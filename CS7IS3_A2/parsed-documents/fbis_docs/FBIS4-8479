The people concerned in the case were given notice. Who are you dismissing in the end? [Csucs] I will not publicize a list, because it could be regarded as branding the people in question, and it could injure their personality rights. [Mester] However, I have seen a list which included, among other people, Akos Mester, Istvan Bolcs, Henrik Havas, Sandor Szenasi.... [Csucs] I will not play guessing games. [Mester] ....that is to say, star reporters, professionally recognized radio personalities with great experience. [Csucs] This is a matter of opinion. It is one thing how well one knows the ins and outs of the profession, and quite another what he does with his expertise and talent. If he carries out his job in a way which is ethically reprehensible, he is not suitable to hold a public service position. [Mester] On 3 March, two demonstrations took place in front of the radio station. In one group, the radio employees gathered, and in the other, the followers of Istvan Csurka who were cheering for you. The radio employees saw a perfect proof in this that you are supported by the extreme right. Csurka's group had also announced earlier that in the district in which you run for parliament, they will not have a candidate. [Csucs] If any segment of society supports such initiatives in such a critical situation, which is at the same time a nearly historical moment, I will gratefully acknowledge it, and have no intention of refusing it. It would be absurd to pick and choose whose sympathy I am counting on, and whose I am not. Concerning my running for parliament, it is true that in Baranya county, in district five, in Mohacs and environs, several voters and parties solicited me to become a candidate. In the beginning I was inclined to do so, because I have ties to this region; I know the problems of the people who live there, and I know that I could effectively contribute to solving them. Unfortunately, my present task, just like that of a parliamentary representative, requires my complete attention. I decided that as long as the powers that be do not prevent me, I will try to carry out the task I undertook at the Radio with the greatest devotion and honesty. Thus, to my great regret, I cannot undertake to run for parliament. [Mester] With what kind of a program, on which platform, would you have run? [Csucs] On the one hand, I consider the concord of national forces important, because in our past, in our history, the reason for defeat could always be pinpointed in discord. I wanted to work for concord, on the basis of Christian values, which for me do not mean only a kind of religious commitment, but also honoring the natural and social laws formulated in the Ten Commandments. On this basis, I wanted to implement my primarily economic program, which includes budget reform, a complete refurbishing of the budget, the overhaul of the system of taxation, the examination of the acute problems of agriculture, and so on. I think this program could be made credible by my professional career and my past, rather than by unsubstantiated promises. [Mester] Let us return to the Radio. Earlier you said that when it comes to dismissals one must think of the group of people who refuse to support the transformation of the radio. How did this resistance manifest itself? [Csucs] When Csaba Gombar left and it was incumbent on me to carry out the tasks of president, I initiated the transformation of the Radio so that it would function as a national institution, and would fully carry out its public service task, especially in the area of objective, all-round information. My task was made considerably more difficult by the fact that in 1990 there was no change of regime at the Radio, and thus the people devoted to the previous regime were strengthened. It is not a well-known fact how we probed behind the scenes, how we tried to find points of contact with decisive forces in the Radio, including the star reporters, in order to get along. I am not interested in their past--which is, incidentally, universally known; I am not interested where they are coming from, only where they are going. If they leave their political affiliation outside the gate, they can continue working; they cannot be harassed, moreover, we can fully utilize their expertise. A very long series of experiments were conducted, in which I was able to make use of the past of chief editor Jozsef P. Szabo, who used to be a diplomat, and who is not only an extremely talented and experienced radio personality, but also, on account of his human capabilities and attitude, was a perfect mediator, should direct contact with the decisive elements fail. My only request was to discuss without screaming how we could make the Radio even better. Unfortunately, the people in question did not think that this was possible. At the same time, they expressed their aversion at every turn, also in their programs. No self-respecting management can tolerate such behavior. I tolerated it for more than a year. Now the cup is full. The change of regime must take place. [Mester] Many people consider your measure to be an act of the government. Are the remaining radio employees supportive of the government? [Csucs] One can hardly find journalists who are supportive of the government, especially not in the political programs on the Kossuth station which can be regarded as decisive. And anyway, it is no criterion whether someone is supportive of the government. The ethical code is still in force, and I hope the remaining employees will keep to the norms. [Mester] If it is a change of regime that is taking place in the Radio, as you formulated it, is it not too late for that? Was it worth embarking on it before the election? Some people think that if the government falls, the dismissed employees will return. [Csucs] It is too late for a change of regime, because it should have been done four years ago. But not to take steps on the pretext that it is too late would not only be a crime against the listeners, but also, we are simply not in the financial position to maintain the current situation. I find it despicable that the budget does not finance the public service tasks, but rather we must rely on subscriptions which are an uncertain source of income. Namely, this forces us to increase our commercial activities, while the rules and regulations stipulated by the government oblige us to carry out public service tasks. But they don't give us any money. What can I do in such a situation? Should I decrease the power of the Kossuth station, so the Hungarians beyond the border could not hear it? Should I cancel the Bartok station, which broadcasts the brunt of cultural and artistic programming? Or the foreign language programs from abroad? Downsizing is the only possible solution, and the State Accounting Office pointed this out to me as early as 1992. And as far as the return of the dismissed is concerned, it is hardly likely that there would be a radio president who would re-hire them in this financial situation, especially the ones who did not keep to the ethical norm. [Mester] Are you not afraid that the dismissed Radio employees will become martyrs? [Csucs] I am certain they will. They will make sure that they will get a monument. But it will be a monument carved in ice, and the first spring rays of sunshine will melt them.
