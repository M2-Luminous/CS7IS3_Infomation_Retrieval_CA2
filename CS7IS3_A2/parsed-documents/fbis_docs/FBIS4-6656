Vice Finance Minister Juro Saito, speaking at a regular news conference, also indicated that Japan is not considering fresh economic measures ahead of a meeting slated for Sunday in Washington of finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven (G-7) major industrialized nations. The IMF said Wednesday in a twice-yearly report that Japan's growth in real gross domestic product will be 0.7 percent for calendar 1994, the lowest among the G-7 nations, and called for further fiscal and monetary measures. The world economic report serves as a key material for the G-7 talks and the twice-yearly gatherings of the IMF and the World Bank. Referring to the IMF outlook, Saito said, "There are various ways to assess the economy... but we think the 2.4 percent target is possible by steadily implementing the ongoing stimulus measures." "The economy has become brighter and is unlikely to fall further," Saito said, analyzing reports by the ministry's regional financial bureau chiefs. Summing up reports by 11 regional chiefs who gathered in Tokyo for a quarterly two-day meeting, the ministry said earlier, "the time is ripening for an economic recovery," with a full-fledged recovery expected in the current fiscal year on the heels of February's 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package and the fiscal 1994 budget. On the fiscal side, Saito said that he interpreted the IMF report as calling for "continued measures and not additional ones." The report said, "For the upswing to gain sufficient momentum, continued fiscal support and a further easing of monetary conditions may well be required." Considering monetary measures, Saito declined to comment, saying Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno clearly indicated his stance in his latest remarks to the press. Speaking to foreign correspondents in Tokyo Tuesday, Mieno said, "I'm not thinking of changing the discount rate at the moment."
