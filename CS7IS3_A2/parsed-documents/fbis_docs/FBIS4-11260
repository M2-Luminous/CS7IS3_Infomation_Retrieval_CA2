FBIS4-11260 "drlat079aa_94006" FBIS-LAT-94-079 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Latin American Ministers Meet EU Counterparts Latin American Ministers Meet EU Counterparts Joint Declaration Issued PY2304024594 Madrid EFE in Spanish 2323 GMT 22 Apr 94 PY2304024594 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Sao Paulo, 22 Apr -- The foreign ministers and delegates from the Rio Group and the EU today condemned in a joint declaration any attempt to disrupt democracy in Latin America. The representatives of the 12 EU countries and the 13 representatives of the Rio Group, the main Latin American forum for concerted action, promised to contribute to the strengthening of democracy through the subordination of all sectors to legally constituted civilian authorities. The so-called "Sao Paulo Declaration," which is eight pages long, establishes the bases for future dialogue in the political and economic fields. The European bloc wanted the document to mention the subordination of the armed forces to civilian power. This proposal, however, was softened at the recommendation of the Latin Americans, who preferred not to mention the military at a moment when threats to the institutional order were felt in some countries. The document condemns xenophobia, racism, terrorism, and the illegal production, trafficking, and consumption of drugs, as well as money laundering. The delegates agreed to concentrate their "efforts in combating the wave of racism and xenophobia against, for example, immigrant workers and their families through, among other measures, the application of strict laws and the implementation of intense education campaigns." As for drug enforcement, the participants agreed to apply global solutions to the drug problem, prevent the misuse of chemical precursors used in drug manufacturing, and promote alternative income sources for the benefit of the affected peasants. The ministers and delegates from the two blocs repudiated "without reservations and labeled as an unjustifiable crime all kinds of terrorist actions wherever they are committed by anyone and for any reason, because they endanger and eliminate human lives, offend the dignity of the human being, and attack democracy and the state of law." They thus agreed to reinforce cooperation and coordinate practical measures to combat terrorism. The declaration pointed out the EU's and the Rio Group's interest in eradicating poverty, defending the environment, and rejecting "arbitrary unilateral actions" in international trade and noncompliance with the GATT principles. The document states that mutual cooperation must be aimed at the eradication of poverty and the protection of the less-favored classes. It must efficiently promote democracy and cooperation in the fields of economy, trade, industry, science, and technology. The chiefs of European and Latin American diplomacy stated that the "right to development is part of basic human rights, the human being is the central subject of development, and the lack of development cannot be used as an excuse to justify disrespect for internationally acknowledged human rights." They also recognized the importance of the Ibero-American Conference, whose fourth summit of chiefs of state and government will take place on 14 and 15 June in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. They also promised intensifying dialogue within the UN framework for the purpose of reforming its charter and to improve the organization's work methods. The two blocs made an appeal to countries to renew their commitment to the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction; they suggested signing a multilateral treaty to totally prohibit nuclear tests, and they mentioned the progress in the consolidation of the system of a total prohibition of nuclear weapons in Latin America.
