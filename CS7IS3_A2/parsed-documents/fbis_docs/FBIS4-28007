The Cambodian landowners there said they first saw 10 to 20 Vietnamese boats anchoring along the river banks near the port. A few days later, they saw many more Vietnamese boats anchoring along the river banks. Some small huts were also being built on the river banks. When the landowners told them to get out off their land, these Vietnamese said they were not settling on these lands and that they would be leaving after staying there for a few days. Our people then returned home. Two weeks later, the Vietnamese boat people went ashore and built hundreds of huts on the river banks. They do everything, including selling goods, fishing, and prostitution. Seeing this, the landowners went to drive the Vietnamese off their land. This time, the Vietnamese replied that the Cambodian authorities had given them permission to settle there. The Cambodian people complained to the ward authorities, but no measures were taken to settle this problem. The people then went to complain to the provincial authorities. But Hun Neng, elder brother of one-eyed Hun Sen, who has been installed by the Vietnamese as Kompong Cham provincial governor, threatened the people against doing anything to harm the fraternal Vietnamese and Vietnamese-Cambodian solidarity. The people were very angry with this statement by Hun Neng. They said he and all his colleagues are Vietnamese lackeys who only defend the Vietnamese while oppressing the Cambodians. The people said that they must not rely on the Vietnamese lackeys any longer; they must solve the problem of Vietnamese land-grabbing by themselves; they must not allow the Vietnamese to grab their land; and that they will take action against Hun Neng later.
