The announcement was made by Governor Patten in a speech delivered before the start of a debate on the Legislative Council this afternoon. The move was followed by the approval of the first part of Patten's proposal for electoral reform at the Legislative Council early this morning. Patten's government also published a White Paper which revealed contents of the 17 rounds of Sino-British talks on the arrangements for the 1994-95 election in Hong Kong in disregard of China's demand for publication through diplomatic channels. Some 200,000 English and Chinese copies of the white paper were distributed to the public here today. The Chinese Government pointed out from the very beginning that the political reform bill proposed by Chris Patten in October 1992 violates the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Basic Law of the future Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong and the understandings and agreements already reached between China and Britain. However, the British Hong Kong authorities introduced parts of the bill to the Legislative Council on December 15, 1993. The move led to the termination of the Sino-British talks on the arrangements for the 1994-95 elections in Hong Kong. The Chinese side stated on many occasions China will accept no bills passed by the Legislative Council before any agreement is reached between the Governments of China and Britain. China also urged the British side to face the fact that without agreements with China, the three-tier councils, which serve as parts of the political structure of the British Hong Kong authorities, will be dismantled when the British rule over Hong Kong terminates on July 30, 1997. However, the British side has ignored all these advices from the Chinese side and clung obstinately on its own course. The escalation of the Sino-British confrontation over the 1994-95 electoral arrangement in Hong Kong added some unfavorable elements to the already violent stock market, dragging the Hang Seng index, the key indicator of the local blue chips, down 331 points today with thin trading.
