FR941116-0-00039 FR941116-0-00006 (A) Conduct a leak check of the dump valve (in-tank valve that is spring loaded, closed and operable by a T-handle at the service panel), and in-line drain valve. The in-line drain valve leak check must be performed with a minimum of 3 pounds per square inch differential pressure (PSID) applied across the valve. (B) Visually inspect the service panel drain valve outer cap/door seal and the inner seal (if the valve has an inner door/closure device with a second positive seal) and seal mating surface for wear or damage that may cause leakage. Any worn or damaged seal must be replaced and any damaged seal mating surface must be repaired or replaced, prior to further flight, in accordance with the valve manufacturer's maintenance manual. (ii) For each lavatory drain system that has a service panel drain valve installed, Kaiser Electroprecision part number series 0218&hyph;0032, or Kaiser Electroprecision part number series 0218&hyph;0026, or Shaw Aero Devices part number series 1010100C, or Shaw Aero Devises part number series 1010100B, or Pneudraulics part number series 9527: Within 1,000 flight hours after revising the maintenance program in accordance with paragraph (b) of this AD, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 1,000 flight hours, accomplish the procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this AD: (A) Conduct leak checks of the dump valve and service panel drain valve. The service panel drain valve leak check must be performed with a minimum of 3 PSID applied across the valve. Only the inner door/closure device of the service panel drain valve must be leak checked. (B) Visually inspect the service panel drain valve outer cap/door seal and seal mating surface for wear or damage that may cause leakage. Any worn or damaged seal must be replaced, and any damaged seal mating surface must be repaired or replaced, prior to further flight, in accordance with the valve manufacturer's maintenance manual. (iii) For each lavatory drain system with a lavatory drain system valve that either incorporates ``donut'' assemblies (or substitute assemblies from another manufacturer) Kaiser Electroprecision part number 4259&hyph;20 or 4259&hyph;31, or incorporates Kaiser Roylyn part number 2651&hyph;194C, 2651&hyph;197C, 2651&hyph;216, 2651&hyph;219, 2651&hyph;235, 2651&hyph;256, 2651&hyph;258, 2651&hyph;259, 2651&hyph;260, 2651&hyph;275, 2651&hyph;282, or 2651&hyph;286: Within 200 flight hours after revising the maintenance program in accordance with paragraph (b) of this AD, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 200 flight hours, conduct leak checks of the dump valve and the service panel drain valve. The service panel drain valve leak check must be performed with a minimum 3 PSID applied across the valve. Both the donut and the outer cap/door must be leak checked. (iv) For each lavatory drain system that incorporates any other type of approved valves: Within 400 flight hours after revising the maintenance program in accordance with paragraph (b) of this AD, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 400 flight hours accomplish the procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(iv)(A) and (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this AD: (A) Conduct leak checks of the dump valve and the service panel drain valve. The service panel drain valve leak check must be performed with a minimum 3 PSID applied across the valve. If the service panel drain valve has an inner door/closure device with a second positive seal, only the inner door must be leak checked. (B) If the valve has an inner door/closure device with a second positive seal: Visually inspect the service panel drain valve outer door/cap seal and seal mating surface for wear or damage that may cause leakage. Any worn or damaged seal must be replaced and any damaged seal mating surface must be repaired or replaced, prior to further flight, in accordance with the valve manufacturer's maintenance manual.
