FBIS3-9907 "drlat039_c_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-039 Document Type:Daily Report 28 Feb 1994 MEXICO Free Elections, New Government Demanded PA2702182094 Madrid EFE in Spanish 1721 GMT 27 Feb 94 PA2702182094 Madrid EFE Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Text] Mexico City, 27 Feb (EFE) -- It was disclosed today that the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) command last night released a communique demanding free and democratic elections, the Mexican Government's resignation, and its replacement by a transition government that will guarantee equality. To guarantee free elections, the EZLN has called for the legalization of the presence and participation of citizens in the observation of the electoral process, thus sanctioning the process' legality and guaranteeing the elections' legitimacy. The EZLN command establishes that a necessary condition for democratic elections is the resignation of authorities "who attained power through electoral frauds" and the formation of a transition government so there will be equality and respect for all political trends. The sixth day of Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis' dialogue with the EZLN representatives and the mediation of Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, concluded with a communique that points out that the peace dialogue sessions have continued in a spirit of work and responsibility. "We cannot overlook" -- the document states -- "that at this time we are dealing with the most critical part of the agreements. This means that we will work with a spirit of responsibility. We are aware that everything that is agreed upon at the dialogue in Chiapas will have profound repercussions on the country's future." The communique, signed by "Subcommander Marcos," Commissioner Manuel Camacho, and Bishop Samuel Ruiz, points out that the joint effort, seriousness, work, and exchange of ideas for the purpose of listening to and understanding each other to find the best possible solutions will culminate in positive results. The EZLN and Mexican Government are in a negotiations process to resolve the armed conflict that began on 1 January with the EZLN insurrection and the armed clashes that cost the lives of at least 200 people, wounded approximately 500, and displaced thousands from their hometowns in the mountains of Chiapas. During the six days that have passed since the peace talks began at the San Cristobal Cathedral, progress has been made on approximately 50 percent of the scheduled agenda, the part that deals with the immediate and urgent demands of the Indian population. Nevertheless, the current discussion has come down to the points that deal with Mexico's general problems, including political issues and demands such as the demand for democratic elections and the mechanisms to guarantee equality and legitimacy.
