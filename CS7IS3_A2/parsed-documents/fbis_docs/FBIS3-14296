Our correspondent Izabella Ginor, who interviewed Posuvalyuk from our studio, asked him about the results of his many meetings with 'Arafat. The Russian envoy said he conveyed to 'Arafat a letter from Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev which underscored the need to pursue the talks and meet the commitment which the peace process imposes on us. At the same time the letter underlined Russia's commitment as a permanent member of the Security Council and a superpower. Posuvalyuk went on to say that as a superpower, Russia will do everything within its power to implement the Security Council resolution. This is what he spoke about with 'Arafat, as well as about concrete issues such as 'Arafat's upcoming visit to Moscow on 19 April. Ginor asked Posuvalyuk whether after five meetings with 'Arafat in Tunis, and as a special Russian envoy to the Middle East, he intends to visit Jerusalem as well. The Russian said that five days ago he met Israel's ambassador to Moscow and later Foreign Ministry Director General Uri Savir in Tunis. Posuvalyuk told his Israeli interlocutors in no uncertain terms that he wants to come to Israel soon in order to hold in-depth talks about bilateral relations and Russia's intended role in the Middle East. Posuvalyuk said he received favorable reactions to his request and the only question remains that of timing, seeing that Israel is on the eve of a holiday. He stated, however, that he would like to come to Israel as soon as possible. The Russian envoy stressed Russia's expected role in the area. He said Russia wants to play a quiet, constructive, and creative role. Asked by Ginor whether his many meetings with 'Arafat do not indicate that Russia is coordinating its moves with the PLO, Posuvalyuk was actually offended, saying it was a rude question. He said that the PLO was an independent party to the peace process and that Russia is one of the cosponsors of the process. It is not a matter of coordination, rather of reciprocal relations and a certain overlapping of aims and practical missions. Ginor asked Posuvalyuk if he solved with 'Arafat the issue of the international presence, which caused so many difficulties on the path to resuming the talks. The Russian answered that the issue was in principle dealt with in the Security Council resolution and is now being discussed by all the sides. We will have to find the optimal formula from among the many ideas introduced. Posuvalyuk said in his opinion a compromise will be found in the form of some kind of international observers. The special Russian envoy believes these will be UN observers with a finely-nuanced status and political equipment -- and other equipment as well. Posuvalyuk emphasized that Russia is in principle very interested in participating in this international presence, whatever form it finally takes. We asked the Russian envoy about the possibility of a meeting between Yasir 'Arafat and Yitzhaq Rabin -- who is scheduled to visit Moscow several days after 'Arafat. Posuvalyuk claimed that so far there is no such meeting on the agenda. Hypothetically, however, a summit between Rabin and 'Arafat -- in Moscow or elsewhere -- could directly contribute to the success of the peace process.
