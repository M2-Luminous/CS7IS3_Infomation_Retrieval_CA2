Question 14: How many of the following areas would be affected by a release from your pipeline (answer 14.1&hyph;14.8 with the number of areas)? 14.1␣Areas where it would take more than two hours to reach and close a block valve once the location of a release is identified?

XXXX 14 49 CFR 192.5(c) states: A Class 2 location is any class location unit that has more than 10 but less than 46 buildings intended for human occupancy. (A ``class location unit'' is defined in the regulations in 49 CFR 192.5(a) as an area that extends 220 yards on either side of the centerline of any continuous 1-mile length of pipeline.) 14.6␣Office buildings? XXXX 14.7␣Factories or plants, such as power plants? XXXX Valves in Urban Areas The March 1991 EFRD study concluded that it was feasible from a benefit to cost standpoint to retrofit existing manually operated block valves on hazardous liquid pipelines located in urban areas to RCVs and to install RCVs when installing new valves in urban areas. An urban area is one which is not a rural area 15 . A proposal to require RCVs in urban areas would apply to hazardous liquid pipelines which have installed leak detection systems, as the Department found in the March 1991 study that RCVs are effective only where leak detection systems are installed. 15 See footnote # 13. The RSPA wants to establish a data base on manually operated block valves located on hazardous liquid pipelines in urban areas to validate the conclusions made in the March 1991 study. Hazardous liquid pipeline operators are requested to respond to Questions 15&hyph;17 for pipelines in their systems which are located in urban areas and on which a leak detection system is installed: Question 15: For your pipeline system, report the number of manually operated block valves that are installed in urban areas. Report data to questions 15.1&hyph;15.4 for each pipeline nominal diameter located in urban areas in your pipeline system. 15.1␣What nominal pipeline diameter does this series of questions pertain (in.)? XXXX 15.2␣How many block valves are installed of this nominal diameter? XXXX 15.3␣For the total reported by nominal diameter, how many valves are installed to limit release of the commodity transported? XXXX 15.4␣For each total reported by nominal diameter, how many are installed for pipeline maintenance purposes? XXXX Question 16: For the period 1983 through 1992 (10 years), how many failures have occurred on your pipeline system in urban areas? XXXX Question 17: Provide the following information for each failure in Question 16: 17.1␣Date of the failure (MM/YY) XXXX 17.2␣What was the cause of the release (check)? 17.2.1␣Corrosion?
