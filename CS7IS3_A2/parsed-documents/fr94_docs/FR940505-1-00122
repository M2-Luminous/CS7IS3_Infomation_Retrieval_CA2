FR940505-1-00122 FR940505-1-00012 EPA is proposing to adopt the enhanced in-use compliance program described in Appendix I Section B. EPA also requests comments on all aspects of its proposal and on any other approaches to further reduce in-use emissions. 4. Nonroad Engines and Vehicles a. Overview_ (1) Statutory Authority. Authority for the actions proposed to regulate nonroad engines is granted to EPA by sections 110, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 213, 215, 216, and 301(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) as amended (42 U.S.C. 7410, 7522, 7523, 7524, 7525, 7541, 7542, 7543, 7547, 7549, 7550, and 7601(a)). The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 extended EPA's authority regarding regulation of nonroad engines and vehicles. Specifically the revised CAA section 213(a) directs EPA to: (1) Conduct a study of emissions from nonroad engines and vehicles; (2) determine whether emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NO X ), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from nonroad engines and vehicles are significant contributors to ozone or CO in more than one area that has failed to attain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone and CO; and (3) regulate those categories or classes of nonroad engines and vehicles that contribute to such air pollution if nonroad emissions in the aggregate are determined to be significant by November 1992. Under CAA section 213(a)(4), EPA may also regulate emissions other than CO, NO X , and VOCs from new nonroad engines and vehicles if EPA determines that such other emissions contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. Finally, Section 213 directs EPA to regulate emissions from new locomotives. EPA is already required by statute, and, in some cases, court order, to promulgate national rulemakings for various categories of nonroad engines. In this NPRM, EPA proposes to allow credit for these rules, which will be promulgated either before or within a relatively short time after promulgation of these FIPs. Thus final issuance of these rules is legally compelled well in advance of their scheduled implementation. Because of the imminence of these rulemakings, and because EPA's commitments to them are legally guaranteed, EPA believes it is appropriate to give credit in the FIP for the emissions reductions they are expected to generate. The emissions reductions involved are relatively small, and are further ensured by EPA's regulatory guarantee to achieve the level of credited emission reductions by other means if necessary. Canvassing the alternatives to this approach bolsters EPA's conclusion. One option is to accelerate the statutory and court-ordered deadlines so that they precisely fit the FIP promulgation date. But the rulemakings at issue are national in scope, and it would be detrimental to cut short the time Congress and the courts have allocated for their analysis and consideration as a technical accommodation to the localized FIP deadlines. The only remaining alternative would be to promulgate temporary, interim measures that would in all probability never be implemented, and that would evaporate when the national rules were issued. This approach would be wasteful, inefficient, and confusing for regulated sources. (2) General Nonroad Background. This section provides general background on nonroad sources excluding large ocean-going ships, locomotives, and Federal sources such as aircraft. These sources will be covered starting with Section III D.4.e of this preamble. The Nonroad Engine and Vehicle Emission Study (hereafter, ``Nonroad Study'') required by section 213(a)(1) was completed in November 1991. The Nonroad Study is available in docket A&hyph;91&hyph;24. The determination of the significance of emissions from nonroad engines and vehicles in more than one NAAQS nonattainment area, required by section 213(a)(2), was proposed on May 17, 1993 (58 FR 28809). At the same time, the first set of Federal regulations for a class or category of nonroad engines that contribute to air pollution, required by section 213(a)(3), was also proposed (58 FR 28809) for new nonroad compression-ignition (CI) engines at or above 37 kilowatts (kW) (50 hp). As EPA continues to implement section 213(a) (3) and (4), it will propose Federal emission standards for new nonroad spark-ignition (SI) engines at or below 19 kW (hereafter, ``small SI engines''), and spark-ignition (SI) marine engines (hereafter, ``SI marine engines'') as well as other classes or categories of nonroad engines that contribute to air pollution.
