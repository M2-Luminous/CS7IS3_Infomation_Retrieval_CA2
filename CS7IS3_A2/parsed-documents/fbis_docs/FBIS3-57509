"The main section of the book deals with the president's comprehension of the 1991 events when Yeltsin assumed office. The author sets out his point of view on the political processes evolving in Russia since then, and shares with future readers his keen feeling for the country's future", Ilyushin said. The book which has about 500 pages has no working title yet. "No one has read the book so far," Ilyushin said, adding that he does not know who helped the president prepare the manuscript for publication. Asked whether people in Russia will be able to read the president's reminiscences, the aide answered in the affirmative.
