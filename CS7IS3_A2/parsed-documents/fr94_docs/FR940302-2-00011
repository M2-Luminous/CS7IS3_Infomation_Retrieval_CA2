FR940302-2-00011 FR940302-2-00007 Comment 1: The petitioner argues that the Department should have used an exchange rate based on either the date of shipment or the date of entry, instead of employing the exchange rate in effect on the date of sale to the United States, because of the extended time between the sale and shipment of MTPs, and the appreciation of the yen against the dollar during the review period. Aida and Komatsu state that the Department correctly employed the exchange rate in effect on the date of the U.S. sale, according to the Department's regulations, 19 CFR 353.60, 353.46, 353.49 and 353.50. Department's Position: We agree with respondents that we have properly employed the exchange rate that was in effect on the date the merchandise was sold to the United States. According to our regulations and long-standing practice, when the U.S. price is based on purchase price and the foreign market value (FMV) is based on constructed value (CV), the conversion of currency is directly tied to the date the merchandise is sold for exportation to the United States. See 19 CFR 353.60 and 19 CFR 353.50(b)(1). Comment 2: Aida states that it is reserving the right to challenge the Department's inclusion of the FMX press within the scope of the order and within the final results of this review. The petitioner claims that the Department should include home market and U.S. sales of Aida's FMX press and its optional transfer unit in its analysis for these final results, because the Department has determined that the FMX press is within the scope of the order. Department's Position: We agree with petitioner. We did not include the FMX press in our preliminary results of review, but stated we would do so in our final results if an affirmative scope determination were made by that time. On November 23, 1993, the Department determined that Aida's FMX cold forging press is within the scope of the antidumping duty order on MTPs. See ``Final Scope Ruling_Antidumping Duty Order on Mechanical Transfer Presses from Japan: Aida Engineering, Ltd.,'' U.S. Department of Commerce, November 23, 1993. We verified the sales and CV data Aida submitted with respect to the FMX press sold in the United States during the review period, and have included this sale in our final analysis.
