"That is why there have been no positive changes in the negotiation process." In Lebed's words, he sees a "peaceful solution to the question" through "civil disobedience and a polite request to the authorities to clear off." Accusations of corruption addressed to top officials of the region's administration are heard virtually every week on television, as well as at the commander's meetings in labor collectives. The purpose of Gen. Lebed's tour of the people, in his words again, is "to get rid of all the odious figures, hold repeat elections, and bring to power people who command respect." A scandal was caused by recently published documents on intrigues involving fuel delivered to the Dniester Region from Russia. The main figure in this story is A. Bolshakov, chairman of a commission of the Dniester Supreme Soviet and a leader of a small enterprise who, according to the documents in question, is "KGB agent Berzin." These documents, which had been handed over to the security organs of the Dniester Region, soon went missing and the region's prosecutor informed the 14th Army's commander that "criminal proceedings have been instituted regarding the loss of personal and official documents relating to agent Berzin of the former KGB." In connection with all these events Lebed has stated: "The uncontrolled crime wave in the city forces me to take the path chosen by the Black Sea Fleet's men and adopt resolute measures to establish public order." Lebed's comments have provoked a response, in particular from the workers' committee in Bendery which dubbed the commander "the black general." Leaflets have appeared in Tiraspol informing citizens that the republic is in danger and that a military coup is being prepared under the leadership of Lebed and Economic Freedom Party leader Borovoy. In the opinion of certain officials of the Dniester Region, the general's aim is to retain the Army's hardware and remove it without the knowledge of the local authorities. To which Lebed commented that the Army is carrying out planned reductions and the disbandment of certain units and that the negotiating process is the basis for the withdrawal of the 14th Army from the Dniester Region.
