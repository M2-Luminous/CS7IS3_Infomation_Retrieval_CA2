Particularly in western Germany, the "traditional spring recovery" has now only covered the continuing economic and structural tensions on the labor market. "Seasonally adjusted," unemployment in the old FRG territory increased by another 20,000. Compared to last year, the number of unemployed is 416,600 higher. Jagoda said that the demand for labor was weak in the west. In the new laender, however, there has been a strong increase in job offers. Employment continues to show a downward trend in western Germany. According to provisional figures provided by the Federal Statistical Office, a total of 28.46 million were gainfully employed in February. This is 580,000 fewer than in 1993. The trend is also reflected in the statistics of labor offices. At the end of March, 247,500 vacancies were registered in the west, 7 percent less than one year ago. According to the Nuremberg-based Federal Labor Office, this comparison appears to be more favorable as a result of the recent strong increase in reported demand of seasonal labor in the agricultural and catering sector. Without these figures, the number of vacancies in the first quarter of 1994 was almost 20 percent below last year's level. However, less than half of the demand of new labor is even reported to the labor offices. In Nuremberg, the entire offer of vacancies is estimated to be the average of the fourth quarter of 1993 -- 536,000. This was one-third less than in the same period of 1992. Since the share of new jobs planned to be offered in the long term also decreased significantly as of late, enterprises are expected to be relatively reluctant to employ new people in the first half year of 1994, Jagoda said. The decrease in demand includes more and more smaller enterprises. There has, however, been a sizable reduction in short-time work, particularly in the key areas such as the automotive and machine construction industry. A different development was registered by labor offices in eastern Germany. There, short-time work is stagnating at a level of about 135,000 employees. Yet, the influence of intervention in terms of labor policy is on the whole diminishing. Only the so-called job-creating measures were still increasing in March. A total of 238,175 east Germans are currently working in fully subsidized jobs. The number of participants in further training classes and retraining schemes is, however, continually decreasing. More and more of those people on early retirement schemes are receiving normal pensions as they get older. Including the people on short-time work, the unemployment statistics for the new laender does not include 1.2 million people who would appear in the statistic without some kind of benefits. One year ago, this number was 500,000 higher. In the view of the Federal Labor Office, the demand for labor in the new laender is clearly superior to the approximately 76,000 vacancies that were registered at the labor offices in March. It is mainly smaller companies that are creating the demand, with trends even increasing. The Federal Office, however, has noted growing reticence among enterprises to contact the labor office for their search for new employees. The quota of registered vacancies was 24 percent for the fourth quarter 1993, while in western Germany it is 37 percent. "We do not regard that as an image problem but many managers in enterprises in the new laender obviously still fail to understand that we are able to offer people with excellent qualifications," Jagoda said. Thus, communication in the new laender must be extended quickly. The growing demand for labor there is regarded by Jagoda as a clear sign for "tendencies toward economic stabilization and stimulation" in eastern Germany. According to Michael Glos, head of the Christian Social Union group in the Bundestag, the decrease in the number of unemployed justifies the hope for a turn of the tide. In a statement, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] has meanwhile noted that the new figures cannot conceal that the situation is as serious as before.
