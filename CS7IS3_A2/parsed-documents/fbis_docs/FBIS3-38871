Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind arrived in London from a two-day visit to Bosnia saying the shelling of the Sarajevo marketplace could prove to be a turning point. The Government believes the Serbs are very much "on the back foot" because of Saturday [5 February]'s atrocity, which killed almost 70 people. "What we are looking to do is to take advantage of this and pressure the Serbs to force a settlement around Sarajevo and, perhaps, even shorten the war itself," said one official. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has stated that he might be prepared to negotiate a separate peace accord for Sarajevo. NATO leaders are adamant that some good must emerge from Saturday's carnage and ambassadors from the 16-nation alliance are expected to reach a clear decision when they meet tomorrow. The primary proposal is likely to be an ultimatum to the Serbs to withdraw their artillery and mortar batteries out of range of Sarajevo or face the threat of air strikes. NATO would then insist on an agreement that the Muslims hold back and that United Nations forces form a carefully controlled buffer zone, similar to the green line in Cyprus. UN troops would be pulled off other duties across the former Yugoslavia to patrol the buffer zone. There are hopes that a settlement around Sarajevo could eventually lead to a more general peace across the rest of Bosnia, where the Serbs are already in largely defensive positions and content with their territorial gains. "I think this could indeed be a turning-point," said Mr Rifkind as he returned to London. But he warned that decisions made over the next 48 hours required clear political leadership rooted in sound military judgement. "Any initiatives we take must have a military coherence and be consistent with what is achievable and sensible so that we actually benefit the people of Bosnia," he said. "I think it is very important to ensure the action taken in the name of the UN is co-ordinated and coherent, and not sporadic and ill-thought out. "The crucial requirement is not simply to engineer some event that has a political impact but to take policy forward in a way to produce results." The ramifications of the Sarajevo massacre overshadowed the original purpose of Mr Rifkind's visit to Bosnia, which was to look at whether the humanitarian aid operation should continue. The Government will make a final decision next month but the defence secretary said aid was getting through and many people would die if troops were withdrawn. He was particularly pleased with the no-nonsense approach of new UN commander, Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose, which he said proved aid could be delivered in a more effective way.
