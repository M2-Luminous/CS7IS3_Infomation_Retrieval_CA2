FR940606-1-00054 FR940606-1-00008 Since the proposed standards for organic HAP and VOC content levels would allow each owner or operator to average organic HAP or VOC content levels across uncontrolled primers and across uncontrolled topcoats, the procedures provide the necessary formulas to calculate the volume-weighted average organic HAP or VOC across all primers or topcoats. For compliant coatings, the EPA is proposing less complicated procedures for demonstrating compliance. This is appropriate because each coating by itself as applied meets the organic HAP (or VOC) content level, and daily calculations of the volume-weighted average HAP and VOC content as applied are not necessary. The proposed rule does, however, require monthly determination of usage and HAP and VOC content as applied. If control devices (e.g., incinerators, carbon adsorbers) are used, the proposed standards require them to achieve an overall control efficiency of at least 81 percent. For control devices other than carbon adsorbers, it is necessary, therefore, to identify the capture efficiency of the capture system, the destruction efficiency of the control device, and, where feasible, operational parameters that would be monitored to ensure continuous compliance. The proposed standards also include provisions for determining the capture and removal efficiencies. The test methods and procedures being proposed for determining the capture and removal efficiencies are those that are typical for control devices. The EPA is proposing that capture efficiency be determined by one of two methods depending on whether the capture system is totally enclosed or not. A total enclosure would be verified according to the provisions specified in ยง52.741, appendix B, Procedure T of 40 CFR part 52 (and, thus would have a capture efficiency of 100 percent). The capture efficiency of all other systems would be determined according to the procedures specified in ยง52.741(a)(4)(iii) of 40 CFR part 52. The EPA is proposing that the removal efficiency of a control device be determined based on three runs, each run lasting one hour. For control of organic compounds, Method 1 or 1A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate, would be used for selection of the sampling sites, and the gas volumetric flow rate would be determined using Methods 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate. Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, would then be used to measure either TOC minus methane and ethane or total organic HAP. Alternatively, any other test method or data that has been validated according to the applicable procedures in Method 301 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A, may be used. Where a carbon adsorber is used, the EPA is proposing to use a mass balance procedure for determining the overall control efficiency. The proposed rule contains procedures as specified in 40 CFR 60.433 for using a mass balance approach that would calculate the amount of organic HAP and VOC applied and the amount recovered. This information would then be used to calculate the overall control efficiency of the carbon adsorber. In addition, Method 309 is being proposed for determining the number of consecutive 24-hour periods in the rolling material balance period for carbon adsorbers. Each owner or operator using a control device would be required to conduct an initial performance test. For control devices other than carbon adsorbers, this test would consist of 3 one-hour runs. For carbon adsorbers, the test would span the number of days specified for the rolling material balance period as calculated by proposed Method 309. In addition, it is necessary to establish, during the initial performance test, operating parameters that would be continuously monitored in order to show continuous compliance. For incinerators other than catalytic incinerators, the operating parameter would be the firebox temperature. For catalytic incinerators, the operating parameters would be the temperature of the gas stream immediately before and after the catalyst bed. No operating parameters are required to be monitored on carbon adsorbers since the material balance calculations provide a continuous check of proper operation. c. Depainting operation. The proposed standards for the depainting of aerospace vehicles requires, in part, no organic HAP emissions, which will be achieved through the use of chemical strippers that do not contain any organic HAP or the use of non-chemical depainting methods or techniques. Since all of the known non-chemical depainting methods/techniques do not contain any organic HAP, the only test method or procedures needed are those associated with determining whether a chemical stripper contains any organic HAP. For the reasons noted earlier under the discussion on test methods for primers and topcoats, the EPA is proposing that the organic HAP content be determined based on information supplied by the manufacturer of the chemical stripper.
