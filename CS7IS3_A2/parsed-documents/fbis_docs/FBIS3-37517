The data from the Economy Ministry reveals that the now regular nonpayments crisis in industry began in September 1993 and the situation particularly exacerbated in December. As a result, production in December fell by 14 percent and the latest data shows it reached 43 percent in January 1994. The steps taken by the NBU [National Bank of Ukraine] and the government in January and February 1994 to combat the nonpayments crisis, such as extending stabilization credit to the amount of 5.4 trillion karbovantsi and repayable financial assistance to the amount of 5.5 trillion karbovantsi, have so far not made the situation change for the better. Economy Minister Roman Shpek announced at the Cabinet of Ministers sitting that various data pointed to the nonpayment by Ukrainian enterprises of 40 to 80 trillion karbovantsi, which caused industry to become uncontrollable. Roman Shpek demanded that the real causes of the nonpayments crisis should be established, thus making the secret become common knowledge. Both the plan and the budget, in the economy minister's view, should be revised. "Let us not pretend that the differences in the policies of the Economy Ministry, Finance Ministry, and the National Bank will somehow pass. Otherwise, no decisions will be taken." Asked by the Ukrainian president whether the fall in inflation in January to 19 percent meant the government was winning, Roman Shpek answered in the positive but pointed out that this was "a victory over the people, pensioners, and the economy." The economy minister predicted that the consequence of this victory would be large emission which would push Ukraine "towards an unprepared monetary reform." Before a speech by National Bank of Ukraine Chairman Viktor Yushchenko, a representative of PivdenMash [Southern Machine Building] production association said he could not understand how a situation was possible when "ministers cannot agree" and when the president should exercise strict control over the NBU. In his speech, Viktor Yushchenko stressed that the nonpayments crisis "is not resolved by the amount of money available for enterprises but is a reflection of the economic crisis." Yushchenko's data shows that two to four trillion karbovantsi per month are at present not being exchanged for goods. As of 1 February alone, over 16 trillion karbovantsi in circulation "did not return." Viktor Yushchenko said there were different views on ways out of the crisis, rather than antagonism in relations between the National Bank, Finance Ministry, and Economy Ministry. Viktor Yushchenko called for consolidation in support of anti-inflation measures. Yushchenko added that "50 percent of price rises in May this year [as received] are the result of the emission that already is there." Ukrainian Acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy remarked that "all Yushchenko [National Bank of Ukraine chairman] is doing is inciting Ukraine and harming the policy of the Cabinet of Ministers." Vice Prime Minister Valentyn Landyk also accused the NBU leadership of "subversive economic activities." Landyk spoke categorically against "flirting" with the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. Finance Minister Heorhiy Pyatachenko stated that "we have successfully ruined the old financial system without having created a new one." Pyatachenko noted that credit resources were not being returned. The finance minister joined in the criticism of the National Bank and pointed out that the NBU "was not taking account of anyone's views." Supreme Council of Ukraine [Budget & Planning] Standing Committee Chairman Andriy Pecherov proposed to restrict "the influence of foreign economies." Pecherov spoke in favor of state regulation of the economy and called for "the introduction of an economic state of emergency." The Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, the leaders of which had been invited to this sitting, had on the previous day submitted for examination by the government its proposals regarding resolving the non-payments crisis. The Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs is demanding in particular that an interbank offsetting of bills be conducted. In accordance with its results bankrupt enterprises will be determined, and it will be necessary to urgently begin clearing up [sanatsiya] inefficient enterprises with these bankrupt enterprises. It is also proposed that the government appeals to Ukraine's Supreme Council, which will continue plenary sittings on 22 February, so that the limit of primary emission for the first quarter of 1994 be confirmed at 50 trillion karbovantsi. The Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs is also demanding that draft basic directions of monetary and credit policy in 1994 be submitted for examination by Ukraine's Supreme Council. The Cabinet of Ministers sitting continued after lunch.
