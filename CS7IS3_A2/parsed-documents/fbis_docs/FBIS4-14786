Speaking before journalists in Kiev, Kravchuk said that this idea needs to be studied in-depth. However, he added, this should be done not by the CIS heads of state but by way of referendums. He underlined that he was against the dissolution of the Commonwealth of Independent States which, in his opinion, has not yet exhausted itself. Vladimir Shumeyko, speaker of the upper chamber of the Russian Parliament, earlier supported the initiative by the Kazakhstani president on setting up a union of CIS countries on a new basis. President of Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan] Askar Akayev also approved of this idea. The official press of the other Central Asian republic -- Uzbekistan -- gives it a negative assessment.
