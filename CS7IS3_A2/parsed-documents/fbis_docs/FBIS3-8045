Alongside this, however, a sense of national dignity has developed, although this was extremely debased during the previous regime. Together with the democratic process, we have strengthened our efforts to follow an independent foreign policy solely in conformity with our national interests and with the principles and norms of international law. This is why today, while preserving our own firm foreign policy orientation toward Europe, toward integration into the European structures, toward the Euro-Atlantic system of security, the Republic of Bulgaria renounces neither the historical and cultural values that bind us to Russia, such as our common Slavonic roots, the alphabet introduced by Cyril and Methodius, our century-long spiritual and religious links, and our national liberation, nor do we renounce our economic positions and interests in the Russian markets and the markets of the other former Soviet republics. What is more, we consider that the historical values that bind us together, cleansed of ideological overlays and freed from political exploitation to which they were subjected by the communist regime, precisely at this time are revealing their true value. Now our relations with Russia are being built upon a democratic foundation of equality in the eyes of the law. For this reason, no political force or group in Bulgaria has the right to appropriate or monopolize the links between our two peoples and countries, nor identify its narrow party interests with the interests of the state in relation to Russia. This was the case at one time, and the sad results of it are sufficiently well-known to all. On a day such as this, I believe it is important that we should show that we have dissociated ourselves from violence and phobias, to recall what happened more than a century ago, and to realize that we are first and foremost citizens of the Republic of Bulgaria, within which we not only live but also have common national interests. In this context, it is foolish to put our relations with one group of countries in opposition to those with others. Partisanship in foreign policy has never brought anything good for our country, all the more now, when the Balkans are an extremely explosive region. Apart from everything else, the Third of March returns our thoughts to Bulgaria's unrealized national ideals. Taught by the bitter experience of four wars and the ravages wrought by two uprisings in this century, today we seek to realize these ideals not though shifting borders, but through opening them up with free intercourse, by making the Balkans an inseparable part of a single, democratic, united, civilized Europe. Homage to the bright memory of the heroes of the War of Liberation!
