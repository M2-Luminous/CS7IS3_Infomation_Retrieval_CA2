I think we should wait and see who wins. We are committed to victory." There is talk about a "constituent government" after the elections, and [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary] Achille Occhetto has issued a warning and a challenge to [Italian Popular Party (PPI) Secretary] Martinazzoli and [Northern League leader] Bossi, who have been talking about it: First, the contest must take place, and the progressives want to win it in order to govern. So Occhetto wants to win, but victory is also the stated aim of the Pact for Italy which -- with [Pact leader] Segni, Martinazzoli, [Socialist] Amato, and [Italian Republican Party, PRI, Secretary] La Malfa -- instead risks playing the role of the preordained loser in this confrontation between the Right and the Left. They are rivals. They goad each other, try to win over the same voters, and attack each other. But the real enemy, the main target of Segni's attacks, and also those of Occhetto and [Democratic Alliance, AD, leader] Adornato, is [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi, the "Knight of the Antenna," as AD calls him. Contesting an election for the first time, both the Pact for Italy and AD (which presented their candidates and programs at two separate hotels in Rome) concentrated their attacks on Forza Italia's leader. Thus Occhetto replied almost contemptuously to Berlusconi's proposal of another election if no clear majority emerges 28 March: "Berlusconi is young, fresh, and full of life. Now he is involving himself in politics and therefore wants to have some fun right after the election so as to be able to broadcast more commercials." Then Occhetto abandoned his sarcasm: "For some time the citizens have thought that it is necessary to set to work, to produce, and to grant this country security. We hope that these citizens will find the strength to opt clearly for a majority that is willing to roll up its sleeves in order to rebuild Italy." This appeal was expressed in the slogan, "Think, Italy," [Ragiona Italia] launched by AD yesterday, to counter Berlusconi's Forza Italia. "We must work for a thinking Italy against those who want to induce the sleep of reason which, as we know, creates monsters." This was said by Luigi Spaventa, a [budget] minister in the Ciampi government, and Berlusconi's challenger in central Rome, the symbolic constituency in these elections. Seriousness versus demagoguery is the theme that AD and the progressives have identified as the key to the campaign against Berlusconi. According to Spaventa, Forza Italia's Right is exploiting the idea of a "mythical Wild West where men are men and the land belongs to everyone." The Right's electoral program is "intellectually and technically coarse," Spaventa said, as, for instance, in the plan to "create a million jobs by granting tax relief on reinvested profits" or with regard to the abolition of road tax. "This means depriving the regions of revenue," the budget minister stressed. "How does that square with a federal tax system?" The Left is telling voters to beware of facile promises. "They are just promises, electoral demagoguery," Bruno Visentini said, flanking Spaventa. "The market economy is not a natural phenomenon but a complex one requiring rules, and it must therefore be subject to discipline," the former Republican minister warned. "And a million new jobs cannot result from a wave of a magic wand." "Demagogic promises" and the request for "blank checks," Visentini said, "are historically the prelude to authoritarianism," to a Right "that longs for the return of the night stick." So according to Visentini, a vote for the Right entails "a real leap in the dark." Segni's Pact for Italy also takes issue with the Left, of course, but its main target remains Berlusconi. What if Forza Italia promises lower taxes? Those are "rash promises," Segni said, recalling the warning issued by Governor of the Bank of Italy Antonio Fazio. "To promise a major reduction in the tax burden means to forget about the problem of the public debt. These proposals are simply demagogic and inopportune." The Pact's pledge, Segni said, is "not to increase taxes. It is through reducing tax evasion and the public debt that a lowering of tax rates will be possible." As for a million jobs in three months -- "not even with a magic wand...." Rather, the Pact leader said, "it is surprising that Forza Italia's program says nothing about the media. For our part, the duopoly in television must be eliminated, though the public presence must be maintained, albeit cut back in some areas." Basically, "it is necessary to ensure a greater private presence through a modification of the Mammi Bill. It is not possible for all private information to be entrusted to a single individual." Martinazzoli, in a mood for witticisms, made a remark about "promises of miracles," which are always easy during an election campaign. "Vote for the Right once, take three," he said, with reference to the cross-party alliance between Bossi, Berlusconi, and [Italian Social Movement (MSI) leader] Fini. He also spoke about Bossi's "year of the Samurai," which has become "the month of delirium." "However," the Italian Popular Party leader said, "miracles rarely occur in politics, and so ultimately it will be necessary to sum up all these subtractions and additions -- less tax, more consumption, more order and money for justice. I hope that the Italian people will not be prompted to support promises that then immediately backfire against them." However, the possibility of a constituent government still remains. "My idea," he explained, "is that if none of the alignments gains a majority, it will be necessary to establish not so much just any kind of government but, rather, a government capable of governing authoritatively in a period which is still to a large extent a constituent one."
