Chiao made the remarks while meeting with Wang Zhaoguo, director of Beijing State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office, at the Great Hall of the People. "We have to sew the cloth together slowly and patiently so as to make it flawless," Chiao said. He said that mutual trust between the two sides could not be established overnight. He said that people in Taiwan are paying great attention to his talks with Tang Shubei, his counterpart from the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) because they see the meeting as a "touchstone" in the development of the cross-strait relations. Wang said that Chiao's trip to Beijing is conducive to the further acceleration of Taiwan-Mainland ties. He expressed the hope that a second round of talks between SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu and ARATS President Wang Daohan would take place soon. The first, historic meeting was in Singapore in April. Chiao's negotiations with Tang continue tomorrow after ending in a stalemate again Thursday.
