FR940425-1-00014 FR940425-1-00005 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;17&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Lockheed Model L&hyph;1011&hyph;385 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Lockheed Model L&hyph;1011&hyph;385 series airplanes. This proposal would require an initial servicing or overhaul of the ram air turbine (RAT), and incorporating repetitive overhaul actions into the FAA-approved maintenance program. This proposal is prompted by reports that, during routine maintenance of the RAT, the turbine blade assembly separated during spin tests. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent separation of the turbine blade assembly, which could damage the airplane structure and systems, and, under certain circumstances, could lead to reduced controllability of the airplane. DATES: Comments must be received by June 20, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;17&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.
