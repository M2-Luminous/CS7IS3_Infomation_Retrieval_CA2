President Boris Yeltsin has issued an official decree on the creation of 30 bases in accordance with proposals from the Russian ministries of defense and foreign affairs. Most of the bases are to be located in the CIS, in the 12 former states of the USSR that have arisen since the collapse of the Soviet Union, with one base in Latvia, at Skrunda. In Latvia and Estonia there is still a contingent of Russian troops, about 20,000 men, due to be withdrawn by the end of the summer. As Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of staff of the Russian Armed Forces, stated, nearly all former Soviet republics have expressed the wish to have Russian military bases set up on their territories. Aleksandr Rannikh, ambassador of the Russian Federation, was summoned to the Latvian Foreign Ministry today and requested to present by tomorrow an explanation for the decree signed by Russian President Boris Yeltsin on 5 April. (Maris Riekstins), secretary of state at the Foreign Ministry, expressed a categorical protest at the intention, formulated as a decree, to create military bases of the Russian Federation's armed forces in the CIS states and the Republic of Latvia, for the purpose of ensuring the security of the Russian Federation and the countries indicated, as well as trying out new arms and military techology; this is in clear contradiction with the agreements reached at international talks and the position of (?free) Latvia. After the seminar being held by the Cabinet of Ministers on the national programs, there is to be an extraordinary session of the government at Jurmala this evening, at which an official statement from the Latvian Government is due to be adopted regarding this decree of Yeltsin's.
