FR940317-1-00091 FR940317-1-00013 (j) Arises out of libel, slander, misrepresentation, or deceit (28 U.S.C. 2680(h)). The misrepresentation exception has been broadly construed to include negligent as well as intentional misrepresentation. It has not been applied in situations involving negligent failure to perform some operational task or to convey information related to public safety independent of any secondary misstatement. Where an erroneous medical diagnosis is made, the exception does not apply because malpractice is the gravamen of the action and the misrepresentation incidental. Similarly, the misrepresentation exception was held not applicable where the United States sold bomb casings to a scrap dealer expressly warranting that they were safe and fit for scrap metal processing, and one of the castings exploded. Before this exception can be applied in the determination of an administrative tort claim, the claims investigation must consider the nature of the Government's acts or omissions, as well as the information upon which the claimant may have relied to his or her detriment. (k) Arises out of interference with contract rights (28 U.S.C. 2680(h)). This exception includes both interference with existing contract rights and interference with prospective or executed contract rights or economic advantage. (l) Arises from the fiscal operations of the Department of the Treasury or from the regulation of the monetary system (28 U.S.C. 2680(i)). This exception includes all disbursing operations of the DA or other military services. However, such claims may be forwarded through Army finance channels for consideration. (m) Arises out of the combat activities of the military or naval forces, or the Coast Guard, during time of war (28 U.S.C. 2680(j)). ``Combat activities'' is defined in the glossary. (n) Arises in a foreign country (28 U.S.C. 2680(k)). There is no clear delineation of what constitutes a foreign country. However, the exception has been held applicable to claims arising in a leased military base in Newfoundland; in the American Embassy in Bangkok, Thailand; on Okinawa under the de facto sovereignty of the United States; on Kwajalein under the trusteeship of the United States; and to various occupied countries. (See subpart J and DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 821, for handling of certain claims arising in a foreign country.) Where the actionable negligence has occurred in the United States and only the consequences occurred in a foreign country, this exception has not been applied. (o) Arises from the activities of the Tennessee Valley Authority (28 U.S.C. 2680(i) and 16 U.S.C. 831 et. seq.). (p) Arises from the activities of the Panama Canal Commission (28 U.S.C. 2680(m)). (See 76A Stat. 22 through 25, and 22 U.S.C. 3761.) Claims accruing after the effective date of the Panama Canal Treaty (1 October 1979) may be cognizable under either the FCA or the MCA. (q) Arises from the activities of a Federal land bank, a Federal intermediate credit bank, or bank for cooperatives (28 U.S.C. 2680(n)). (r) Is for the personal injury or death of a member of the Armed Forces of the United States incurred incident to service, or for damage to a member's property incurred incident to service ( Feres v. United States , 340 U.S. 135 (1950)). (See ยง536.25 and DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraphs 8&hyph;26 through 8&hyph;28.) Currently the most significant justification for the incident to service doctrine is the availability of alternative compensation systems, and the fear of disrupting the military command relationship. Other supportive factors often cited by the courts are the service member's duty status, location, and receipt of military benefits at the time of the incident. (1) The exception applies to members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, including the Reserve Components of the Armed Forces. (See 10 U.S.C. 261.) The exception also applies to service members on the Temporary Disability Retired List, on convalescent leave, and on the extended enlistment program; to service academy cadets; and to members of visiting forces in the United States under the SOFA between the parties to the North Atlantic Treaty or similar international agreements. (2) The incident to service doctrine has been extended to derivative claims where the directly injured party is a service member. Third party indemnity claims are barred. (s) Is for the personal injury or death of a Government employee for whom benefits are provided by the FECA (5 U.S.C. 8101- 8150). (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 8&hyph;25.) Who is a Government employee under the Act is defined in the Act itself (5 U.S.C. 8101), but the term is not limited to Federal Civil Service employees. The term ``Government employee'' can include certain ROTC cadets (5 U.S.C. 8140) and State or local law enforcement officers engaged in apprehending a person for committing a crime against the United States (5 U.S.C. 8191), certain nurses, interns, or other health care personnel, for example, student nurses, (5 U.S.C. 5351, 8144), and certain Army Community Service Volunteers (10 U.S.C. 1588; AR 608&hyph;1).
