The joint Israeli-Palestinian patrol arrived on the scene to investigate the incident. In the territories last night, a Molotov cocktail was thrown at an Israeli bus near the settlement of Shavey Shomron. The bomb exploded on the road, no one was hurt. The Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] terrorist organization has announced it intends to form a political party in the territories, but at the same time the Hamas spokesman, speaking in Amman, denied that a representative of the organization, Sa'id Balal, has agreed to become a member of the Palestinian National Authority. If Balal has chosen to take part in the authority, said the spokesman, it was on his own initiative, not as a representative of Hamas. The Palestinian police chief in Gaza, Nasr Yusuf, has called on Hamas members to stop their killing attacks and hand over their weapons. In a leaflet distributed in Gaza, the police also asked Hamas to turn in the people responsible for killing two Palestinians suspected of cooperating with Israel. In other developments, about half the Fatah Hawks police recruits have quit, claiming there were informers among the conscripts. And last night some 260 Palestinian policemen entered Gaza from Egypt.
