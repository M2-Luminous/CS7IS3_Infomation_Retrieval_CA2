Upon completing the necessary evaluations, I had to thank certain government employees for their cooperation, as in the case with Foreign Minister Arturo Fajardo Maldonado, who will be replaced by Marithza Ruiz de Vielman, based on her background, capabilities, and human and professional qualities. In all the ministries I am going to mention, you can rest assured we conducted a flawless examination of the appointees, and that their appointments were based exclusively on the capabilities they have displayed in the numerous activities they have pursued, their qualifications, and especially their professional and human qualities and also, unquestionably, their performances in other disciplines or activities, public as well as private. Engineer Oscar Armando Martinez Anaya, who was minister of communications, transportation, and public works, will be replaced by Eng. Jorge Erdmenger de la Fuente. The Economy Ministry, which soon we hope to be able to legally call by the name we are currently using, Foreign Trade Ministry, will be headed by Eduardo Gonzalez Castillo, replacing Fanny de Estrada, who resigned some time ago because of health problems. The Finance Ministry was and still is headed by Richard Aitkenhead, who presented his irrevocable resignation some time ago because he was appointed to an important position in an international organization. I spoke with Aitkenhead and after accepting his resignation I decided to replace him with Economist Ana Ordonez de Molina, who until now was executive secretary of the Presidency. Her appointment was based on the follow-up evaluation I referred to earlier. As a strategy to strengthen the economic cabinet, Romulo Caballeros was secretary general of economic planning up until December. He accepted the position solely to participate in and cooperate with the government in the area of planning -- a mission he carried out perfectly because that institution worked with the economic cabinet on the 180-day plan and the 1994-95 government agenda. Having fulfilled his goal, and since he is no longer with us, I have appointed Guillermo Rodriguez Magual as secretary general of economic planning.
