FR940525-1-00015 FR940525-1-00007 As was mentioned above, the Banking Agencies' regulatory capital treatment of asset transfers with recourse differs from the accounting treatment of asset transfers with recourse under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). 6 The Banking Agencies do not believe it would be appropriate to conform the regulatory capital treatment of recourse arrangements to GAAP. 6 The OTS requires thrifts to account for assets sold with recourse in accordance with GAAP for reporting purposes and leverage capital requirements, but assesses capital against assets sold with recourse in computing the risk-based capital requirement for thrifts. Under GAAP, a transfer of receivables with recourse is accounted for as a sale if the transferor (1) surrenders control of the future economic benefits of the assets, (2) is able to reasonably estimate its obligations under the recourse provision, and (3) is not obligated to repurchase the assets except pursuant to the recourse provision. These provisions indicate that GAAP focuses on the transfer of benefits rather than the retention of risk in determining whether an asset transfer should be accounted for as a sale. The transferor must accrue, as a separate liability, an amount sufficient to absorb all estimated probable losses under the recourse provision over the life of the assets transferred. This accrued amount is referred to as the GAAP recourse liability. If a banking organization reported assets transferred with recourse in accordance with GAAP, and no regulatory capital were required for the transaction, then the institution's only protection against losses would be the GAAP recourse liability account. For a number of reasons, the Banking Agencies are of the opinion that the GAAP recourse liability account would be an inadequate substitute for an appropriate level of regulatory capital. First, the GAAP recourse liability account is intended to cover only an institution's probable expected losses under the recourse provision. In contrast, regulatory capital is intended to provide a cushion against unexpected losses. In recognition of the distinctly different purposes of the GAAP recourse liability account and regulatory capital, the Banking Agencies explicitly exclude the GAAP recourse liability account from regulatory capital. Second, the amount of credit risk that is typically retained in a recourse transaction greatly exceeds the normal, expected losses associated with the transferred assets. Even though a transferor may reduce its exposure to potential catastrophic losses by limiting the amount of recourse it provides, in many cases the transferor still retains the bulk of the risk inherent in the assets. For example, if an institution transfers high quality assets with 10% recourse that have a reasonably estimated loss rate of 1%, the transferor retains the risk of default up to a maximum of 10% of the total amount of the assets transferred. Because the recourse provision represents exposure to such a high amount of losses relative to the expected losses, in the normal course of business the transferor will sustain the same amount of losses as if the assets had not been sold. Consequently, the Banking Agencies take the position that the transferor in this example has not significantly reduced its risk for purposes of assessing regulatory capital and should continue to be assessed regulatory capital as though the assets have not been transferred. Third, the GAAP reliance on reasonable estimates of all probable credit losses over the life of the receivables transferred poses additional concerns for the Banking Agencies. While it may be possible to make such estimates for pools of consumer loans or residential mortgages, the Banking Agencies are of the view that it is difficult to do so for other types of loans. Even if it is possible to make a reasonable estimate of probable credit losses at the time an asset or asset pool is transferred, the ability of an institution to make a reasonable estimate may change over the life of the transferred assets. Finally, the Banking Agencies are concerned that an institution transferring assets with recourse might estimate that it would not have any losses under the recourse provision, in which case it would not establish any GAAP recourse liability account for the exposure. If the transferor recorded either no liability or only a nominal liability in the GAAP recourse liability account for a succession of asset transfers, a cumulation of credit risk would occur that would not be reflected, or would be only partially reflected, on the balance sheet. II. Notice of Proposed Rulemaking The Agencies' proposal to amend the risk-based capital standards would do the following: •Define the term ``recourse,'' expand the definition of the existing term ``direct credit substitute,'' and define the associated terms ``standard representations and warranties'' and ``servicer cash advance''; •Reduce the Banking Agencies' risk-based capital assessment for certain low-level recourse arrangements; and •Require equivalent treatment of recourse arrangements and certain direct credit substitutes that present equivalent risk of loss, including _requiring banking organizations that purchase certain loan servicing rights which provide loss protection to the owners of the loans serviced to hold capital against those loans, _requiring banking organizations that purchase subordinated interests which absorb the first dollars of losses from the underlying assets to hold capital against the subordinated interest plus all more senior interests, and _requiring banking organizations and thrifts that provide financial standby letters of credit or other guarantee-like arrangements for third-party assets that absorb the first dollars of losses from those assets to hold capital against the outstanding amount of the assets enhanced. 7 7 The OTS currently treats purchased loan servicing rights and purchased subordinated interests as recourse. This treatment would not change under this proposal. A. Definitions of Recourse and Direct Credit Substitute 1. Recourse The proposal defines ``recourse'' to mean any risk of loss that a banking organization or thrift retains in connection with an asset transfer, if the risk of loss exceeds a pro rata share of the institution's claim on the assets. 8 The proposed definition of recourse is consistent with the Banking Agencies' longstanding use of this term, and is intended to incorporate into the risk-based capital standards existing Agency practices regarding retention of risk in asset transfers. 9 8 If the institution transfers an asset or pool of assets in whole or in part but shares the total credit risk from the assets on a pro rata basis with the purchaser, this is not considered recourse. In such transactions, capital is required only against the transferor's pro rata share. Recourse exists when the transferor retains a disproportionate amount of the credit risk relative to its retained interest (if any) in the assets. 9 The OTS currently defines the term ``recourse'' more broadly than the proposal to include credit risk that a thrift assumes or accepts from third-party assets as well as risk that it retains in an asset transfer. Under the proposal, as explained below, credit risk that a banking organization or thrift assumes from third-party assets would fall under the definition of ``direct credit substitute'' rather than ``recourse.''
