FR940428-0-00007 FR940428-0-00003 The changes we are making include allowing the interstate movement to slaughter of sheep and goats less than 1 year of age from scrapie-infected flocks or source flocks that do not meet the requirements of ยง79.2 (a)(1) through (a)(7) of the regulations, if the animals are moved in a sealed means of conveyance and accompanied by a permit. This approach will be less restrictive and more efficient than allowing these animals to be moved interstate only if the animals have been identified with an ``S'' mark to the left jaw. Although the change applies to both sheep and goats, at present no goats are being moved interstate with an ``S'' mark. There are approximately 92,500 sheep farms in the United States, with approximately 11 million sheep. The large majority of these are small entities. Ninety-nine percent of the sheep farms in this country each have annual sales totalling less than $500,000, and approximately 77,000 have fewer than 100 sheep. The number of farms and animals that will be affected by this change is relatively small. There are approximately 81 infected or source flocks in this country, with only about 4,050 animals. All of these flocks are on what are considered small farms. The total number of farms affected will be less than .1 percent of the total number of sheep farms in the United States. It costs approximately $0.50 to brand a lamb. This amount will be saved by those farms that choose to ship animals according to the regulations. This compares to the average market value for a finished market lamb of $65. We are also providing that the diagnosis of scrapie necessary to categorize a flock as an infected flock, source flock, or trace flock must have been made after March 31, 1989. This change excludes from such categorizations flocks that completed a 42-month surveillance period prior to October 1, 1992, and in which scrapie has not been diagnosed since. This change clarifies our intent as to the definitions in question and will have no economic effect. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12778 This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and local laws and regulations that are in conflict with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule. Paperwork Reduction Act In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ), the information collection or recordkeeping requirements included in this final rule have been submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget.
