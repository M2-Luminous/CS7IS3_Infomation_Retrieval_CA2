In a lengthy article today AL-ZAHF AL-AKHDAR said that the so-called Lockerbie incident was from the outset a dirty plan of the intelligence agencies which was set up with the specific aim of preoccupying Western public opinion with marginal issues and distracting it from the harsh and bitter crises which they experience in their daily life. [passage omitted] AL-ZAHF AL-AKHDAR concluded at the end of its commentary that Lockerbie revealed that Western governments do not respect the public opinion of our society and do not value those who represent bodies, organizations, and humanitarian and legal organs, and that Western governments trade with their peoples and use them as a means of achieving their own aims. The Western governments proved that they are backward, malicious, and racist toward the peoples of the world and its small states and that they do not rely on moral values in dealing with international issues and crises.
