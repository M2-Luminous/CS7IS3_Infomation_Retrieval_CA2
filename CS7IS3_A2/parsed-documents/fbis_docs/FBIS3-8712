"I believe it is essential that the decisionmaking process at the United Nations is such that the effectiveness of responses can be assured under good conditions whenever a response is required. Too frequently this is not the case." In the case of the Serbian tank aggression, "once again, it took more than one hour for the administrative procedures to run their course," affirmed the prime minister. According to the military personnel on the ground, the request to respond has been made at 2217 local time by the commander of the French battalion, and the green light was only given by the UN special representative, Mr. Yashusi Akashi, (the sole individual there empowered to order an air strike) at 2315 [local time]. This version of events was implicitly confirmed by a NATO spokesman in Rome. He indicated that the two aircraft which arrived over Bihac received shortly afterwards the order not to intervene because "the shooting had ceased." Edouard Balladur had come out with his reproaches Sunday morning, during a talk with Yasushi Akashi in Zagreb. He announced that, together with [Defense Minister] Francois Leotard and Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, he would "study the proposals that might be made with a view to accelerating the process so that decisions to respond be made in time and not when the moment had passed. It is essential that our troops benefit here from optimal conditions of safety and protection, because they are not indulging in warring activities, but participating in humanitarian operations." The criticisms made by Edouard Balladur echo those made by General Cot, the UNPROFOR commander, who -- back in January -- had already taken issue over the ponderousness of the decisionmaking process leading up to an air strike in response [to hostilities in violation of the cease-fire]. At the time he suggested that the UNPROFOR commander be empowered to make the decision. The French Government has also called into question the behavior of the UNPROFOR commander in Bosnia, the British General Michael Rose, who is second-in-command to General Cot. Last Thursday, according to Francois Leotard, the UN troops in Bihac had called for air support "but General Rose had rejected their call." According to French military sources, relations between the French leaders and the British general, who the former reproach for having adopted "too personal" an approach in managing the situation in Bosnia, are not looking rosy. Paris also fears that Bihac could become a major center of confrontation. Since the beginning of February the latter [not further specified] have in fact reinforced their presence by several thousand men. Within the context of an agreement between the Croats and the Muslims, the railway (along the river Una, in the south of the pocket), which constitutes the boundary, is of great strategic importance, for it represents the sole link between Knin in Serbian Krajina and Belgrade, thereby ensuring the continuity of Serbian territory.
