Slovenia would also like a border revision with Croatia. [passage omitted] In your view, where will all these border battles lead? [Kucan] The war against Bosnia-Herzegovina is being waged because of the nationality problems. The striving to resolve the nationality issues is justified at all events; but the means are not justified. The method that Serb politics have chosen for the solution is antidemocratic, and the revanchist voices being heard from the direction of Italy luckily reflect only certain peoples' stances on the matter of Slovenia's borders. I hope that Europe, in the interest of its own future, will make a stand for its own position and will defend the principle that European borders are inviolable and cannot be altered by force, by war. As for the Slovene-Croatian border, on land this is definitive; but the marine frontier has not been designated. We have now set up a joint commission; I hope that this professional committee will recommend to the politicians solutions with which the Croatian-Slovenian marine borders can also be designated definitively. [Orban] Mr. President, you personally still know a lot of leaders from the former Yugoslavia, but also from the new successor states. You see events from the inside. What will be the outcome of this war? [Kucan] I am mostly acquainted with those leaders who also held office in former Yugoslavia. My opinion is that the Balkan crisis does not really depend on personalities. It is true that in Serbia, for example, most of the threads are held in the hand of President Milosevic; but Milosevic is not the intellectual author of the concept of greater Serbia. The history of this idea goes back to much older times. [passage omitted] Also, Milosevic, from Serbia's point of view, is a really successful implementer of this concept. As you see, a lot of people support this concept, even from the ranks of the opposition. So, not a lot depends on personalities. The fate of the war depends on whether the opposing sides will accept or not the logical European norms that are also included in the Helsinki documents. [Orban] What is your opinion on Central European cooperation? Do regional relations of this kind have a future? [Kucan] Central Europe is an objective reality, which stretches from the Baltics to the Adriatic. I consider this as an intellectual position. Let me quote one of your compatriots, Gyoergy Konrad [writer], who said that Central Europe constituted a world outlook. I agree with him, by all means. Central Europe is a spiritual quality, a life situation, a stance, a value system. This is where these countries' mission lies. They have to bring these values into the common Europe. I am convinced that the European ideal can be realized. But, if it turns out in the end that an associated or joint Europe is not possible after all, Central Europe will gain a new sense and meaning. Then we will have to consider the idea of an association in an institutional form, from the point of view of Central Europe, as against Western and Eastern Europe. Naturally, the question of where the borders of Central Europe begin is still to be answered.
