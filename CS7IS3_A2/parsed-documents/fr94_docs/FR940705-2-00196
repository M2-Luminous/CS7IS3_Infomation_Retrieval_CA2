FR940705-2-00196 FR940705-2-00091 Appendix G-II-C&hyph;1-d. Eating, drinking, smoking, storing food, and applying cosmetics are not permitted in the work area. Appendix G-II-C&hyph;1-e. Persons wash their hands: (i) after handling materials involving organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules, and handling animals, and (ii) when exiting the laboratory. Appendix G-II-C&hyph;1-f. All procedures are performed carefully to minimize the creation of aerosols. Appendix G-II-C&hyph;1-g. Persons under 16 years of age shall not enter the laboratory. Appendix G-II-C&hyph;1-h. If experiments involving other organisms which require lower levels of containment are to be conducted in the same laboratory concurrently with experiments requiring BL3 level physical containment, they shall be conducted in accordance with all BL3 level laboratory practices. Appendix G-II-C&hyph;2. Special Practices (BL3) Appendix G-II-C&hyph;2-a. Laboratory doors are kept closed when experiments are in progress. Appendix G-II-C&hyph;2-b. Contaminated materials that are to be decontaminated at a site away from the laboratory are placed in a durable leak-proof container which is closed before being removed from the laboratory. Appendix G-II-C&hyph;2-c. The Principal Investigator controls access to the laboratory and restricts access to persons whose presence is required for program or support purposes. The Principal Investigator has the final responsibility for assessing each circumstance and determining who may enter or work in the laboratory. Appendix G-II-C&hyph;2-d. The Principal Investigator establishes policies and procedures whereby only persons who have been advised of the potential biohazard, who meet any specific entry requirements (e.g., immunization), and who comply with all entry and exit procedures entering the laboratory or animal rooms. Appendix G-II-C&hyph;2-e. When organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules or experimental animals are present in the laboratory or containment module, a hazard warning sign incorporating the universal biosafety symbol is posted on all laboratory and animal room access doors. The hazard warning sign identifies the agent, lists the name and telephone number of the Principal Investigator or other responsible person(s), and indicates any special requirements for entering the laboratory such as the need for immunizations, respirators, or other personal protective measures. Appendix G-II-C&hyph;2-f. All activities involving organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules are conducted in biological safety cabinets or other physical containment devices within the containment module. No work in open vessels is conducted on the open bench. Appendix G-II-C&hyph;2-g. The work surfaces of biological safety cabinets and other containment equipment are decontaminated when work with organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules is finished. Plastic-backed paper toweling used on non-perforated work surfaces within biological safety cabinets facilitates clean-up. Appendix G-II-C&hyph;2-h. An insect and rodent program is in effect. Appendix G-II-C&hyph;2-i. Laboratory clothing that protects street clothing (e.g., solid front or wrap-around gowns, scrub suits, coveralls) is worn in the laboratory. Laboratory clothing is not worn outside the laboratory, and it is decontaminated prior to laundering or disposal. Appendix G-II-C&hyph;2-j. Special care is taken to avoid skin contamination with contaminated materials; gloves should be worn when handling infected animals and when skin contact with infectious materials is unavoidable. Appendix G-II-C&hyph;2-k. Molded surgical masks or respirators are worn in rooms containing experimental animals. Appendix G-II-C&hyph;2-l. Animals and plants not related to the work being conducted are not permitted in the laboratory. Appendix G-II-C&hyph;2-m. Laboratory animals held in a BL3 area shall be housed in partial-containment caging systems, such as Horsfall units (see Appendix G-III-K), open cages placed in ventilated enclosures, solid-wall and -bottom cages covered by filter bonnets or solid-wall and -bottom cages placed on holding racks equipped with ultraviolet in radiation lamps and reflectors. Note: Conventional caging systems may be used provided that all personnel wear appropriate personal protective devices. These protective devices shall include at a minimum wrap-around gowns, head covers, gloves, shoe covers, and respirators. All personnel shall shower on exit from areas where these devices are required. Appendix G-II-C&hyph;2-n. All wastes from laboratories and animal rooms are appropriately decontaminated before disposal. Appendix G-II-C&hyph;2-o. Vacuum lines are protected with high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters and liquid disinfectant traps.
