Using the LF-12 laser facility, and guided by X-ray laser theoretical research done at the Beijing Institute of Applied Physics and Computational Mathematics, the SINPC scientists successfully observed two electron-collision-excited Ne-like Ge X-ray laser gain lines--one at 19.6 nm and one at 23.6 nm. The scientists used a narrow-pulse-width, low-energy bipulse laser drive and a thin-film target. In electron-collision-excited mechanism research, this is the first report worldwide of successful realization of high-gain X-ray lasing with a low-energy, mid/high-power-density laser.
