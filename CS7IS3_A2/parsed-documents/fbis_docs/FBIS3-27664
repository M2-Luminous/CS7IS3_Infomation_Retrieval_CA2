Zhu Rongji spoke highly of the precious contribution made by friends of the Keidanren over a long time to the development of Sino-Japanese trade and economic cooperation, and gave a briefing on the current state of China's reform at the request of people in Japan's economic circles. He said: This year is a crucial one for China's economic reform. Many important reform measures were introduced at the beginning of this year. These reform measures were drawn up on the basis of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. They have been implemented for more than 50 days and are making relatively smooth progress. This further strengthens our resolve to promote reform. In the process of drawing up reform bills, we used the experience of developed countries, including Japan, in economic development. Keidanren officials, including Hiraiwa, said: Japan is very interested in China's economic development. The Keidanren set up its China Committee in May last year to promote the development of Japanese-Chinese economic relations. Senior personnel in the entourage, including He Chunlin, deputy secretary general of the State Council General Office, were present at the meeting and were invited to attend the banquet in the evening. Zhu Rongji also met Chairman Kosaku Inaba of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry [JCCI] at the Shin Otani Hotel this afternoon. During the meeting, Zhu Rongji said: "The timing of my visit to Japan is very good. This year is a crucial one for China's economic reform. Japanese friends have been following with interest the economic situation in China. One of the purposes of my visit to Japan is to introduce China's domestic economic situation. Markets and prices are now stable in China, and so is the general mood of the people there." Zhu Rongji said: "This year is also important for Japan. The Japanese Government wants to take some important measures to stimulate economic development. The timely exchange of views between China and Japan is very necessary for the two countries in improving mutual understanding and developing cooperation." Inaba said that, when he visited China last year, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji suggested that the JCCI organize a delegation to visit China every year. Inaba said: The JCCI followed up the suggestion. This year, it is preparing to organize a delegation to visit cities in central and west China to conduct survey.
