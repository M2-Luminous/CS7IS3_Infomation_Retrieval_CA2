According to government counts, 142 human lives were lost in the October developments. The leader of Russia's National Salvation Front Iliya Konstantinov, a member of the Constitutional Court Valeriy Zorkin, the chairman of the Popular party off Free Russia Vasiliy Lipitskiy, a member of the State Duma Stanislav Govorukhin, members of the dissolved Supreme Soviet Oleg Rumiantsev and Gennadiy Sayenko as well as other opposition leaders who defended the building of the Russian House of Soviets on October 3 and 4, took part in the memorial ceremony in front of that building. In Rutskoy's view, more people failed to come to their aid in October because truthful reports on what was happening were not available. Rutskoy said those who defended the national parliament were no communo-fascists. Instead, those who opened fire on the parliament were fascists. Rutskoy dubbed as shameless what Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said in a Saturday's appearance on national television. According to Grachev, the armed forces were sent in last October to cut a way through political debris. The ex-vice-president stood for a long time with a bowed head and in silence at the monument which was designed as a wooden cross with hanging funeral bands and loops of barbed wire. Barbed wire entanglements surrounded the building of the Russian parliament in October. Asked by journalists what he felt at the moment, Rutskoy said "Ask Yeltsin". National Salvation Front leader Iliya Konstantinov told a reporter for Interfax he intended to concentrate on organizational and analytical efforts. As well as Rutskoy, Konstantinov was arrested in the wake of the October uprising and released from the Lefortovo investigation cells on the Duma's amnesty decision. He said that today the opposition must concentrate on preparations for the next elections to the Federal Assembly and, especially, presidential elections. He refused to name the opposition's choices by saying time would show that. President Yeltsin banned both the National Salvation Front and the Working Russia movement led by Viktor Anpilov from taking part in the parliamentary elections of last December owing to their role in the October developments.
