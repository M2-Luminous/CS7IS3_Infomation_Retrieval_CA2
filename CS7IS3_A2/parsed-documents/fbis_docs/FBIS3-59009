Due to what October's special European Council agreed in Brussels, these negotiations should be over for 1 March, so that the European Parliament can give its assent under the current legislature. The outcome of this trip will, to a great extent, determine the possible convening of extra ministerial negotiations sessions in February, after the General Affairs Council of 7/8 February, or even a special summit. As we already mentioned, Sweden seems close to this result, already having most of the difficulties behind it (thus, it did not ask for many exemptions in the field of the Common Agricultural Policy [CAP] and, as for regional policy, obtained recognition of "Objective 1" status of an area -- connecting Norwegian and Finnish regions which have been guaranteed this status -- for which it appears it had had no intention of fighting). Norway, however, (came later than the three other countries in the negotiating process) continues to raise a certain number of sticky issues (fishing CAP, mainly), even if the energy dossier now seems to be moving forward smoothly; according to well informed European sources, the Norwegian Government has benefited from a kind of right to have a look in at the "joint position" adopted by the Council over the right of exploiting resources and is alleged to be prepared to accept it as long as this question is the subject of an annex in the accession treaty; this latter requirement is said to still be causing problems for some member states which intend to be sure that this clause should only be valid for Norway, thus in the case where this country actually does accede at the end of negotiations and, especially, the referendum which (as in the other candidate states) should give the "green light of the people." Concerning this, EUROPE recalls that the dates for these different referenda have still not been set. It does, however, seem that Sweden would like to organize its own in the wake of the Finnish referendum (the latest events in Russia could encourage the population to see accession with a little more enthusiasm), and, in any case, before the Norwegian referendum (this country seems the least certain seen from the population's point of view). The Norwegian authorities responsible for managing whaling explained to the press their country's position as regards this; in their opinion, this could lead to complications in accession negotiations but without it posing an obstacle to their conclusion. EUROPE will return to this aspect.
