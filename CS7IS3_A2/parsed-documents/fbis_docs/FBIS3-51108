Even if decisionmaking is backed by evaluations, studies, and forecasts, unexpected events are almost always detrimental to long-range decisions. In the military area in particular, there are many examples showing the difference between actual capability and the desirable level. But despite that, forecasts, studies, and evaluations are still of basic importance in reaching decisions affecting the future. In the Armed Forces, those functions are performed by high-ranking officers with outstanding ability, and their purpose is to point decisions by the higher commands in the right direction. Known as general staff activities, they are an efficient tool that commanders rely on in order to exercise their command, even at the risk of being faced with unforeseen and pressing events. In the Brazilian Army more specifically, the general advisory organization responsible to the minister for preparing and guiding that institution in its use of the ground force is the Army General Staff. Established on 24 October 1896 and located at Army Headquarters in Brasilia, the Army General Staff consists of a chief of staff, a deputy chief of staff, and six assistant chiefs of staff who specialize in various military matters. Its vast range of duties also includes responsibility for cooperating with the Armed Forces General Staff (EMFA) in studies aimed at establishing military doctrine, policy, and strategies. The current Army chief of staff is a four-star general: Benedito Onofre Bezerra Leonel. A native of Piraju, Sao Paulo, General Leonel has an extensive record of service to the Army--his military career spans nearly 50 years--and he was promoted to full general in July of last year. In the line of hierarchical succession, the Army chief of staff takes charge of the Ministry of Army if the actual minister is absent. On the morning of last 17 August, Gen. Leonel received the editors of TECNOLOGIA & DEFESA, Francisco Ferro and Cosme Degenar Drumond, in his office. On that occasion, he commented to our magazine exclusively regarding important matters related to current military affairs and enumerated the Brazilian Army's priorities in terms of the country's financial capabilities. Here are the principal excerpts from his remarks during that interview. Simulation System "With a view to increasing the efficiency of training while also achieving cost-benefit gains, the Army has acquired a Small Caliber Arms Effect Simulation System. That modern equipment, which has been adopted by the armed forces of several countries, will enable us to improve training standards in small units (companies and platoons) by making the execution of dual-purpose maneuvers possible. The equipment will be assigned to a motorized infantry brigade. The company supplying the system will provide a 12-day training period for officers from various units." Electronic Warfare "This is a priority for the Army because it is a factor for modernization and increased operational effectiveness in the service. The phases of this project include personnel training and the introduction of high-performance tactical and strategic systems in the field of communications and noncommunications, the objective being to monitor the electromagnetic spectrum. Personnel will be trained at the Electronic Warfare Training Center, a unit that provides officers and NCO's--and, through a cooperative effort, the Navy and Air Force--with specialized training in that activity." Modernization of Equipment "The modernization of equipment will be aimed not only at meeting the demands of modern warfare, which require that we have materiel more suited to existing operational environments, but also and chiefly at saving money. With that in mind, the limitations imposed by the current economic situation are being taken into account. The current priorities in the modernization effort are armored vehicles and field artillery equipment, but we are not losing sight of the needs in other areas--communications equipment, for example." Antitank Missile "The MSS-1.2 antitank missile has been developed and is now going through the final phases preceding industrial production. This weapon is the result of cooperation between the Army and a European firm. It is a missile of the latest generation with an effective range of about 3.5 km and the ability to destroy the most modern armor currently in existence. Production is expected to begin in 1994, and at that point distribution to the infantry battalions will begin." Osorio Main Battle Tank "Several tests conducted in international competitions show that the Osorio, manufactured by Engesa [Specialized Engineers, Inc.], is a tank in the same class as the M1 Abrams (American), the Challenger (British), and the Leopard II (German) and that it is superior to the first-line tanks of other countries. The Army worked with Engesa to develop this tank." Ballistic Protection Helmets "Individual protection is essential for the soldier on the battlefield, who is exposed to four kinds of threats: shrapnel, projectiles, blast effects, and incendiary effects. As far as helmets are concerned, it is necessary to obtain a more suitable model that is more comfortable and affords increased ballistic protection. Some countries have used a composite material made of aramid and polymer resins. The Brazilian Army intends to gradually replace the old steel-fiber helmets with a highly functional light combat helmet providing ballistic protection. It has an effective shape and can be used on various missions." New Suppliers "The configuration of the world today is quite different from what it was five years ago. Until just recently, the Brazilian Army looked for equipment in West Europe and the United States. But today there are other potential suppliers: Russia, China, Korea, and Taiwan, for example. Those countries have interesting things to offer, and we are engaged in a process of developing closer relations with them by observing and making certain analyses. It is essential to pay attention to three principles: the materiel itself, logistics, and technology transfer when required." Foreign Materiel "Before buying any materiel abroad, the Army needs to know whether the supplying firm is 100-percent privately owned or a state-owned firm and the kind of economic-financial policy its country has. For example, when the Army deals with a foreign firm, it needs to be certain that the government of that country will support and guarantee the transaction, because we must seek the best for Brazil." Antiaircraft Artillery "The Secretariat of Science and Technology is continuing its studies and projects aimed at the development of a Brazilian surface-to-air missile. Portable infrared-guided missiles will be acquired to expand our current defense capability. Plans also call for acquiring a battery of laser-guided missiles (optronic)." Field Artillery "This involves several current programs: a) modernization of the M-108's, including the replacement of engines and changes to the vehicle transmission systems, to be completed in 1996; b) modernization of the self-propelled 155mm howitzers and the self-propelled 105mm's to increase their ranges by 32 km and 17 km respectively. This program is being carried out by a British firm that will transfer the technology; c) the acquisition by 1996 of a large number of 105mm howitzers; d) studies and tests on the use of 105mm ordnance in the Amazon Region; e) the acquisition by 1996 of area saturation rocket systems; f) a start on the incorporation of modern radar target seeking equipment and sound ranging equipment as well as sight, laser, and infrared ranging equipment; and g) the acquisition, now under way, of photographing equipment and electronic fire computing equipment." Coast Artillery "Defending the coast and navigable inland waterways is an Army concern. The General Staff is conducting studies for ensuring suitable defense of the tactically important points controlling access to the Amazon Region." Domestic Expertise "This is fundamental for the Army. We are collecting know-how outside the country in the initial phase and then encouraging our own firms to participate in technological development. I believe that the same thing is also going to happen in connection with Sivam [Amazon Region Surveillance System]. As the program continues, the Army will enlist domestic industry. When you talk about materiel for military use, domestic industry, and the Armed Forces, that combination is a great platform for giving development a boost, with applications in many other areas. Technical know-how radiates out into the civilian area. There is no doubt that the Armed Forces play an important part in the country's development." Support for Industry "A country's security does not depend solely on its Armed Forces. It also involves the economic, psychosocial, and political areas in addition to scientific and technological development. The ability to design and manufacture materiel for military use is very important for strengthening our defense capability. The peace and progress that we all want for Brazil depend upon the integration of Armed Forces and industry. One of the efforts that the Army has been making in the area of industrial integration is Sicatex (Army Cataloguing System). The Army has a special affection for domestic firms which, besides working with production, also engage in research and carry out technological projects. Those firms deserve closer attention. In all projects of interest to the Army, the participation of our firms has been preserved. We cannot promise anything at the moment because of budget difficulties, but as soon as things improve, we will continue to support projects being carried out by our firms." Military Service "The Military Service System administers the Army's most important resource: people. It should be pointed out that even the Royal Charter dated 22 March 1776 ordered that everyone, with no distinction as to class, should participate in the defense of the territory. The current recruitment process has served very well throughout this entire period and lived up to Olavo Bilac's expectations regarding its role in promoting patriotism. The essential thing is to decide what is best for the country. We must decide that question ourselves without importing any models, especially since 83 of the 143 countries with organized armed forces have universal conscription, and our solution must be the result of an analysis taking into account geopolitical factors--size of the territory and population--among other things. The Military Service Law and its implementing regulations, based on Brazilian tradition and prior legislation, are the consolidation of long-time practice in dealing with the activities of military service." Army Aviation "Our Army Air Force comprises two types of helicopters: reconnaissance/attack helicopters and utility helicopters. There are a total of 54 aircraft, and they are going to be joined by another 18 reconnaissance/attack helicopters that we are in the process of receiving. To meet its requirements for logistic support and pilot training, the Army is looking into the acquisition of freight helicopters and training helicopters." Adoption of GPS "The adoption of portable equipment for determining one's position by the use of satellites leads to greater speed and accuracy in all combat missions. In order to conduct military operations in the field, it is essential for the fighter to know the exact location of his forces and of the enemy. The use of GPS [Global Positioning System] and other similar equipment greatly facilitates missions for all combat echelons and makes greater operational performance possible. The importance of that kind of equipment is very great in areas with difficult terrain, where there is dense plant cover and few reference points, the Amazon Region being one example." New Caliber "Several foreign armies have been adopting 5.56mm caliber personal weapons to replace the traditional 7.6.2mm. Besides helping to reduce weight and volume, the new caliber enables a fighter to carry more ammunition for the same weapon. Ballistic studies show that the 5.56mm weapon meets the requirements for range, penetration, and shock power. Some units of the Brazilian Army are already testing the FAL 5.56mm, produced by Imbel [War Materiel Industry], and preparing to use it." Computerization "The current state of computerization in the Army is characterized by a growing concern with the training and technical expertise of personnel and efforts to assimilate the culture of information processing; the search for a level of standardization that can improve productivity, quality, and the interaction between systems; awareness of the need to turn the user of information processing into the subject of the process by encouraging his active participation in the same; and the planning and implementation--now under way--of integrated systems for dealing with personnel and equipment and, later, economy and finance. Those systems will make it possible to develop other systems which are no less important than the former but which are dependent upon them." Brazilian Amazon Region "It is unquestionably an area of great strategic importance. The chief element in the vivification and development of that vast area--a slow process until recently--has been the pioneering work of the Armed Forces. The Federal Government laid the groundwork for the Calha Norte Project in 1985, and the actual work, which started in 1986, was to be carried out jointly by several government agencies. The project covers the region located north of the Solimoes and Amazon Rivers. Because it was already organized in the area, the Army quickly began working on the project." Reserve Training Centers "The Ministry of Army establishes reserve training centers at the request of the municipal governments, which address those requests to the commanders of the military regions. The centers are primarily the result of a municipal community effort. The Ministries of Army and Social Welfare have set up an interministerial coordinating committee for actions resulting from a protocol of intention covering the establishment of TG [reserve training center] programs in areas that lack them. Work to establish a pilot project (six TG's) is scheduled to begin in 1994. Those installations will also be used for activities of a social nature under the coordination of community centers." Finances "As far as the Army is concerned, the current fiscal year has meant an unprecedented exercise in adaptations and adjustments. Since the 1993 budget could not be approved until the end of April and actually implemented until June 1993, the ground force got through the first five months of the year with equivalent funds and only 12 percent of the amount it expected to have for operations and investment. The Army has an interest in getting its budget ceilings increased in 1994, because otherwise its operational capability will suffer."
