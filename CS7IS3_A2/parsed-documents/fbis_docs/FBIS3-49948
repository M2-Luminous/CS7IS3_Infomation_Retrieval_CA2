After all that happened it is evident that the Muslims have opted for war, not for peace, Karadzic went on to say, stressing that the Serbs would exercise maximum restraint in responding to provocations. Karadzic said he expected the launching of an all-out Muslim offensive, especially in central Bosnia. "If the sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia were lifted, the Muslims would sign the peace plan," Karadzic assessed, underlining that everything now depended on the international community. Nikola Koljevic, Serb Republic vice president, recalled that the Muslims had been offered a truce and confidence-building measures which, as he said, they rejected.
