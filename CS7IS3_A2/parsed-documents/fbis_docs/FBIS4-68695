Over the many years of UN operations in support of peace, a fairly stable concept of their principles and tasks has taken shape: disengagement of the warring sides, complete neutrality, avoidance of political assessments of the actions of one side or another, the use of force in exceptional instances, on a limited scale, and only in self-defense. The rules are fairly rigid but dictated by a need for the United Nations to observe a genuine role as peacemaker. In recent times this noble role has undergone an especially acute and in no way harmless distortion. In the name of the United Nations, squadrons of bombers and armadas of ships are massed. In the name of the United Nations, one party to a conflict is loudly accused while the other is indulged. In the name of the United Nations, plans for a settlement are drawn up which often do not even manage to ask the consent of those who would be bound by these plans. The results are plain to see, as they say. How disgraceful the result of the UN peacemaking effort in Somalia has been! The people are starving just as they starved in the past. General Aidid--whom the "peacemakers" hunted so zealously--is prospering. While the "peacemakers" themselves, having spent tremendous amounts of money--that could have been used to feed half of Africa--have vanished. No less incredible are their actions in Rwanda, from which they managed to extricate Europeans and Americans with difficulty and are now swiftly retreating, while suffering significant casualties. A direct example of distortion of the peacemaking role of the United Nations can be seen in Bosnia. In developing the anti-Serbian resolution of the Security Council, clearly aimed at strangling Yugoslavia with an embargo (this resolution has never yielded anything positive), the creators of UN policy in Bosnia applied the theory of "Serbian aggression" to carry out a policy openly hostile to one of the sides in conflict. For a long time ignoring reports on atrocities by Muslims or Croats, they did everything they could to blow up testimony on Serbian atrocities. Ignoring the deep historical roots and causes of the conflict, thereby ignoring its exceptional complexity, they kept reiterating that everything could be resolved in one fell swoop. As a result, a distorted picture of the conflict was established in the minds of many people along with unjustified confidence in the possibility of settling it. It was alleged that the entire affair revolved around "Serbian greed," that the Serbs must be stopped, and that the best way to do this was by inflicting massive combat strikes against their positions. So now when this very simple thesis was foisted on the Western public, the NATO bloc came upon the scene--out of work and lacking any goal following the Cold War. From all appearances the NATO Council and its secretary general saw Bosnia as a chance to save the bloc and an opportunity to fill the military-strategic vacuum that had formed between Italy and Greece. Yugoslavia was suddenly, and entirely arbitrarily, proclaimed a "zone of responsibility" of NATO. The bloc itself is becoming the "tool of the United Nations" and is prepared to offer the organization its services. Russia, initially voting in favor of the anti-Serbian resolution of the Security Council (the first major mistake of its foreign policy in the Yugoslavia crisis), is becoming a coparticipant, against its will, in this game which is fraught with tragedy. We can now attempt to clarify who issued the order to begin the bombing in Bosnia and why. We can deplore the disgraceful result of the "Churkin mission" that began with such success. We can take offense at the fact that--you see, "they did not consult Russia." We can and must accuse the Serbs of obstinacy and stubbornness, and of causing the latest collapse in the negotiations process. But we cannot close our eyes here to the nature of the political actions of the West in Bosnia. These actions, culminating in the recent NATO bombings, do not facilitate a peaceful settlement, but rather impede it. And the United Nations, which must of course be given its due for the organization of humanitarian assistance to Bosnia, bears its share of responsibility for the breakdown of the negotiations. It would be useful for the UN leadership to remember the original objectives of its organization. These do not consist of encouraging NATO attempts to resolve all the problems with bomb strikes. That is clearly a dead end. On the contrary, the United Nations must return to its mission of peace, not turn into a warring party in the Bosnian conflict. Otherwise the United Nations risks getting entangled in its own Vietnam.
