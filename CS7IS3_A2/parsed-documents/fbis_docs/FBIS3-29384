The top government spokesman made the suggestion at a regular news conference after a meeting among Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and subcabinet-level officials who represented Japan at trade negotiations with the United States. "A cabinet-level session will be convened on the matter next week," said one government source. Prime Minister Hosokawa plans to focus on improving foreign access to the market in a meeting with cabinet members, government sources said. They said the scheme, including deregulations and boosting imports, is designed to break the impasse in the bilateral framework trade talks. The talks to whittle down Japan's lopsided trade surplus with the United States broke down last week, prompting Washington on Tuesday to announce plans to impose sanctions for a slow U.S. penetration into Japan's cellular phone market. Takemura said the prime minister and government officials confirmed in the meeting that the government will voluntarily draw up measures to help slash Japan's vast trade surplus, which totaled 130 billion dollars last year, of which about 60 billion dollars was with the U.S. The steps include deregulation and promotion of imports and investments in Japan, freeing competition for foreign goods and services in Japanese markets and improving government procurement. Asked if the steps will be compiled before the February 26 meeting of finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven major economic powers in Germany, Takemura replied, "it should not be too late." Hosokawa has noted the need for Japan to "swiftly" come up with voluntary measures since he and U.S. President Bill Clinton failed in their summit last Friday to narrow differences on cutting the trade surplus and boosting the sale of foreign goods in Japan. Takemura added that a cabinet-ministerial meeting on Japan's trade gap with the U.S. should be held as quickly as possible. He also renewed his call on the U.S. to refrain from imposing retaliatory measures. Clinton said Wednesday he expects to have policy recommendations drawn up in the next few days to address the bilateral disputes. The options under consideration reportedly include resurrection of a U.S. trade law that allows punitive measures against countries that refuse to change what Washington deems are unfair trade practices. U.S. press reports said a White House decision to revive the "Super 301" trade measure through executive order is imminent, possibly by Thursday.
