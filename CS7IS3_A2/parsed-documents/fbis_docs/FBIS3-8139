Early elections, the date of which has not been set as yet, are seen by both the government and the opposition as a solution to the current political crisis in Slovakia. Speaking at a meeting of the government coalition, which is also formed by Premier Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), Slota stressed that his party would not allow Slovaks to become an ethnic minority in the country's south. Southern Slovakia is home to most of the 560,000 ethnic Hungarians living in the country and constituting almost 11 per cent of its total population. Slota hailed the departure of a group of people around the former SNS chairman, Ludovit Cernak, as "cleansing the party of the people who thought that the SNS could be built up on civic principles." Parliament Deputy Chairman Augustin Marian Huska (HZDS) commented on the evident disharmony between the Castle, seat of President Michal Kovac, and Meciar saying that "the government is to govern and the president is to represent (the country)". Kovac has refused to accept Meciar's candidates for the posts of privatization and foreign ministers, Ivan Lexa and Jozef Prokes, respectively. He has also decided not to call a referendum on stripping the deputies who have left the parties for which they had been elected of their mandates because this contradicted the constitution, as Kovac's spokesman Anton Bodis put it. Huska called on the Slovaks to rid themselves of their "slavish souls" and to demonstrate their ability to defend their statehood. He stressed that since the times of (9th-century) Prince Pribina "we have been endangered." Deputy Premier and SNS honorary Chairman Jozef Prokes said Kovac probably had refused to put him in charge of the Foreign Ministry (to replace Jozef Moravcik, HZDS, who resigned last week) because "I dared to express the doubt that the best way of conducting talks with (U.S. President Bill) Clinton (during his January visit to Prague) was to read him a half-hour lecture." Meciar called Kovac's meeting with Clinton "a historically wasted opportunity." Prokes called false the claims that it was not possible to cooperate with Meciar because his own case testified to the contrary.
