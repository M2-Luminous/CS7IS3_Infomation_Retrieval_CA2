"We are taking one problem at a time, by choosing Sarajevo first before going on to other problems," Haekkerup said, referring to the threat of NATO air strikes which convinced the Serbs to remove their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo or place them under UN control. "The threat of air strikes will be used again," Haekkerup told the daily DET FRIE AKTUELT. ``If we managed to force the withdrawal of heavy weapons from around Sarajevo, the UN and NATO are ready to impose new conditions, and there is a good chance they will be respected. "You can't deny that they (the Serbs) took the NATO threat seriously," he said. "The situation on the ground confirms that." The airport in the northeastern Bosnian town of Tuzla is held by UN troops but the Serbs have steadfastly refused to let it be used to fly in emergency aid. The Serbs have also prevented Canadian UN peacekeepers from being rotated out of the besieged Moslem enclave of Srebrenica in the east of the country. Also Monday, Danish Premier Poul Rasmussen said the United Nations had asked his government to divert to Sarajevo a column of tanks bound for Tuzla. Rasmussen, emerging from a meeting of the Danish Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, said the government had received the request during the night but had not yet decided whether it was going to reply favourably. He said the United Nations wanted the tanks to be on the outskirts of Sarajevo ready to intervene if the withdrawal of heavy artillery by the Bosnian Serbs did not go as planned. The 10 German-designed Leopard tanks, accompanied by 100 Danish soldiers, are already on their way to join the Nordic battalion in Tuzla from the south after being refused permission by the Serbs for some four months to go in from the north. Rasmussen said any change in itinerary would have to be approved by parliament. The chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Peter Duetoft, said "The United Nations is within its rights to divert our tanks temporarily, but their final destination remains Tuzla, where they will defend the Nordic battalion of around 1,000 men and contribute to opening up the airport of this besieged town." Rasmussen also emphasised Denmark's support for keeping up pressure on the Serbs. "Pressure on the Serbs should be maintained even if the risk of NATO air strikes on Serb positions is much less than a few days ago," he said. "In the longer term, one could imagine putting similar pressure on other towns in difficulty in Bosnia." He said he was glad that the NATO threat to launch air strikes on heavy weapons not withdrawn from a radius of 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) from the center of Sarajevo had been taken seriously, and "confident in the Serbs' inclination to keep their promises to withdraw all their heavy weaponry from around Sarajevo."
