In a statement to AL-HAYAH he said that these contacts are designed to arrange direct contacts between the ruling authority and detained FIS leaders, specifically Shaykhs Abbassi Madani and Ali Belhadj. Haddam added that all contacts ended with informing the various parties and brokers that "none of the FIS leaders can negotiate with the ruling clique separately, and the regime must recognize the Front's legitimate leadership and enable the detained shaykhs to meet with its shura council." Haddam, who currently lives in the United States, heads the Front's parliamentary mission, and was elected in the canceled elections, pointed to the existence of other new parties "which should be taken account of when the negotiations begin, namely leaders of armed action." A few weeks ago the Front announced its conditions for negotiation, not dialogue, as it prefers to call the process. These conditions included releasing the Front's leaders, enabling them to meet with the Front's shura council, and then holding negotiations in a neutral country. Haddam also denounced what he termed "the ruling clique's attempts to divide the Front's leadership by contacting illegitimate elements who do not belong to the FIS line." He added: "The regime tried to divide the Front before following the 1991 June incidents. It also tried to create an alternative leadership to the Front but its scheme failed, and any attempt to make contact with an illegitimate leadership is also doomed to fail." [passage omitted]
