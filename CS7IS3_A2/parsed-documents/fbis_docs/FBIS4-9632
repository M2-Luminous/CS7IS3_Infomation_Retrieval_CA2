In 1990 the VMRO-SMD [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Union of Macedonian Societies] was restored and he was its leader until 30 March 1992. He is married with two children and lives in Sofia. [Aneva] Mr. Gotsev, despite the position adopted by the Parliamentary National Security Commission, the Ilinden OMO [United Macedonian Organization] is thinking of holding its usual convention at the Rozhen Monastery. Is the Bulgarian Government helpless in this case? [Gotsev] The lack of any reaction by the Bulgarian institutions cannot be justified by ignorance, incapacity, or weakness in addressing this phenomenon. The Bulgarian people are clearly aware that people outside the country are forcing our politicians to tolerate this movement in Bulgaria. The so-called supporters of Ilinden appeared in public after 10 November 1989. They are dangerous and at the same time pathetic because, despite their conspiratorial origins, they are capable of destroying our age-old traditions. [Aneva] Who is responsible for our politicians' inaction? [Gotsev] Before 10 November 1989 everything came from Russia, which prohibited and refused us leave us to tell the truth about the Macedonian question because it had its own specific interests in the Balkans. Today, this factor no longer exists, but the same policy continues to prevail, perhaps in an even more arrogant form. Nevertheless, Serbian provocation on such a scale, which denigrates everything Bulgarian and declares that Bulgaria is an occupier, never occurred on our territory prior to 10 November. [Aneva] Where does VMRO stand in this situation? [Gotsev] I think that VMRO is paralyzed and is unable to affect these events. I cannot otherwise explain how a hostile foreign organization has appeared to supplant it in the territory where it is active. [Aneva] There are many VMRO organizations. Which is the true one? [Gotsev] There is only one VMRO, and that is the one formed by Gotse [Delchev] and Dame [Gruev, cofounders of the first Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization in 1894]; all the others -- about a dozen of them -- are false. They are formed by someone or other and then disbanded when their lords no longer need them. [Aneva] Were you replaced by a coup organized to change the line followed by the organization and to politicize it? [Gotsev] I was in hospital when the announcement was made that I had resigned. I think that this was arranged by foreign embassies, and not only one, but two or three. [Aneva] What do you think about the VMRO's intention to run in the next elections? [Gotsev] At the very outset, when the VMRO was restored, some people had daydreams about turning it into a party, but so far it continues to maintain that Bulgaria has enough parties, and anyone who wants to enter parliament can do so through them. Our movement is a national one, but has no political color. No one can close down the VMRO until it has completed the program outlined by Levski to protect and gather the Bulgarians in one place. [Aneva] Is it a realistic prospect that Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] may join Bulgaria? [Gotsev] I was one of the first to advise President Zhelev that we should recognize Macedonia. There was then a chance that Serbian troops would withdraw from there without a fight. A referendum was held in which 96 percent of the people in Macedonia declared for independence. Only a historian can appreciate what a great event this was; it is one of the great successes in our modern history. However, out of ignorance or for other reasons, the Bulgarian politicians failed to use this event to the benefit of our all-Bulgarian national cause. [Aneva] What should have been done? [Gotsev] During these last three years they should have done everything possible to make the border between Bulgaria and Macedonia a formal one. If one talks about historic chances, God gave us such a chance after 100 years. However, to use this chance the people have to be prepared, and we turned out to be completely unprepared. Macedonia needed to obtain diplomatic protection throughout the world, but we failed them. We ought to have three railroad links by now: from Kumanovo to Kyustendil, from Kocane to Blagoevgrad, and from Gevgeli to Petrich. We did nothing to stop the anti-Bulgarian propaganda there. [Aneva] It is your idea that we should have a minister solely in charge of Macedonian problems.... [Gotsev] Greece has a special Ministry for Macedonia-Thrace. Over 2 million Bulgarians from Macedonia live inside Bulgaria and there are about another 3 million outside. At least one person in the Bulgarian Government should know where Macedonia is and promote all good initiatives connected with Macedonia. Before 9 September [1944, date of Bulgaria's liberation in World War II], the government always included people with actual and emotional connections with Macedonia. At that time, almost 50 percent of the scholars and scientists in Bulgaria were from Macedonia, plus 50 percent of senior army officers, 50 percent of the higher clergy, and more than 50 percent of diplomats. Everywhere where it was necessary to defend the Bulgarian cause in Macedonia, the Macedonian Bulgarians were in the forefront. Accordingly, the Macedonian question was a Bulgarian one, and no one in the world doubted that it was anything else. At present, not a single Bulgarian in the state institutions and the top administration is publicly committed to the Macedonian cause. On the other side of the coin, during the last 50 years half the diplomats in Serbia came from Macedonia, and many people from Macedonia were recruited into their army, police, and all their higher state institutions. With the help of a few hundred Bulgarians from Macedonia whom it has bought, Serbia is holding Macedonia in subjection, deluding the people into believing that Macedonians in fact rule them. [Greek] President Karamanlis comes from the village of Brodi in Aegean Macedonia, and Papandreou's first and second wives are also Bulgarians from Macedonia. Formerly, when Venko Markovski, who is also from Macedonia, published a new poem, a note was always sent from Belgrade and the newspaper editors got excited. Serbia and Greece did not allow film footage of Macedonia to be shown in Bulgaria, and our authorities fulfilled their wishes without question. It is the same thing now. [Aneva] Nationalism is gaining quite good positions in Europe, so is it possible for the VMRO to play the nationalist card in Bulgaria? [Gotsev] Nationalism does not exist in Bulgaria; it was destroyed long ago and its sting has been extracted. Today the Bulgarians have need of much patriotism, and we have to know what policies we are pursuing, so as not to hate a foreign nation for no reason. Why should we hate the Serbs and Turks for exploiting our ignorance? [Aneva] Do you personally sympathize with Zhirinovskiy, and is a Bulgarian Zhirinovskiy possible? [Gotsev] I do not think such a person can appear in our conditions, but it is more than necessary for a Bulgarian to appear to put things in order. [Aneva] You mean a Bulgarian with a strong arm? [Gotsev] I am not talking about a strong arm, but about a Bulgarian who knows how to govern the state. It can be an individual or a government, but it is high time that someone rescued Bulgaria from this humiliating situation. [Aneva] Do you see any strong individual in either of the two main parties at present -- the SDS [Union of Democratic Forces] or the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party], or in any new party? [Gotsev] In the state they are in at present, I do not see anyone. There may be suitable individuals among them, but they should come forward. [Aneva] Who in Macedonia would offer his hand to them? [Gotsev] At the present, only culture and cultural links can bring us finally together. In Macedonia there is a strong intellectual movement that a month ago formed its own organization, the Movement for Cooperation Between the Republics of Macedonia and Bulgaria, and it will stage an official promotion in Skopje on 8 May. A similar movement is also being formed in Bulgaria.
