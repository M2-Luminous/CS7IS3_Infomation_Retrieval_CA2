FR940725-2-00080 FR940725-2-00050 On July 30, 1987, Respondent was indicted by the grand jury of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana on eight felony counts of violating 21 U.S.C. 841 for issuing prescriptions for controlled substances to the informant and the officer. On September 15, 1987, a superseding information was filed charging Respondent with one misdemeanor count of violating 18 U.S.C. 2 and 21 U.S.C. 844 by aiding and abetting the possession of Valium that was not dispensed in the normal course of professional practice or for a legitimate medical purpose. On September 17, 1987, Respondent pled guilty to the misdemeanor count, and the indictment was dismissed. On November 20, 1987, Respondent was placed on two years active probation, ordered to perform 250 hours of community service, fined $25,000, and ordered to pay a special assessment of $25. On March 29, 1988, the court denied Respondent's motion for reduction of sentence. On November 12, 1987, Respondent surrendered his DEA registration with respect to Schedule II controlled substances. Respondent testified that he was initially asked to surrender his registration in all schedules, but refused, believing that he was to retain his Schedule III through V privileges as part of the plea agreement, and that when he was later issued a registration in Schedules III through V, he understood it to be pursuant to the plea agreement. The administrative law judge found that the plea agreement specified that Respondent would surrender his DEA registration in Schedule II, did not refer to Schedules III through V, and explicitly stated that ``no other promise has been made or implied by or for either the [Respondent] or the [United States Attorney's Office]''. On March 5, 1993, Respondent filed a Motion to Enforce Plea Agreement in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, alleging that he agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor and to surrender his DEA registration in Schedules I and II in return for the Government's agreement to dismiss the indictment and forego forfeiture and administrative revocation proceedings. On March 10, 1993, the court denied Respondent's motion on grounds that the plea agreement was not ambiguous but, rather, silent as to Respondent's Schedule III through V privileges, and that if it had been the intention of the parties to preclude DEA from proceeding against Respondent's registration in those schedules, it could have been indicated in the plea agreement. The administrative law judge found that on July 22, and November 18, 1988, the Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners (Board) conducted a hearing on charges that Respondent's prescribing to the informant and the officer violated the Louisiana Medical Practice Act. On December 9, 1988, the Board issued a decision in which it found that Respondent's prescribing was for an illegitimate purpose motivated by financial gain. However, based on its finding that Respondent's activity was unlikely to recur in the future, the Board suspended Respondent's medical license for two years, stayed all but four months of the suspension and imposed terms of probation, including that Respondent not handle any controlled substances, that he obtain at least 50 hours of continuing medical education per year, and that he pay a fine of $5,000. On December 19, 1988, Respondent filed an Application for Rehearing, which was denied by the Board on January 5, 1989. Respondent then filed a request in state court for reversal of the Board's order or a remind for further proceedings. Following an evidentiary hearing, on April 29, 1991, the court remanded the case to the Board for issuance of a new decision. On June 20, 1991, the Board issued another decision making the same findings and imposing the same sanctions as the initial decision. Respondent again appealed to the court, which stayed the Board's order. The stay was still in effect as of the date of the hearing in this matter. Respondent admitted at the administrative hearing that he was ``lax'' with respect to his prescribing to the informant and the officer. Respondent also testified that the individuals paid him for their office visits, not for the prescriptions, and that the informant told him that she was nervous and had headaches. However, Respondent later acknowledged that the informant denied having headaches or tension, and that Seconal is not prescribed for headaches. Respondent testified that he believed that the informant and the undercover officer manipulated him. The Respondent further testified that the loss of his DEA registration would make it difficult to treat his patients, and to his willingness to cooperate with DEA in verifying compliance with the rules and regulations surrounding a DEA registration. Respondent presented the testimony of several witnesses as to his professional competence and concern for his patients. Included among these witnesses was a patient of Respondent, two psychiatrists, Respondent's brother, two of his sons, as well as his daughter-in-law. The witnesses testified to Respondent's exemplary character and his exceptional abilities as a medical provider; to the devastating impact of the criminal and disciplinary proceedings upon the Respondent; and to the unlikelihood that Respondent would abuse his controlled substance privileges in the future. However, the administrative law judge accorded little weight to their testimony since the witnesses did not appear to be fully apprised of the extent of Respondent's misconduct. Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4) the Deputy Administrator may revoke a registration and deny any application for such registration, if he determines that the continued registration would be inconsistent with the public interest. In determining the public interest, the following factors are considered.
