During a news conference upon his return from this important meeting, Poletto detailed some of the benefits obtained in the Uruguay Round, among which he stressed the tariff reductions Venezuelan products will receive in Japan (90 percent), the European Union [EU] (43 percent), and the United States (36 percent). According to the ICE president, the creation of the World Trade Organization [WTO], which will replace GATT in 1995, will offer our country guarantees. "We will be very much in the WTO, because if we are not in it, we will be left out of the world," he commented. Likewise, he stressed that Venezuela's entry into the WTO gives it the right to demand proof of direct damage to verify dumping claims before sanctions are imposed, including the verification of direct damage to local producers caused by dumping. On this issue, Poletto referred to the controversy that arose over Venezuelan steel exports, which he described as an "unjustifiable problem." To regain this right, Venezuela--together with the Andean Pact member nations--has promised to reduce tariffs on industrial products to 35 percent within five years. On the same subject, he pointed out that the WTO will eliminate the discrimination that has existed concerning dumping regulations, establishing safeguards, and resolving disputes. Until now the GATT decisions on these issues were not binding on member nations, as was proven by the ruling on the quota system imposed by the EU on Latin American banana exporters. Likewise, Poletto referred to the achievements obtained in the agricultural sector "in which tariffs became clear-cut." According to the agreements, approximately 30 products will receive a 40-percent tariff reduction based on the amounts imported between 1986 and 1988. In his judgment, this will allow the Venezuelan Government "room to make changes in agricultural tariffs to meet the country's needs." The ICE president will soon present the agreements signed in Morocco to Congress for its review and approval. According to his expectations, this procedure should be completed before January 1995, when the WTO will be created. Venezuela hopes to become a charter member of the WTO.
