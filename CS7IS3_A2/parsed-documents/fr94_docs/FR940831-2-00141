ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice publishes the ``Report to OPM on Living Costs in Alaska and in the Washington, DC, Area, June 1994,'' prepared by Runzheimer International under Government contract OPM&hyph;90&hyph;0705. DATES: Comments must be received on or before October 31, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send or deliver comments to Allan G. Hearne, Methodology Development Branch, Office of Compensation Policy, Personnel Systems and Oversight Group, Office of Personnel Management, room 6H31, 1900 E Street NW., Washington, DC 20415. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Allan G. Hearne, (202) 606&hyph;2838. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Sections 591.205(d) and 591.206(c) of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, require that nonforeign area cost-of-living allowance (COLA) survey summaries and calculations be published in the Federal Register . Accordingly, OPM is publishing the complete ``Report to OPM on Living Costs in Alaska and in the Washington DC Area, June 1994,'' produced by Runzheimer International under contract with OPM. This report explains in detail the methodologies, calculations, and findings of the winter 1994 living-cost surveys conducted in Alaska and in the Washington, DC area. The report presents only the results of the winter 1994 surveys. It does not cover the summer 1993 living-cost surveys conducted in Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The results of the summer 1993 surveys were published in the Federal Register on May 26, 1994. Reporting the summer and winter living-cost surveys separately allows OPM to adjust COLA rates where warranted in a more timely manner. Based on the winter 1994 living-cost surveys, Runzheimer computed index values of relative living costs in allowance areas using an index scale where the living costs in the Washington, DC area equal 100. (See the Executive Summary of the June 1994 Runzheimer report accompanying this notice.) OPM notes that the winter survey indices showed that the COLA rate for the Rest of the State of Alaska is currently set at the proper level but that the rates authorized for all of the other Alaska allowance areas are above levels warranted by the indices. However, the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act, 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;141), prohibits reductions in COLA rates through December 31, 1995. Therefore, OPM is not proposing any adjustments to the COLA rates in Alaska at this time. U.S. Office of Personnel Management. James B. King, Director.
