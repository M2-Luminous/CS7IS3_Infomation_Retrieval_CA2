During the meeting, President Kim said the nuclear issue ought to be resolved through dialogue. "But, if dialogue efforts fail to bring about any tangible result, there would be no way but to use the last card,' namely, a U.N. sanction," Chongwadae spokesman Chu Ton-sik quoted Kim as saying. Chu said the presidential position was readily agreed to by Secretary Perry. President Kim and Secretary Perry shared the view that the resolution of the North Korean nuclear question requires solid and close cooperative system between South Korea and the United States and that presently bilateral cooperation is in a satisfactory state. Secretary Perry said in particular that if the U.N. Security Council takes a sanction, it would apparently offend North Korea, adding his country is prepared to take full defensive steps in such a circumstance. A number of Korean and American officials were present at the Chongwadae meeting. They included Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Yi Yang-ho and Chief Presidential Secretary Pak Kwan-yong from Korea. Among the U.S. officials present were Ambassador James Laney and U.S. Forces in Korea Commander Gen. Gary Luck.
