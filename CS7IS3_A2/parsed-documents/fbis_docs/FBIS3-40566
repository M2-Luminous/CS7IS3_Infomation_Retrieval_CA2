According to this agreement China will provide Pakistan loans for purchasing defense equipment. There is no doubt that China is Pakistan's brother and friend. No agreement with such a great friend should surprise us. In the present situation, no two countries can be friendly or get angry at each other without the prior approval of world powers. Therefore, Pakistan's agreement with China is a good omen for us. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has been in office for about one and a half months. This is a major and significant achievement during this brief period and shows that the foreign office of the present government is active. China is an important country for supplying weapons to third world countries at reduced rates. The United States and other international powers are putting pressure on China to supply weapons only to the countries that are on the U.S. approved list, and not to the countries that the United States does not like. Still, China follows its own foreign policy despite suffering problems and losses in this context. He is trying to improve friendship with other counties, especially Pakistan, by offering them new defense agreements. No doubt this is a brave step on China's part and we cannot praise it enough. The United States accused China recently of supplying missiles and related technology to Pakistan, although both China and Pakistan have denied this accusation by saying that they had not violated any Missile Technology Contract (MTC). Similarly, the United States forced a Chinese commercial ship to stop in the Gulf while it was on its way to Iran loaded with commercial goods. The United States accused China of carrying defense equipment on this ship that came under international agreements. China agreed to let them inspect the ship to prevent the situation from becoming dangerous. This inspection proved that there was nothing objectionable in the Chinese ship; it carried general commercial goods. The United States also imposed restrictions on Chinese purchase of computers and other defense equipment. To ensure the success of their policies, the international powers not only put pressure on countries that supply defense equipment, but also put pressure on countries that purchase them. All agreements are successful or unsuccessful only after international powers have checked them using their dichotomous policies. Against this international background, this defense agreement will prove to be a glorious chapter in China-Pakistan friendship. The importance of this defense pact can be understood by the fact that General Ziang, commander-in-chief of Chinese armed forces, was present there. This agreement strengthens cooperation and friendship between the armed forces of two countries. We hope that during Benazir Bhutto's rule this great brotherly and friendly relationship between Pakistan and China at the levels of government and the people will continue to get stronger and stronger.
