The union's general secretary, Mr Peet Ungerer, said that at several mines, white workers had been threatened, assaulted and prevented from going to work. He said the union rejected the allegations of racism. It had been the custom for many years for workers with higher grades to be hoisted to the surface first because they had to discuss production reports with senior officials, he said.
