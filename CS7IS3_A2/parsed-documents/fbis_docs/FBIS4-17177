Vasiliy Vorobyev, chief of the Belorussian Supreme Soviet Information Department, refused me the right to attend a press conference given by the parliamentary opposition. The day before I had received an invitation from the press conference organizers to attend this event. However, my name did not appear on the list of journalists allowed entry to the Supreme Soviet to take part in the press conference. Mr. Vorobyev, who had signed this document, stated during a telephone conversation that he would not allow me to attend the meeting with representatives of the opposition. Clearly, the chief of the Information Department had learned how to divide journalists into "clean" and "unclean" back when he worked as an instructor of the Minsk party city committee. But people's deputies had a different opinion on this score: Thanks to them, IZVESTIYA was represented at the press conference. Its main theme was the signing by Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich of the agreement on the unification of the currency systems of Russia and Belorussia [Belarus]. Opposition deputies managed to obtain the text of the agreement only via Moscow: On various pretexts government officials here refused to provide parliamentarians with the document. It turned out that by signing his name to it Kebich had violated four articles of the new Belorussian Constitution simultaneously (or at least, that is what opposition members think). A group of deputies belonging to the Belorussian People's Front prepared an appeal to Mechyslaw Hryb, chairman of the Supreme Soviet, and Vasiliy Sholodonov, the prosecutor general, demanding that the prime minister be called to account under article 61 of the Belorussian Criminal Code (treason against the state). Opposition leader Zyanon Paznyak assessed this as a unique situation in Belorussia's recent past when a government surrenders its country's sovereignty in violation of the constitution. It was not hard to predict the opposition's viewpoint on this question. At the moment it is not entirely clear how Belorussian Supreme Soviet will qualify the premier's actions. To your IZVESTIYA correspondent's question of whether the republic's Fundamental Law tallies with the agreement on the unification of currency systems, Dmitriy Bulakhov, chairman of the parliamentary legislation commission, replied laconically: "Hardly." Mr. Bulakhov refrained from further comment since he did not have the text of the documents signed in Moscow. According to him, not one member of the Supreme Soviet Presidium had the agreement in his hands on Friday. At the press conference one of the articles of the agreement was cited which says that on the day that the document goes into force, the Central Bank of Russia will have the right and powers of the sole money issuing center. According to Article 145 of the Belorussian Constitution, the republic's National Bank has the exclusive right of money emission. This discrepancy automatically entails a violation of Article 8 of the Fundamental Law, which bans the conclusion of international treaties, which contravene the Constitution. Everyone is now deciding for himself just how far Kebich observed Article 1 of the Constitution, which says that the Republic of Belorussia shall defend its independence and pursue its domestic and foreign policy autonomously. The prime minister has indirectly acknowledged his guilt in public. At a press conference, Kebich, brandishing a copy of IZVESTIYA containing Mikhail Berger's article "Belorussia Has Exchanged Part of Its Sovereignty for the Russian Ruble," rejected the accusations of bartering away independence. But at the same time he remarked that alterations to the Republic's Constitution are needed in order to legalize the Moscow accords. In turn, opposition deputies told journalists that they had asked the prime minister this question: How could he sign an agreement knowing that it did not correspond to the Constitution? To which Vyachaslaw Frantsavich gave a highly original reply: He told the oppositionists that he was unaware of the existence of Article 8 of the Fundamental Law. The irony of fate is that Kebich was one of the people most interested in the very speedy adoption of that Constitution, which was successfully steered through parliament with the help of some dubious legal procedures. The prime minister is hardly threatened with sanctions from law enforcement organs that are under the full control of his own entourage. But there are two far more serious problems here: First, the legislature is showing an extreme degree of restraint when giving political assessments of the Moscow accords. Mechyslaw Hryb has stated that he does not support the idea of making alterations to the recently adopted Constitution. There is nothing surprising about that IZVESTIYA has already written about the differences of opinion between Kebich and Hryb, which began immediately after the election of the last chairman of the Supreme Soviet. Now, when the prime minister has embarked upon a fairly dangerous path, the speaker has been given his only chance of competing with him in the presidential elections. Whether Hryb will make use of that opportunity will depend largely on the political alignment before the elections. Moreover, the making alterations to the new Belorussian Constitution is no easy process. For that to happen the Supreme Soviet must twice discuss and approve the alterations over a period of at least three months. But in the six months before the deputies' powers lapse they do not have the right to revise the Fundamental Law. It is hard to say how much longer this Supreme Soviet has left since it has promised the voters early parliamentary elections in March 1994. But even if it lasts the full course (March 1995) there is only just enough time left. But it has even less time left before the elections. Because the prime minister's promises about universal prosperity resulting from the unification of the currency systems have begun to pall a little even on his admirers. Thus on the eve of the extraordinary session of the Supreme Soviet, scheduled to begin on 27 April, ways of circumventing the constitution are urgently being sought. Ivan Antonovich, a former secretary of the Russian Communist Party Central Committee, proposed in a speech on Belorussian television that instead of alterations [izmeneniye] to the constitution an amendment [popravka] to it should be adopted. The aim is clear -- to simplify as much as possible the process of adjusting the Fundamental Law to meet the needs of the government. But from the legal viewpoint, Antonovich's idea is absurd: The Constitution allows alterations to be made to it but there is no mention of the word "amendment" at all. The appearance on air of odious individuals such as Ivan Antonovich -- people left on the margins of Russian politics but who have been taken up by the Belorussian Government -- has become a lamentable tradition on Belorussian state television now. At first Antonovich was made rector of the Academy of Administration under the Council of Ministers, then director of a scientific research institute. If only matters had ended with Antonovich and his ilk expressing their viewpoint on this event or that.... But no, Russian democrats are regularly reviled on state television and direct insults are hurled at the Russian president and his team.
