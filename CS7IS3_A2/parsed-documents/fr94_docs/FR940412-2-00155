FR940412-2-00155 FR940412-2-00111 [Docket Nos. 50&hyph;498 and 50&hyph;499] Houston Lighting and Power Company (South Texas Project, Units 1 and 2); Exemption I On March 22, 1988, and March 28, 1989, the Commission issued Facility Operating License Nos. NPF&hyph;76 and NPF&hyph;80 to Houston Lighting & Power Company, et al. (the licensee) for South Texas Project, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, respectively. The license provided, among other things, that the facility is subject to all rules, regulations and orders of the Commission. II Pursuant to 10 CFR 55.59(a)(1), ``each licensee shall successfully complete a requalification program developed by the facility licensee that has been approved by the Commission. The program shall be conducted for a continuous period not to exceed 24 months in duration.'' Also, pursuant to 10 CFR 55.59(c)(1), ``The requalification program must be conducted for a continuous period not to exceed two years, and upon conclusion must be promptly followed, pursuant to a continuous schedule, by successive requalification programs.'' By letter dated December 17, 1993, as supplemented by letter dated January 14, 1994, the licensee requested a one-time exemption from 10 CFR 55.59(a)(1) and (c)(1) which would extend the current requalification cycle to April 22, 1994. Pursuant to 10 CFR 55.11, ``The Commission may, upon application by an interested person, or upon its own initiative, grant such exemptions from the requirements of the regulations in this part as it determines are authorized by law and will not endanger life or property and are otherwise in the public interest.'' III HL&P increased the operating staff from five to six crews to reduce the burden placed on the operating staff. The increase to six crews is in the public interest in that it will allow sufficient numbers of operating personnel to maintain individual workloads at a reasonable level while on shift without the need for routine overtime and still allow for continued uninterrupted training. The licensee began its six-operating crew, six-week requalification training plan in January 1994. Because of the additional crew, the current requalification cycle, which began on April 13, 1992, will continue until April 22, 1994. The extension of the training cycle is unavoidable in order to enhance the operations staff while maintaining adequate staffing levels. The exemption will allow the licensee to exceed the 24-month limit stated in 10 CFR 55.59 by ten days. IV Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 55.11, this exemption is authorized by law, will not endanger life or property, and is otherwise in the public interest. Therefore, the Commission hereby grants Houston Lighting & Power Company an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 55.59(a)(1) and (c)(1). Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of the Exemption will have no significant impact on the environment (59 FR 11330). This Exemption is effective on issuance. Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 4th day of April 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Jack W. Roe, Director, Division of Reactor Projects III/IV/V, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.
