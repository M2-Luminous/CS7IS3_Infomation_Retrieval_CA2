Ljubljana, 23 May--At this morning's meeting the Defense Committee, among other things, discussed a report from Minister Jelko Kacin on personnel changes in the Slovene "Pentagon." There are no longer many individuals in the ministry's leadership from the inner circle of former Defense Minister Janez Jansa and the coordinating group that prepared and conducted the country's defense within the army. If we can judge by Jelko Kacin's statements, the expected shifts will stop with the chief of the Republic Headquarters of Territorial Defense [TO], Albin Gutman. Specifically, approval from President Milan Kucan is required for replacements in the leadership of the General Staff. Colonel-General Albin Gutman was the commander of the provincial TO headquarters for Carniola, which is headed by Rade Klisaric. Along with some of Jansa's associates involved in the maneuvers structure of national defense, he is on the notorious list from Dossier 13. With the replacements of the provincial TO headquarters commanders--the last one was at the provincial TO headquarters for the southern coastal region--the list of expected replacements has probably been exhausted. Two politicians, however, think that the situation in the army is "extremely problematic." Janez Jansa is convinced that a political purge is being conducted at the Defense Ministry, while the former chairman of the Defense Committee, Zmago Jelincic, is of the opinion that Minister Kacin has no other choice but to clean up after his predecessor. "If he does not succeed, it is best to disband the army and rely on the police," Jelincic concluded in the latest SOBOTNA PRILOGA. Jansa criticized State Secretary Boris Znidaric, who came to the Defense Ministry after 23 years of service in the police leadership, of running the army like the police. Znidaric, in addition to two other state secretaries, is responsible for training, organization, and personnel in the Defense Ministry. The most radical changes, after Jansa's removal, were suffered primarily by the Moris First Special Brigade. After the replacement of Brigadier Anton Krkovic, the defense minister was not satisfied with its effectiveness. If we can judge by the experiences of foreign countries, one should not expect it to be disbanded, although even outwardly Moris is to be made equivalent to other Slovene army units. The disputes between the army's special brigade and the police have a political background, if we can reach a conclusion from the dramaturgy of the Smolnikar scandal, and they also originate from the conflicts and old grudges among individual participants in that operation. In fact, the agents in the spy scandal were employed by the First Special Brigade. The above conflict was most evident in the Defense Ministry's Security Service. Three heads of VOMO have been replaced in a six-month period. The departure of Andrej Lovsin at the peak of the war among the intelligence officers several months before the replacement of Janez Jansa allows different explanations. Dusan Mikus, who was replaced by Marjan Miklavcic, had to leave his job as director because of the Smolnikar scandal. A conversation lasting several hours between Jelko Kacin and Dusan Mikus about the top secret Bizjak report did not bear any significant fruit. Among the directors of the individual administrations, the only one to be dismissed was Janez J. Svajncer, who left as managing editor of the magazine SLOVENSKI VOJAK. The director of the Second Administration, Joze Zagozen, after talking to the parliamentary commission on the arms scandal, reportedly told the defense minister that after taking leave, he intends to resign from his position. The statistics, according to which the new defense minister, Jelko Kacin, appointed 15 new people in two months, while approximately as many people left the ministry, do not say much, since those figures apply to the structure of the Defense Ministry. More important is the political decision on how many soldiers and what kind of army the state needs, and there will undoubtedly be parliamentary discussions of this. The Assembly's decision on the defense tolar, i.e., investments in fundamental development programs over the next 10 years, which, after the personnel changes, will undoubtedly be the most important topic of polemics regarding the Defense Ministry, is only halfway toward building our own army. The dilemmas concerning Slovenia without an army, which several politicians recorded in the so-called "Declaration for Peace" in 1991, have not yet been surmounted, at least judging by the views of parliamentarians, in spite of the war and the fundamentally changed circumstances in our vicinity. For the time being, support for the army depends upon the control and influence of the ruling policy.
