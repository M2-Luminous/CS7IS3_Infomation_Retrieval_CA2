The massacre may harm the Palestinian Israeli peace talks. It illustrates the need to place the status of holy Jerusalem on the agenda of the Palestinian-Israeli talks. The horrendous slaughter of Palestinian worshippers led the Israelis to seal off the West Bank and Gaza and sent angry Palestinians marching into the streets. Ironically, more Palestinians were shot and killed by the Israeli army trying to quell Palestinian demonstrations. The shocking incident in which hundreds of worshipers were injured brought a cascade of protests from international circles, with many observers expressing fears that the slaughter, and the resulting anger among the Palestinians, would undercut peace efforts in the region. The Israeli Government ought to take all the blame for the attack on Palestinian worshippers in the Ibrahimi mosque. Egypt, a country that has a historic role in the region and that has been actively involved in the peace process, has strongly denounced the massacre in Hebron on the West Bank. Commenting on the atrocity, Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa stressed the need to combat terrorism, a scourge that has spread in numerous societies of variant religions and political doctrines. Musa said the massacre underscores the need to safeguard Palestinian, not just Israeli, security. Security claims, he said, are not the exclusive prerogative of Israel. Musa said that in view of the incident's ugliness and its grave implications for the peace process in the Middle East, Egypt will take part in any UN Security Council meeting convened at the request of Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat. 'Arafat has called for immediate international action to protect the Palestinians in the occupied territories. It seems that the urgency of the Palestinian, Arab, and international reaction has alerted the Israeli Government to the hideousness of the carnage. A senior Israeli official made a statement saying that the Israeli settlers would be wrong to think that such acts could obstruct the peace talks. Indeed, he said, the Israeli Government has no option but to accelerate the peace process, even if this involves further concessions to the Palestinian side. The incident demonstrates the drawbacks of Israel's policy on settlements. The incident should make Israel carefully consider removing the Israeli settlements from the Palestinian territories so that the peace process might remain on the right track. What particularly distressed the international community is that such atrocities inflicted by the Israelis on the Palestinians may lead sections of the Palestinian community to lose interest in talks with the Israelis under the current conditions, that is, as long as Israeli settlements and settlers are part of the deal. To conclude, let us state that Egypt, eager to maintain the peace momentum in the region, is holding intensive contacts with various sides to preserve a climate conducive to talks and eventually to peace in the region.
