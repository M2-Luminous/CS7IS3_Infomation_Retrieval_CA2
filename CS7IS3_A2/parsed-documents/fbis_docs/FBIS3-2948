In a report to the Security Council issued today, he said UNPROFOR needed extra 8,250 troops, 150 military observers and 275 police monitors. The council, in resolution 900 passed earlier this year, had asked the secretary-general to appoint an official to help restore normal life in Sarajevo, and to report on procedures to extend UN protection to the towns of Maglaj, Mostar and Vitez. The secretary-general said 2,200 of the extra troops would be needed in and around Sarajevo, 6,050 in central Bosnia, including Mostar and Vitez, and further 1,500 would be needed if the council were to extend the safe-area concept to Maglaj. He warned that UNPROFOR currently lacked the military resources to achieve its objectives and could lose the initiative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, despite numerous opportunities for progress. The secretary-general said UNPROFOR's mandate would have to be modified if member states did not provide the necessary personnel. "It would be a tragedy for the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina if the present opportunity were lost for lack of resources," he concluded.
