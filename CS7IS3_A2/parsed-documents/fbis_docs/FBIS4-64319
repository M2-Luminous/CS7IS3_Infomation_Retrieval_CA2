In a news conference in Ankara today, Kiratlioglu charged that Motherland Party leader Mesut Yilmaz launched efforts to create a transition regime in order to resolve the difficulties within his party arising from the fact that the party was defeated in the local elections. Noting that Yilmaz is suggesting new government models within parliament, Kiratlioglu said that these proposals are reminiscent of antidemocratic governments established in the wake of 12 March [1971]. These proposals are being raised for the so-called reason that the parliament should do something before solutions are imposed on it by others, Kiratlioglu explained, adding: Mr. Yilmaz is now a civilian revolutionary and is leading a civilian revolution. Claiming that Yilmaz wants to remain as his party's leader by creating a political crisis in the country, Kiratlioglu said that earlier Yilmaz also prepared the grounds for the current banking crisis by announcing that dollar accounts will be confiscated. Kiratlioglu declared that the plans to weaken the TPP will not succeed, the coalition government is standing upright, and democracy will certainly be victorious.
