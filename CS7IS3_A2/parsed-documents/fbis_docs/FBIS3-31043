The meeting is to discuss differences of views that have clearly taken shape within the past few days. Our colleague Renata Havranova, editor of the PRACE daily, reports: [Havranova] The extraordinary session of the HZDS national leadership is to decide today about the stance to be taken by the ruling movement on solving a serious political crisis in Slovakia--the crisis that was brought about by the HZDS itself, with some SNS [Slovak National Party] deputies, by obstructions in the [Slovak] parliament. Since early this morning, the Modra hotel has been totally closed to journalists. [HZDS] press spokeswoman Ivana Salczerova confirmed that Prime Minister [Vladimir] Meciar had taken the floor, as he had promised, to give his view on the Alternative of Political Realism formed in Papiernicka, which is being supported by nine deputies--one of the original 10 signatories has withdrawn its signature--and two government members, [Deputy Prime Minister] Roman Kovac and [Foreign Minister] Jozef Moravcik. Meciar is said to have described once again their appeal to immediately form a government of broad coalition without political heads as an immoral, undemocratic appeal contradicting the movement's principles. According to Meciar, the action taken by Moravcik and Kovac is a dirty trick, not only on him personally but also on the entire government and all of its members. This afternoon, journalists came across Jozef Moravcik walking in the streets of this little town. He confirmed to them that the discussion was very sharp and that all those who had joined the Alternative were probably going to be pacified by the [HZDS] leadership. He also said that a proposal was voiced asking him and Roman Kovac to resign. He is determined not to resign. According to Minister Moravcik, whatever decision is made at today's session of the leadership, there is no doubt that the shaping of views has already begun, and it is no longer possible to halt it.
