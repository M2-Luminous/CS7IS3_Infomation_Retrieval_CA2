During the Chiriqui province chapter of CADE [Annual Conference of Business Executives] '94, held at the Bambito Hotel, presidential candidate Ruben Dario Carles (for the National Renewal Movement, Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement, and Civic Renewal Party that comprise the Change '94 alliance) announced that he wants to establish a commission to promote investments and jobs, "so that local and foreign investors will not be lost like someone in the woods who doesn't know where to go." Samuel Lewis Galindo, presidential candidate for the Solidarity Party and the National Unity Mission that comprise the National Consensus Alliance, promised he would lower taxes on agricultural supplies to lower production costs. "We would do this also by supporting and promoting the appropriate producer organizations by giving them training and orientation, as well as any technical and financial support they may need." Christian Democratic Party presidential candidate Eduardo Vallarino said: "Not being prepared for economic aperture means certain death for the small production that still exists in primary and secondary sectors." Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential candidate for the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), Labor Party, and the Liberal Republican Party that comprise the United People alliance, announced that he would create "irrigation provinces [provincias de riego]." "Another element would be the development of business organizations." The candidates concurred on the need to decentralize public administration to expedite the autonomous development of provinces, to protect national production, improve the country's road infrastructure to and from Bocas del Toro and Chiriqui, and upgrade ports on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 28 February 94) Four presidential candidates -- Jose Salvador Munoz, of the Doctrinaire Panamenist Party; Eduardo Vallarino; Ernesto Perez Balladares, and Ruben Carles -- have said that the Panamanian Banking Center is solid and efficient, while acknowledging that it must undergo some reforms to consolidate its prestige at the national and international level. The candidates conveyed this position on 8 March at a meeting organized by the National Banking Association. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 9 March 94 p 1A) The Change '94 presidential slate presented unveiled its platform at a 3 March news conference. The plan "will promote the creation of more and better jobs in different sectors and improve the quality of current jobs, emphasizing different training and job education programs. It will maintain the 13-month bonus and continue paying workers their second allotment of the 13-month bonus," Carles said. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 3 March 94) A report detailing Carles' position on corruption highlighted the following points: As a result of the corruption that prevailed during the military dictatorship, the Panamanian state ended up "in the service of organized crime both inside and outside the country, particularly in drug trafficking and money laundering." Carles notes that this is why "the eradication of corruption will be a slow, difficult, and complex task, but a task that must be tackled." He added: "Public spending and the use of state property must be strictly and fiscally controlled." (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 7 March 94 p 10A) Papa Egoro Movement [MPE] presidential candidate Ruben Blades has said that now that the political campaign has gotten under way "the people will really have choices." In response to a reporter's question that his campaign seems to be faltering, Blades noted that his is a "new group, and we lack the economic means others have in the country's politics. Also our group has been organizing as we grow." (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 2 March 94) Ruben Blades has said that newsmen will not accompany him on his campaign visits because they work for news media "controlled by" political and economic "interests."

(Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 3 March 94) On 8 March, Gruber came out in favor of a new law on the banking system that would check money laundering. Regarding the U.S. military bases in Panama, she noted that it is the people of Panama who, through a plebiscite, must decide whether the bases should stay or go.

(Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 7 March 94) Galindo has unveiled a plan to decentralize the executive branch, giving ministries and autonomous and semiautonomous entities the authority to implement their own plans and projects. His plan calls for the creation of public security, tourism, transportation, communications, environment, and finance ministries, as well as a national secretariat attached to the Presidency. "We will get nowhere so long as we continue to not have a modern and agile government that facilitates investment by local and foreign citizens." (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 28 February 94) The National Consensus Alliance candidate has proposed the creation of a deputy minister's office to handle drug prevention, penalties, and rehabilitation.
