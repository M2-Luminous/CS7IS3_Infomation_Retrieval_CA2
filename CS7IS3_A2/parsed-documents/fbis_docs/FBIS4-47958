But the fighting has slackened off considerably from last week, when the corpse-littered city shook with the boom of mortar explosions as the belligerents shelled each other mercilessly. "It's been relatively quiet since Saturday," said spokesman Abdul Kabia contacted by telephone in Kigali. "We don't know whether the ceasefires are having any effect, but they have more or less stopped fighting for a while." One ceasefire that was to have started at midnight Saturday was signed by Rwanda's interim government last week. The rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front then signed another, supposed to have taken effect at midnight Sunday. But Western diplomats and relief officials in the region expressed doubt that either would staunch Rwanda's month-old bloodbath in which some 100,000 people have reportedly been killed. Diplomats said reports indicated that pro-government militias only loosely under the control of the government were responsible for most of the slaughter, targeting members of the minority Tutsi tribe that forms the backbone of the rebel movement and Hutu opposition supporters. The militias would not feel bound by a ceasefire, and would continue clubbing and hacking their victims to death, the diplomats said.
