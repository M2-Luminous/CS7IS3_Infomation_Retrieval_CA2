Maric: "Biljana Plavsic -- He Who Attacks the National Interests Will Inevitably Lose"] [Text] Banja Luka -- In a statement for GLAS SRPSKI, Biljana Plavsic, vice president of the republic of Srpska, among other things, touched upon the speech FRY President Zoran Lilic made at the congress of the Yugoslav Trade Union Federation in Novi Sad the day before yesterday. "Statements made by some SPS [Socialist Party of Serbia] officials or by some people belonging to the SPS, in which they advocate the need to give in to blackmail in the peace process are suddenly along the same line as the SPO [Serbian Renewal Movement] (perhaps one should not say suddenly, because similar things have been happening for a long time whenever the national question is discussed and when Serbs in Krajina and the republic of Srpska are concerned). In this respect, they do not differ from Vuk Draskovic who had said: `Send them there, let them live together with the Muslims.' And when Zoran Lilic says `we no longer want to be hostages to the Serbian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina,' he is only putting it a little differently. "Democracy suits the Serbian people, and I do not know how, with such views, it could endure the 50-year torture of an undemocratic regime. The Serbian people have a rich history and that helps it to survive on this Balkan wasteland. Therefore, all those people who attack the basic national interests will inevitably lose. Such changes will happen in Serbia as well, although everything is happening a little more slowly there. Things were happening in this way here, because we were thrown into events that occurred quickly and into dangerous situations. However, I am convinced that this will happen in Serbia as well," Biljana Plavsic concluded.
