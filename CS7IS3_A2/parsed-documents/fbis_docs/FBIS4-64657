With this meeting the newly elected head of government started off his political talks. During his 24-hour stay in Germany he will also meet with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who will host a dinner for Hata tonight. The main topics to be discussed will be Japan's one-sided foreign trade balance, and thus its relations with the European Union, with which Hata will have talks in Brussels on Friday. Before travelling to Bonn, Japan's head of government said in Paris that his country's trade surplus is unhealthy. Japan is the FRG's major trading partner in the Far East. The government in Bonn is likely to draw Hata's attention to investment opportunities in the new laender.
