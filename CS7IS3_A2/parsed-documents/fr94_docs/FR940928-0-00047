ACTION: Interim final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy (the Department) gives notice of an Interim Final Rule to establish test procedures for fluorescent and incandescent lamps, incorporating by reference test procedures adopted by the Illuminating Engineering Society (IES), American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Commission on Illumination (CIE). The Energy Policy Act of 1992 requires the Department of Energy to administer an energy conservation program for certain major household appliances and commercial equipment. Among other program elements, the law requires that standard methods of testing be prescribed for each covered product. Today's Interim Final Rule will put lighting test procedures in effect so that lighting manufacturers can meet the testing requirements imposed by the Energy Policy Act of 1992. DATES: This rule is effective October 28, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of October 28, 1994. Written comments (eight copies) in response to this notice must be received by December 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments (eight copies) are to be submitted to: U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Interim Final Test Procedures for Fluorescent Lamps and Incandescent Lamps, Docket No. EE&hyph;RM&hyph;94&hyph;220&hyph;IF, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585. Copies of the public comments received may be read at the Department of Energy Freedom of Information Reading Room, U.S. Department of Energy, Forrestal Building, Room 1E&hyph;190, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585, (202) 586&hyph;6020, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
