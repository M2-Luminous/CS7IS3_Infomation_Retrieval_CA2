SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Alexander Archipelago wolf occurs in insular and mainland southeast Alaska, from Dixon Entrance (U.S./Canada border) to Yakutat Bay, including all large islands of the Alexander Archipelago except Admiralty, Baranof, and Chichagof Islands. The subspecies may be threatened by elimination of habitat, reduction in prey availability due to the harvest of older forests, and disturbance due to increased opportunities for public access on expanded logging road networks.

In order to accommodate these parties, the Service is extending the comment period until October 1, 1994. Written comments may be submitted to the Service office in the addresses section.
