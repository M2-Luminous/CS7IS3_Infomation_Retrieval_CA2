And Advises the CIS Countries to Agree on Single Citizenship"] [Text] The Congress of Russian Communities [CRC] has presented President Nazarbayev with an ultimatum following an illegal arrest and detention of Boris Suprunyuk, a Russian Federation citizen who heads the Russian community of the Northern Caucasus. This was announced at a news conference yesterday by CRC Executive Committee Chairman Dmitriy Rogozin. Reproaching the Russian authorities for inaction, Mr. Rogozin said that unless Mr. Suprunyuk is set free by 1 June and the Kazakhstan leadership provides a reasonable explanation about Mr. Suprunyuk's confinement, the CRC will reserve the right to use "its own options" to secure the release of the political prisoner. The ultimatum, by Mr. Rogozin's admission, is a forced step because the search for other acceptable answers has led him "into a deadlock" and proved futile. The CRC leader noted that the Semirechensk Cossacks have already tried rescuing Suprunyuk with their own forces and that in principle mass protest action is possible any moment. Passing from the particular to the general, Mr. Rogozin described Crimea, Belorussia [Belarus] and Kirgizia [Kyrgyzstan] as former USSR regions most favorable for Russians. In all other regions, according to Mr. Rogozin, the Russian population is subjected to indirect or direct discrimination. Sharp criticism for inaction in protecting the compatriots who have found themselves abroad against their will was meted out to the Russian Government, its foreign policy department, and especially the Nationalities and Regional Policy Ministry, which, according to Dmitriy Rogozin, has done virtually no work under Sergey Shakhray. On the positive side, Mr. Rogozin made several proposals on CRC behalf. Russian lawmakers were invited as a matter of urgency to adopt a law on repatriates and also draft and approve "10 to 15 principles," guided by which, Russia could fulfill its duty before the Russian people living in the CIS countries. At this point the Russian communities' leader asked not to confuse Russians with "Russian speakers" among whose number Messrs. Nazarbayev and Shevardnadze were included. The Russian Government was advised to expand contacts with Russian communities, in particular work toward "most favored regime" being granted to Russian businessmen in the CIS countries. The CIS heads of state were urged to adopt a joint pact on dual citizenship or single citizenship for all CIS countries.
