The Speaker is responsible for house proceedings and routine preparation of questions for debate and for representing the Duma in relations with the President, federal and regional bodies, as well as with parliaments of other countries and inter-parliamentary groups. He also represents the House in any conciliatory procedure envisaged by the country's constitution. The House rejected a proposal from Kiril Ignatyev of the Russia's Choice faction calling to delete a clause on the Speaker's function of preparing questions for debate. The Duma has also reached agreement on how to elect Speaker of the House. The deputies rejected the option of a secret ballot, settling for the Council of Factions' proposal for two rounds of voting to be held instead. The names of two candidates who enlist more support than others in a straw vote will next be put forward for a secret ballot. The Duma has now begun nominating candidates for the post.
