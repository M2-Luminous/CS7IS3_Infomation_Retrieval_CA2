Your newspaper published a frontpage report on Saturday 5 March 1994 headlined "Abu-'Ammar [PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat] Orders Not To Retaliate" which says that sources close to the Hamas Movement told you that the Palestinian leadership hopes Hamas will not carry out any military operations at present, and that Hamas has halfheartedly responded to this request. We emphasize that this report is baseless and that all information contained in this report is a total fabrication. No contacts have taken place between our movement and the Palestinian leadership on retaliation for the Hebron massacre. Our movement's policy is clear and open. it calls for strong and decisive retaliation against the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and revenge for the martyrs' blood. Our position has always rejected the Oslo and Cairo agreements, and this fully conflicts with the published report. While we wish that you would check such information through contacting the known Hamas representatives in the future, we hope that you will publish this clarification in the same place in which that report was published.
