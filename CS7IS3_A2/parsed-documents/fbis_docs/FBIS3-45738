Hu and Bear Li] [Text] Washington, Jan. 21 (CNA) -- Tariff consultations between the United States and Taiwan ended successfully Friday [21 January] despite no concrete agreements being reached, according to chief Taiwan negotiator Haung Yen-chao, the director-general of the Board of Foreign Trade. Huang said that during the two days of meetings, the U.S. negotiators did not press Taiwan to immediately cut tariffs on 699 farm and industrial products by 50 percent, as they have previously requested. The United States may even consider sending officials to Taiwan next month for another round of talks on issues related to Taiwan's entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), he noted. The U.S. originally said that it would not talk with Taiwan about GATT issues until its tariff-cut request was met. Despite no timetable being set for the tariff reductions, Huang insisted the talks were "useful," and said Taiwan "must pay some price" sooner or later in order to gain admission to GATT. He added that relevant Taiwan government agencies would soon start studying the U.S. request. According to customs officials, however, Taiwan is likely to cut tariff rates for only part of the industrial imports. As for slashing tariffs on the 185 agricultural goods, "that possibility has been totally ruled out," the officials said.
