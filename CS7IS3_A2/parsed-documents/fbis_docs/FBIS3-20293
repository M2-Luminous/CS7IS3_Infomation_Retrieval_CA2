In a talk with Chinese Justice Minister Xiao Yang on Tuesday [29 March], Kinkel also pointed to China's responsibility as a permanent member of the UN Security Council. Pyongyang refuses to have its nuclear facilities inspected by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). At the meeting, Kinkel insisted on the observation of human rights in China, a spokesman announced after the meeting. The minister emphatically referred to a special human rights case in connection with the students' unrest of 1989, in which there has still not been any reaction despite repeated requests by Kinkel. The FRG Foreign Minister also advocated a "fair autonomy and the protection of the cultural, ethnic, and religious rights" of the Tibetans.
