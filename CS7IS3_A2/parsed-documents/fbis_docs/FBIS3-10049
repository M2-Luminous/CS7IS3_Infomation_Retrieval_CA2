The 500 workers also continued to collect signatures for a petition rejecting an adjustment bill, to be presented to trustee Juan Schiaretti on 20 March, that sparked violent riots here late last year. Union sources said that teachers were upset about differences in salaries paid to staff doing the same job. The sources added that there is no salary scale to go by in the province for teachers and other state workers. Teachers unions also said that the 20 percent bonus paid to teachers with more than 20 years on the job had been cancelled by the government here.
