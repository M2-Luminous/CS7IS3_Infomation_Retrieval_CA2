At the same time, he admitted that it would be hard to resist the pressure from the industrial and regional lobby especially after the inflation spiral was wound tightly in the last four months. Now it is beginning to unwind, forcing the government to pay off the debts which were not paid in November-December, Shokhin said. Even if former First Vice Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar decided to stay in the government, this process would continue anyway, he said. It is hard to imagine that under Gaydar inflation would be smaller in January-February than in December, Shokhin said.
