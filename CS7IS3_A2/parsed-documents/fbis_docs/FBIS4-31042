There were still "barely a few dozen in three pockets in the exclusion zone," he said. UN officials have called for a meeting here with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to discuss the presence of around 150 Serb forces in Gorazde. The Bosnian Government has demanded their complete withdrawal in compliance with an April 22 ultimatum as a condition for their attending the talks, called to arrange an overall ceasefire throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina. Late Thursday a UN military spokesman said the Serbs had made no move to withdraw from the exclusion zone, contradicting an announcement by UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi that they had begun their pullout. "There is no evidence at all that the Serbs are withdrawing," UN Protection Force spokesman Dacre Holloway said in Sarajevo. "Our information is that the situation is exactly the same," he said, charging that the armed Serb forces had merely donned civilian clothes and were pretending to be refugees while continuing to carry guns. Negotiations due to have opened Thursday were postponed when it became clear that despite pledges from Karadzic that they would retreat the Bosnian Serb units had remained in place. Akashi on Thursday evening said the Serb forces had launched their withdrawal. "I have received positive news," he told AFP. "They have started their evacuation, but there are still some places where they have not moved." Akashi's spokesman, Michael Williams, later added that about 100 policemen had left the exclusion zone before nightfall. The reports were flatly contradicted by Major Holloway in Sarajevo. "The police and militia are wearing civilian clothes," he said. "But they are still carrying guns. They took their police uniforms off and claim to be refugees."
