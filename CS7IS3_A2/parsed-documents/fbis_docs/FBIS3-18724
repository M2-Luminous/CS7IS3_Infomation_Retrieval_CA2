Exports of militarily relevant goods, that are subsidized by Bonn, have increased, according to a study by the International Economy and Development Organization. They tripled in 1993 compared with the previous year, reaching more than 2.2 billion German marks [DM]. Thus, Indonesia bought 39 ships of the former National People's Army. For the refurbishing, the Federal Government promises coverage of approximately DM699 million. For the purchase of submarines, Bonn guarantees another DM665 million. The delivery of MBB BO-105 and BK-117 helicopters to Argentina, Botswana, Swaziland, the Philippines, and the Czech Republic is also guaranteed by the Federal Government. How quickly armament export can become a problem is shown by the example of Argentina: Secured by Hermes guarantees, Germany supplied submarines to Argentina in 1977. Argentina later used one of these submarines in the Falkland war against Great Britain.
