How can we get out of the power shortage bottleneck that lasted over the past 23 years? We believe that a much more in-depth reform is required in order for us to take an extraordinary path. To take a so-called "extraordinary" path is to depart from conventional wisdom in order to achieve goals and objectives of a socialist market economy. We will have to be determined to deal with fundamental issues affecting the growth of our electric power industry. Major breakthroughs are needed in teaching new concepts, straightening out the production system, pushing for a standardized shareholder system, separating government from business and converting to a business enterprise structure, and establishing a modern electric power industry. Particularly, we have to intensify our macroscopic control to raise large sums of domestic or foreign capital to invest in power plants, accelerate the cost structure, improve our ability to repay debt, promote for conservation and efficient utilization, significantly improve the profitability of the industry, and further unleash the production capacity of the industry in order to create the condition for the electric power industry to grow in a healthy environment. Therefore, an "extraordinary" path not only implies a jump in quantity but also in quality, not only in terms of speed but also in revamping of mechanism. 1. Electric power industry will never get out of the bottleneck by conventional approach While the electric power industry can grow following our conventional approach in a developing nation such as China, it will never be able to catch up with economic needs and personal demand. In 1949, mainland China had a total installed capacity of 1,860MW and produced 4.3 billion kW of electricity annually. Since the founding of the present government and after 40 years of hard work, China ranked fourth worldwide in terms of installed capacity and annual power production in 1987. By the end of 1993, it is estimated that China will have a total installed capacity of 180,000MW that produces 800 billion kW of electricity annually. The amount of power generated in days now is equivalent to that produced in the entire year of 1949. Nevertheless, as the electric power supply increases, the power shortage is worsening in most regions in China. The constraint imposed by the power shortage is hampering our modernization effort. Areas that are prospering usually have the fastest development in power supply. However, those are often places of severe shortage. It is untrue that government has ignored the electric power industry in the past 40 years. Nor can it be attributed to lack of substantial investment. We should not underestimate the effectiveness of the management system overhaul in the past decade. However, in all fairness, these steps did not break away from the routine pattern of growth. Most of the reform policies and measures are based on the old planned economy system. Unavoidably, we are affected by the old framework and cannot possibly eliminate all the shortcomings in the old system. These shortcomings are preventing the electric power industry from taking a leading role. The deficiencies of the old system show up in the structure. Primarily, there is no separation of government and industry. The electric power industry is affiliated with the government. In a planned economy, macroscopic control is always subjective. This led to an insufficient level of investment in the electric power industry. The development was inadequate in scale. World Bank experts believed that a developing nation should invest more than 2 percent of its GNP in electric power. However, between 1980-1992, we only invested 1.24 percent per year. Past experience showed that the normal electric equipment to power generator capacity ration is 2:1. However, it has been far greater than 2 in China for years. Not only is the actual ratio greater than 2 but also the increment is more than 2. Second, energy conservation is never a priority issue. There are no policies and measures adopted and no energy conservation mechanisms and structures established. Society, as a whole, does not have a sense of necessity for energy conservation. This makes it difficult to promote energy conservation. A serious power shortage and a huge waste of electric power exist at the same time. Third, ownership is unclear and responsibility and authority are not consistently defined. Industry is a part of government and employees take industry for granted. For a long time, the government has been responsible for collecting and paying utility bills. Collection and payment are made by different branches of the government. Even after adopting a contract system, this has not changed. More than 90 percent of the profit of an electric utility goes into the treasury in the form of taxes and fees. On the one hand, the electric utility is situated between local and central government treasuries. On the other hand, industry does not have the ability to invest or borrow money. In other countries, some utility companies raise more than 50 percent of the funds for basic construction. In some cases, it is as high as 90 percent. In China, it is less than 5 percent. Because the electric utility is not a truly independent producer and operator, and there is no competition, the fact that the industry has an excessively large number of employees has become a major problem. The old system produced an extremely distorted price structure for electric power. It neither reflects its cost nor its supply and demand. This irrational cost structure made us ignore the fact that electricity is a commodity. The electric utility industry competes unfairly with other industries. There is no way to establish a fully functional business management mechanism. This not only makes it hard to raise money to invest in construction, but also hampers efforts to conserve energy and suppress excessive demand. It also makes it more difficult to reorganize industry to raise foreign capital to build more power plants. From the standpoint of the electric power industry, conceptually it has been bound by tradition for a long period of time. Its understanding of the market economy is lagging. Concepts such as market, competition, profitability, investment and output are weak and need to be reinforced. 2. Extraordinary development requires us to dedicate our efforts on deeper reform, mechanism conversion, structure optimization and improved profitability. As early as 1975, when Deng Xiaoping [6772 1420 1627] was in charge at the State Council, he stressed the need to speed the buildup of the electric power industry to meet the demand of a growing economy, and to leave some room for the unexpected. To implement Deng's instruction is the objective of the electric utility industry today. We plan to install more than 15 million kW of large and medium generator units annually between 1995-1997 and to add 20 million kW annually between 1998-2000. In addition to expanding our installed capacity, other issues related to power generation and power grid technology and education will be addressed at the same time. By the end of this century, our total installed capacity will reach 310 million kilowatts. Assuming a GNP growth rate of 8-9 percent and a reduction of power demand per unit product value of 8-10 percent, power shortage can be alleviated nationally. Every county will have power and more than 95 percent of the rural areas will have electricity. To accomplish this goal, in-depth reform and the taking of "extraordinary" steps are required. The "decision" adopted at the Third Central Committee Meeting of the 14th Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party signified that our economic reform had entered an overall, accelerated and coordinated phase. The recently held national economic workshop accelerated the pace of reform and introduced a large number of measures. It is an excellent opportunity for the electric utility industry to take "extraordinary" steps. To take advantage of this opportunity, the main strategy is that the industry must actively reorganize to a corporation structure and operate as a business. A corporation structure is a beneficial tool to build a modern electric power industry. The core is to build a modern electric enterprise system that can adapt to the need of a market economy, has a clear ownership, responsibility and authority, and separates government from industry, and is managed scientifically. The eventual outcome in a market economy is that the electric power industry must operate as a business. The core is centered around the concept of electricity as a commodity. We have to create a competitive environment and allow the industry to operate independently in accordance with laws and regulations. It will become an economic entity that is responsible for its own profitability, growth and control. This is also a way to standardize a shareholder ownership system. A shareholder ownership system is a better way to organize and operate a business that suits the needs of a product-oriented society and requires a great deal of investment. It is widely used around the world. It is an organization that also meets the basic requirement of public ownership in a socialist society and is an effective way for the electric utility industry to grow in an "extraordinary" manner. On the basis of the status and mission facing the electric power industry, it is far more urgent to try out the shareholder ownership system. The first objective is to convert the mechanism. The key to its success depends on how strictly standardization can be done. A standardized shareholder ownership system, in essence, must take our special situation into account. It has to follow the normal rules and regulations of a socialist market economy and our unique situation that production, supply and sales happen simultaneously. It must be consistent with the general requirements concerning shareholder ownership and obey the "20-Word" policy governing the reform and development of the electric power industry. It should fundamentally liberate the productivity of the entire power industry. In 1987, the State Council issued the following guideline and principle for the reform and development of electric utilities; i.e., separation of business and government, using provincial grids as operating entities, connecting all grids, centralizing power dispatching, collectively raising capital for construction, and taking individual special situations into consideration. In practice, this turns out to be an excellent guideline, consistent with our unique situation and existing pattern in the electric power industry. It systematically unveiled the approach to solve our power shortage problem in steps. In a socialist market economy, separation of business and government is a direction we must insist on in order to reform and develop the industry. "Using the provincial power grid as an entity to connect all power grids" is a product of the objective pattern in industry growth and actual economic management in China today. Essentially, it stresses that an inter-provincial or provincial power grid must be an independent economic entity. At the same time, it is also a collective body of mutual interest for a number of parties. "Centralized dispatch" is determined by the internal power production pattern. The complete concept should be "centralized dispatch and layered management." Raising money to invest in power plants is a major accomplishment in the reform of our electric power industry. To build up the electric utilities ahead of the game requires us to take full advantage of capital available both domestically and internationally. Fundraising must also be perfected toward a higher level, such as joint ventures and standardized shareholder ownership, within a socialist market economy structure. A standardized shareholder ownership is a better way to raise money to build up the industry. It is more powerful than making an investment or arranging a loan because it can effectively attract domestic and foreign funds. It can clearly sort out the ownership of a complicated production entity through a standardized shareholder system. Legally, it ensures a true separation of ownership and operating authority to protect the legal rights of the investors and the legitimacy of the operator. This move will help standardize the way investment in power plant construction is made and the way foreign investment is treated. It will facilitate the government to authorize other parties to operate its business to improve efficiency and thus secures the appreciation of existing nationally owned enterprises. "Do what is suitable to the occasion and place" is a principle we must follow in implementing the reform and development plan for the electric power industry. As long as we insist on being practical, we ought to be able to find a way to standardize the ownership of the local power grid to place the industry on a healthy growth track. Under the "20-Word" guideline, a standardized shareholder ownership may be in a variety of forms. However, regardless of the form, all participants must be voluntary. For example, in addition to a standardized shareholder ownership-based provincial power grid, with the approval of a higher authority, a number of power plants managed by investors themselves or by other industries may be allowed to operate in parallel on the grid as well. Nevertheless, they must sign an agreement with the power grid that protects their rights and specifies their responsibilities. Furthermore, on the basis of local economic growth conditions and with the approval of a higher authority in charge of electric utilities a more flexible shareholder arrangement may be experimented in a limited region, such as cities and counties along the eastern seaboard. This region may be called the electric utility "developing region." Hopefully, local governments will provide certain incentives to encourage power plant construction as well. Investors should take advantage of such incentives and invest more in power plant construction to produce a higher annual growth rate and create a mechanism for future projects. This is an important measure that will encourage an economically growing region to build up its own electric power and perfect its own power grid. 3. Strong leadership, daring experimentation and steady pace are required to march toward a standardized shareholder ownership system. After a decade of reform and open market policy, there is a solid foundation for a standardized shareholder ownership system. However, as a whole, our reform is still very primitive and unbalanced. Shareholder ownership should be experimented in more competitive and higher quality industries first to produce the desired results. The experience gained can then be used to guide the rest of the nation. Other industries must be patient to create the necessary conditions. We must proceed steadily and prevent a stampede. Industries that are earmarked as test points for shareholder ownership must rigorously follow the procedures and regulations issued by the government and proceed step by step according to plan. On the basis of the "20-Word" policy and the "suitability to occasion and location" principle, an industry must find a format that suits its specific situation. The focal point is to study the organization of the shareholder structure. Every electric utility must have a solid organization as a modern business. The organization must function perfectly for the purpose of conducting business. We must make sure that the State Council set aside a certain amount of our national infrastructure investment fund for a national electric utility industry corporation as its capital in order to strengthen its ability to borrow money elsewhere. It will be part of the power grid construction fund that will be loaned to the electric utility corporation to build key grids. It will handle the borrowing, repayment of principal and interest, and the construction and management of key power grids. Key power grids must be 100-percent controlled by the electric utility corporation and loans will be directly obtained from the national development bank. Existing government-owned capital in electric utility needs to be liquidated. For example, after adopting a price structure that pays back principal and interest, the money collected should be reinvested in other projects managed by the industry. Existing and added capacity of the power grid must be managed by the electric power industry. Investment in large key power plants built for peak-saving and load leveling, including water pumping storage power plants and nuclear power plants, should be made by the electric utility corporation with government funds so that the utility company can effectively control and directly manage such plants on behalf of the government. On this basis, a national electric utility corporation should be established. We must insist on the principle of having a single grid control system and many electric utility companies. Under the premise that safe operation of the grid is ensured, other internal standardized shareholder ownership systems may be explored. Domestic and foreign investors will be encouraged to build power plants either with controlling interest or as a shareholder. However, investment and loan must be separated. If it is an investment, then it is entitled to dividends. If it is a loan, then its principal and interest should be repaid. The investor has an option to choose. In the next seven years, the electric power industry needs $25 billion. This corresponds to importing 45 million kW of equipment. To this end, in addition to loans obtained from foreign governments, international monetary agencies and commercial credits, it is also necessary to attract direct foreign investment, free up tied-up capital and encourage joint ventures and other collaborative effort to construct more power plants. We have to establish and perfect rules and regulations that govern the use of foreign investment on power plant construction and strengthen our control over this matter. Our own national interest should always come first. We must provide solid leadership and rigorous supervision to make sure that risks are shared. We should avoid paying an excessively high or a fixed rate of return to put us in a disadvantageous position. Reform is the driving force behind liberation and development. In order to liberate and develop the output of the electric utility industry to put it in the lead, we must fully mobilize the resources in our central and local government. This is the key to a successful reform. To realize such an "extraordinary" growth in the electric utility industry, and to better serve our economy, we must work together as a whole under the leadership of the Party Central and the State Council and be persistent until our objectives are met.
