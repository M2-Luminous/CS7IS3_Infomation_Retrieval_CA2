Comment is solicited as to whether these proposed amendments address the procedural and timing concerns of issuers listing debt securities on a national securities exchange. 36 Proposed amendment to Rule 12b&hyph;7. E. Reporting Today's proposals do not exempt listed debt securities from registration and reporting under the Exchange Act. Companies that list their debt securities for trading in the public market will still have to provide annual, quarterly, and current reports. This raises the question as to the need for similar requirements for issuers with substantial amounts of debt securities traded in the OTC market. When Congress amended the Exchange Act in 1964 to add Section 12(g), it extended registration to the OTC market for the first time. However, the 1964 amendments focused exclusively on issuers of equity securities. No comparable provision was provided for debt securities that are traded in the OTC market. This difference in regulatory treatment was not based on a policy decision that current financial information is not important to the market. Rather, the decision appears to have been based, at least in part, on the nature of the debt securities market in 1963. At that time, it was considered unnecessary to extend registration to debt securities trading in the OTC market, as it appeared that a company that had a significant amount of debt securities outstanding would probably meet the Section 12(g) threshold with respect to its equity securities. 37 37 1963 Special Study, supra note 27, at n.55. Specifically, in its 1963 Special Study, the Commission cited the results of a questionnaire it used in, among other matters, determining whether debtholders independently needed the protections of Section 13, 14, and 16 of the Exchange Act. 38 The questionnaire sought information about outstanding debt securities, face dollar amount, and number of holders. While acknowledging the small number of respondents to the questionnaire, the Commission found that of 218 issuers that responded, only 58 would not have incurred a reporting obligation. 39 Of these issuers, 45% had less than $250,000 face amount of debt securities outstanding, 60% less than $500,000 outstanding, and 76% less than $1,000,000. 40 The Commission concluded that the proposed Section 12(g) equity threshold would make financial reports publicly available to a large majority of debtholders. Furthermore, the aggregate sums lent by issuers that would not be subject to any reporting obligation tended to be modest. Thus, the 1963 Special Study recommended to Congress that Section 12(g) not apply to debt securities. 41 38 Id. 39 Publicly available financial information would have been available for 160 issuers that would have met the proposed Section 12(g) threshold requiring registration of their equity securities. Id. 40 Id. 41 Id. The Commission also noted that Section 314(a)(1) [15 U.S.C. 77nnn(a)(1)] of ``[t]he Trust Indenture Act of 1939 gave the Commission power to require companies which qualify indentures under it, but are not otherwise under a statutory duty to report under the provisions of Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act, to comply with such of the reporting requirements of section 13 as the Commission might prescribe.'' 1963 Special Study, supra note 27, at 6. In the 1980s, the issuance of debt securities in both private placements and public offerings began to increase dramatically. 42 In addition, the increasing use of leveraged buyouts that concentrated equity ownership below Section 12(g) thresholds resulted in a number of companies with significant outstanding debt securities that are not reporting companies. Concerns have been expressed about the lack of information being available to the market regarding the issuers of some of these securities. 43 In the case of privately placed debt securities traded in the OTC market, no registration or periodic reporting under the Exchange Act is required. Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act 44 requires reporting by issuers that make a registered offering of equity or debt securities, but permits companies to suspend their reporting obligations after one year when a class of securities are held by fewer than 300 record holders. 42 Federal Reserve Bulletin, Vol. 68.12&hyph;79.3 (December 1982&hyph;March 1993). 43 See generally, Jereski, ``None of Your Business,'' Forbes (April 29, 1991) at 68; Norris, ``Market Place_When Companies Conceal the Facts,'' The New York Times (September 14, 1990); Jereski, ``Now You See the Junk, Now You Don't,'' Business Week (April 2, 1990) at 40; Colloton, supra note 26.

The court held that absent specific provisions in the indenture, Section 314(a) of the Trust Indenture Act would not compel production of financial and other information by the non-reporting company to its trustees. 44 15 U.S.C. 78o(d). As applied, most issuances of debt securities are viewed as separate classes of debt. Therefore, it is not uncommon for a company that sells registered debt securities not to have a 15(d) reporting obligation after its first year. While there may be more than 300 holders of record for all the registered debt of a company, it is not uncommon that there are fewer than 300 holders of record for any one issue. The staff of the Division of Corporation Finance recently examined information on companies that had more than 5 million dollars of debt securities outstanding to determine whether the companies were reporting with the Commission. The staff concluded that there are at least 200 non-reporting issuers, with over $47 billion of debt securities outstanding. 45 It appears appropriate to determine whether the nature and size of the debt market has sufficiently changed since the 1960s such that continuous reporting by issuers with significant amount of debt securities may now be warranted. 45 The staff believes that these statistics are understated since non-reporting companies often consider their financial and operating information proprietary.
