FBIS4-14056 "drnes080_m_94005" FBIS-NES-94-080 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 JORDAN Al-Majali on Citizenship, al-'Aqabah `Siege' Al-Majali on Citizenship, al-'Aqabah `Siege' JN2504181094 Amman PETRA-JNA in Arabic 1525 GMT 25 Apr 94 JN2504181094 Amman PETRA-JNA Arabic BFN [Text] Amman, 25 Apr (PETRA)--Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali has stated that there is no political dimension in the call of His Highness Prince Hasan, the regent, for reconsidering the valid procedures for the residence of West Bank citizens in the kingdom. He added that this procedural issue was aimed at facilitating measures for citizens arriving and departing across the bridges because of the growing pressure on state organs at the bridges. Thousands of citizens, he said, cross the bridges every day. During his meeting with the representatives and correspondents of Arab and foreign news agencies and newspapers accredited in Jordan, Dr. al-Majali asserted that nothing decisive and final has been issued so far regarding the siege of al-'Aqabah. The prime minister denied that there were U.S. conditions for lifting the siege on the Port of al-'Aqabah, noting that Jordan has announced that it will send a very low-level delegation to the multilateral negotiations to express its dissatisfaction with the contradiction between the objectives of the multilateral negotiations, which have economic and social aims in the region, and the maintenance of a siege or punitive measures on one of the parties. This, he said, will destabilize the national economy that should be improved as a result of these negotiations. The prime minister appealed to the fraternal Arab countries to reschedule their political differences just as they reschedule their economic debts. He also said that the recent accelerating events in the region, particularly the Hebron massacre and the situation in the Port of al-'Aqabah, have contributed to halting the peace process, pending positive signs on outstanding issues. He added that Jordan's decision to enter the negotiations had nothing to do with the siege of al-'Aqabah but was due to Jordan's firm strategy toward peace. Jordan, he added, was among the states that first carried the torch of peace in this region. Following are the proceedings of the prime minister's meeting: Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali has said that there is no political dimension in the call of His Highness Crown Prince Hasan, the regent, for reconsidering valid procedures for the residence of West Bank citizens in the kingdom, adding that it is simply a procedural issue at the bridges and the kingdom's other border points. The continued pressure at the bridges makes it incumbent on the state organs to change and improve many of these routine procedures. He added that are no procedures and instructions that can satisfy everybody and cover every case. Therefore, an issue requiring certain measures emerges from time to time and new developments have to be considered. Speaking about what is new concerning the al-'Aqabah siege, the prime minister said that so far no decisive and final decision has been made on this issue. However, he noted, there is an inclination to remove this cloud and that the preparations for that are underway. Perhaps a statement on this issue will be made following His Majesty King Husayn's meeting with the U.S. secretary of state. If the situation remains the same, then the Jordanian stand is clear. We have announced that our representation at the multilateral negotiations will be minimal as an expression of how we feel toward the contradiction between the objectives of the multilateral negotiations, which have economic and social aims in the region, and the maintenance of a siege or sanctions on one of the parties, which will destabilize the national economy that these negotiations seek to improve. Speaking about the options Jordan presented as solutions to the al-'Aqabah siege, the prime minister said that Jordan proposed that a nonpolitical and nonprofitmaking party carry out observation rather inspection operations at the Port of al-'Aqabah while Jordanian customs personnel inspect the containers which arrive on board the ships. He added that the recommended party is Lloyd's Register, whose task will be confined to observation and inspection of shipping documents. It will then present reports to responsible parties on the implementation of resolutions which deal with sanctions on Iraq. He said that Jordan made it very clear that it will not allow any foreign party whatsoever to encroach on Jordan's sovereignty over its own soil. Al-Majali said this in response to reports that Jordan had agreed to replace naval inspections by U.S.-led multinational forces with ground inspections. He noted that the United States had made inquiries about parties to carry out inspection operations and that it presented a report to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who may brief His Majesty King Husayn on some details and recommendations of this report during their anticipated meeting later today. He said that the U.S. side had almost accepted this Jordanian proposal and that the details concerning the action plan and the financing of this party are currently under discussion. Al-Majali noted that Jordan had explained to the international quarters its stand that al-'Aqabah is Jordan's gate to the world and not to Iraq only. He added that if the alliance forces want to make sure that Jordanian goods are not being exported to Iraq, then inspection and observation should take place at the Jordanian-Iraqi borders.
