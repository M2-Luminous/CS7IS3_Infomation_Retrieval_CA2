However there are no plans to sign the program during his visit. Interfax learned this from Yuriy Ushakov, the chief of the European Cooperation Department of Russia's Foreign Ministry. According to him, the issue of Russia's joining the Partnership For Peace program is still being considered. "At the moment it's hard to say what time interdepartmental discussions will take. Neither has it been decided in what form Russia will submit its considerations concerning its joining NATO's Partnership For Peace program," he said. "At first we would like to discuss with NATO the content of our relations, and settle the issue of joining the Partnership program in one way or another only afterwards." When asked whether Moscow intends to receive guarantees that upon signing the program Russia will not find itself in a position of NATO's "junior partner", Ushakov said "Yes". "We want to discuss the entire format of our relations with NATO in advance," he said. As Interfax's interviewee said, Moscow is deciding "when and in what form it will submit to NATO its presentation document which concretizes the possible directions of interaction between Russia and NATO in the framework of the Partnership For Peace program." When asked about NATO's reaction to the cancellation of Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's visit to NATO's headquarters in Brussels planned for April 21 because of the developments in Bosnia, Ushakov said: "NATO's program says that a potential partner decides on its own when to sign the document and on what level. For Russia it is not important whether it will be the fifth, sixth, or fourteenth to join the Partnership program. What is important to us is to make this partnership meaningful in real terms."
