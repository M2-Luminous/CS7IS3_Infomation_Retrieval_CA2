FR941116-0-00048 FR941116-0-00010 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION 17 CFR Parts 200 and 240 [Release No. 33&hyph;7110; 34&hyph;34952; IC&hyph;20691; File No. S7&hyph;5&hyph;93] RIN 3235&hyph;AF85 Securities Transactions Settlement AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission. ACTION: Final rule; change of effective date. SUMMARY: On October 6, 1993, the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') adopted Rule 15c6&hyph;1 (17 CFR 240.15c6&hyph;1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which establishes, effective June 1, 1995, three business days as the standard settlement time frame for most broker-dealer trades. In order to provide for an orderly conversion to three business day settlement, the effective date of Rule 15c6&hyph;1 has been changed. EFFECTIVE DATE: The regulation published on October 13, 1993, 58 FR 52891, will now be effective on June 7, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jerry Carpenter, Assistant Director, or Christine Sibille, Senior Counsel, at 202/942&hyph;4187, Office of Securities Processing Regulation, Division of Market Regulation (``Division''), 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Mail Stop 5&hyph;1, Washington, D.C. 20549. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On October 6, 1993, the Commission adopted Rule 15c6&hyph;1 1 which establishes three business days after the trade date (``T+3'') instead of five business days (``T+5'') as the standard settlement time frame for most broker-dealer securities transactions. As adopted, Rule 15c6&hyph;1 was to be effective June 1, 1995. 1 17 CFR 240.15c6&hyph;1 (1994). After discussions with representatives from the securities exchanges, the clearing agencies, the National Association of Securities Dealers, and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, it was determined that implementation should be moved from June 1, 1995, to June 7, 1995, in order to minimize any potential disruption resulting from the conversion to a T+3 settlement environment. It has been decided that the most efficient method of converting to a T+3 settlement time frame is to have trades executed on Friday, June 2, 1995, settle five business days later; trades on Monday, June 5, and Tuesday, June 6, settle four business days later; and trades executed on Wednesday, June 7, 1995, the new effective date for Rule 15c6&hyph;1, settle three business days later. This process will result in two double settlement days ( i.e., days in which trades from two trade dates will settle). Trades from June 2 and June 5 will settle on Friday, June 9, and trades from June 6 and June 7 will settle on Monday, June 12. By moving the conversion to T+3 settlement from June 1, 1995, to June 7, 1995, the two double settlement days will be split by a weekend. This will provide an opportunity for broker-dealers to make any necessary adjustments to their systems should any problems develop during the conversion process. Furthermore, by moving the effective date to June 7, implementation will not take place at the same time as heavy systems usage that is expected to occur from the processing of interest and dividend payments (interest and dividend processing are typically times of extensive systems usage). By the Commission. Dated: November 9, 1994. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;28266 Filed 11&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 8010&hyph;01&hyph;M
