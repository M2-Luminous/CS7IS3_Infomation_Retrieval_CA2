Chen Huanyou, secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial CPC Committee, gave an important speech at the meeting. Sun Han, chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial CPPCC Committee, delivered the work report of the Seventh Jiangsu Provincial CPPCC Committee Standing Committee at its request. Chen Huanyou said: The second session of the seventh provincial CPPCC committee is an important meeting held at an important juncture when Jiangsu is restructuring its economic system in accordance with guidelines laid down by the 14th National Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. The meeting will be significant for mobilizing all CPPCC organs and members, democratic parties, industrial and commercial federations, mass organizations, and people of all walks of life in Jiangsu to achieve greater successes in CPPCC operations and to expedite Jiangsu's reform, opening up, and modernization. On behalf of the Jiangsu Provincial CPC Committee, he warmly congratulated the session and extended his cordial regards to all CPPCC members, all CPPCC organs, democratic parties, industrial and commercial federations, mass organizations, and people of all walks of life in Jiangsu. After briefly reviewing the fruitful results which Jiangsu achieved last year in seizing opportunity, deepening reform, and opening up wider to the outside world, as well as simultaneously promoting a material civilization and socialist ethics, Chen Huanyou pointed out: These successes are the results of the hard work done by the vast number of cadres and people in Jiangsu--including all CPPCC organs, democratic parties, industrial and commercial federations, mass organizations, and people of all circles--under the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council. CPPCC organs at all levels in Jiangsu and the vast number of CPPCC members have played an important role in the overall development of Jiangsu. Chen Huanyou also pointed out: 1994 is a very crucial year for expediting reform, opening up, and modernization in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the 14th National Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. Seizing the opportunities, deepening reform, opening up wider to the outside world, expediting development, and ensuring stability are requirements of overall importance set for the entire party and the entire country by the CPC Central Committee. Work in all quarters must obey and serve these requirements. While doing our work, we must fully adhere to the general policy set for accomplishing this year's assignments, and must pay special attention to properly handling the relationship between reform, development, and stability. This year's assignments are formidable. Under such circumstances, people's political consultative organs are important organs for multiparty cooperation and political consultations under the CPC leadership, as well as important avenues for fostering a socialist democracy. We must improve CPPCC operations and make this year's assignments successful by continuing to unite all forces which can be united and by mobilizing all positive factors. Chen Huanyou urged the provincial CPPCC committee to do three things. First, achieve a consensus of view by thoroughly studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the "decision" made by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. To promote unity and cooperation among member units and people of various circles, to properly perform their basic political consultative and democratic supervisory duties, and to attain a higher level of participating in administration and state affairs discussion, members of the provincial people's political consultative committee must thoroughly study and comprehend the theory and decision until a consensus of views and common understanding have been achieved. Second, members of the provincial CPPCC committee must earnestly perform their basic political consultative and democratic supervisory duties so as to contribute to Jiangsu's reform, opening up, and economic construction. The provincial CPPCC committee must organize and mobilize its members to investigate, inspect, and discuss decisions in a planned manner as well as come up with ways and means for reform, opening up, economic construction, social development, and other major issues. The provincial CPPCC committee must make active efforts to promote the development of science and technology, education, culture, health, sports, and other social services; it must contribute its wisdom and strength to Jiangsu's socialist spiritual construction. During the course of improving party conduct, promoting administrative ethics, and fighting corruption, the provincial CPPCC committee must intensify its supervision. In safeguarding social stability, it should actively assist party committees and government departments in handling all types of contradictions among the people and in dissolving all factors of instability so that stability and political unity can be maintained. Third, the provincial CPPCC committee must foster democracy and unite more closely so as to consolidate and develop the patriotic united front. As reforms continue to deepen, a stronger and broader patriotic united front has become even more essential for expediting economic construction. This is an important mission placed on the shoulders of the people's political consultative organs during the new period. While doing its work, the provincial CPPCC committee must foster democracy, unite more closely, and display the spirit of providing democratic consultations. It should give full scope to the roles played by all democratic parties, industrial and commercial federations, and mass organizations. It should strive to create a democratic, united, and harmonious environment, and to unclog and broaden all democratic channels. To promote the great cause of the motherland's peaceful reunification, it should also strive to broaden the patriotic united front overseas. In conclusion, Chen Huanyou stressed: The party must provide stronger leadership over CPPCC organs. Party committees at all levels must do an even better job in upholding all rules governing political consultations and democratic supervision. Meanwhile, they should actively create conditions essential for CPPCC members to participate in administration and state affairs discussion, and should give CPPCC organs the support they need for carrying out their projects so that CPPCC organs can give a broader scope to their roles. In his report, Sun Han pointed out: Since the seventh provincial CPPCC Standing Committee began operating a year ago, it has, under the leadership of the Jiangsu Provincial CPC Committee, extensively rallied all democratic parties, mass organizations, patriots without party affiliation, and representatives of various circles in Jiangsu; organized and guided members to earnestly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as the guidelines laid down by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; actively carried out political consultations and democratic supervision, centering around Jiangsu's reform, opening up, and modernization; actively established relations with friends overseas for the motherland's reunification; continued to collect cultural and historical material; and strengthened itself so that its members can function more effectively as a whole. All this shows the provincial CPPCC committee has achieved new success in consolidating and developing the patriotic united front; in expediting Jiangsu's reform, opening up, and modernization; in building a better socialist democratic and legal system; and in promoting the peaceful reunification of the motherland. Speaking on projects for 1994, Sun Han stated: In accordance with the basic policy of the party and the state, as well as the provincial party committee's planning, we will continue to organize and guide our members to study the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" and the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th National CPC Congress; will follow through with the "decision" made by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and actively carry out consultative and supervisory activities, centering around economic construction; will establish stronger relations between members of the provincial CPPCC committee and people of all walks of life in society; will actively carry out theoretical studies about operations of CPPCC organs; and will continue to build CPPCC organs into stronger bodies. I hope CPPCC organs at all levels and their members will work with one heart and mind, make concerted efforts, and make greater contributions to achieving the grand objectives set for Jiangsu's reform and development.
