In a statement after his meeting with Boucher, which lasted for nearly 60 minutes, Denktas said that he briefed the ambassador on the latest developments. [Begin Denktas recording] We briefed the ambassador on the latest developments. Naturally, the United States regards itself as being closely concerned with the matter because it has significant influence in the UN Security Council, that is, together with Britain. They insisted that a result be achieved by the end of the month. However, we must not be held responsible for the delay in the process, that is, if a delay is in question. The main reason for that is the recent move made by the UN officials to put forward matters that were neither included in the package nor related to it and to refuse to have them discussed. Those matters have to do with our security. Therefore, we insist on discussing them. A tangible form has not yet been given to the promises that were made to us at the beginning; that is, the promises that were made in the reports drawn up by the experts. We have been informed that we should sign the agreement because a tangible form will be given to them. However, a tangible form must be given to the promises that have been made about our rights for me to say yes to the package and have it approved by the Republican Assembly. That is necessary and inevitable. In no way can I inform the Republican Assembly that we will place Maras [Varosha] under UN jurisdiction and that the work on the rights that will be given to us will be maintained and we will gain those rights in the near future. Negotiations cannot be held like that. The proposal for the demilitarization of an area to the south of Maras, an area which is under our control, concerns our security. That is a new factor that is not related to the package. That matter has been brought up as a new issue, regardless of the fact that we have been informed by the highest official that that area will remain under our control and our security will not be threatened. There are several other issues to be discussed. We are ready to maintain the talks if they also wish to do so. However, if they wish to find alternatives, then they need time to do so. We cannot agree to a process of negotiations in which one of the parties would approach the matter with the concept that the problem has to be resolved by this or that day, otherwise this or that side will be penalized. The Cyprus problem did not begin today. Nor can it be resolved in two or five days or even five months. It is a legal matter and a question of rights. The Greek Cypriot side has created the Cyprus problem. The Greek Cypriots have done everything they can to destroy us and usurp our rights. They continue to regard the rights they have usurped from us as being their own rights. No one has bothered to consider that fact. Several developments have taken place in the Greek Cypriot side. The Greek Cypriots provoke us every day. The preparations they make and the approach they maintain indicate that they want to place all of Cyprus under their control. No one seems to be bothered by all that. Attention has been focused only on the package of confidence-building measures. However, an atmosphere of confidence is required for the talks on that package. We have been informed on the many developments and statements in the Greek Cypriots side, which further strengthen the lack of confidence. That should also be considered. [end recording]
