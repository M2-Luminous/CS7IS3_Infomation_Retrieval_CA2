Speaking first in the debate on the president's opening of Parliament speech, Mr de Klerk said he had no regrets about events flowing from his February 1990 speech that unbanned the African National Congress. "With your presence in this chamber Parliament is at long last complete," Mr de Klerk said. "Welcome to you -- and welcome to the millions of South Africans, whom we all together for the first time in our history, represent ?n this highest council of our country." He said the National Party [NP] was prepared to play its part in putting South Africa first. Mr de Klerk said the NP welcomed the theme of a "people-centred society" which was a theme of Mr Mandela's address. The theme had the potential to resolve a philosophical debate. The NP also supported the Reconstruction and Development Programme [RDP] outlined by Mr Mandela. "The NP enthusiastically supports most of the objectives of the RDP. Many of the goals in the programme are also goals which have for years been pursued by the NP. The main problem did not lie in our willingness to meet the needs of the people, but in the willingness of a large sector of our people to accept services from a government which they regarded as illegitimate. This problem has at last been removed," he said. There was a risk, however, that the RDP would be prescriptive and invite government intervention. Non-material needs like reconciliation, culture and security were also important. There was broad consensus on these issues. Progress was reflected by the relaxed manner in which the elections took place, the spontaneous warmth generated by the ceremonial activities, and the spirit of co-operation in the government of national unity. Sentiment had to become reality. The constitution protected the status of English and Afrikaans and gave increased status to other languages. "It is of the greatest importance that these measures are implemented. And yet we find some government corporations not acting according to the spirit and the letter of the constitution," he said. Minority rights were suspect during the apartheid era. "It was associated with apartheid, racism and discrimination. In the post- apartheid era, we South Africans will have to address this issue fairly and squarely. The realities of our country demand it -- the multicultural and multi-linguistic nature of our great nation demands of us to focus on the question of effective protection of minority rights." Mr de Klerk quoted from the United Nations "Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities" and said the issue of minority rights "will need to be addressed more fundamentally than is the case in our present transitional constitution". However, the Freedom Front's proposed "volkstaat" [Afrikaner homeland] was not attainable and would lead to a new form of discrimination which the NP could not support. While the NP was committed to the concept of one-city, one- taxpayer, there was a case for devolving control of some government functions to the neighbourhood level. Local schools and old age homes could be administered at the neighbourhood level in the interests of the communities they served.
