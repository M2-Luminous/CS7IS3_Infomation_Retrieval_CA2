The leader of the Islamic revolution, Ayatollah Khamene'i, in an important message in connection with the crime, described the painful catastrophe a reminder of the mass murders carried out by the Zionists during the occupation, saying that these crimes are now being committed openly and before the eyes of the world people. In part of his message, the leader of the Islamic revolution said today: The bitter reality, that the oppressed Palestinian nation is compelled to carry out a struggle on its own homeland to be able to live there, has once again been dawned upon that nation. The leader of the Islamic revolution, then addressing the world bodies and the governments, the so-called defenders of the human rights that for years have ignored the human rights violations of a nation in Palestine, posing the question as to whether this time, too, these organizations will continue their silence and whether those having forced peace with the usurper enemy will realize their mistakes. Yesterday's horrible crime committed at the Abraham mosque in Hebron is a shocking event which cannot easily be overlooked and, as initial reaction, covered by the news reports of mass media, show the dimensions of the crime are so widespread that even the Western political circles and the supporters of the Zionist regime have shown a negative reaction. In this connection the U.S. State Department released a statement yesterday strongly condemning the horrible and terrorist attack. The U.S. administration in the statement, saying that the crime stresses the need for expediting the Arab-Israeli talks, has called on the two sides negotiating for the signing of the compromising agreement between Palestine and Israel to continue their talks. At the same time, France and Russia, through their official stance in the world bodies, such as the Amnesty International and the human rights organizations, in their statements have condemned the crime and along with that the leaders of the Islamic governments and organizations have also strongly condemned the Zionist attacks against the Muslims. What happened at Hebron yesterday has given rise to strong reactions on a large scale and in the political circles and it undoubtedly deserves condemnation. The Muslim government and nation have great responsibility in following up to find who are behind the crime. But from the political point of view what has provoked the Western concern and the concern of the U.S. with respect to the consequences of the horrible incident is the impact that this can have on the future of the peace talks, especially when nothing is clearly predictable as yet. Further there are many questions posed with regard to the Muslim reaction over the crime and Western political analysts cannot easily find answers for these questions.
