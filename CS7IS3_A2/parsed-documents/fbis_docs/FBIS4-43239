Despite the different course of the elections, it is in each case at the expense of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]. The new role is shared by Alliance 90/Greens in the west, and the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] in the east. Unlike the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], the social democrats also suffered from the low voter turnout. This is what the Institute for Applied Social Sciences (Infas) says in an analysis ordered by DPA, which we publish in the following slightly abridged and edited version. At a glance, the trends in east and west seem to diverge -- losses here and gains there for the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU]; gains here and losses there for the social democrats. The Free Democratic Party [FDP] loses little in the west, while it is almost halved in the east. Alliance 90/Greens stagnate in the east but have clear gains in the west. The CDU can stabilize its dominating position in east and west. The FDP was also existentially weakened by the anti-Europe party of its former member, Guido Brunner. The 1 percent for this party would have raised the FDP above the 5-percent hurdle. However, the stream from the FDP to the CDU was larger than this movement, namely approximately 400,000 voters net in the west. In the east -- compared with the 1990 Bundestag elections -- the number was approximately 200,000. Another decisive exchange took place between the SPD and Alliance 90/Greens. The largest shifts in the red-green camp took place in the large cities and service centers. A total of 660,000 former SPD voters voted for the ecological party. In the east, no more than 11,000 former SPD voters voted for Alliance 90/Greens. In the east, the losses of the SPD to the PDS were of decisive importance. The net balance was approximately 210,000 voters, which roughly corresponds to the number of inhabitants in Rostock. The losers of German unity -- no matter of what persuasion -- voted for the PDS, whereas the winners of German unity, having temporarily maintained restraint or even voted for other parties, returned to the CDU. Movements from the SPD to the PDS were compensated by movements from the CDU to the SPD. Compared with the 1989 European elections, there were gains for the CDU/CSU and for Alliance 90/Greens, and losses for the social democrats, the liberals, and the Republikaner. The FDP only succeeded in narrowly overcoming the 5-percent hurdle in Baden-Wuerttemberg. The Republikaner achieved their relatively best results in Bavaria (6.6 percent) and Baden-Wuerttemberg (5.9 percent). However, in Bavaria they lost no less than 8 percentage points, compared with the 1989 European elections; of these protest voters of 1989, many did not vote this time, and many returned to the CSU. The largest differences in the west manifested themselves in the voter turnout. In federal laender where communal elections took place at the same time, the turnout was clearly higher than the average 59.5 percent, in the northern laender, it was equally clearly lower. In the east, too, the voter turnout in the laender where communal elections were held simultaneously was also higher. In Brandenburg, however, it was only a little higher than 40 percent, in Berlin approximately 54 percent, in the four other laender, between 65 and 70 percent, comparable to the turnout in Baden-Wuerttemberg. In the east, in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Brandenburg, Alliance 90/Greens remained under 5 percent. In Mecklenberg-Western Pomerania, the PDS passed the SPD and worked its way up to second place; in all the other new laender it reached third place. In Brandenburg, it was just 1 percent behind the CDU. Compared with the 1990 Bundestag elections, the percentage of FDP votes was generally halved; in Saxony-Anhalt, it was even reduced to one-third. The PDS percentage roughly doubled in all new laender. The SPD achieved slight gains (except in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania), and the CDU suffered major losses. Berlin represents a sort of microcosm that reflects the all-German landscape. The combined result from east and west shows that the CDU and SPD with 28 percent compete for first place, while Alliance 90/Greens and the PDS with 14 and 16 percent, respectively, compete for third place.
