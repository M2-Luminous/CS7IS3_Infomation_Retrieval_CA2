The institute has devised a system whereby the life of an EV battery can be tested and evaluated for actual road conditions inside a laboratory. In this system, a battery is placed inside the test equipment, and an external device is used to input changes in accelerator pressure (discharge), temperature, humidity, and vibrations for actual driving conditions in Fukuoka City. The system can evaluate 30 different batteries simultaneously, so it is a lot faster and much more labor-saving than actual on-road testing. Battery makers do not as yet have such a testing and evaluation system. Lead batteries used to be used in electric vehicles, but they could only go about 70 km on a one recharge for in-city driving. When a nickel-zinc battery is used, that figure goes as high as 140 km, but these batteries have a short lifetime and are twice as expensive. If the life of a nickel-zinc battery could be extended, it would mean that a new battery would not be needed and that the total cost could be reduced, thereby making such a battery more practical to use. The institute wants to extend the life of existing 70-cycle nickel-zinc batteries to 400 cycles, with one cycle being one complete charge and discharge. Working from a 4-year plan that starts this year, the institute has said it will investigate the optimum configuration for the battery by changing the makeup of the electrode plates and the electrolyte concentration in the battery.
