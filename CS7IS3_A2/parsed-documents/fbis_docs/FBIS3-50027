In a statement issued on the occasion of the current visit by a Council of Europe delegation to Slovakia and given to CTK today leaders of Romany organizations of the Kosice district represented in the Association Council of Slovak Romanies protested efforts by Hungarian parties to create an autonomous ethnic territorial unit with "exceptional" rights for ethnic Hungarians in southern Slovakia. "Apart from other non-Hungarians at least 200,000 Romanies also live in southern Slovakia. Although they have declared themselves to belong to the Hungarian minority, national minority rights which are being fully enjoyed by ethnic Hungarians have never been applied to Romanies," the statement says. The Romanies appealed to the Slovak Government, parliament, and Council of Europe not to confine themselves to dealing with "pseudo-national" claims, but to at last stop the economic decline of Slovakia and to pay more attention to abolishing the reasons for the impoverishment of Slovakia's population. The government and parliament do not respect Romanies' views, ideas, and proposals concerning their own cultural development. By hiding their heads in the sand they support intolerance towards Romanies and condone their "spiritual genocide." According to a spokesman of the Union of Romanies Civic Initiative, Slovak Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac is to meet with Romany representatives in Kosice in the near future.
