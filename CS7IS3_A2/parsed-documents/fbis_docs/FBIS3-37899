"In case the accused agree with the (Duma) resolution I shall rule to drop criminal proceedings against each of the accused", Kazannik told TASS on Thursday. If the accused refuse to be pardoned the criminal cases against them will proceed in a usual way, he added. Kazannik said he had not yet received the Duma decision, but stressed that his office does not give political assessments to various laws. "It ensures lawfulness and a strict fulfillment of all instructions of competent state bodies", he said.
