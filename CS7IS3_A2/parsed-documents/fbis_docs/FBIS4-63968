After the consultations of the heads of the Ukrainian and Russian Governments with Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk, the first variant of a joint document appeared under a conventional title agreement between the governments of Ukraine and the Russian Federation on the first stage of settling the Black Sea Fleet issues. It is unclear as yet what the second, the third, and the subsequent stages will be, and how many stages at all are to follow. Experts worked up this agreement. However, none of the sides was satisfied with the last variant, despite the fact that the delegations were trying to find a compromise solution. According to Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov, the stands have been brought closer to each other. However, there are key points that we failed to solve. Only mutual respect for the laws of both countries can lead to a concrete result, he pointed out. Sevastopol became a stumbling block. The Russian side refers to it in the document as the main base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, claiming its right to the whole city, where there will be no place for Ukrainian sailors and ships. Ukraine is ready to grant Russia the base in Sevastopol; but it does not agree to give up the whole city for the base. Besides, as Ukraine's Acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy said, Russia insists that the entire shore-based infrastructure should be passed to it, something Ukraine cannot agree to, which is only natural. Unexpected for the Ukrainian side was also the solution of the issue on dividing the ships that came up at the previous meeting in Sevastopol. This has been reported by Colonel General Ivan Bizhan, Ukrainian deputy defense minister. The Russians declared that Ukraine had already received a certain part of the ships apportioned to it, proceeding at this point from the very understated data on the current quantitative composition of the Black Sea Fleet. With such an apportioning offered by Russia, Ukraine will receive only a minimum of the ships and will be deprived of the entire shore-based infrastructure. In the end, it will cease to be the master of its own land. Despite a number of nonessential differences, the delegations again took their seats at the negotiating table today.
