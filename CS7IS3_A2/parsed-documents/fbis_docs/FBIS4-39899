In his words, Russia is carrying an increasing peace-making burden in former Soviet republics. Closer interaction of the council with European neutral states, which are experienced in peace-making, would help to increase the collective peace-making potential, said the minister. Kozyrev urged the need for closer cooperation of CSCE and the council in peace-keeping operations as it is envisaged by the council's plan for 1994, and suggested to form a corresponding joint working group. The Russian concept of European partnership provides for coordination of military, political and peace-making interaction by the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and the leading role of CSCE, Kozyrev told the council's session. In his opinion, the council can and must gradually transform into an independent body to be based on equality of all participants and not on the scheme of "NATO plus partners". Kozyrev called for the involvement of a large number of CSCE members in the council activities, permanent contacts between the two organizations and the use of the council's abilities in the implementation of the Partnership for Peace program. Russia is striving for deepened partnership with NATO without mutual vetoes and "surprises", Kozyrev told the council. "The Partnership for Peace program is starting. We plan to come to Brussels to boost a program of deepened cooperation between Russia and NATO, including a framework document, as soon as the NATO headquarters finalize the preparations," said Kozyrev.
