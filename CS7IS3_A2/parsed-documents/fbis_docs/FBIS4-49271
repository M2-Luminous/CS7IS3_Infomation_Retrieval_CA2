Hayden said this in a meeting with visiting vice-chairman Tian Jiyun of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC), who is leading a NPC delegation on a visit to the South Pacific nation. Hayden said that he hoped China would continue to cooperate with Australia in the fields of agriculture and husbandry and increase its trade volume in agricultural produces. The Australian governor-general just returned back from his nine-day official visit to China, where he had meetings with President Jiang Zemin and other Chinese leaders. Tian, expressing his appreciation for the contributions Hayden has made to the Sino-Aussie friendship, said that Hayden is an old friend of the Chinese people. Tian said that both China and Australia are big countries in the Asia-Pacific region and can play an important role in development and in safeguarding peace and stability in the region. He also said that the potential for cooperation is great between the two countries as China is a large nation with over a billion population and Australia is a large country boasting rich resources. Tian said that the deepening of China's reforms would offer opportunities for further increasing bilateral trade. Tian also conveyed regards from Chinese President Jiang Zemin to Hayden, who asked Tian to convey his best wish to Jiang. Tian arrived in Australia on Tuesday [3 May] for a week-long visit to the country, the last leg of his four-nation South-Pacific trip, which has already taken him to New Zealand, Western Samoa and Papua New Guinea. In the morning today, Tian also had meetings with Rick Farley, executive director of the National Farmers' Federation, Andrew Peacock, shadow minister for foreign affairs of the opposition, and Tim Fisher of the leader of the National Party.
