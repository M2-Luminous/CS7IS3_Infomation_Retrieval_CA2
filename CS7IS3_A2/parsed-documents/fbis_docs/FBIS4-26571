Wu and Y.C. Tsai] [Text] Jakarta, June 21 (CNA) -- Ties between Taiwan and Indonesia have improved significantly since President Li Teng-hui paid an unofficial visit to Indonesia in February, a Taiwan official stationed here said Tuesday [21 June]. Lu Pao-sun, representative of the Taipei Economic and Trade Office in Jakarta, noted that Taiwan had invested a total of US$8.6 billion in Indonesia as of the end of May, making it the second largest foreign investor in the Southeast Asian country. In comparison, he pointed out, aggregate Taiwan investment was about US$4 billion as of the end of 1993. It's really amazing that investment from Taiwan made such a big jump in the five-month period, he said. Annual two-way trade between the two countries stands at nearly US$3 billion, he added. Lu made the remarks at a cocktail party in honor of a delegation of Taiwan manufacturers taking part in the Jakarta fair, which opened last Saturday and will continue through July 16. The delegation is led by Ronie H.K. Huang, secretary-general of the Taipei-based China External Trade Development Council. Stressing that the delegation aims to strengthen trade and investment cooperation between the two countries, Huang said he has invited Indonesian entrepreneurs to display their products at the Taipei import fair, which is scheduled for October. Earlier in the day, Huang called on Commerce Minister Joedono and Rudy Langkong, chairman of the Export Promotion Commission under the Ministry of Commerce. Also speaking at the party, ROC legislator Lin Shou-shan said the Taipei government has promoted the "southern strategy" in a bid to help enhance the economic progress in Southeast Asian countries and Taiwan's overseas investment. Taiwan is willing to share its experience in economic development with other countries, Lin noted. In return, Langkong extended his welcome to the Taiwan delegation, saying that longstanding relations between the two countries have been solid despite the lack of diplomatic ties. He said that Indonesia will definitely be represented at the 1994 Taipei import fair.
