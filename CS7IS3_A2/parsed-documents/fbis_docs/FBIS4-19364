According to an opinion poll published in GOTEBORGS-POSTEN, supporters of the EU now number 33 percent while opponents number 42 percent. The poll also reveals that over half of Sweden's Social Democrats are against the EU. This is a problem for the party leadership that is in favor of the EU and is seeking to gain governmental powers in the Swedish elections in September.
