Dehaene for the Kingdom of Belgium] [Text] The Russian Federation and the Kingdom of Belgium henceforth referred to as the contracting parties, relying on the bond of friendship and cooperation between their peoples, the mutual trust and adherence to the common values of freedom, democracy, justice and solidarity, assuming that the Russian Federation is the successor state of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, believing that the historical changes taking place in Europe have opened prospects for creation of a fair and strong order on the European continent, based on a respect for international law, the United Nations Organization Charter, human rights and basic freedoms in accordance with the Helsinki Concluding Act, the Paris Charter for a New Europe, the Helsinki document of 1992, "Challenge of the Time of Change," and other documents of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), emphasizing the need for ensuring security and stability in building a new Europe and striving to aid in this effort, have come to agreement on the following: Article 1 The contracting parties have decided to give their bilateral relations a new quality of accord and partnership. The contracting parties shall develop their relations as friendly states on the basis of equal rights, respect for sovereignty and political independence of both states, mutual adherence to the principles of freedom, democracy, supremacy of law and human rights, as well as the adherence to the letter and the spirit of the Paris Charter for a New Europe, the Helsinki document of 1992, "Challenge of the Time of Change," and other CSCE documents. This new quality of accord and partnership, based on the decisiveness of the contracting parties to overcome the consequences of the division of Europe into opposing blocks, will find its expression in all spheres of bilateral relations. Article 2 The contracting parties shall use all the means at their disposal to promote a strengthening of the authority, role and effectiveness of the United Nations organization, as well as the full respect of the UN Charter by all member states. The contracting parties affirm their unconditional adherence to the principles of peaceful regulation of disputes contained in the UN Charter. The contracting parties shall actively aid in the realization of effective actions in the sphere of preventive diplomacy. Article 3 The contracting parties affirm the decisive role which the CSCE may play in the cause of strengthening stability and security in Europe, and emphasize the principle importance of the statutes of the Helsinki Concluding Act, the Paris Charter for a New Europe, the Helsinki document of 1992, "Challenge of the Time of Change," as well as other CSCE documents. The contracting parties shall facilitate the strengthening of the CSCE for purposes of ensuring the guarantees of human rights, democracy and the legal state, and preventing and regulating disputes by peaceful means. The contracting parties ascribe particular importance to strengthening the capacity of the CSCE for actions in the spheres of preventive diplomacy and regulation of conflicts. Article 4 The contracting parties concur in the fact that security and stability must be based on dialogue, partnership and cooperation, as well as on the practical realization of the principle of defense adequacy. They believe that a peaceful order in Europe presupposes, on the basis of adherence to the concluded treaties, a full implementation of the Treaty on OVSE [Conventional Armed Forces in Europe], a continuation of efforts toward reduction and control of arms and armed forces, a development of measures of trust aimed at guaranteeing security and stability on the continent, as well as the nonproliferation of mass destruction weapons. The contracting parties affirm their adherence to the 1968 Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the directives coordinated by the group of countries who are suppliers of nuclear materials, and the 1993 Convention on Banning the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Application of Chemical Weapons and Their Destruction, and will take necessary measures toward excluding the transfer of materials, technologies or equipment of nuclear weapons or other types of mass destruction weapons in these countries to other countries. Article 5 The contracting parties acknowledge the important role of the European Union, as well as the significant contribution of international economic and financial organizations in the balanced development of the world economy and in the political and economic development of Europe. The contracting parties believe that the success of reforms, the transition to a market economy and the integration of Russia into the world economy are facilitated by its rapprochement with the European Union, specifically by means of conclusion of the appropriate treaties between them, such as the treaty on partnership and cooperation. The contracting parties support efforts on cooperation within the framework of the Council of Europe. They acknowledge, in particular, the importance of programs aimed at the development of law and the strengthening of democratic institutions. Article 6 The contracting parties are stepping up bilateral meetings at the appropriate level--political as well as expert-technical--along with regular contacts in the course of various meetings on a multilateral level and within the framework of the European Union. All the questions which are of mutual interest will be discussed at these meetings. The contracting parties shall promote the implementation of regular consultations on current questions at the level of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs. Article 7 The contracting parties believe it is important to develop contacts and exchanges of information in the military sphere. In this context, they provide for visits of military delegations at various levels and exchanges of opinions. For this purpose, they are compiling bilateral programs of military contacts. Article 8 The contracting parties shall cooperate in the humanitarian sphere, giving first priority importance to maintaining generally accepted standards of democracy and human rights, specifically for the purpose of promoting the activity of charitable organizations. If necessary, they will reach administrative agreements with local authorities in order to facilitate actions in extraordinary circumstances. The contracting parties shall cooperate in clarifying the fates of their citizens who, in connection with various circumstances, find themselves on the territory of the other contracting party, or who are missing there. Within this framework, they conclude agreements for the purpose of allowing the investigators of the other party access to archives which might contain information on the above-mentioned citizens. The contracting parties shall cooperate in the sphere of return of archives. Article 9 The contracting parties believe that such fields as culture, education, professional training, public health and scientific research are one of the important spheres of their cooperation. With these spheres, which are within the competency of the Communities and Regions of the Kingdom of Belgium, the Russian Federation is ready to conclude the appropriate treaties and agreements with the above-mentioned communities and regions, according to the constitutional and legislative directives which are in effect in both countries. Article 10 The contracting parties stress the importance of better mutual familiarization with each other's legal systems. The contracting parties shall promote cooperation between the institutions of justice and the law enforcement agencies of both states, including mutual legal assistance in civil and criminal cases and cooperation in the struggle against crime, unlawful circulation of narcotics and psychotropic substances, terrorist acts of an international character and contraband, including the unlawful transport of cultural valuables over the border. The Belgian side will have a favorable attitude toward the Russian Federation and will render it assistance in joining in treaties on cooperation in the sphere of the struggle against crime concluded by the Council of Europe member states. Article 11 Without infringing upon the competencies of the subjects of the Russian Federation and the Communities and Regions of the Kingdom of Belgium in the sphere of international cooperation, the contracting parties shall facilitate the enhancement of mutual cooperation in the sphere of economics, energetics, transport, communications, finance and agriculture, ascribing particular importance to development of programs for advanced training of workers at enterprises and financial organizations. As necessary, the competent authorities of the contracting parties shall develop new programs of cooperation, primarily in such spheres as the agroindustrial complex, privatization, financial services and banking, the trade network, communications, informatics, transport, energetics, application of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, and specifically nuclear safety and the processing of military fissionable materials for their application for civilian purposes. In this context, the contracting parties believe that the activity of the Mixed Commission on Economic Cooperation Between Russia and the Belgium-Luxemburg Economic Union (BLEU) must be adapted to the new situation which is being formed in connection with the transition of the Russian Federation to the market economy. The contracting parties shall aid in the creation of favorable conditions for establishing direct relations and activity of enterprises and other legal persons, encouraging and protecting capital investments, and developing exchanges of economic information. They shall renew the existing legal documents, increase their effectiveness and develop new ones which will be adapted to the new economic and juridical situation in the Russian Federation. Article 12 The competent authorities of the contracting parties shall aid in expanding and enhancing cooperation in the spheres of science, technology, space research and environmental protection for the purposes of using the achievements of modern science and technologies for peaceful purposes. They encourage scientific exchanges and the implementation of joint projects. Article 13 The contracting parties promise to hold consultations on disputed questions, which may be raised by each of the contracting parties in regard to the financial and material aspects of the property and interests of individuals and legal persons of both countries. Article 14 The contracting parties shall ensure, on the basis of reciprocity, conditions for the normal activity of diplomatic and consular institutions, as well as other official representations of the other party. For purposes of specifying responsibilities within the framework of the CSCE regarding the freedom of movement and transit for all citizens of the contracting parties on their territories, they will take into consideration these obligations for concluding the necessary bilateral agreements in accordance with international treaties already concluded by each of the parties in this sphere. Article 15 The present treaty in no way alters the obligations which bind the contracting parties in accordance with other treaties in which they are participants. They in no way affect the obligations of the contracting parties in regard to third countries and are not directed against any of them. Article 16 Each of the contracting parties shall notify the other party upon completion of procedures provided by its legislation for implementation of the present treaty. The present treaty shall become effective 30 days after receipt of such notification. The present treaty is concluded for a term of 5 years. Upon tacit approval, its effect shall be extended for each subsequent period of two years, provided neither of the parties gives written notification to the other 6 months prior to expiration of the appropriate term of effectiveness, stating its decision to denounce the treaty.
