This is a major concern. As a principal force and trend in the country, Hizballah is concerned with preparing for every eventuality. [passage omitted] Asked about Hizballah's future after the settlement, his eminence said: Nobody can cancel the trend in Lebanon called Hizballah. That's one thing. The other thing is that talk of settlement possibilities is premature. It's in nobody's interest to discuss how to deal with what will happen if peace is established. We are not prepared to give an answer to the intelligence service free. Asked whether there are differences engulfing Hizballah ranks, Nasrallah said: Not every one in Hizballah thinks the same. Views are usually raised. But differences are always settled through a higher religious authority (al-Marja'iyah]. This constitutes a basic immunity. There is a collective leadership in Hizballah, so its decision is unanimous. Asked if there is any connection between the Resistance operations and the political situation, his eminence said that the Resistance operations are not subject to any political circumstances. Consequently, the operations are governed by one factor: The fighters' capabilities and the field conditions they face. [passage omitted On Hizballah's conditions for joining any future government, his eminence said: We are not hungry for power sharing and thus we do not seek to enter just any government. Joining or not joining a government is open to study and debate every time a government is about to be formed. What concerns us is the role this government will play, its policy statement, plan, and credibility. If we can see the program that the policy statement reflects and that the way the government is made up gives it credibility and if we find that its program and statement are in line, not with all our policies, but with the main issues that we believe in, primarily the liberation and Resistance, then we will not object to joining it. Asked if Hizballah might join a government under al-Hariri, he said: I don't want to rush Hizballah's decision on this but in my mind and following the 13 September massacre, I don't think so. We have blamed the executive authority, both the regime and the government, for the massacre. Both are responsible. And the government did not behave responsibly after the massacre. Withholding confidence or submitting a motion of no confidence in the government at the Chamber of Deputies is always possible but we must choose its timing because we are not after a no-confidence motion just to make a point. We have made our point with something bigger than the no-confidence motion, and the people echoed it in their slogans and shouts, which were not politically orchestrated. If we thought a no-confidence motion would bring down the government, we would not hesitate to submit it for one moment. We have raised the slogan of bringing down the government and we continue in that direction but there are priorities. Because of the country's delicate circumstances, Hizballah has resorted to no negative measures or violent methods. We accuse some circles in power of seeking to cause a collision between Hizballah and the Lebanese Army; they seek to use the Army to strike at Hizballah and striking Hizballah means striking at the Resistance. They are trying to find motives or accusations to use against Hizballah. The Lebanese authority made commitments to Christopher during the seven- day war in which the Islamic Resistance in particular used all its weight, mujahidin, weapons, and resources. After some time, the Lebanese authority brought the Army to the area of operations of the UN troops as part of a clear-cut and explicit commitment. This is not just newspaper talk; we have complete information that promises were made to repress and disarm the Resistance.
