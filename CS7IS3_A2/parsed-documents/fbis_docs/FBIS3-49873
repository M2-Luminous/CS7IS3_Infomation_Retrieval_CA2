A spokesman in the Serb-controlled town told AFP that the vehicle had been blown up early Tuesday outside an apartment of two ICRC employees but the blast caused no casualties. "This attack raises serious problems of security," said Pierre Gauthier, an ICRC spokesman in Geneva. Loyal authorities have opened an enquiry into the attack, the spokesman said. The ICRC has about 25 workers in the northwestern town, which is a base for supplying both Moslem and Serb populations in the area.
