IBM Corporation, the largest manufacturer of computers in the world, will demonstrate a number of its PS/2 series PC's with a three-year service guarantee in New York which it plans to promote as computers for commercial users. And in the beginning of September, IBM reported on the production of a new cheap PS/1 series system that is designed for use in small offices and under everyday conditions. Five new table-top systems, three servers, three monitors, and four personal computers with audio and video capabilities are in the PS/2 series. The firm's OS/2 version 2.0 operating system will be loaded in all of the systems beforehand and all of them will be based on IBM's "microchannel" architecture. An IBM spokesman refused to provide any detailed description of the product whatsoever. Personal Computer Company, a new IBM subsidiary enterprise with headquarters in Somers (New York), will be involved in marketing the expanded PS/2 series. According to information from IBM spokesmen, the firm's income from production of PC's totaled $7 billion in 1991, however, IBM's "Personal Business" Division head J. Canavino refused to provide a prediction for next year. Hewlett-Packard plans to offer four high-class personal computers, manufactured based on the 80486 microprocessor, with a starting price of $1,149. Hewlett-Packard, whose income totaled $14.5 billion in 1991, is known primarily as a manufacturer of printers, automated work stations, and measurement equipment. According to expert assessments, printers account for 25% of the company's profits and personal computers only account for 5%. In August, Hewlett-Packard reduced prices on its personal computers by more than 25% while attempting to remain competitive in the market. According to the company's official statement, the new series of computers, which have received the name Vectra 486N PC, are $400 cheaper than comparable items from Compaq Computer Company. New York (Reuters), 3 September 1992; 24 September 1992. Cray Receives Contract from NASA Cray Research has received a NASA contract worth $74 million for the delivery of a high-speed computer, beating out such competitors as Japan's NEC Corp. and its American marketing partner Control Data Systems. The computer is needed by NASA experts from Ames Scientific Research Center (Mountain View, California) to assist in the design and conduct of tests of new design aircraft and spacecraft. This center became the first to utilize numerical modeling on a computer to replace certain expensive and time-consuming tests of models of aircraft in a wind tunnel. Hundreds of scientists from government, industrial, and scientific organizations utilize the computer installed at Ames Scientific Research Center in their work. Cray received a seven year contract. The order for the computer that was issued by Ames Scientific Research Center became the first joint marketing effort between Control Data Systems and NEC after they signed a cooperation agreement in January 1992. Control Data Systems (Arden Hills) became the successor of Control Data (currently Seridien) for conducting calculations on a computer. NASA awarded the contract to the American firm in response to NEC's efforts to introduce high-speed computers in the American government market, in which Cray is the leader. Having received at one time a Canadian Meteorological Service contract, beating out Cray in the process, NEC filed suit against NASA in Federal Court, accusing the agency of a pro-American policy, and won the right to compete in the competition along with Cray. According to NASA spokesmen, Cray won the contract thanks to the superiority of the specifications of its new C-90 computer and the firm's reputation as a long-standing, reliable, and profitable partner. The C-90 computer will replace the Cray-2 computer, which has been utilized at the Ames Scientific Research Center since 1985. Cray made a profit in the amount of $113 million with income of $862.5 million in 1991. AP, 3 September 1992.
