The National Election Commission said opposition parties had secured 17 of the 24 seats available in the second round, while the pro-Eyadema Togolese People's Rally had won two, and transitional Premier Joseph Koffigoh one. The results from four remaining seats were not released. The results meant that after two rounds of voting, pro-opposition parties had won 39 seats, compared to 37 for pro-Eyadema parties, holding out the prospect of an end to the monopoly on power exercised by Eyadema since 1967.
