Demirel hosted a dinner in honor of Israeli President Ever Weizman. In a dinner toast, Demirel welcomed the beginning of the Middle East peace process. He explained that the courageous steps taken by Israel and the Palestinians last year enabled Turkey to transport its efforts for cooperation and peace southward. The existing desire to perpetuate peace will be reflected widely and positively in the world, Demirel stressed. Recalling that the relations between the Turkish and Jewish people began a long time ago, Demirel noted that Turkish citizens of Jewish origin contribute significantly to the country and its cultural heritage. In his speech, Weizman said that he came to Turkey, knowing that it is a country with an influential role in the future course of the Middle East. Underlining that Turkey has always contributed to peace, Weizman remarked: The leaders and people of the Middle East should embrace Kemal Ataturk's motto of peace at home and peace in the world. There are many factors that connect the two nations and the two countries, Weizman recounted, adding that Israel will never forget that the Jews were accepted by the Ottoman Empire when they were expelled from various European countries some 500 years ago. Weizman pointed out that thousands of Arabs and Jews were killed in the wars waged before it was understood that Israel's existence in the region is a living reality. He added that the agreement with the Palestinians constitutes the beginning of a change in the region.
