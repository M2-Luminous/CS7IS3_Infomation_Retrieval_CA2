According to them, Azerbaijan oil producers must perform engineering-research and seismographic-exploratory work in the southeastern part of the Caspian Sea valued at a total of more than $3 million. As Azerbaijan State Petroleum Company Vice President Khoshbakht Yusuf-zade, Doctor of Geological-Mineralogical Sciences, announced, business relations with the National Petroleum Company of the neighboring state began to develop at the end of the 1960's when Azerbaijani geophysicists did research needed by the Iranians for studying the geological structure of minerals in the southern part of the Caspian Sea. The Azerbaijani special ships Zokhrab Veliyev and Rezonans, which are equipped with everything necessary for performing the entire complex of work under the new contracts between the oil companies of the two neighboring Caspian states, will soon depart for the southern shores of the Caspian Sea.
