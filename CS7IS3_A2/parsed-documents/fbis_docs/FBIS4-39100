In particular, Kim stressed that ethnic Koreans could play a role in building relations between the two countries, they said. Karimov, meanwhile, emphasized that the 200,000 ethnic Koreans in Uzbekistan are proper citizens under Uzbekistani law and, therefore, will not be subjected to discrimination or unfair treatment under any circumstances, the officials said. Uzbekistan's president praised ethnic Koreans for their role in developing the country and pointed out that some are serving as high-level officials including vice minister, according to the officials. Kim and Karimov witnessed the signing of agreements on aviation and other fields before giving a joint new conference.
