He said: This year, with the state further tightening control over credit, the shortage of funds will remain. Therefore, all material supply enterprises should take effective measures to overcome the effect of unfavorable factors, should tap the potential for increased financial revenues, and should strive to improve management and operations and to raise the efficiency of using funds, thereby pushing the overall efficiency of material supply departments to a new height. He said: In recent years, quite a few material supply enterprises have benefited from market analysis and forecast, earning profits year after year. However, some enterprises failed to attach importance to market analysis and to draw an accurate assessment of the situation, thus performing poorly and decreasing their efficiency whenever the market fluctuated. This year, the total demand and supply of capital goods are both expected to increase by a relatively large margin and to be balanced in general. However, prices of capital goods will be affected by the state's policies, energy, communications, and international market changes, in addition to supply and demand. Therefore, under the general trend of balanced supply and demand, we still cannot rule out price fluctuations, or relatively big price fluctuations of certain commodities in some regions during a given period of time. Hence, each and every material supply department is required to obtain a good grasp of the state's policies in a timely manner, to collect information of all kinds, and to step up dynamic analysis and forecast of various commodities in order to keep abreast of market trends and changes and to make decisions on operational strategies. Only by so doing can material supply enterprises become profitable and be able to continually expand and enliven their operations.
