Protection Force (UNPROFOR) on Sunday agreed on the opening of two air corridors to Tuzla, a Muslim-held town in the north-eastern part of the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The agreement was reached at Pale, the R.S. administrative centre, between R.S. president Radovan Karadzic, special U.N. Secretary-General's envoy for the former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi, and UNPROFOR Commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina, Gen. Michael Rose, the R.S. news agency SRNA said. Akashi confirmed after the meeting that an agreement had been reached on the opening of two air corridors which would link Tuzla with Croatia's capital of Zagreb and the Croatian Adriatic port of Split. Akashi said that the ways and means of securing the airfield near Tuzla had also been agreed. The Japanese diplomat said that Karadzic had guaranteed the safe use of the airfield, but there remained some difficulties with the other two sides, the Bosnian Muslims and Croats, with whom he said no agreement had been reached yet. A group of Russian experts left for Tuzla on Sunday to carry out preparations for the opening of the airfield in line with an agreement reached between the Russian Government and the R.S. Russian observers will check all deliveries which arrive at the Dubrava airfield near Tuzla, because the Serb side fears the airfield could be used for illegal munitions shipments to the Bosnian Muslims. Karadzic said after the meeting with the two UNPROFOR officials that he was satisfied since "things are moving in a positive direction and confidence is also gradually increasing." The R.S. president set out special interest in the "free movement of civilians in Sarajevo, since arounds 60,000 Serbs are still to be found in the Muslim section of the city, where they are held as ethnic hostages." Karadzic recalled that an agreement had been reached at the Geneva peace talks on the free movement of civilians between the Serb and Muslim sections of Sarajevo. Asked to comment the statements of Bosnian Muslim leaders that peace could be reached in Bosnia-Herzegovina in April if the Serbs were to join the Croat-Muslim agreement on a federation, Karadzic said that "peace is possible even earlier." He, however, said he doubted the new coalition's readiness to accept a peaceful solution to the conflict. Karadzic recalled that Muslims and Croats had been "hostile towards Serbs" in both the first and second world wars, just as he said they were now.
