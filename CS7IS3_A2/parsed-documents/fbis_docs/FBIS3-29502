"We are not hostile to each other at all and we are in very close contact," the premier said at a session of the House of Representatives budget committee in response to opposition questioner Michio Watanabe. Takemura told the same session, "I think we are on good terms. I don't think we are on bad terms." Hosokawa was responding to a question as to why he sounded out Hiroyuki Sonoda, a senior legislator of the Sakigake (Harbinger) group founded by Takemura, on whether he is ready to take over as a cabinet member in case Takemura cannot remain in the cabinet. Watanabe, a former foreign minister, pressed Hosokawa to clarify "whether you want to replace your chief cabinet secretary." "Why did your relations deteriorate?" He asked. Hosokawa told the session many press reports are wrong. But later on Friday, Hosokawa attended a reception for members of his Japan New Party and said, "my reformist administration is over. It has entered a second stage." Political analysts said Hosokawa implied an intention to reorganize the cabinet by saying that his administration has entered a new stage. Earlier this week, speculation ran high that Hosokawa will carry out an early cabinet reshuffle and remove Takemura from the post of chief cabinet secretary. On Monday the prime minister said he is considering to reshape the cabinet, launched last August. Faced with strong opposition from Takemura's Sakigake and the Social Democratic Party, the biggest group in Hosokawa's seven-party coalition, Hosokawa retreated later and said Wednesday, "the issue is still a blank piece of paper and I am not working on the assumption that I should conduct it immediately." Takemura, leader of the 14-member Sakigake, reportedly alienated Hosokawa and Shinseito co-leader Ichiro Ozawa over his opposition to the pair's proposal to slap a new 7 percent indirect tax on goods and services. Ozawa, a key strategist in the ruling coalition, was reported late last year to have urged Hosokawa to remove Takemura from the key cabinet post. Meanwhile, a senior official in Hosokawa's seven-party coalition denied that Sakigake is softening its opposition to the cabinet reshuffle and leaning toward accepting the removal of Takemura. He said Sakigake will not accept a proposal to transfer Takemura to another cabinet post if he gives in to pressure to quit the office of chief cabinet secretary, whose constant contacts with the press gives it special political advantages.
