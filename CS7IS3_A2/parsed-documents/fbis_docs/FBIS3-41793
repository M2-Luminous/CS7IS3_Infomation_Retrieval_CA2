The figures show that around a quarter of current HIV infections are heterosexually caused, although the vast majority of these have been through contacts with high-risk partners, people overseas, or from people from other countries living in Britain. However, there is a small but growing number of people infected in this country who had partners in no high-risk categories. The report by Professor Nicholas Day of Cambridge University, for the Public Health Laboratory Service, has looked at the likely level of AIDS cases up to 1997, and current levels of HIV infections. Taking all risk groups into account, the forecast is that there will [be] around 2,400 new AIDS cases a year by 1997 in England and Wales, compared with some 1,600 from the whole UK over the past 12 months. The 1997 figures predict 1,350 AIDS cases among gay men, 165 among injecting drug users, and 770 among heterosexuals. Each year between now and 1997, around 85 haemophiliacs infected with contaminated blood products will develop AIDS. After 1997 AIDS figures are expected to fall, reflecting behaviour changes in the mid-1980's by gay men and to a lesser degree injecting drug users. AIDS cases among gay men may peak this year or next year, says the report, but this depends on continued safe sex behaviour, and there are signs that in younger gay men this is not happening. The unknown factor is how fast heterosexual cases will increase. "Whereas AIDS incidence in homosexual males may peak in 1993 and 1994, the incidence in those exposed heterosexually is expected to increase steadily." Estimates of those with HIV now, as opposed to those known to be infected because they have come forward for testing, puts the probable figure for England and Wales at about 27,200, although Professor Day said yesterday he inclined to a figure of around 24,000. The report says that of these 27,180 infections, homosexual exposure accounts for 14,890 cases, injecting drug use 4,450, heterosexual exposure 6,340, and blood products 1,500. The current total number of known HIV infections is 19,524. Researchers have looked at all the known heterosexual cases of AIDS and HIV between 1982 and 1992. They say that of the total 2,237 infections, 73 percent were probably exposed abroad, and 13 percent had a high-risk partner. However, there have been 117 cases of people infected within the UK with no known high risks. The researchers have looked in detail at 30 of these. The report states: "Although half had previously contracted another sexually transmitted infection, the sexual lifestyle of these 30 cases was otherwise unremarkable. "Their median number of sexual partners in the previous five years was three, 23 had never practised anal intercourse, and only one had ever paid for sex." At a press conference yesterday, Professor Day said the number of low-risk heterosexual infections was still small, but all epidemics began with small numbers and stemmed outwards from high-risk groups. He added: "The heterosexual community has to be infected from somewhere and initially it gets infected by the groups who are themselves infected. Once it's in the heterosexual community, infection is going to accelerate." Dr. Kenneth Calman, Chief Medical Officer, warned that the predictions of a falling number of AIDS cases did not mean the threat was over. There were no grounds for complacency.
