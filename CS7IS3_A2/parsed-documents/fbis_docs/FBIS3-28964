In July 1976, Hyundai Motor Co. made the country's maiden car exports when it shipped some Pony's to Ecuador. After that modest beginning, South Korea had exported a cumulative total of 4,004,688 cars by the end of last month. In 1993, exports jumped 40 percent from the year before to an annual high of 638,544, bringing the cumulative total at last year's end to 3,956,990. Exports last month totaled 47,698, causing the cumulative total to break through the 4-million mark. South Korea needed 11 years and two months to export 1 million cars, achieved in September 1987, followed by two years to hit the 2-million mark in September 1989, two years and eight months to pass the 3-million mark in May 1992, and then one year and eight months to reach the 4-million mark in January 1994. In 1985, exports first hit the 100,000-unit level, with a record of 123,110, and the annual achievement reached the 500,000-unit level for the first time in 1987 when Hyundai's Excel-model cars swept the U.S. market. In cumulative export records by model over the past 17 years and seven months, Hyundai's Excel overwhelmed all others with 922,526, followed by Pride (Kia) with 544,788, Lemans (Daewoo) with 396,946, Presto (Hyundai) with 310,503, Pony-Excel (Hyundai) with 252,757, Elantra (Hyundai) with 234,225 and Pony I and II with 217,496. The association predicts that exports will increase 27.7 percent to 815,000 units in 1994 and that the country will begin exporting 1 million cars a year in 1995.
