The French prime minister, who has been in Saudi Arabia for the past few days at the head of a military-economic team, hopes, by offering easy payments terms and bilateral oil deals in future, to encourage the authorities in Riyadh to sign three trading and military agreements with France. [passage omitted] Yet, the Saudi defense minister has so far told the French that their easy terms were not sufficient and that his country, because of the falling oil prices, had to think long before signing any new agreement. Meanwhile, the British defense minister, who is currently in Saudi Arabia, is trying to clarify the outcome of the agreement for the sale of 48 Tornado planes signed two years ago. [passage omitted] The British officials fear that because of its shrinking budget, which mainly affects military expenditures, Saudi Arabia may cancel its military contracts and in return the British military industries may face a serious crisis. Political pundits believe that though the fall in oil prices can help Western countries out of their economic recession, it may, as a by-product, confront the Western military industries with a crisis. [passage omitted] So long as the West uses various levers to keep oil prices at a low level, oil producing countries will be forced to slow down their purchases from the international market. Such a consequence is a major tragedy for the Western arms industries. Thus, the fall in oil prices is a two-edged sword in the hands of the Western countries; they will have to clarify their position with regard to that sword.
