South Korean Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae received a two-page letter during his visit to Moscow from his Russian counterpart Pavel Grachev, who said that maintaining peace and stability in Northeast Asia is an urgent issue. Russia first proposed establishment of a regional multilateral security system to neighboring countries in 1986 when Mikhail Gorbachev was president, but it is unusual for Moscow to deliver a letter to the South Korean Government, officials said. The letter says that to maintain stability in Northeast Asia, countries in the region should observe military exercises in neighboring states, notify others of large-scale military movements in advance and establish a military dispute prevention center, they said.
