The SDU member said in an interview broadcast yesterday evening by the BBC's Radio 4 in London that he does not know how many people he has already murdered, because he does not keep count. Yesterday, both the National Party [NP] and the ANC condemned the SDU member's shocking remarks. The NP said that it would ask the Law and Order Subcouncil of the Executive Transition Council (ETC) to look into the matter. The SDU member, whose alias is Tembo, told the BBC reporter that he and his companions commit the murders to protect the community. He recognizes that murder is wrong in the eyes of God, but the situation around them forces them to do it. They will be glad if the Peace Force stabilizes the situation and the SDU members can get "normal" work. Tembo said this about his routine work as murderer: "I don't think about it. It doesn't bother me, because the situation is one where if we kill a certain person...it's like...for me it is like I have killed a chicken, because I see no reason for him to live if he does not understand what the will of the people is...what it is that we are fighting for." When asked about the matter, NP spokesman Mr. Marthinus van Schalkwyk said that the NP regards this as such a serious indication that the ANC's SDUs are responsible for much of the violence that he will ask the Law and Order Subcouncil of the ETC to take a close look at the matter. "This proves that the ANC's attempts to blame others for the violence is a massive disinformation campaign," he said. ANC spokesman Mr. Carl Niehaus expressed his shock over the SDU member's remarks and said that this is unacceptable. He said "by way of explanation, not justification" that the remarks must be viewed against the background of societal decline and violence in the region. It is a tragic indication of the circumstances under which young people have grown up, where violence has become part of their lives. "The ANC's position is clear. This (the murders) is unacceptable. The ANC will do everything possible to end this." Mr. Niehaus said that the ANC is working on a program to restructure SDUs insofar as that is possible. The ANC is trying to draw up guidelines to ensure that SDUs do not take the offensive, but rather act only in self-defense. It is the duty of everyone in South Africa to improve socio-economic conditions in places such as Tokoza and Katlehong in the Eastern Rand so that such people can have a meaningful future. The hostel problem must also be ironed out. Cooperation among all political parties and the entire community is necessary for that, as provided for in the holistic plan being worked on by President F.W. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela, as well as the ETC. "This must not be used for political propaganda. It is a problem that must be solved," Mr. Niehaus said.
