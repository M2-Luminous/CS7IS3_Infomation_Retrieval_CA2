More and more people from government departments, colleges, institutions and state-run enterprises are "plunging into the sea of business", as the Chinese expression for joining the private economy goes. By the end of March this year the number of private enterprises and individually-run firms had reached 95,173, employing 196,800 people. They have produced a total value of 1.83 billion yuan so far, a 43 percent increase over the same period of last year. The Wuhan city government has taken the economic growth in private sector as an important part of the reform in recent years. To make it work better, the government has drawn up a series of regulations and policies, urging government departments at all levels to turn on the green light for the registration, land use, personnel recruitment and money raising of private and individual enterprises. Now, most of the new private businesses can get their licences within two or three days. The development of the private economy not only provides jobs for both surplus staff of government departments and the unemployed, but also makes a great contribution to the development of the whole local economy.
