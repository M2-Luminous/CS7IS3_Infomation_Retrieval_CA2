What will our province's banking situation be in 1994? With this question in mind, this reporter interviewed Lin Zhenxiong, president of the provincial branch of the People's Bank of China. Lin Zhenxiong first affirmed our province's achievements in banking work last year. In 1993, our province scored remarkable achievements in macroeconomic regulation and control of the banking sector. Everybody credits "three factors" with bringing about the hard-won change from the extremely dire situation during the first six months to the trend toward basic stability by year's end: The effort by the central authorities to increase and improve the weight of policy decisions regarding macroeconomic regulation and control, the joint efforts by party committees and governments at all levels and by all departments, and the joint efforts by the entire banking sector. Thereafter, he said: Because some deep-seated problems pertaining to economic and banking operations have yet to be solved fundamentally, the foundation for basically stabilizing the current banking situation remains rather fragile, and there are still many contradictions and problems. He analyzed the main contradictions and problems in banking work as follows: Although the investment scale for fixed assets has been determined, it remains overextended, and the contradiction between supply and demand of funds remains glaring. The commodity price index has risen rather swiftly, posing formidable tasks for containing inflation. Working capital is still in short supply. On the one hand, the proportion of working capital to new loans in the state's credit plan for this year is the smallest in history; on the other, the substantial proportion of processing industries in our province's economy demands large amounts of working capital. Therefore, this year, banks will face new contraditions in arranging loans for use as working capital. Banking institutions of various types lack sound mechanisms by which they exercise self-restraint, and banking activity has yet to be regulated. Although banking order has improved somewhat, the chaotic state has yet to be rectified completely. A few banking institutions and some localities, departments, and units outside the banking sector have unduly pursued gains for small groups or individuals. The practice of indiscriminately collecting fees, providing financial assistance, granting loans, and raising interest rates will likely persist, and this will affect banking stability. What are the countermeasures? Lin Zhenxiong said: The party Central Committee has set forth the guiding principles for work to be carried out by the entire party, as well as overall economic work. It has determined the principle for carrying out this year's banking work: "Continuing to restore banking order, advancing banking reform steadily, strictly controlling the total credit volume, and earnestly tightening supervision and control over the banking sector." The establishment of this principle is of vital importance for solving contradictions and problems in banking work, for consolidating the achievements in macroeconomic regulation and control, and for promoting sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. According to this principle, our province's banking sector should focus on the following tasks this year: It should make earnest organizational efforts to implement the State Council's various measures for reforming the banking system, and make every effort to raise funds and increase its financial strength through the gradual establishment of a banking operational mechanism suited to the socialist market economic system. This year, it will implement a system of managing assets and liabilities ratios under the guidance of loan quotas. It will unify foreign exchange rates, abolish the practice of retaining portions of foreign exchange proceeds, conduct foreign exchange transactions through banks, inspire foreign trading enterprises' enthusiasm for earning foreign exchange from exports, and attract foreign funds. It will strictly control the total credit volume, especially loans for fixed assets investment, in accordance with the requirements of state macroeconomic policy decisions. The State Council recently issued a circular on continuing to tighten macroeconomic regulation and control over fixed assets, instructing that no efforts should be made to blindly increase investments, launch projects, and expand the investment scale without regard to macroeconomic conditions. As state banks, various banking institutions should properly perform their functions as banking departments in conjunction with planning commissions, economic commissions, and other economic departments under the leadership of local governments. They should exercise strict control over financial resources in accordance with the guidelines of the State Council's circular. We should continue to restore banking order and create a good banking environment that is conducive to healthy economic development. Because of last year's consolidation efforts, banking order is now taking a turn for the better. Nevertheless, all departments and localities, as well as banks at all levels, should pay close attention to preventing the occurrence of new problems under the new situation. Various banking institutions should exercise greater self-restraint and regulate their activities. The lessons of last year have taught everybody that chaotic banking order will inevitably tarnish the reputation of banking departments and ultimately affect economic development. Only by maintaining banking stability can we promote healthy economic development. Lin Zhenxiong hoped to send the following message to various departments through the media: According to the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, we should take a gigantic step forward in this year's reform of the banking system. This reform, however, can only be completed after a lengthy process. We cannot implement it in only one move; we should advance it steadily in conjunction with reforms in other fields. It is hoped that people in all circles will show greater understanding of and support for our province's reform of the banking system and banking work. Banking departments should maintain close contact with local governments, provide more briefings to party and government leaders, attract greater attention from leading party and government departments, and make more contributions to our province's reform, opening up, and economic development.
