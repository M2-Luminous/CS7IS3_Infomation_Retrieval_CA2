The study, which was prepared by the Arab League's General Department of Economic Affairs, on the expected consequences of the GATT agreement on the Arab economy, said that the outcome of the principle of liberalization of international trade, which is the basis of the agreement, will favor the industrial countries whose products and services enjoy a superior level of quality. It added that these countries will benefit from the implementation of the agreement in tackling the unemployment problem and increasing world demand for their products, and that the world trade growth rate will increase in favor of these countries. The study then said that, according to the agreement's clauses, special privileges will be granted to members of some economic groupings--namely countries belonging to the EU's Maastricht Treaty, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the Rome Agreement. It then explained that the deteriorating Arab growth rates of agricultural and industrial production confirm that the consequences of implementing the agreement will not be in favor of the Arab countries whose agricultural production represents only 1.5 percent of the overall world agricultural production while their industrial production represents only 0.5 percent of world production. The study pointed out that the price of agricultural and food products will treble as a result of the GATT decisions; this will absorb a major part of the Arab countries' financial revenues. It noted that current Arab agricultural imports total around $21 billion annually. It said that with the increase in the price of agricultural imports, the deficit in the Arab balances of payments will consequently increase; this will, in turn, lead to a similar increase in the deficits of public budgets. According to the agreement, agricultural subsidies for the member countries' production will be repealed and hence the (?Arab) countries will find themselves at a great disadvantage vis-a-vis agricultural imports from abroad, as the price of imported goods will be less than that of local Arab goods. This threatens to destroy Arab agricultural production in the long term unless advanced agricultural development is achieved. The study called for developing systems of Arab agricultural production, food security, and water availability in the future to help the Arab states face outside competition. The study highlighted the need to turn to agricultural mechanization; improve agricultural packing, transportation, storage, and marketing methods; cut back on consumption; and eliminate agricultural waste in production, transportation, and storage. The study touched on the GATT's effects on Arab industrial commodities. It pointed out that the Arab states will face tough competition in the future in the field of industrial products, particularly since raw materials represent a considerable part of Arab exports. In the meantime, the major industrial states endeavor to develop new alternatives to the raw materials they obtain from the developing nations, something that will weaken the competitive position of the Arab world. In this regard, the study noted that the Arab states have difficulty promoting Arab industrial products as an alternative to foreign imports, except in limited areas. For instance, the Arab world produces 10 million tons of iron annually, while the Arab markets need more than 16 million tons. The study emphasized that under the GATT agreement, a number of Arab industries will be affected by tough international competition, including petrochemicals, wooden products, ready-made clothing, paper, printing, and publishing industries. The study called for applying the rules of research and development and introducing quality methods and world standards on specifications to save Arab industries. On the freeing of trade in services, the study noted that this will result in unequal competition within the Arab markets in the fields of banking, insurance, transportation, tourism, communications, construction, cultural production, and aviation because the Arab states are importers of services. Meanwhile, these services are highly advanced in the developed nations. The GATT has expanded the concept of world trade to include government purchases, including purchases by the army, police, local governments, and public utilities, in which the public tenders will be subject to free world competition. Accordingly, the advanced states will gain a larger share of government tenders, which will amount to $100 billion in the year 2000, as compared to $22 billion in 1990. The study concluded that the Arab world will be greatly affected in the fields of government purchases and tenders for infrastructure and public sector projects. It also concluded that the Arab states will incur losses in the short and medium terms in the areas of agricultural and industrial production and services, while the price of imported commodities is expected to rise. The study recommended the need to devise integrated and modern economic and trade policies that rely on a common Arab will to remedy the expected losses. The GATT's decisions were issued during the Uruguay round last December. There are 115 member states of the GATT and two observer countries. Among the member states there are eight Arab countries: Egypt, Bahrain, Tunisia, Kuwait, Mauritania, Morocco, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia.
