The Supreme Soviet of Ukraine has finally decided to define its attitude toward the trilateral declaration of the presidents of Ukraine, the United States and Russia. As official sources have indicated more than once, this document proclaims the removal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine and defines the mechanism for compensation and security guarantees for our nation. All of the nuclear warheads, according to the trilateral declaration, will be removed from the territory of Ukraine to Russia for their subsequent dismantling in the shortest possible time. Russia will provide compensation in the form of deliveries of fuel rods for the requirements of Ukrainian nuclear power engineering. Ukraine will provide for the destruction of all nuclear weapons, including strategic offensive weapons, deployed on its territory within seven years, and all of the SS-24 missiles will be deactivated within ten months through the removal of their nuclear charges. Russia will in turn guarantee the technical servicing and safe operation of the nuclear warheads. The United States will provide technical and financial assistance for the reliable and safe dismantling of the nuclear weapons. Everything that is contained in the trilateral declaration and the addendum to the declaration, from the point of view of President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk, conforms to the requirements posed by the Supreme Soviet regarding ratification of the START-1 treaty and satisfies the restrictions advanced by the people's deputies. There were 13 such restrictions, and they talked chiefly about the aforementioned security guarantees and the granting of financial and technical assistance directed toward the elimination of the nuclear arsenal. Life has confirmed once again, however, that there are as many ideas as there are people. And when we are talking about politicians, then they could have even more. There were meetings the day before the recent session of the Supreme Soviet by the commissions on questions of defense and national security, questions of legislation and legality, foreign affairs and the working deputies' commission to study the START-1 treaty. The aim of the session was to prepare findings regarding the conformity of the trilateral declaration signed on January 14 in Moscow. Since there was not a quorum at the session, they did not come to any unified findings, but each commission came to its own findings separately. Since it would be out of place to cite those findings, we will address the results of the working commission to study the START-1 treaty. According to the statement by President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk, the members of that commission indicate, he has confirmed his "commitment to the fact that Ukraine join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NNPT] as a state not possessing nuclear weapons in the shortest possible time." The Supreme Soviet, at the same time, had earlier considered Ukraine to be the possessor of nuclear weapons, and only the realization of START-1 "would open up the way for the resolution by the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine of the question of joining the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty." Another detail is connected with the fact that the trilateral declaration indicates that "Ukraine will provide for the destruction of all nuclear weapons, including strategic offensive weapons, deployed on its territory," even though the Supreme Soviet has stipulated the destruction of only 36 percent of the missile delivery systems and 42 percent of the nuclear warheads. Moreover, this presidential wording obligates Ukraine to destroy not only all nuclear weapons within seven years, but also all strategic offensive weapons along with their infrastructure. After all, as was indicated on this score in a memorandum of the U.S. embassy, "any preservation of deployed SS-24 ICBMs after the seven-year period of cutbacks under the START treaty would be in contradiction to the obligations of Ukraine, whether those missiles are fitted with nuclear or conventional warheads," and the United States "will not agree to any weakening of this obligation." This categorical American attitude signifies that the prospects for the creation of high-precision weaponry with conventional warheads based on the SS-24 delivery system as a means of strategic deterrence are quite uncertain. The terms of compensation for tactical nuclear weapons, financing for inspection activities, the possibility of using launch silos for peaceful purposes, the use of weapons-grade plutonium, and expenditures for the social support of officers and warrant officers of the missile forces who will be discharged from the army owing to the cutbacks all remain uncertain in the trilateral declaration. I am citing all of these contradictions in great detail in order to give a better sense of the tension that was present in the hall of the Supreme Soviet during the discussion of the trilateral declaration, the ratification of the START-1 treaty and the joining of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The speeches by President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk, Minister of Defense of Ukraine General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy Radetskyy and Minister of Foreign Affairs Anatoliy Zlenko stressed once again the fact that nuclear weapons are no guarantee of security for us, we are not able to maintain them, and to go against the world opinion, even if you are correct, is a hopeless matter. Nuclear weapons for Ukraine, in the current economic difficulties, are almost a suitcase for a drowning man -- too heavy to hold on to, but a shame to let go of. The fate of the nuclear weapons stationed on the territory of Ukraine was resolved in two hours of discussion by the two paragraphs of a Decree of the Supreme Soviet, namely: 1. Bearing in mind the specific steps taken by the President and Government of Ukraine with regard to the fulfillment of the provisions of the Decree of the Supreme Soviet of 18 November 1993 and the reciprocal steps on the part of the United States and Russia, to remove the restrictions with regard to Article 5 of the Protocol to the START Treaty that was signed in Lisbon on 23 May 1993. 2. To authorize the Government of Ukraine to exchange letters on the ratification of the START-1 treaty and to make more active the actions of the Government to reach a concrete agreement that flows out of the restrictions of the Supreme Soviet regarding the ratification of the START-1 Treaty. What do the two paragraphs of this short decree mean? First, that very difficult and painstaking work lies ahead. At least five treaties or agreements will have to be reached, which translate or at least should translate the declarative substance of many provisions of the trilateral declaration into the area of concrete, detailed and documented mutual obligations. This pertains first and foremost to a schedule for the dispatch of the first lot of nuclear warheads to Russia, an agreement pertaining to the procedure and conditions for monitoring their dismantling and salvaging on the part of Ukraine, an agreement on compensation for the value of the nuclear weapons transferred to Russia, and an agreement on guarantor's and originator's oversight of the status of the warheads that are still in Ukraine, including their transport to "S" facilities and plant yards. Second, that it is still too soon to put a period to the resolution of the problem of the nuclear weapons stationed in Ukraine, since a thing or two remains that is not entirely clear or resolved. Although the removal of the restrictions pertaining to Article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol also envisages Ukraine's joining in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, after all, the deputies were still disinclined to the possibility during the voting. Ukraine, under legal canons, does not have the slightest right to demand compensation for strategic and tactical nuclear weapons in joining the NNPT. The United States and Russia, however, as indicated in the trilateral declaration, will provide Kiev with security guarantees only in the event Ukraine joins the NNPT. So the circle closes. And only time will tell what the way out of this legal-political stalemate will be...
