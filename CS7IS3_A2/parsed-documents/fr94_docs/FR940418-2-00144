SUMMARY: This notice announces the withdrawal, under Notice 89&hyph;61, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 717, of a petition requesting that acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) pellets be added to the list of taxable substances in section 4672(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tyrone J. Montague, Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Passthroughs and Special Industries), (202) 622&hyph;3130 (not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On September 12, 1989, a Notice of Filing was published in the Federal Register (54 FR 37757) announcing the acceptance of a petition for ABS submitted by GE Chemicals. Upon consideration of the written comments received, it has been decided that ABS is a member of the ``polystyrene resins and copolymers'' group of taxable substances and, as such, is already on the initial list of taxable substances in section 4672(a)(3), effective January 1, 1989. Accordingly, the petitioner is withdrawing that petition. In addition, on April 14, 1992, a Notice of Receipt of Petitions was published in the Federal Register (57 FR 12956) announcing the receipt of a petition for ABS submitted by Dow Chemical Company. That petition by Dow is not accepted because ABS is a substance on the initial list of taxable substances in section 4672(a)(3). Dale D. Goode, Federal Register Liaison Officer, Assistant Chief Counsel (Corporate). [FR Doc. 94&hyph;9193 Filed 4&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4830&hyph;01&hyph;U
