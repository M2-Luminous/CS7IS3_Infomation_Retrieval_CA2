Last year they introduced some 700 items of the achievements of science and technology such as new coal-cutting method, rice harvester combine and developer for the electronic duplicating machine, thus making a sizable contribution to the development of the national economy and the improvement of the people's standard of living. The scientists and technicians dispatched to the Sunchon District coal mining complex introduced a method of cutting coal layers downwards so that the coal output per cutting face could be raised 1.5-2 times. A coal mine under the complex produced an extra 210,000 tons of coal last year by introducing this method. Those who are active at the Pyongyang thermal power complex resolved some 40 problems of science and technology in raising the combustion rate of boilers and keeping a steady rate of electric production to increase the annual generating capacity by 200 million kwh. Those dispatched to the sector of light industry built a production process of super-plastic material, new shoe moulds and lasts so as to diversify the variety and increase productivity. The February 17 shock brigades of scientists and technicians have solved a large number of scientific and technical problems of great importance to the chuche orientation, modernization and scientization of the national economy. Among them are note-worthy successes such as development of 300 kinds of micro and hi-fi electronic elements and NC devices, completion of the method of laser heating and massproduction of precision alloy steel and micro alloy steel. They also solved many problems in such advanced science and technology as cell engineering, genetic engineering and ultracryogenics. Thanks to their activities in recent years, the remote control and computerization of production processes have reached a higher stage at many industrial establishments including the Hwanghae iron and steel complex and the Puryong alloy steel complex, and many coal and ore mines nearly doubled the production. The shock brigades, which play a big role in developing the national economy, were organised on February 17, 1978 by dear Comrade Kim Chong-il. Comrade Kim Chong-il laid down the policy of dispatching scientists and technicians to work sites in order to solve problems arising in production and actively develop new technologies in reliance on the collective strength of the producers, and took all necessary measures including the action programme, guidance system and supply conditions for the shock brigades. Last year, he dispatched such shock brigades to 19 new important units of the national economy and provided them with good conditions for scientific research. The shock brigades total more than 60 and involve some 8,000 competent scientists and technicians.
