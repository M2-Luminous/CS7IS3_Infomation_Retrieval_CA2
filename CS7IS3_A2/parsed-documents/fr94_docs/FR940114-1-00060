FR940114-1-00060 FR940114-1-00009 Are These School Bus Safety Measures Effective in Reducing Crashes, Injuries, and Fatalities? As stated previously, school buses already provide the safest form of transportation in our country. Since the number of fatalities that are school bus-related is already so small, it is difficult to quantify the benefits of the actions that have been taken. The agencies believe, however, that these measures are the ones most likely to reduce or eliminate fatal and serious injuries. Determination Regarding School Bus Safety Based upon the agencies' review of the available material regarding the scope of the problem, including FHWA studies regarding bus driver training and driver fatigue, we have determined that significant attention has been devoted to school bus safety, and steps have been taken to improve the already excellent safety record of this mode of transportation. In view of the successful measures already taken, the agencies do not view school bus transportation as a problem nearly as significant as other highway safety program areas. Furthermore, the states already have the ability under the section 402 program to address school bus and other highway safety programs, and are proficient in allocating existing resources as they deem necessary to achieve maximum safety benefits. In addition, the recent designation of Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety as a National Priority program area has facilitated the States' ability to address the majority of school bus-related fatalities, which occur while children are boarding or existing, not riding the bus. The agencies believe that the establishment of School Bus Safety as a priority area could result in States shifting 402 funds away from other priority programs, and that the expenditure of an increased level of 402 funds in this manner would not significantly affect the overall safety of school buses. Therefore, the agencies tentatively conclude that School Bus Safety should not be included as a National Priority program at this time. The agencies wish to stress that this tentative decision should not be construed to imply that the current resources focused upon School Bus Safety should be reduced or redirected. NHTSA and FHWA believe that all existing efforts in this area should be continued to maintain the impressive safety record associated with school bus transportation. The agencies hereby request data, statistics, and other substantive information relevant to this determination. Comments Those wishing to comment on this document should limit comments to the safety aspects of these two programs, and submit data or statistics which demonstrate the extent of the nation's highway safety problem which is attributable to either Speeding or School Bus Safety, along with any discussion of countermeasures which are or could be effective in reducing the number of deaths and injuries in either of these two areas. In determining whether these programs should be identified as National Priority Programs, the agencies will determine whether the problem is of national concern; whether effective countermeasures have been developed to address the concern; and whether State programs appear to be among the most effective as compared to other traffic safety program areas. In order to expedite the submission of comments, simultaneous with issuance of this notice, copies of this notice will be mailed to all Governors and Governors' Representatives for Highway Safety. Comments should not exceed 15 pages in length. It is requested but not required that 10 copies be submitted. Necessary attachments may be appended to these submissions without regard to the 15-page limit. This limitation is intended to encourage commenters to detail their primary arguments in a concise fashion. All comments received before the closing date indicated above will be considered, and will be available for examination in the docket at the above address both before and after that date. To the extent possible, comments filed after the closing date will also be considered. However, the rulemaking action may proceed at any time after that date. The agencies will continue to file relevant material in the docket as it becomes available after the closing date, and it is recommended that interested persons continue to examine the docket for new material. Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their comments in the docket should enclose, in the envelope with their comments, a pre-addressed stamped postcard. Upon receiving the comments, the docket supervisor will return the postcard by mail. Economic and Other Effects The agencies have considered the impacts that would be associated with this proposed action, and determined that it is significant within the meaning of Executive Order 12866 and the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures since it raises policy issues concerning the setting of priority programs. This rulemaking document was reviewed under E.O. 12866. The rulemaking would not affect the level of funding available in the highway safety program, or otherwise have a significant economic impact. The agency has prepared a Preliminary Regulatory Evaluation which is available in the docket.
