Addressing an extended meeting of the Russian Government, the president said, "this is particularly necessary in the present situation over which the danger of confrontation is looming." He was referring to the recent amnesty decision made by the State Duma, or Lower House of the Russian Parliament, under which former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy and former Parliament Speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov were freed last Saturday [26 February] from Moscow's Lefortovo Prison. He said he is "fully aware of the contradictory nature of the decision made by State Duma and the haste with which it was fulfilled." The president stressed that he "believed and continue to believe that the constitution, the law and moral norms were violated." He warned the the amnesty could lead to confrontation again. "Russia is different today," Yeltsin said, "it has a constitution and peaceful potential for resolving its problems." The meeting, attended by government ministers, leaders of state executive bodies, Parliament chamber speakers and local leaders, is being held in the Kremlin to discuss the economic performances last year and the reform tasks for this year.
