The head of state, General Sani Abacha, stated Nigeria's objection to the classification today in Abuja during his maiden press briefing of media executives. State House correspondent Chris Nguw reports that Gen. Abacha described the briefing as an opportunity for forging a productive government-media partnership: [Begin recording] Nguw: The head of state's briefing centered on six issues: Government-press relationship, the economic policy, foreign policy, the imminent constitutional conference, drug trafficking, and the Nigerian-Cameroon dispute over the Bakassi Peninsula. One of the highlights of the briefing was his reference to the United States' recent listing of Nigeria as an uncooperative country in the fight against drug trafficking as a political smoke screen, without doubt a genuine component of the United States policy on drug control. Gen. Abacha said the United States' pronouncement was a surprise, especially as Nigeria's efforts at combating drug trafficking are well known and have been recently applauded by the American Embassy in Nigeria and the United States drug administration. He said his administration would, however, not be deterred in the fight against drug trafficking. Abacha: Be that as it may, it should be understood by all concerned that this administration is going to continue its fight against drug trafficking and the related crimes just from our concern to ensure that the drug taking culture does not take firm roots in our society. We shall intensify our antidrug crusade. Of course, we believe it is right to do so in our national interest and to protect our society from its cancerous effects that we have observed in Western societies. We urge the Western governments to look inwards into their own societies and curb the excessive appetite of their own citizens, which creates the demand for drugs. [applause] Nigeria does not produce any hard drugs. Nigerians are not a drug consuming people. [passage omitted]
