M. Basova, Voronezh Oblast Epidemiological Station] [Text] Air sampling requires laboratory technicians to spend a long time in an atmosphere of toxic substances and to endure a significant physical load. This device is intended to hold absorbers and filter holders. It can be used by an operator to take samples while he is located outside the atmosphere of toxic substances. There is a pin 3 threaded into a hole in cover 2 of an electric-powered aspirator 1 (see figure). A rod 4 made from Duralumin tubing with an inside diameter equal to the diameter of the pin is mounted on the pin. The length of the tubes is varied in height from 60 to 80 cm depending on the air sampling requirements. A comb 5 made from an angle (50x50x250 mm) is mounted on the free end of the rod. It is secured to the rod by means of a threaded connection 6, for which purpose the corresponding hole is drilled into the horizontal part of the comb. There are holes 7 with a diameter of 20-30 mm in the horizontal part of the comb for the absorption instruments, and slots 8 and 9 of different widths in the vertical part to hold the corresponding types of adapters. The device can be used to sample air at heights of 160-170 and 95-100 cm--that is, when working in standing and seated position. The device has enjoyed wide use in public health and chemical laboratories of Voronezh Oblast. Izdatelstvo ``Meditsina,'' 1993
