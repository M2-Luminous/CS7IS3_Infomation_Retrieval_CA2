He had this to say, among other things, about the outcome of his trip: [Begin Zieleniec recording] The character of the visit was primarily to put a seal on the present level of relations between our two countries. We have also signed mutual letters, in which we have confirmed the validity of obligations both countries have against each other in international law. Moreover, Switzerland is our important trade partner. Despite its being such a small country, it occupies 12th position in our trade relations with the outside world, which is very remarkable. It was therefore natural that we should have also discussed matters concerning the expansion of trade and economic cooperation. Swiss companies are participating with distinction in the process of the transformation of the economy. I have, however, also noted that the first swallows of our capital expansion, if I may say so, have appeared in Switzerland. Some of our companies have already set up mixed companies or branches directly in Switzerland. [end recording]
