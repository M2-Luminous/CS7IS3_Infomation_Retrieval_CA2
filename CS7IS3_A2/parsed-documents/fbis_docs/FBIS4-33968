Investors will be allowed easier access to the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA) [as received] after setting up plants there, Chuang Chih-lung, an overseas Chinese authorized by the zone to court Taiwan investment, said Saturday. Chuang made the call for more Taiwan investment in the wake of Republic of China Premier Lien Chan's visit to Mexico last week. The only Taiwan companies currently operating in the industrial zone are computer makers, Chuang said. Most of the investors in the zone, which encompasses a population of a million people, come from the United States, Japan, and Taiwan, Chuang noted. He said the low cost of rent in the zone and the cheap and abundant labor force there make it an ideal place for Taiwan investors wanting to break into the North American market.
