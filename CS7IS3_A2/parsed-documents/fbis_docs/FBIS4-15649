A new professional and social base takes shape. Gennady Burbulis, member of the State Duma, president of the Humanitarian and Political Sciences Centre "Strategia" (strategy), said in an interview to ITAR-TASS. He said that the new political reality is "the part of the pragmatically-minded population that for various reasons kept from engaging in active politics, but on whose specific activity the stability, meaningfulness and constructiveness of all undertakings in Russia will depend in future." Regarding his quitting Russia's Choice faction, Burbulis said: "I have not as much quitted Russia's Choice as I meet halfway the new reality. I objects to its being overlooked." Burbulis believes there is no need to cling to slogans and ideological values that have been used for three years now. "The activity of Russia's choice is quite justifiable, but it risks to go into a dead alley unless the changed situation is taken into notice," he said. Burbulis regards as a new political force, first of all, the December 12th group in the duma. He said there are also quite a few deputies in other factions upholding the same positions. Regarding his political career, Burbulis said he is not going to become a leader of the new political force. "I shall be pressing for its recognition and unification on a constructive basis and I shall be promoting the emergence of new leaders," he said.
