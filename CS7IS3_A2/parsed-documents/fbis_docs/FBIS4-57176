This terminal, located right next to the Yankee naval base, had profits of $125,000 during the first four months of 1994 as a result of its prompt dispatch of ships. To date, the terminal's port workers have loaded some 20 ships from different countries, and have earned $1.05 in profits for every ton moved, which is more than twice the income earned during the last such identical period.
