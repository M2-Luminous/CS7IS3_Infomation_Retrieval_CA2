More than 100 people attending the meeting reviewed the international situation in the past year and warmly discussed future trends. The experts held that peace and development remained the two major themes of the contemporary world. In the past year, some tendencies are noteworthy: First, the economy in the East Asian region rose, and the center of gravity of the world economy was moving toward the Asia-Pacific region. Against the background of extensive recession in the world economy, East Asia was becoming the locomotive of the world economy. Second, some old regional hot spots eased, but new hot spots emerged, and turbulence will continue to spread. In the past year, breakthroughs were made on some old hot-spot issues, and the most important event was the conclusion of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement. However, from the Outer Caucasus to the Balkans, a large number of territorial, ethnic, and religious conflicts were emerging. The Russian situation and its future strategic tendency also attracted serious attention. Third, there was a multitude of contradictions within the Western world, and the leading position of the United States was being continuously weakened. The contradictions among the United States, Japan, and Western Europe developed further. The process of multipolarization in the world was accelerating. The domestic and foreign policies of the United States were still undergoing adjustments. Fourth, the world was in a period of adjusting military strategies, and the main tendency was: The strategies mainly aimed at major wars were being replaced by strategies mainly aimed at minor wars; preparations against enemies in reality were shifted to preparations against potential rivals in larger numbers; the building of large strong forces was being shifted to the building of modern crack troops able to react rapidly. Fifth, China's economic development and social stability enhanced the nation's international status. When looking to future tendencies in the international situation, people expressed the following opinions: First, hegemonism and power politics remain in the world, but the process of multipolarization has been quickened. In particular, Germany and Japan are seeking the status of world powers, and this tendency will become more obvious in the future. Second, the danger of "neo-interventionism" will increase. Because regional conflicts will occur frequently, international interventions and peace-keeping actions will substantially increase. This will provide opportunities for some big powers to seek hegemony. The struggle against interventionism will be a major aspect of international struggle in the future. Third, the strength of the developing countries will continue to grow. The regional economic organizations in Asia, Latin America, and Africa will further develop. Economic cooperation will bring about political coordination and will give rise to some regional dialogue organizations. They will share common interests in safeguarding independence, opposing power politics, and striving for the establishment of an international political and economic order. The comrades attending the meeting unanimously agreed that in the contemporary world, comprehensive national strength will form the foundation for a country's strategy, and that economic strength is the foundation of comprehensive national strength. Therefore, we must continue to carry out the party's basic line of taking economic construction as the central task, properly handle our own affairs, and join the people throughout the world in striving for the establishment of an international political and economic order characterized by peaceful coexistence, equality, and mutual benefit.
