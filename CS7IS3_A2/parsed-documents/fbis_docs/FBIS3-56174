A ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA special correspondent asked Yevgeniy Arefyev, deputy head of the Russian Federation government apparatus, to comment. [Ignatyev] Yevgeniy Parfiryevich, on first acquaintance with the edict the impression is that minor changes have been made to the structure of government, the number of ministries is little reduced, and there has been practically no reduction in cabinet numbers. The question is: Was this restructuring necessary? [Arefyev] Yes, the media are currently claiming that there have been no significant changes in the structure of the government. That is not so. First of all I want to say that the reorganization of federal organs of executive authority was necessary in view of the adoption of the Russian Federation Constitution, since there were many elements in the old structure that did not correspond to the country's main law. For instance, we have 22 ministries and 15 state committees. The latter's chairmen were members of the government, together with the ministers. Article 110 of the Constitution makes no provision for that. Point 2 says: "The Government of the Russian Federation comprises the chairman of the Russian Federation Government, the deputy chairmen of the Russian Federation Government, and federal ministers." That is why some state committees were turned into federal ministries. For instance, the Russian Federation State Committee for Economic Cooperation With Commonwealth States was turned into the Russian Federation Ministry for Cooperation With CIS States. The word "economic" was deliberately removed from the old name. So the functions of the new structure have been expanded. [Ignatyev] So it was decided, as it were, to adapt the new government structure to the Constitution? [Arefyev] No. The entire restructuring of the federal organs of executive authority was a response to the command of the times, to the new economic and social transformations that are currently taking place in our country. We are not just changing nameplates. Indeed, some ministries were created by combining state committees with other departments with related functions and activities. For example, the Russian Federation Ministry for Civil Defense, Emergencies, and for Eliminating the Aftermath of Natural Disasters was the successor to the state committee of the same name. But it incorporated the functions of the former Russian Federation State Committee for the Social Protection of Citizens and Rehabilitation of Territories Affected by the Chernobyl and Other Radiation Disasters, the Committee on Special Underwater Work, and the Russian Federation Air and Space Search and Rescue Service. [Ignatyev] So there was practically no reduction and some departments acquired higher status by being revamped or combined, while others joined other government structures? [Arefyev] All state committees left the government. Some of them did become ministries; others were absorbed into new structures, while nine of the 15 remained autonomous. They are performing the same functions as before, but they are operating within the framework of the law. I think this is the right decision. Irrespective of any change of government, the leadership of these committees will not now be replaced. As a rule, they are structures with very specific functions. Their work requires stability above all else. But some departments, such as the Russian Federation State Committee for the Management of State Property, could be turned into ministries, if necessary. It would require the Federal Assembly's adoption of a number of amendments to existing laws. Whereupon, the president would be able to issue an edict transforming the department. So of the 37 former members of the government who were heads of ministries or state committees, only 23 remain. Don't you call that a significant reduction?! We are nearly matching world standards now. The world average for cabinet members is between 12 and 25. We now have a total of 29 instead of 45. [Ignatyev] Is it possible to say at this point who will be the top people in the new cabinet? The press has already suggested the names of Gaydar, Soskovets... [Arefyev] First of all I want to say that for the moment all the members of government are performing their duties as before. None has been dismissed. It is too early to talk about a new leadership. But if consultations have taken place in this matter, only two people -- Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin and Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin -- can put specific names to the deputy prime ministers. And the press is misinforming you by publishing the names of candidates. We will get precise information in the very near future and we will certainly tell you.
