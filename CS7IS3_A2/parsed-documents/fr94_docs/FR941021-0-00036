FR941021-0-00036 FR941021-0-00002 The Agency anticipates that circumstances may arise beyond the borrower's control that could warrant restructuring the debt prior to the next scheduled installment coming due. In these cases, since the set-aside brings the account current, the borrower may be considered for a writedown or net recovery buyout as set forth in subpart S of part 1951 and/or granted assistance in accordance with §1941.14 of subpart A of part 1941 of this chapter only if the set-aside is reversed and the addendum cancelled. If the set-aside is reversed, the account will reflect the current payment status as if the payment had never been set-aside. In the case of entity borrowers, all members of the entity liable for the debt must apply for set-aside in order for FmHA to consider the application. This procedure is consistent with that under subpart S of part 1951. The set-aside program will be available only until July 1, 1995. This timeframe will provide those borrowers who have already made their payment that was due after the disaster ample time to determine if the loss they incurred from the disaster will affect their repayment ability for the following year.
