It was building housing in Kaliningrad for families of officers being withdrawn from the Baltic states. We have often talked about Vladis Laurinavichius, director general of Selma, who concluded a private contract with the Russian Defense Ministry to develop a residential area of 2,000 apartments and about the impressive construction site that he began near Kaliningrad that provided work for several thousand Lithuanian construction workers. The Russian Defense Ministry in turn was a reliable contractor and by agreement turned over part of the Baltic Fleet's property, money, and oil as barter to the Lithuanian side. In return it was to receive quality housing. It would seem that one could ask for nothing more, that a mechanism for a civilized and mutually beneficial solution to the troop withdrawal problem had been found. This was precisely what permitted the redeployment of units from Lithuania in a short period of time. However, it seems that this situation was not to the liking of representatives of the opposition, who are longing for power. And then the Lithuanian special services unexpectedly arrested Vladis Laurinavichius for allegedly storing explosives in his apartment, on the very day he was planning to go to Kaliningrad to meet Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. [Video cuts to show Russian Defense Minister Grachev talking to camera] [Begin Grachev recording] He, Vladis, was told that I am carrying a directive from the prime minister in which the payment terms were stipulated. In other words, I have brought the barter goods for them. We were supposed to settle with him with oil as we had envisaged. So, as you can see, I have the directive in my briefcase but I cannot hand it to the director general nor can I thank him. [end recording] So it looks like a detective story, does it not? However, I think it has been written in a rather clumsy way and not in the best traditions of this style. One may ask: Why does a major businessman who deals with money totalling billions need to store explosives in his apartment? None of the representatives of Lithuanian Sejm deputies who arrived at the construction site could answer this question. However, they showed obvious eagerness to continue the Selma Association's work, however, in such a way that the profits would not go to the association but to designated government functionaries. This position did not find any support among the Baltic Fleet command, which concluded the agreement with Laurinavichius and was confident of his responsibility, nor did it find support among Lithuanian construction workers. They declared that they are stopping work until their leader returns. This is what happens when politicians meddle in a normal and mutually beneficial business, said former Lithuanian Defense Minister Audrius Bytkiavichius, who defended Selma in several press articles. In the meantime, the construction site is at a standstill and if some goodwill gestures are not forthcoming from the Lithuanian side, the conflict may unnecessarily complicate relations between the two states. [Video cuts to shot of Grachev] [Begin Grachev recording] Of course, I consider this to be a misunderstanding, moreover, because our relations with the Lithuanian leadership are not bad. This concerns the withdrawal of troops and the issue of the residence of the Russian-speaking population. Of course, this unpleasant moment will not benefit Russian-Lithuanian relations.
