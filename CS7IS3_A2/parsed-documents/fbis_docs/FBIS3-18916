This recommendation was primarily addressed to Estonia and Latvia, since this problem with minorities does not exist in Lithuania. Solving the problem is of "outstanding importance for the future of the relations with Russia as a whole," Kinkel said. Kinkel assured all three republics of German support for the gradual approach to the European Union and the Western European Union with the final goal of full membership. Closer cooperation is also to be striven for with NATO. Promoting a better relationship between the Baltic States and Russia was the central topic of the meeting, with which the foreign ministers of the Baltic Sea republics met with Kinkel in Germany for the first time. Kinkel stressed the "particularly close relationship" both with the Baltic States and with Russia. At the beginning of the meeting, he stressed that the date of 31 August 1994 for the withdrawal of the Russian troops from Estonia and Latvia must be observed and that there are no reasons for delay. Estonia was represented by Juri Luik, Latvia by Georgs Andrejevs, and Lithuania by Povilas Gylys.
