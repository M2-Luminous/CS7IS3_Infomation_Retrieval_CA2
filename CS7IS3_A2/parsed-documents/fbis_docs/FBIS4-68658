Kirpichnikov: "Russian Community in Azerbaijan Backs Geydar Aliyev and Sergey Baburin"] [Text] Russian All-People's Union holds press conference A press conference was held by deputies, members of the unregistered group "Russian Way", who visited Azerbaijan at the invitation of the Russian community (ROA) [Russian Community of Azerbaijan]. As a result a cooperation agreement was signed yesterday in the presence of the journalists between the ROA and Sergey Baburin's Russian All-People's Union. Then the organizers spoke about their visit. They were received by Geydar Aliyev and other ROA leaders at the cultural center of the Slavs of Azerbaijan and visited camps for refugees liberated from Armenians, as well as settlements, and villages populated by ethnic Russians. According to the deputies the Russian community supports the policy of Mr. Aliyev and shares the burden of war around Nagornyy Karabakh, surprised at the indifference of the Russian side. The deputies condemned action taken by Armenia in seizing foreign lands, the non-fulfillment of UN resolutions, and the pro-Armenian SMI [mass media], they were also shocked by the state of the refugees and the inaction of Russia and underscored the loss of trust in it by Azerbajanis and local Russians. Mention was also made of recruiting points for mercenaries on Russian soil and of the fact that peace proposals of the Russian Federation with regard to the withdrawal of the warring sides from the line of contact are unacceptable to Azerbaijan. The only area in which the positions of Geydar Aliyev, the Russian All-People's Union, and the Russian community of Azerbaijan diverged pertained to the question of the revival of USSR: in calling for closer unification with Russia Mr. Aliyev stands for independence and the CIS; Mr. Baburin hints that first there is the CIS, and then it is not too far to something like the Soviet Union; the ROA chief, Mr. Zabelin, without being specific, speaks of unity. That divergence leads to certain banalities. The problem of ethnic Russians in Azerbaijan, naturally, exists. Also a no less natural fact is that they support the leadership of the warring country in everything: this is not the Baltic region for you--expression of discontent may cost you some blood. And the desire to receive cultural support, and whenever possible materials support, from the historical homeland is totally understandable. The viewpoint of the Azerbaijan leadership with regard to its own actions and the Russian community, in connection with these actions, is equally predictable. Finally, the Russian Federation leadership must unconditionally support Russian communities on both sides of the front, both politically, socially and culturally. It must also take into account the attitude of the leadership of the warring sides toward the given communities, without even mentioning the historical, "geopolitical," simple political, and simple ethnic evaluations of what is taking place. It is simpler for the Russian All-People's Union and it may allow itself to grumble publicly without being particularly concerned with objectivity. Let us say, a comparison of the situation in Nagornyy Karabakh and in Bosnia is completely proper: in both places it is terrible, in both places Christians are persecuting Muslims, and states not recognized by anyone were proclaimed on officially foreign land. Mr. Baburin, however, who visited both regions, in one case supports "the victim," and in the other "the aggressor." In order to preserve some semblance of logic he promulgates the version of a world conspiracy whose goal is to throw firewood on the fire of conflicts from any side just so that it would burn hotter--a world conspiracy understandably supported by world forces of Evil. With that thesis Baburin places himself not only in the position of a person with whom it is improper to argue, but, taking into account the literary legacy of Zhirinovskiy, in a position that is already occupied by a more astute predecessor. Unfortunately, international "Baburinism" is peculiar to many leading and rank-and-file deputies of the State Duma who have visited one of the warring sides in some conflict, and it is completely normal if the deputation from the lower chamber dispatched to the Balkans will return with a similar world outlook. Even that, however, is not the entire problem. The reliance of truly suffering Russian-speaking, Serbian-speaking people, and others on political fringes or warring dilettantes leads not only to exaggerated self-appraisal and inadequate acts, but also, inevitably, to a cautious attitude by persons conducting real Russian policy.
