Asked about the law on the protection of investment by Taiwan compatriots which was promulgated by the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee recently, Zhou, spokesman for the current session of the Eighth NPC, said that the law was designed to suit the current situation. He said that economic exchanges across the Taiwan straits and Taiwan investment in the Mainland have been increasing substantially. But there are still no direct transport and commercial links between the two sides of the straits. Zhou said that the new law is formulated to ensure the personal safety and economic interests and rights of Taiwan investors to the Mainland and keep their enterprises on the Mainland from being requisitioned. This has fully demonstrated the Mainland's respect for the interests and rights of Taiwan investors and its sincerity in developing trade relations across the straits, he said. Asked about possibility of an agreement on protection of investment by the two sides, Zhou said that Taiwan is an inseparable part of China and the relations between the Chinese Central Government and Taiwan are the relations between a central government and a locality. "It is out of the question that the two sides may sign any agreement," he said. In response to a question about whether Hong Kong's three-tier political structure will be terminated when China resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, the spokesman blamed the uncooperative attitude of the British side for the breakdown of Sino-British talks on the Hong Kong issue. Zhou pointed out that the three-tier political structure of Hong Kong will be terminated by June 30, 1997, the date set in the Sino- British joint declaration. Asked about NPC accelerating the pace of legislation and strengthening legislative supervision, he said that the NPC and its standing committee has accelerated legislation, especially in the economic field, in the past year. It passed 22 laws in 1993, including 12 economic laws, setting a record in NPC history. He said that last year the NPC Standing Committee sent ten inspection teams to 15 provinces and autonomous regions to oversee the implementation of the laws, and learned opinions of relevant departments on key tasks of the government and the issues that people are concerned about. The spokesman said that the Eighth NPC will strive to promulgate 152 laws during its term of service, which will end in 1998. The laws will form the framework of the legal system of the socialist market economy and perfect legislation in other areas. At the press conference attended by several hundred correspondents from China and abroad, Zhou also answered questions about Sino-U.S. relations, reform of large- and medium-sized state- owned enterprises and the securities law.
