The Nordic foreign ministers have had talks in Stockholm about developments in Russia and the Baltic countries. The Nordic countries will assist the Baltic countries in setting up their own peacekeeping force. [Correspondent Mikko Maeaettaelae] The Nordic foreign ministers gathered in Stockholm, who were joined by the newcomer Tore Godal of Norway, devoted a large part of their talks to issues in areas in their close vicinity. Finnish Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto commented on the latest news from Russia on the resignation of Finance Minister Fedorov by voicing the hope that he would be replaced by an equally good man. On the other hand, Haavisto suspects that the reform policy in Russia will slow down. The Nordic foreign ministers point to the aggressive nationalist trends appearing in Russia, voicing the hope that Russia will adhere to the foreign policy it has chosen and that it will become closer to the rest of Europe. The hope is expressed that Russia will respect the inviolability of other states. The foreign ministers urge Russia and, on the other hand, Estonia and Latvia to reach an agreement on the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltics. This is what Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto had to say: [Begin recording] [Haavisto] It is based on the international treaties concluded and it would increase stability here in northern Europe, in our close vicinity. [Maeaettaelae] How rapid a withdrawal would the Nordic countries wish for? [Haavisto] As I have seen it, the issue between these Baltic countries and Russia has been that withdrawal should take place by the autumn. [Maeaettaelae] The Danish defense minister has said that a new cold war can be expected in Europe unless Russia withdraws its troops from the Baltics. What do you say to this? [Haavisto] I don't think it is a question of that. These countries are now having businesslike talks with each other and I believe that they will be acting in accordance with the principles as they have promised at various international conferences. [end recording] [Maeaettaelae] The Nordic foreign ministers take a positive view of the fact that the Baltic countries are joining peacekeeping work. The Nordic countries are prepared to assist the Baltic countries in establishing a peacekeeping unit operating under the auspices of either the United Nations or the CSCE. This is what Foreign Minister Haavisto has to say about Finland's ways of helping: [Begin recording] [Haavisto] Well, mainly in training. We have considered that we have the capacity in Niinisalo to take on pupils for training from the Baltic countries -- that is the primary way in which we are taking part. [Maeaettaelae] Is this in fact military assistance? [Haavisto] No, this is purely training specifically for peacekeeping duties. [end recording]
