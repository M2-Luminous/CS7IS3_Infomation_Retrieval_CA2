After meeting with the ministers of finance, industry and commerce, science and technology, and culture -- Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Elcio Alvares, Jose Israel Vargas, and Jose Roberto Nascimento e Silva, respectively, whom he briefed on his negotiations in Washington last week -- Amorim declined to say if an agreement will be reached. He said: "I believe the agreements of the Uruguay Round give both sides a set of conditions for reaching an agreement. However, I cannot give assurances such an agreement will be reached." Amorim confirmed that under U.S. law, 28 February is the deadline for an agreement. He added that an eventual accord must be ratified by the Brazilian Congress within the normal deadlines for the approval of the patent law. Once approved by the Chamber of Deputies, the bill will be submitted to the Senate and return to the Chamber of Deputies if the modifications requested by the United States are included. Amorim said that during a conversation with U.S. Commercial Representative Mickey Kantor last Wednesday, "suggestions, new ideas, and imaginative proposals were made" for resolving the problems created by Brazil's reluctance to recognize international patents. After yesterday's meeting, Minister Cardoso said Brazil will uphold its basic demands during the negotiations with the United States.
