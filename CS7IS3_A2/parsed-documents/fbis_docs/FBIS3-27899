The North Korean move seems to be in preparation for the partial opening it is reported to be considering for the first half of this year, North Korean sources in Hong Kong said on 30 January. According to the sources, North Korea on 20 December dispatched to Shenzhen--China's first special economic zone--a survey team consisting of some 20 members of section chief-level officials from major organizations such as the Ministry of Foreign Trade, the External Economic Committee, and the Academy of Sciences. Since then, the survey team has been conducting a survey on the background of the establishment of the special economic zone, layout of land, the way of controlling residents between the special economic zone and the ordinary areas, the foreign capital introduction policy and laws and regulations thereof, and the activities of the trading firms in the special economic zone. It has been learned that the survey team has been keeping its government in Pyongyang informed of its findings through the North Korean trade missions in Guangzhou, Beijing, and Shenyang. North Korea increased the personnel of its trade mission in Guangzhou by five persons last August, and this is taken to have a bearing on its survey of the special economic zone. Since last December, North Korea has also been dispatching a number of senior officials from the Light Industry Ministry, the External Economic Committee, the Nungna Trade General Bureau, and the Unha Trade General Corporation to the southern district of China, including Zuhai. The North Korean survey team, which is expected to stay in China until February, thinks the Shenzhen model is suitable for North Korea in that Shenzhen is independently managed in the manner of being cut off from other areas, therefore, North Korea is very likely to apply the Shenzhen model to the prospective North Korean areas for the introduction of openness, such as the Najin-Sonbong area, Chongjin, Haeju, Nampo, and Sinuiju, the sources said.
