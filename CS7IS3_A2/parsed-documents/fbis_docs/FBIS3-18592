According to the Public Service, Transportation, and Traffic Trade Union (OeTV), these strikes will have a considerable negative effect on public local traffic in Braunschweig, Goettingen, and Lueneburg in the course of the morning. After the agreement reached in the west German metal industry, the Trade Union has stuck to the warning strikes in Lower Saxony to make the public sector employers present a new offer for he next round of negotiations on 10 March. So far, the OeTV demand for income improvements of 4 percent has been countered by the employers with a list of items to be abolished and the demand for a break in wage increases. Heinz Schleusser, the chief negotiator of the laender, has meanwhile come out in favor of a 2-percent wage raise as of 1 January 1995. Regarding the issue of safeguarding employment, however, the Social Democratic Party of Germany politician did not show any readiness for compromise in an interview with the Berlin daily B.Z. (Monday edition). The OeTV expects about 5,000 participants in warning strikes in Braunschweig, Goettingen, Lueneburg as well a in Holzminden, Celle, and Salzgitter on Monday. Last Tuesday, about 10,000 public sector employees had gone on temporary strike in Lower Saxony.
