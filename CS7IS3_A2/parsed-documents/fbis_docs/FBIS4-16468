Sergey Dubinin, acting Russian finance minister, and Mikhail Zadornov, chairman of the Duma Committee for the Budget, Taxes, Banks, and Finances, delivered reports. Sergey Dubinin stressed that when drawing up the draft budget for 1994 the Russian Federation Government opted for a version intermediate between a tough financial policy which would allow inflation to be lowered to 5 percent per month but would be very painful and an attempt at pumping the economy full of money, which would lead to 50 percent inflation. He reported that they have planned a budget revenue base of 120.7 trillion rubles [R], a deficit of R62.4 trillion, and expenditure of R183.1 trillion. Inflation remains "enemy number one," he said. Ten percent inflation per month is now planned, with a reduction to 7 percent by the end of the year. The budget deficit planned for the current year is 8-9 percent of GDP. Part of the deficit, roughly 6 percent of gross product, will be covered by Central Bank loans. Commenting on the revenue side of the budget, Sergey Dubinin noted that a sharp increase in total revenue is not expected. Whereas last year it was 10 percent of GDP for the federal budget and 14 percent for the budgets of the territories, this current year a total of 12 percent of GDP is planned. The speaker noted that it is planned to take effective measures to stop tax evasion. Regarding the allocation of budget expenditure, the minister reported that R48.5 trillion has been appropriated for defense and the law-enforcement agencies; R48.1 trillion for state support for sectors of the national economy; R24.5 trillion to help the regions; R16.8 trillion to service the state debt; and R12.2 trillion for social measures. Mikhail Zadornov, chairman of the Duma Committee for the Budget, Taxes, Banks, and Finances, advocated revising the 1994 draft budget. He proposed, in particular, that the budget deficit be increased from the current 34 percent to 43-45 percent. The committee chairman considers that the revenue side of the budget requires amplification, as he fears that many sources of income will not be able to yield the return the government expects. It is also necessary, according to Zadornov, to abolish concessions on customs duties and consolidate extrabudgetary funds. Mikhail Zadornov even reported that the committee he heads considers it right to ratify the budget for the first six months and to instruct the Russian Federation government to submit to the Duma the draft budgets for the third and fourth quarters of the current year, that is to say, to switch to the practice of examining the budget quarter by quarter. We will thereby, he considers, "ensure the government takes account of our proposals and really controls the implementation of the budget." The Russian Government, the Duma committee chairman said, has also been instructed to submit the 1995 budget to the Duma no later than September this year. For his part, deputy committee chairman Aleksandr Pochinok, expressing a "dissenting view" on this issue, proposed that the draft budget be passed on the first reading. He stated, in particular, here that the proposed budget deficit increase to 43-45 percent would entail rapidly increasing inflation.
