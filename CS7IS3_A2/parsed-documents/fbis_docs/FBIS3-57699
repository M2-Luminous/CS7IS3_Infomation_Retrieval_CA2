"If the law on the president of Crimea goes against the constitutions of Ukraine and Crimea -- too bad for this law," he said. He also stated that the provisions of this law must be brought in accordance with Ukrainian and Crimean legislation. "Otherwise, this law will be considered anti-constitutional," he said. According to the law on the president of Crimea, the president shall have the right to appoint the prosecutor general, chairman of the security service and interior minister, and control the operations of the Ukrainian army in Crimea. To quote Mikhalechenko, the law on the delimitation of powers between the Ukrainian and Crimean bodies of state authority envisages consultations on the Ukrainian policy in Crimea, and on the appointment of the prosecutor general, the head of the security service and the commander of the national guard. "Consultations with the parliament, not the president," he said. He described Russia's approach to the Crimean problems as "carefully weighed-out and realistic." "If a realistic policy is implemented, we shall solve the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, and Russian citizens will be able to spend their holidays in Crimea," he said. Candidate to the post of Crimean president and leader of the Crimean Republican Party Yuriy Meshkov told a press conference in Sevastopol that the results of the first round of elections (during which he scored 38.5% of the votes -- Interfax) "are the choice of the people who have lost hope and for whom Russia is the only source of inspiration." "This is not a manifestation of nationalism," he said. Meshkov believes that the simultaneous holding of the second round of presidential elections in the Crimea, the referendum on the Crimea's status, and the parliamentary elections in Ukraine and Crimea should be held simultaneously on March 27 to save expenses. As we have reported already, the second round of presidential elections in Crimea is scheduled for January 30. Meshkov also said that there would be no complications between Ukraine and Crimea. "The idea of the referendum does not imply Crimea's secession from Ukraine. Neither does it imply any redrawing of the borders between Ukraine and Russia," he continued. What is actually meant here is the right to take decisions in the sphere of Crimea's economic and cultural relations with Russia, Ukraine and other countries independently, he said. "It is extremely dangerous to adhere to the old policy of Crimea's rigid dependence on Ukraine. We can tackle many of our problems on our own," he said. To quote Meshkov, measures are taken to establish contacts with the Kiev authorities. "Our representative has already met with the Ukrainian leaders," he said. He pointed out that Russia treated the developments in Crimea normally. "A hostile attitude to Crimea on the part of Boris Yeltsin is absolutely ruled out. Time will show what his normal attitude will be like," he said. He noted that he shared the position of the Kuchma-Grinyov bloc because it advocated normal relations between Ukraine and Russia.
