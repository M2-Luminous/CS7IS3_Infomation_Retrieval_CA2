The circular said: In October last year, the State Council promulgated the Regulations on Control of Ground Facilities for Receiving Satellite TV Broadcasts. The Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television recently promulgated the Rules for Implementing the Regulations on Control of Ground Facilities for Receiving Satellite TV Broadcasts. This is of great significance for placing the production, sale, and use of ground facilities for receiving satellite TV broadcasts under control in accordance with the law; ensuring orderly development; promoting the building of a socialist spiritual civilization; and maintaining social stability. According with the regulations and implementation rules, and in light of the situation in our region in which the installation of ground facilities is in a chaotic state; development of such facilities is being promoted recklessly without out a plan; and the contents of TV programs is out of control, the following five requirements have been set to strengthen control over ground facilities for receiving satellite TV broadcasts in our region. All prefectural administrations, the Lhasa City People's Government, the people's governments of various counties and cities, and various commissions and offices under the regional government should earnestly implement them. 1. You must vigorously publicize the regulations' guidelines. Under the leadership of the local governments, radio and television administrations in all prefectures and cities, should, together with public security, state security, industrial, and commercial departments, thoroughly understand the documents and earnestly implement them in light of local conditions. 2. You should register and check local cable TV systems and ground facilities for receiving satellite TV broadcasts. If problems are discovered in the course of inspection, you should handle them in accordance with the relevant documents. 3. You should rectify the situation after carrying out a checkup. Radio and television administrations of all prefectures and cities must carry out a strict checkup of permits. Old ones should be changed. If ground facilities for receiving satellite TV broadcasts set up by individuals prior to October last year must be preserved because of special circumstances, they must be reported to the relevant radio and television department before 5 May in order to obtain permits according to procedures. Units which obtained permits prior to 5 October last year to receive overseas TV programs must be urged to submit their permits for reexamination by a radio and television department prior to 5 April. Units and individuals that have set up and used ground facilities for receiving satellite TV broadcasts but have not obtained permits according to procedures should report to the departments concerned according to provisions stated in the rules for implementing the regulations. Units and individuals whose facilities are found to meet the set requirements must obtain a permit before 5 May. Units which have set up two ground facilities for receiving satellite TV broadcasts but have not obtained permits to receive overseas TV programs must dismantle the antenna for receiving overseas TV programs. Units which have installed only one satellite antenna must readjust their antenna to receive only domestic programs. Measures for technological safety should be adopted in accordance with regulations and implementation rules to deal with units which are authorized to receive overseas TV programs. 4. Efforts will be made to establish cable TV stations. 5. Problems should be handled in accordance with the provisions contained in the regulations and with the procedures and functions set by the implementation rules.
