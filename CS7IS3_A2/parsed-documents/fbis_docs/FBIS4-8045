The statement says that daily UN Protection Force reports from the ground, as well as media reports, showed that the fighting around Gorazde was provoked by the Muslim forces and also that it was on a limited scale. "In spite of this NATO, or rather those who irresponsibly pull its strings, showed with this attack against the Serb positions that they have war and not peace on their mind, and that they are not impartial but support one side in the conflict." "The Democratic Party of Serbia regrets that the international community, having betrayed the role of a mediator, has through this action become a participant in the civil war in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina," the statement says.
