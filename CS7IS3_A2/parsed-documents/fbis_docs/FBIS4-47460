Burinskiy, Textiles and Light Industry Institute, St. Petersburg; UDC546.91:541.183] [Abstract] The need for treating electroplating effluents for highly toxic chromium (VI) ions is brought about by the high PDK (maximum allowable concentration) of this substance in the water system. Thus, the PDK for chromium is set at 0.1 mg per liter, while its actual content in the effluents is as much as 13-100 mg per liter. The widely used electro-coagulating reagents used for this purpose fail to provide a high enough degree of chromium ion elimination. Ion exchange methods appear to be the most effective means of providing a high degree of water purification, especially that of fiber ionites which are characterized as having higher rates of adsorption and greater ease of regeneration, in comparison with resin forms. In the present work PAN-AN-1 and PAN-AS-1 are recommended as fiber sorbents for leaching out chromium (VI). These are analogs of anionite exchange resins AN-18 and AV-17, used for the same purpose. PAN-AN-1 is diethylamine modification of an epoxy-containing grafted copolymer of polyacrylonitrile fiber, and has a static exchange capacity for low basicity tertiary amines of 3 mmoles per gram. PAN-AS-1 is obtained by treating the above copolymer with trimethylamine. It contains high basicity trimethyloxypropylammonium groups in amounts to 1.3 mmoles per gram. Anion exchange capacity of the ionites comprises 2 mmoles per gram. Tests show that these sorbents are effective in eliminating chromium (VI) from electroplating effluents.
