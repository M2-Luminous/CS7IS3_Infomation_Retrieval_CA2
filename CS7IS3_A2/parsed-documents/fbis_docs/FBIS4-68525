For some reason, I always think of it when I hear the newly fashionable appeal for "civic accord." In itself, the idea is, of course, a good one. It is the right idea. It should have been presented earlier--in about 1990 or at least in 1991, or at the very least somewhere in mid-1993. Had this idea been brought to life then, it would have saved many human lives and fates. Perhaps it would have saved entire peoples and our once great state. But what now? Now the memorandum proposed by the president will perhaps only save the president himself. First of all, from early re-elections, secondly--from the responsibility for two state overthrows, and thirdly--from corrections to the new constitution (and primarily from the correction regarding those same re-elections). All else is more than problematic. And here is why. The agreement is entitled, "On Achieving Civic Accord in Russia." Wonderful. No one opposes this. But how do you intend to realistically achieve it (and not just on paper)? Judging by the title, we are speaking not only about an agreement between the political elite, but about accord in society itself. Yet what is our society like today? It has been torn to bits, to pieces, which have grown farther and farther apart from each other. Who or what can force the poor and the rich, the criminals and their victims, the all-powerful bureaucracy and the citizens without rights to agree amongst themselves? What document can reconcile warring ethnic groups, rival mafia clans, and polarized social currents? First of all, the present-day contradictions in society, the opposition of its various strata and groups, the open enmity and hatred, have already gone too far. Secondly, they are objectively defined by the condition of life itself in Russia--and primarily by the economy. No decree, memorandum or agreement can remove these objective contradictions or eliminate the very source of disagreement in society. And this source, no matter how you look at it, is the policy of reform. There will be no accord until reforms begin to yield a positive result. That means that in order to achieve true accord in society, what we need is not to compose memoranda, but to work toward this positive result. However, the people do not see such work. Up until the present, we have not been able to positively resolve a single acute and painful question: Neither the question of prices, nor of inflation, nor of non-payments--all those questions which reforms have given rise to and which millions of people suffer from. Without the resolution of these and many other vitally important questions, there is no use in waiting for accord and peacemaking at the lower levels. And without this, what is the value of accord reached at the top? Let us assume the miners' trade unions sign a "social obligation" not to strike, while the miners, if their situation does not improve (and it will not improve, since there are as yet no prerequisites for this) will go on strike and will demand a change of the government and resignation of the president. And they would spit on any memoranda. The same is true also of the parties, as for example the Agrarian Party. What will its signature under an agreement be worth if the deception of the peasantry, which in our country has become a state policy, continues? The tension in society is growing. Even the students (the harbingers of all Russian revolutions) have taken to the streets. One sector replaces another in the picket lines around the White House, and the news releases are full of announcements of the stoppage, one after the other, of the country's former industrial giants. Unemployment is at the door of millions of Russians. And what have the recent elections to the local organs of power demonstrated? They have demonstrated a mass distrust of the ruling political forces, the total alienation of the people from power (even the authors of the Agreement on Accord were forced to acknowledge this fact). And what is the crime situation in Moscow today, and throughout all of Russia? Every day there is a terrorist act. The level of banditism is almost the same as it was during the civil war, and there are probably as many firearms in the hands of the population as there were during wartime. Yet they tell us about "civic accord," as if we have just fallen from the Moon. At first, the authorities did everything to see that society became splintered and destratified, that it fell apart into irreconcilable component parts. But now they want to bring everyone to accord with some document (even it if be three times as good and re-worked 100 times). Is this not naive? We get something like the introduction of communism by decree. As of 28 April, civic accord is being proclaimed. But where is the material base for it? They have not built it yet. Another little anecdote comes to mind here: "Zhora, fry the fish." "But there is no fish!" "You just fry, and there will be fish." The prospects of achieving accord at the top--between various political forces--are almost as unrealistic. This is specifically because of their differences, which bear a principle character. In fact, the draft agreement asks them to sign under a moratorium on waging political struggles, and primarily the struggle for power, which is basic to the activity of any party, even "Russia's Choice." It is for this, generally, that the entire business was cooked up. And from this standpoint the president's initiative is nothing other than a change of tactics. Up until now, the main political weapon of the presidential side has been disagreement (practically with everyone), confrontation and violence. However, these tactics have not brought success. The people have become angry, but have not been frightened and continue to offer resistance. The opposition has not scattered, but has become strengthened and has even legalized its activity. The president's authority and respect for the president (or even fear of him) have not increased. Rather, it has been the opposite. His rating in Russia and abroad has notably declined. The policy of confrontation has become bankrupted. Now they want to try the policy of accord. On paper everything is pretty. Yet how does all this correlate with the actual reality? The very subject of political differences has not been coordinated or regulated: What path should Russia follow? What kind of society should we build? Toward what ideal should we strive? By what means and methods should we move toward our goal? Yet they want to agree simply not to touch this subject, to avoid it. In other words, the problems over which all the discord has taken place in our society will not disappear, but it is as if everyone will agree to keep quiet about them. In that case, the Agreement on Accord is no more than an effort to hide our shame with the palm of our hand. I doubt that the parties and movements which have already gained sufficient influence will so easily and simply reject their political convictions. There is one other side to the matter, which casts doubt upon the possibility of general agreement. Recent events in the State Duma and the Federation Council (amnesty, dismissal of the procurator general) have shown that even with the new parliament the president has a fleeting, unsteady accord, and that this organ--the closest in state hierarchy--certainly has not become his unconditional ally. And all because one thing is written in the agreement, while something else is done in real life. The tradition of violating the constitution and the laws, of exerting pressure on the legislative and law enforcement organs, is retained. The episode with Kazannik was a regular continuation of the episodes with Rutskoy, Stepankov, Zorkin, and Barannikov. Is it not strange that the leaders of the main law enforcement agencies in the country suddenly, one after another, find themselves in contradiction and open conflict with the head of state? Is this fact alone not proof that law is being scorned in the state, and not by just anyone, but by the supreme authorities. In everyday life they say the following about such situations: "It cannot be that everyone is bad and he alone is good." With the attitude toward law and toward the laws and moral standards which still prevails in the Russian upper echelons, not to mention the lower levels, we need hardly speak of any accord. If only this accord is not with lawlessness, such an accord when some transgress the law while all others agree to pretend that nothing terrible is happening. If only the agreement were preceded by the honest and noble confession: Yes, citizen Russians, there has been a sin. I did violate the constitution and the laws, I employed violence, I repent and promise never to do so again! Let us start all over, like human beings..." Yet nothing of the sort is being said. They are calling upon someone--we do not know who--not to behave disgracefully any more. The list of potential signers, however, is not specified. If these are only the state agencies--the president, the government, and parliament--according to the constitution they are obligated to do all that is written in the draft, including to work for accord in society. Will the opposition sign all this--that is the question. Some of those in the president's encirclement propose that its extreme flanks be excluded from the number of participants. But then the entire idea loses its meaning. You can cross them out on paper, but it is not in your will to exclude them from the political life of Russia. Then about what accord--of whom with whom--are we speaking? Of Yeltsin with Gaydar? They will come to an agreement without a memorandum. But is it possible for them to come to agreement with Zhirinovskiy, Zyuganov, and Rutskoy--the real figures on the political scene of Russia? And without the mutual accord of specifically the polar, extreme forces, once again, what would be the value of such an agreement? Nevertheless, even understanding all this, realizing the unreality and utopian nature of another political manifesto, we would like to believe and hope. To believe that there will not be a civil war, and to hope for civic accord, and mainly--for the reason and conscience of the politicians. If, thanks to this "Agreement on Accord," they do not shoot down parliament once again, even that is good. Although, of course, it is shameful that the constitution and the laws are not enough for the politicians in our country. They must also give a signed statement promising not to throw pitchforks at one another.
