"I spoke about what didn't work, and there were fundamentally two things," Salinas de Gortari said during a meeting at the presidential residence with the cabinet, governors, and legislators. The president noted first "the remoteness of authorities and the resulting lack of communication and information on what was happening there, and second the state information system." Salinas appointed a commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas on 10 January during a reshuffling of his cabinet, which he described as "a recognition of what didn't work." The president told the officials and legislators with whom he had breakfast that a deep reflection on political matters was necessary. "Now more than ever we need politics in the best concept of the word, meaning as a task, an endeavor, a commitment in favor of the loftiest causes of the people, and as the art of avoiding confrontation," Salinas stated. Local authorities must not be satisfied with saying that they know about the problems of their regions, the president indicated. "They have to be there; they have to get out more." The president urged officials "to work, go out more to all the states of the republic, be closer to the people and their problems, and be closer with solutions in favor of our countrymen." The Mexican head of state stressed that "political circustances that we need to acknowledge" are among the causes that led to the situation in Chiapas. "Many cases of abuse... have turned into narratives and stories. On occasions there has been a lack of political homework by the authorities and organizations to be close to their fellow citizens, as well as a lack of opportunities." President Salinas de Gortari stressed that "it is truly wrong to try to link poverty and needs with violence. If that were the case, one-third of mankind would be up in arms today." "We must explicitly recognize it. That is why we said this is not an Indian uprising but an uprising with the participation of Indians, several of them facing hardships, others practically tricked into it." After noting that the only surprise in Chiapas has been the attempt to use violence as a method to remedy the situation, he added: "That is indeed alien to the institution building we have been engaged in for several generations." "There is nothing the aggressor group can do that can exceed the Mexican state's capacity to react with a response committed to peace, justice, liberty, and democracy," the president said. Salinas reiterated that the Mexican Army "acted and has been working ably and loyally in line with its constitutional responsibility in response to the request by the authorities" of Chiapas State. There are some indicators in Chiapas that point to "major lags accumulated over decades, even centuries," the president admitted. He has supported actions to overcome social backwardness in that state and the damage of the conflict. On 1 January, an armed group arose in Chiapas to press the demands of Indians who took over towns, thus necessitating Army intervention. On 10 January the government adopted reconciliatory measures to seek a political solution to the conflict.
