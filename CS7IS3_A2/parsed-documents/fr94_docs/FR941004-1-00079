FR941004-1-00079 FR941004-1-00018 •Part 100 (consolidation and simplification of State plans). We also propose to delete two regulations. The requirements in §205.101 that identifying and organizational information must be provided by the administering agency are now incorporated into proposed §1357.15 (e) and (f); Section 205.150 is proposed to be deleted as the cost allocation plan requirements now are found in 45 CFR part 95. We want to call attention to a proposed change in the applicability of 45 CFR part 95, subpart A. Subpart A, Time Limits for States to File Claims, is based on section 1132 of the Act and now covers title IV&hyph;B and the Independent Living Program (as part of title IV&hyph;E). However, the States do not submit claims for the title IV&hyph;B programs or the Independent Living Program (ILP) in accordance with section 1132. Accordingly, we propose to specify that part 95, subpart A, does not apply to these programs. The statute for both the ILP and title IV&hyph;B, subpart 2, requires that funds be expended (liquidated) within two years. For these two programs, States (and Indian tribes participating in the subpart 2 program) must file a Standard Form SF&hyph;269 expenditure report 90 days after the end of the two-year expenditure period. Therefore, other time limits to file claims are not applicable, i.e., subpart A of part 95. We have proposed in §1357.30(i) a two year expenditure period for title IV&hyph;B, subpart 1 funds. If approved, this change will have the operational effect of requiring an SF&hyph;269 expenditure report for all three programs. States typically have no difficulty in accounting for their expenditures within the two year period. Therefore, we see no need to keep title IV&hyph;B funds open on an extended basis as currently allowed in subpart A of part 95. We believe this provision has been burdensome administratively to both Federal and State offices. 2. Part 1356_Requirements Applicable to Title IV&hyph;E In §1356.10, we have revised the language to indicate that part 1356 now contains requirements applicable to the Independent Living Program. A new §1356.80, Independent Living Program (ILP), is added to summarize the statutory provisions applicable to this program. 3. Part 1357_Requirements Applicable to Title IV&hyph;B Section 1357.10␣Scope and Definitions Paragraph (a) of §1357.10 is revised to expand the scope of part 1357 to include the new subpart 2 of title IV&hyph;B (family preservation and support services). Paragraph (b) of this section is amended to provide that the services under both subparts 1 and 2 of title IV&hyph;B must be available on the basis of the need for the service and may not be denied on the basis of income or length of residence in the State or the Indian tribe's jurisdiction. This general eligibility statement does not preclude a State or an Indian tribe from selecting populations or geographic areas to which family preservation and family support services will be targeted nor from moving toward Statewideness of child welfare services as required in Section 422 of the Act. In paragraph (c), we have revised the three definitions currently in paragraph (c) and added five definitions or clarifications of the following terms: children, community-based services, families, family preservation services, and family support services. The following three definitions are revised:
