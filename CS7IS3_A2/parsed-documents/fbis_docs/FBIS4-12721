A telephone call from a mutual friend had me rushing to this Western capital. My friend said that Mr. X, the highly placed Western diplomat whom I had known as an expert on Iraq, and who had many connections in pre-Gulf war Baghdad and is still responsible for Iraqi affairs in his country, was on his way to this capital before returning home after attending both secret and open UN discussions on lifting the sanctions against Baghdad. Now I am waiting for this "source" and whiling away the time by recalling the latest developments. Baghdad now seems to have lost hope that the international stand against it will be reevaluated. Two days ago, 'Udayy Saddam Husayn criticized Iraqi diplomacy, accusing it of failure in effecting a diplomatic breakthrough in the international embargo, and threatening to resort to other methods that had nothing to do with diplomacy. Saddam Husayn himself threatened and vowed to take revenge. Information is almost certain that Iraq is preparing to launch a comprehensive offensive in the north to reopen its strategic artery with Turkey. All these events, coming simultaneously, indicate that something different is being prepared. Therefore, the questions in my mind concentrated on Saddam's new calculations and the new plan behind his threats. I am certain that the satisfactory answer will come from this "friendly source," who I am waiting for in this Western capital after a previous appointment. As usual, I now record the verbatim dialogue that was conducted between us. There was no time for many courtesies and greetings. So when the "friend" took his seat, the question of Iraq sprang to the lips and I began by asking him: Where has Iraq obtained such sudden strength to be brave enough and issue such threats? And with the air of one who has a sensational story to relate, the "friend" began his answer: "Snow was falling on this mountainous village near Salzburg, one of the most beautiful towns in Austria, famous for its annual music festival to commemorate its son, Mozart, when four elegant cars pulled up at the entrance to a chalet. Men of Middle Eastern features alighted. They drew the attention of the European tourists who did not give them much consideration since they are used to seeing tourists from all over the world. However, the Middle Eastern tourists were not tourists or ordinary visitors but Iraqi officials who came on a special and secret mission to hold an important meeting with other 'tourists' who had arrived at the chalet from the former Soviet Union only minutes before the Iraqis." The man went on and I did not interrupt: "The meeting was not kept secret for long, however, because elements of the Austrian security forces, in addition to one representative of a West European and one representative of an East European security service concerned with the Middle East and with Iraq, were tasked with monitoring the movements of the Iraqi officials. These elements reached the meeting after monitoring the officials movements for two days, starting in Vienna. They were operating in accordance with information received in advance from Moscow and an Arab capital stating that a secret high-level Iraqi delegation would arrive, led by Qusayy Saddam Husayn, head of Saddam's special security apparatus and executor of special tasks, such as this Austrian one. "Qusayy was the first official to enter the meeting place, preceded by his bodyguard. He was followed by Abu-Ahmad, one of the men in charge of external operations in the Iraqi intelligence service, and three high-ranking Iraqi Army officers who were participating in such political-military talks for the first time. They were graduates of Soviet military academies and had important connections in Moscow. Those recognized among the Russian team were certain veteran Russian politicians, former generals in the Soviet army, and leaders of the Russian mafia connected with certain military and political wings in the Kremlin. The Iraqi side was not eager to maintain secrecy because Baghdad wanted to exploit the appearance of its delegation in front of the intelligence services as message to scare the Western world." My diplomat friend appeared confident that Iraq will witness serious developments in the coming weeks or months as a consequence of Saddam Husayn's threats. When I reminded him that the recent threat is not the first of its kind, that the Iraqi president has threatened the world with dire consequences several times in the past, only to retrack his threats and submit, the diplomat said: "This time it is different. I believe you know Saddam Husayn better than I do. You no doubt recall that in the past, he used to ask one of his close associate to issue threats and to avoid committing himself to carrying them out, thus paving the way for a retreat. This time he initiated the threat. You will be convinced of the true dimensions of Saddam's threat if you allow me to reveal the secrets of the Salzburg meeting that took place two months ago, and the information acquired by prominent world security and political agencies on Iraq's secret movements." I said that I would ask my questions later and he continued: "Reliable security reports, some of which were submitted by participants in that meeting, emphasize that Qusayy Saddam Husayn was eager to go a long way in promoting Iraqi relations with the pro-Iraq Russian parties that have maintained relations with the Iraqi regime since the Soviet days of close military, security, and political cooperation. Those attending the meeting from the Russians generally represented the Iraqi lobby, which now has a great deal of weight in the Russian political and military arenas. These not only represent the Zhirinovskiy group, but a large spectrum of Russian military and political figures who yearn for the days of the Soviet empire and would like to restore their superpower status and influence, especially in the Third World and in the Arab world in particular. They are calling for a return to the region in a big way and for an end to submission to the United States, the only world superpower." The diplomat paused for a while and added: "Reports say that in his speech, Qusayy concentrated on this chord, which is so sensitive to his interlocutors, pointing out that the road to the return of Soviet influence to the world must pass through the Middle East. He said that the Arab region, which has suffered because of the absence of this superpower and its great ally, and the state of confusion among the Arabs now in view of the tottering peace process and U.S. arbitrariness and its extremist support for Israel, paves the way for Russia's return to the arena with the support of the Arab people who are seeking a means to avenge their wounded self-esteem. Qusayy said that Iraq continues to regard itself as an ally on which Russia could depend in its political comeback and in ending the U.S. hegemony, through Iraq's contribution toward solving Russia's economic crisis. If you help us lift the blockade, he said, we will be able to repay billions of dollars in debts and sign military contracts that will be the beginning of a powerful Russian breakthrough in the Arab world." The diplomat added: "The principle of restoring Iraqi-Russian cooperation did not take a long because the two sides were in agreement on this point and because it was not the main subject of discussion." And what was the main subject? "This meeting was preceded by several preparatory meetings. It had been agreed to hold the meeting to draw up a joint plan for action that would the focal point in the 'new course' [al-sabil al- jadid] Saddam Husayn talked about when he issued his threat to the world." And what is the Russian mafia's role in the meeting? "A big one. According to available security reports, the plan is very serious and has world-wide dimensions that require cooperation with the Russian mafia, which has wide-scale connections in the fields of terrorism, gun smuggling and drug running, and which is now connected with a world network specialized in terrorist operations in most world countries." I said, obviously aghast, what is this serious plan then? The diplomat answered, fully confident of himself and his information: "Saddam Husayn has recently reconsidered all his calculations and made a serious decision based on the principle that the attack is the best means of defense. The man is now convinced that the efforts to corner him and keep him in isolation by continuing the embargo will ultimately lead to his political and popular suicide and that he will not be able to withstand this for many years. The world, and the United States in particular, treat him as if he does not exist and have established formulas for the region without taking him into account, except to weaken him further and further. While not working seriously to topple him, the United States is refusing to make any move to give him any future role. This has begun to tell on his future political and popular assets inside Iraq and in the Arab world, even among those who admired his challenge to the United States, Israel, and the West. Even these admirers have completely forsaken and forgotten Saddam Husayn. The man feels that he has truly been quarantined from the world for a long period of time and that he cannot take any more." I said: But, what has changed for him to be able to confront this isolation while the internal popular indignation against him is increasing, and the political, economic, and military blockade gives him no room for maneuvering? He said: "In his new calculations, Saddam Husayn believes that the regional and international stand toward him has changed, and that facts are no longer the same as those that existed during the invasion of Kuwait or directly after its liberation. He also believes that the international alliance, in its current form, is no longer as cohesive as it used to be. In his view, it is impossible to obtain an international consensus to deal military blows to him if he violates the UN Security Council resolutions, especially since this council has begun to suffer seriously from the policy of double standards and impotence, which becomes clear when dealing with Israel, and which became clear toward the Muslims in former Yugoslavia and in Somalia. We cannot deny that through economic and other temptations, Iraq succeeded in creating a rift among the UN Security Council's permanent member states. These member states were divided into two teams -- the United States and Britain on the one hand, and France, Russia, and China on the other. He wagered on the second team's support for lifting the blockade. However, the renewal of sanctions has forced him to resort to his plan to return to the arena strongly. This time, he aims at reshuffling the cards in this sensitive region at this sensitive stage, at disrupting stability, and fomenting disturbances and riots through a hellish internal, regional, and international plan." Finally, we have arrived at the plan. "Yes, and I am not revealing a secret if I say that several big powers are taking this plan very seriously, and fear that the implementation of this scenario has already begun on the internal level." What will Saddam do this time? "Information indicates that the Iraqi president's plan includes several parts, all aimed at creating an explosion in the current situation and creating new facts to force world states to give him some kind of a role. The first part is internal; Saddam will seek to once again raise the issue of the dangers of fragmenting and partitioning Iraq in order to make others recognize his role in safeguarding the country's unity, and to threaten the region's states with the dangers and repercussions of partitioning Iraq on them. Actually, Saddam has begun to mass his troops in the north to exacerbate the security situation with the Kurds. At the same time, he is preparing for similar operations in the south to defy the Western alliance and to put it face to face with a serious attempt to fragment it and to create difference among its members. In this regard, you can see the policy of flirtation which now exists between Turkey and Iraq. Turkey is counting on this to help it find a way out of the impasse of war with the Kurds. In return, Iraq relies on this to reinforce its penetration of the blockade and to pave the way for trade on a larger scale than what is currently taking place. In the Iraqis' opinion, Turkey and the Western states cannot ignore the Iraqi markets and their economic resources during this world crisis. Consequently, they should have a thousand apprehensions before adopting a new international stand toward Iraq." What about the second part? "The second part is aimed at the Gulf and the region. In addition to threatening the region with the dangers of partitioning Iraq, the regime in Baghdad will seek to foment disturbances on the border with Kuwait and in some Arab states. It seems that Saddam Husayn is aware of the sensitivity of the international stand toward him regarding the Kuwait issue. So, he will try to implement his plan with a new method in which the regime and its forces will have no role, and without any direct military threat. Information shows that the Iraqis intend to escalate the situation with Kuwait, one time by creating problems on the border with ordinary people, and another under the cover of smuggling drugs and alcohol, which will lead to armed clashes, or by carrying out bombing inside Kuwait, which will contribute to spreading horror, anxiety, and disturbances." The diplomat continued to say: "You know very well that Iraq's interference in the serious conflict in Yemen is part of a scheme to cause tension in the region. However, Iraq will not stop at this point. Perhaps the more important card Saddam Husayn is trying to play, proceeding from his new international calculations, is that of foiling the peace process in the Middle East, which is going on without him. Information confirms that, after the failure of his secret contacts with the Americans and following progress he achieved in his contacts with the Russians, Saddam Husayn will try to use the foundering peace negotiations and the Arabs' increasing feeling that they are being deceived and humiliated by a hostile Israeli-American alliance that forces them to make concessions and remain silent over Israeli intransigence and repression to deliver the coup de grace to the peace process. "Security sources indicate that Saddam Husayn recently reestablished contacts with Palestinian groups opposed to the peace accord and known for their support for the Iraqi regime and for their distinguished relations with it during their long stay in Iraq. He also opened up to Islamic fundamentalist groups that recently visited Baghdad, especially the Palestinian opposition groups. "Furthermore, it has been learned that Palestinian leaders well known for their Iraqi links recently received the green light to visit certain Arab countries to hold contacts with Palestinian opposition factions and to coordinate stands with them to broaden the scope of pressure on the negotiations. These Palestinian leaders also formed plans to carry out armed operations inside and outside the occupied territories in order to destroy the peace process." The diplomat went on to say: "What is more serious is that big security sources collected confirmed information indicating that Saddam Husayn decided to bring his confrontation to the point of threatening the world with terrorist operations and of delegating terrorist, extremist, fundamentalist, Palestinian, and international groups to plant bombs and explosives in Europe. "Information confirms that plans were formulated to carry out operations against Israeli and non-Israeli targets in countries that still adopt stands hostile to Iraq and are waging a campaign of continuing sanctions against it." I interjected by asking: Does Saddam Husayn have an international terrorist network to implement these operations? He said: "All the information indicates that the Russian mafia attended a meeting in Salzburg to study capabilities for carrying out these operations. These capabilities are very big due to the current link between mafia smuggling and terrorist networks and also due to the relations among mafia leaders, intelligence elements, and security bodies from many East European countries, which had broad relations with international terrorism during the days of the communist bloc. "I forgot to tell you that one day after the Salzburg meeting, Qusayy Saddam Husayn and an accompanying delegation went to Bulgaria and held secret meetings with Palestinian opposition leaders who chose asylum in that country. They had previously received military training there along with elements from (former) liberation and extreme left movements from all over the world under Russian experts. All of them maintained their old relations. Indeed, contacts resumed about a year ago and coordination was reestablished under former KGB officials." He added: "We must not forget that Saddam Husayn previously won over Palestinian and international leaders known for terrorism. Many of them gathered in Baghdad during the Gulf crisis and were joined by numerous Islamic fundamentalists. You are well aware that the CIA accused Baghdad of the blast at the World Trade Center in New York and that one of the suspects escaped to Iraq and is still residing there." I interrupted him once again and said: We can easily understand the Russian Mafia's role, but what exactly is the Russian role, and why did generals and politicians attend the Salzburg meeting? He replied with a brief smile, and continued: "Saddam Husayn does not want to repeat the experience of the Mother of Battles in his new plan, and he is concerned to avoid involvement in a suicidal project. He built his calculations on protecting his back by the important regional and international changes that, to him, seem to be in his favor and can be exploited. "The most prominent of these changes, which in fact are mere ambiguous signs, is that Russia is looking for a way to return to the international arena and restore some of its past influence. What Qusayy offered the Russians who are enthusiastic about this theory was a deal with, and a service to Russia. In other words, the more the crisis worsens and the situation in the Arab world deteriorates to reach the point of explosion, the more the road becomes open for the Russians to emphasize the importance of their return as a balancing and stabilizing factor and mediator, if not a full partner that is able to play a role in safeguarding regional and international stability as the situation used to be during the days of the Soviet Union. There is nothing better than confusion and conflicts for Russia's return to the arena, especially when Yeltsin is surrounded by strong political and military opposition that pushes him in that direction." I said: From what you say, it is understood that Saddam Husayn is now prepared to sabotage the region and the world to prove that he is still able to disrupt things and pose a threat to the stability of the region and the world order counting only on dividing the Western alliance and Russian support. However, nothing indicates that Russia, which is economically and politically ruined, and Yeltsin, who is threatened with being removed from office, and who is unable to feed his people, is able to carry the heritage of the Soviet Union. Don't you think that Saddam Husayn's new adventure is destined to failure and is, once again, based on miscalculations? The diplomat quickly answered: "There should be a distinction between security information and political analysis. The Iraqi movements, activities, and plans I revealed to you are based on information from very reliable sources, and the evidence is that we have begun to see the beginning of implementing this plan on the ground. On the other hand, you have the right to ask about the seriousness of depending on Russia in its current situation and Saddam Husayn's miscalculations. In my view, the Iraqi president is still unable to grasp the utmost strategic importance the United States attaches to the region, and it is impossible for Washington to allow Russia to share it. The most that Washington can accept is Russia's restoration of its influence in the independent republics that formed the Soviet Union, and assuming the role of policeman in these republics. At present, Russia's utmost ambition is to impose its hegemony on that area in order to prevent the conflicts, confusion, and civil wars in these republics from spreading to Moscow, unless Yeltsin finds himself in Saddam Husayn's shoes and becomes in need of avoiding the problem through venting the pressure of his opponents. This can be done through exploiting distant crises. Nevertheless, I do not think that he has the capabilities to do so, and, in the first place, I do not think that Washington is prepared to relinquish the title of the world's sole superpower. "As for the possibility of splitting the Western alliance, I fear that the Iraqi plan may contribute to the restoration of the alliance's integration because Iraq and the region are not Bosnia- Herzegovina and Somalia. The question is how far Saddam Husayn will go in his game of 'I am drowning, so why fear getting wet?' This is what the next weeks will reveal."
