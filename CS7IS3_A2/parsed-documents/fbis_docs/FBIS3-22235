How can it be done under conditions acceptable to all? The issue is so sensitive and the public is now so watchful and cautious that the governments of nuclear energy producing countries think twice before presenting their proposals. Ten years ago, who would have predicted the proliferation of mediators, sent to the front lines by public administrations, nuclear industry manufacturers, and brand-new agencies in charge of managing this waste, to inform, reassure, answer questions, and consider everyone's probing and apprehension before reaching any decisions? Nuclear power can no longer be forcefully imposed; public administrations have understood this and have learned their lessons from the past. In February 1990 the Rocard government, aware of difficulties it would encounter if it imposed this or that site for storage of highly active waste from the nuclear industry, chose to halt hostilities with the determined population on 9 February 1990 and to let time do its work. Of course this decision was not completely devoid of electoral considerations, but excessive coercion eventually creates a trap which Rocard wanted to avoid by declaring a one year moratorium on the management of these awkward waste products. The 30 December 1991 law on this issue has formed a legislative framework for any new steps in this regard and given mediator Christian Bataille the heavy responsibility of consulting constituencies and collecting voluntary proposals from communities interested in the installation of an underground laboratory for research on nuclear waste. This was a good initiative and about 30 such proposals came quickly to light. Today, four departments, Gard, Haute-Marne, Neuse, and Vienne have been tentatively selected by Bataille (see LE MONDE of 6 January) and the government has just authorized the Radioactive Waste Management Agency (ANDRA) to begin geophysical surveys of the sites. Here again, cautiously, the authorities will take their time for one to two years before reaching any decision. Groundbreaking for the laboratories, which will cost 1.5 billion francs each, cannot begin before the end of 1997 at the earliest, which means that operations would begin in 2002. This would be followed by eight years of research on site quality (nature of bedrock, water flow study, deeply-imbedded materials performance, and so on); this is because ANDRA is not scheduling materials storage before 2020 at sites that have yet to be determined assuming the program is authorized to continue after Parliament deliberations around 2010. This surfeit of caution is not unique to the French authorities: all nuclear energy producing countries are facing the same type of problems. As a matter of fact, France is managing fairly well at present with its surface storage for low radioactivity waste at the Hague (Manche) which is filled, and at Soulaines (Aube) which has just opened. The only remaining problem is to so to speak, settle the delicate issue of permanent storage of highly active waste. One step has just been taken with Bataille's report. Many other countries wish that they were that far along. Strong Local Opposition In Europe the situation has more facets as a few examples will illustrate. In Germany where disagreement is sharp, it is clear that all nuclear industry waste will be stored underground regardless of its radioactive level. Storage has already been established at two locations for low- and medium-activity radioactive waste: at the former salt mines in Morsleben near the old East German border, and at Asse (Lower Saxony). The latter has in fact been for some years, the site of international experiments for storage of high radioactivity waste. Two other sites also in Lower Saxony are currently being discussed as possible storage centers. The first is in Gorleben where two wells are being drilled in a salt dome for high radioactivity waste, the first shipments of which may come in 1994 and 1999 from France and Great-Britain. But work on this project has been stopped. The second is at the Konrad iron mine for less radioactive material. But its placement into service is being hotly contested between the federal government and the Lower Saxony authorities. In Switzerland where there a research laboratory in granite already exists at Grimsel, nuclear industry waste is housed on-site at plants and research facilities, while waste resulting from other industry activity has been temporarily stored since 25 November 1992 at a 9.3 million Swiss franc installation in Wurenlingen in the Argovie canton. For permanent storage, the Cooperative for Radioactive Waste Storage (CEDRA) approved in June of last year a center whose cost is estimated at 500 million francs and which would be built in Wellenberg in the semi-canton of Nidwald. Swedish Example But canton authorities are blocking current construction based on their recently acquired legal power to grant licenses for underground utilization. Many discussions must yet take place before Parliament issues a decision (in 1997?) on this proposed center whose operation could begin in 2005. As for high radioactivity waste, this is only the beginning. Preliminary drilling intended to analyze the nature of the soil (granite and gneiss) has already been conducted in the northern part of the country in Bottstein, Leuggern, Weiach, Kaisten, Schaffisheim and Siblingen. Other drilling operations have been requested by federal authorities to prospect clay deposits in the Aar Valley and in the area between Baden and Schaffhouse. But as the JOURNAL DE GENEVE pointed out last summer, in Siblingen, the canton authorization procedure for drilling took six years while at the federal level it took one year and eight months. ``All that time to come to the realization that the site was not suitable...'' Clearly waste management is not an easy matter and according to nuclear energy promoters it is hampered less by technical difficulties than by social and political problems. The country currently having the most success in resolving them is Sweden, whose early decision against reprocessing irradiated fuels at its plants has made the choices easier. Sweden has an underground facility, the SFR, carved out of granite on the Baltic coast not far from the Forstmark plant, which since April 1988 has been used for permanent storage of low and medium radioactivity waste. At the same time the Stockholm government in the early 1980's commissioned an enormous underground storage center in Oskarshamm, the CLAB, intended for storing irradiated fuels from Swedish plants for 40 years before they are permanently buried in the substrata of the country's two northern communes situated right in Lappland near Arjeplog and Overkalix (see LE MONDE 17 September 1992). Discussions are underway to determine which of these two locations may receive these vexatious ashes. There is no hurry, even if it takes time to win over a very skeptical public opinion. This is why, in spite of CLAB's intermediate storage (CLAB received its first highly radioactive shipments in July 1985), the Swedes want proof ``through a dress rehearsal'' that their permanent storage plan in granite is efficient. The Swedish Fuel and Radioactive Waste Processing Company (SKB) has thus begun drilling a deep tunnel in granite at Orskarshamm near CLAB; this is the Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory (HRL) which is intended to serve as proving grounds for the engineers. The whole facility should be completed at the end of 1994 or the beginning of 1995. But unlike its Canadian counterpart, URL at Pinawa in Manitoba, this underground laboratory will not be converted to a storage site.
