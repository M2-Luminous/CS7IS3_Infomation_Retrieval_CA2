The political position of the Czech Republic on the question was completely clear, he told journalists in the village where Edvard Benes, Czechoslovak president in 1935-38 and 1945-48, was born 110 years ago yesterday. Revising the decrees would mean revising the entire post-war situation, he said. "The decrees were a reflection of the time," and their study is a matter for historians, he said. In a speech today to mark the annivesary of the birth of this key figure in Czechoslovak history, Havel said Benes's merits, "though overshadowed by his dilemmas, defeats and problematic acts, are unquestionable". "He was a great man who made a worthy contribution to our state; he was a figure whom history at times placed before great dilemmas," he said. Coming to terms with Benes's acts meant coming to terms with the cruelties of history, he said. [passage omitted] The 110th anniversary of Benes's birth is being celebrated in a time when his life's work can be analysed and evaluated "freely, objectively (and) publicly," Havel said. His life "not only dramatically reflects the fate of the Czech nation, but also exposes some of the fundamental and urgent questions of our modern existence as a state and the basic dilemmas of politics," Havel said. Havel also laid flowers at the bust of Edvard Benes and the memorial plaque at his house of birth, and opened an exhibition of Benes's life in the village school. [passage omitted]
