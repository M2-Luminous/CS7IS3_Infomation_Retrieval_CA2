Tests involving exposure to mine explosion, gunfire, and shock waves have revealed, unfortunately, the vulnerability of series-produced vehicles to the aforementioned effects. The above observations were supported by combat action experiences acquired in Afghanistan. Drivers of vehicles moving in columns would eventually learn of the bitter experiences suffered by comrades who fell victim to mines or were struck by bullets while behind the steering wheel. They undertook the practice of setting up inside the cabs pieces of armor taken from disabled armored personnel carriers. They would install the plates on the floor, on the sides, the doors, and sometimes on the windshields, leaving only a small port for observation. The above served as the impetus for the concept and industrial production of local protection packages for series-produced vehicles. The first lot of this kind of equipment was subjected to testing even before our troops returned from Afghanistan. The protection packages won the unqualified approval of military leaders. There are several versions of armor protection for motor vehicles. For example, a UAZ-3151 equipped in this manner is externally virtually indistinguishable from the standard model of this vehicle. In this case, the cab is structurally reinforced to take shields made of aircraft armor. Fastened to the floor are aluminum alloy shields offering protection against shell fragments. A special high-strength fabric fastened to the obverse side of the plates reduces ricocheting of secondary fragments. In addition, the windshield is replaced by a bulletproof version. The Ural-4320 truck, however, is fitted with external armor plates, with armor louvers on the windshield (see photo). The vulnerable areas are protected in the amount of 55 percent. The armor plates are made of steel. Mass of the protection package is about 184 kg. Mounted on the interior surfaces of the panels and doors of the cab of the KamAZ-4310 are armor plates. Attached to the windshield are steel plates with ports. The size of the observation window is adjustable by virtue of removable armor plates. Seventy percent of the vulnerable areas is given protection. Mass of the cab protection package is 285 kg, while that of the cab rear is 235 kg. The armor protection package for the truck offers protection against bullets 7.62 mm in caliber and fragments with a mass of up to 2.0 g. It is stored as a kit that is easily installed on the vehicles when the need arises.
