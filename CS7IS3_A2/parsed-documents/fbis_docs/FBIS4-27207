FBIS4-27207 "dreas104_a_94040" FBIS-EAS-94-104 Daily Report 31 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Hata's 20 Million Yen Loan Remains `Mystery' Hata's 20 Million Yen Loan Remains `Mystery' OW3105085994 Tokyo KYODO in English 0835 GMT 31 May 94 OW3105085994 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- Who deleted a description of a 20 million yen loan to the wife of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata from his 1993 asset disclosure report remains a mystery, the Foreign Ministry and his financial secretaries said Tuesday [31 May]. Hata submitted to news organizations his fiscal 1994 asset report that revived the deleted description of the 20 million yen loan to his wife Yasuko from her father. Hata's political office said although it incorporated the description of the loan in last September's report, someone removed the account from the photocopies of the report later distributed to the mass media. "We do not know why that description was deleted from the copies of the report distributed to the press," said an official at the political office. The office said Yasuko borrowed the money to finance part of the construction cost of Hata's private residence in Tokyo's Setagaya ward. The deletion called into question political ethics of the premier who has been dubbed "Mr. Political Reform" since the days when Hata was a legislator of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), political analysts said. Hata's financial aide, Akira Makabe, told KYODO NEWS SERVICE, "I put the account of the loan onto the report after hearing its explanation from the premier's wife and then I handed it over to Mr. Yoichi Nishizawa, who was then serving as the political secretary to then Foreign Minister Hata." Makabe gave KYODO a photocopy of the duplicate copy of the report carrying the description of the loan, which he said has been kept at the office. However, Nishizawa told KYODO, "although I certainly received the report from Mr. Makabe, I do not remember whether it carried the description in question or not." "I handed over the report to the ministry bureaucracy without tampering with it," he said. The Foreign Ministry's General Affairs Division said the report was submitted to the Prime Minister's Office after it was ckecked by the Ministry's Personnel Division. When the Prime Minister's Office distributed the photocopies of the report to reporters at the press club covering the premier's official residence, the submitted report's column for loans and debts was blank, the division said. The analysts said the description was possibly deleted by either Hata's secretaries or bureaucrats, or the description that was nonexistent on the initially compiled report was later incorporated by someone. Both Makabe and Nishizawa admitted it is hard to believe that bureaucrats deleted the description. Meanwhile, Makabe acknowledged deleting another description of a separate 50 million yen loan from the premier's 1993 asset disclosure report. The description was revived in this year's report. The aide said Hata borrowed 50 million yen from Hachijuni Bank in his constituency of Nagano Prefecture last June 25 by pledging his 261-square-meter residence in Ueda, Nagano, as collateral. Hata needed the money to shoulder mandatory contributions to Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], which he and his colleagues founded last June after defecting from the LDP, he said. The money was channeled to the party from Hata's own fundraising organization, Shinwa-kai, to which Hata loaned the 50 million yen, the money he had borrowed from Hachijuni Bank. Makabe told KYODO, "I decided not to put the description of the loan onto the report with much hesitancy, as I thought Hata's borrowing the money is almost tantamount to the Shinwa-kai's borrowing the money. "I should have incorporated the description of the loan onto the report, as it is the money borrowed by Hata," he said.
