However, concern has been growing over the apparent lack of mutual trust between the bureaucrats of the two nations who are in charge of the trade talks. The two nations have been at odds over setting "objective criteria" to measure progress in market access, and hardly any progress has been made in the talks. As a result, the United States continues to step up its criticism of Japanese bureaucrats. Concern voiced by former Japanese bureaucrats has also been noted. "Japanese negotiators like to stay up all night. They do not show what is up their sleeves until the eleventh hour. Americans are nice, so they show their hands right away." In a recent visit to Japan, U.S. Under Secretary of State Joan E. Spero, who is in charge of the negotiations, made these remarks during a news conference at the Japan National Press Club on 12 January. She thus complained it was the fault of Japanese bureaucrats for causing the two nations to still fail to see points where they could agree in the trade talks despite the fact that the Japan-U.S. summit meeting is less than a month away. In response to such "bashing of Japanese bureaucrats" by U.S. officials, Keio University professor Makoto Utsumi, in a lecture at the Japan National Press Club on 14 January, said: "What is making the current trade talks difficult is distrust between Japanese and U.S. negotiators." Utsumi, who formerly served as deputy vice minister for financial affairs at the Ministry of Finance, thus expressed his concern on the outcome of the trade talks. Concerning current Japan-U.S. relations, Utsumi considers the affinitive relationship between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton as one of the positive factors. However, he points out that "U.S. negotiators seem to think rather simply that just because Prime Minister Hosokawa enjoys high popularity, the Japanese Government should be able to do anything, but cannot because the bureaucrats are bad." Utsumi explained that the good relations between the leaders seem to act in reverse and lead to bureaucrat bashing. Furthermore, Utsumi criticized the United States, saying: "Since Prime Minister Hosokawa is a lord, he does not go out to directly persuade those concerned. This is the bureaucrats' job in Japan. Therefore, it does not do any good for the United States to go on bashing Japanese bureaucrats." Explaining that the United States has misunderstandings, Utsumi offered the following advice to ensure the trade talks proceed smoothly: "First, the two nations should look for points where they can agree so they do not have to criticize each other. Second, they should take up working on bilateral cooperation in practical areas. From there, they should build up mutual confidence. This is necessary above all." Tentatively, the focal point of the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks is a vice ministerial meeting to be held on 25 January in Washington. Talks are expected to be held to the very limit on individual trade sectors which include automobiles and auto parts, insurance services, and government procurement. As the United States steps up bureaucrat bashing, Japanese Government officials who are actively engaged in the negotiations are deliberately trying to remain calm. One Japanese negotiator has said: "In negotiations, there is bargaining up to the last moment. Some Japanese and U.S. negotiators are personal friends. Therefore, I do not think feelings of mutual distrust will grow." Mutual distrust would be detrimental to building new bilateral ties. It is hoped that calm, constructive discussions will be conducted during the trade talks.
