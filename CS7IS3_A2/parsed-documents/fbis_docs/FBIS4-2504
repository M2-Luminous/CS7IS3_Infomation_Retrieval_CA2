Wen Shizhen, member of the provincial party standing committee and executive vice governor of the province, briefed the State Council's price inspection team on the province's economic situation and price inspection work on behalf of the provincial people's government. Vice Governor Wen Shizhen said: The province's present level of general commodity prices is fine. However, prices for the means of production show a faster increase and the rise and fall of prices for products turned out by the state-owned enterprises is relatively large. Enterprises are being heavily affected by the prices of material supplies. If we fail to improve the situation in a timely manner, it will adversely affect the social stability and the improvement of the people's lives. He said: The market economy has set forth new demands for shifting the governmental function. Departments in charge of commodity prices at all levels should enhance the market calculation while grasping the macroeconomic readjustment and control in a timely manner, report on time the fluctuation in commodity prices, and perform their bound duties to make the economy prosperous and improve people's lives. During the briefing Hao Dechun, deputy director of the provincial price bureau, also delivered a speech in which he said: After the telephone conference sponsored by the State Council and the provincial people's government on making work arrangements for price mass inspection on 7 March, the people's governments of various cities have attached great importance on the arrangements; gone into action rapidly; and earnestly implemented the arrangements. Thus, a certain momentum and scope in the price inspection work have been built up. We will conduct concentrated inspection in a shorter period to correct the prominent price violations throughout the province and to ensure the mass inspection work to score periodical results in June this year. The work team of the State Council, which comes to the province to conduct price mass inspection, will spend more than 10 days on carrying out practical inspections.
