In December 1993, this figure for the first time crashed through the 1,800 trillion lire threshold: the exact figure was 1,809,676 billion lire. With respect to the previous year this was a growth of 10.5 percent. This meant that the monthly growth in Italy's state debt had been something like 14.3 trillion lire. Furthermore, these figures include the accumulated indebtedness of the central administration only and exclude local administrations and public agencies now transformed into joint stock companies. Should these be included in the calculation as well, a much more complicated matter, the total public indebtedness could be ascertained only up to October of last year when it was estimated to be 1,815,692 billion lire (that same month the total state debt was 1,770,966 billion lire).
