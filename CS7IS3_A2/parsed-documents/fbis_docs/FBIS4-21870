The airliner was hijacked this morning on a domestic flight from Khartoum to al-Danaqilah. The Egyptian authorities and Armed Forces supplied the plane with fuel before it took off and provided food and medical care to its passengers. The passengers appreciated the good hospitality they received from the Armed Forces and Egyptian officials and said it was nothing unusual from the fraternal and generous Egyptian people. The captain of the Sudanese airliner said he would head first for al-Danaqilah and then proceed to Khartoum, adding that all the passengers are well. A Sudanese official earlier announced that the Sudanese airliner left Luxor Airport two hours before it actually took off.
