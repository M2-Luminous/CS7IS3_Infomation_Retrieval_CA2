FBIS4-29105 "dreas115__a94007" FBIS-EAS-94-115-A Daily Report 13 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan Governor Seeks Settlement on Base Issue Governor Seeks Settlement on Base Issue OW1306204994 Tokyo RYUKYU SHIMPO in Japanese Evening 13 Jun 94 p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1306204994 Tokyo RYUKYU SHIMPO Japanese BFN [Text] A team, which includes Governor Ota, that is visiting the United States to demand a resolution on the issues of bases in Okinawa ended its activities in Hawaii on the morning of 12 June (at dawn on 13 June, Japan time) and is heading for the U.S. mainland. The team extracted from the commander-in-chief of the Pacific Fleet in Hawaii a partial abolishment of the training across Okinawa Prefecture's Route 104. On the issue of the naval port in Naha, rough going was indicated for specifying a place to move it. The team is facing bright prospects and thick walls. The stage for negotiations is moving to Washington, where attention is focusing on whether the team will be able to gain concrete answers from the State and Defense Departments and whether its members will be able to gain support from Congress. The U.S. Military has continually emphasized its contribution to the security of Asia and its consideration for the lives of residents. The team does not wish to interpret as lip service the declaration of former Marine Commandant Stackpole, attached to the Pacific Fleet at Okinawa, that there would be a partial abolition of training across Route 104. Whether the "partial abolition" of training becomes a step to the total abolition of the training that crosses Route 104 and whether it will become linked to an abolition of gun platforms near residential areas, self-control over their use, and a decrease in the frequency of training are all specific points that need to be ascertained through talks with high-ranking government officials. Concerning the reversion of the naval port in Naha, while it has become a formal topic for the Japan-U.S. joint committee, the team's having received the explanation that the endeavor is facing difficulties shows that one cannot view with optimism the governor's negotiations in Washington. The team visiting the United States has three important proposals, including the return of Yomitan Airfield. The team will also ask for items on which Japan and the United States have not yet agreed: Futenma Airfield, the Okuma Recreation Center, and the return and/or reduction of water and air areas. Their diplomatic skill will be called into question on whether a hole can be opened in the thick walls of the U.S. side. The group learned from the Hawaiian State Government the details on how the Kahorawe [name as received] Island training ground used for live-firing exercises by the U.S. Navy and Marines and in Rimpac exercises was returned through the union of the residents' movement, the state government, and the state's congressmen. On the basis of special U.S. Congress legislation, the state and the military authorities reportedly agreed on a plan to dispose of unexploded bombs and use the site. The legislation now before the Diet for the transfer of specified facilities from the military appears realistic. From the record of Kahorawe's return, Governor Ota's team obtained information for promoting the future return of the bases and use of the sites.
