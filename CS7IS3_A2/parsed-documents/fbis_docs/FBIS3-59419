As a result of its inability to form a preelection coalition, more than 10 percent of voters today have no representative in the Slovak parliament capable of promoting their political interests. Having learned from this experience and, in accordance with the will of our voting membership, having resolved to continue the process of integration of the Slovak civic right, the Conservative Democratic Party [KDS] and the Democratic Party [DS] have concluded a merger agreement. This new political entity intends to resume the traditions of the DS, which succeeded in concentrating all of the civic forces that opposed fascism and, after the liberation [of 1945], fought for the reestablishment of parliamentary democracy, a law-governed state, and the protection of private property and private enterprise. At that time, the DS demonstrated that it could successfully defend these values in Slovakia while struggling against communist expansionism, aggressive proletarian dictatorship, and totalitarianism. We will strive to renew, advance, and preserve democratic values, and to create a civic society that will promote the free development of individual citizens. We are convinced that only a principled transformation of society and the economy will enable Slovakia to join the community of democratic and prosperous countries.
