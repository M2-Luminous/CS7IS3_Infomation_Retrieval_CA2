Slovakia has been recognised by 123 countries and diplomatic relations have been established with 106 states. Among European states, only Liechtenstein has not recognised Slovakia, due to unclear property issues. The mutual distrust and tense atmosphere in relations with Hungary have not been overcome in spite of (Slovakia's) accommodating steps. Hungary is to be blamed for the current situation since it has questioned Slovakia at international forums by stressing the problems concerning the ethnic Hungarian minority (ethnic Hungarians number 560,000 people, 11 percent of the 5-million Slovak population) and nourishing irredentist tendencies of several representatives of the ethnic Hungarian parties in Slovakia, the report states. Turning to relations to Hungary, the report mentions the need to sign a bilateral treaty of friendship and cooperation and to resolve dispute over the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros hydroelectric project at the International Court in the Hague. The report stresses the importance of the European agreement on Slovakia's association with the EU and the provisional agreement on trade and related issues between Slovakia and the EU signed last year. Membership in the Council of Europe was also a success, the report says. It points out relatively poor dissemination of information about Slovakia abroad. The interest of foreign media and political representatives focuses on the expediently selected issues such as the protection of the ethnic minorities' rights, freedom of press, conversion of arms production and situation of Romanies (Gypsies), the report complains.
