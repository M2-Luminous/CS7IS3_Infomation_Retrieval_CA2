The statement by the Prosecutor General's Office reads: Following a preliminary study of the materials, it emerges that they do not enable one to establish the presence or otherwise of sufficient information on the commission of crimes of a general nature. According to the statement, the materials also cannot serve as a basis for mounting a preliminary investigation under Article 191 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Most of the materials received were in the form of xerox copies of letters, contracts, and memoranda that did not even bear the signatures of the persons who compiled them. The materials also included a complaint to Mr. Berov submitted to the Council of Ministers on 1 October 1993, protesting against acts by officials from the Ministry of Trade. However, the document contained no information as to whether any official action had been taken on the matter or on what was established as a result of the complaint. The Prosecutor General's Office hopes that the Trade Ministry officials in question will carry out their duties by taking action on the complaint after studying each individual case that it brings to their attention, and that, in the event of information emerging on the commission of a crime, they will provide specific information to the prosecution service.
