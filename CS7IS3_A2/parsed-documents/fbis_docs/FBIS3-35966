The region's policy of peaceful restructuring "gradually removes painful aspects of the post-Gulf War inter-Arab relations," stressed the diplomat. A proof to it is a recent Saudi Arabian meeting of King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz al Sa'ud and PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat whose ways parted during the Iraqi-Kuwaiti crisis. The Russian Foreign Ministry believes that "progressing Mideastern peace process, including the Palestinian-Israeli declaration on principles of Palestinian self-government," gives an impetus to Arab rapprochement. Karasin praised the efficiency of recent meetings of Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in Oslo and Davos, where "another courageous step towards peace in the Middle East was made".
