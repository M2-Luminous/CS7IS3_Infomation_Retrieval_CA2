[passage omitted] In his opening address, Sr. Gen. Than Shwe said that today's management course is being held for 404 USDA executives from branches in states, divisions, districts, and townships throughout the country. He expressed pleasure at meeting with the trainees. He said first he would like to explain why USDA branches are being organized firmly and extensively throughout the country. He said the main objective in forming this organization with the people, including patriotic trainees, is to meet the need for national unity which has declined and weakened throughout the nation. Reviewing the 1988 events [year of the uprising], he recalled that there were many factions among the various strata of society and the youths. National unity was in a state of disintegration and nationalism and patriotism were in decline. There were some who tied the state flag to their legs while some flew it upside down. There were also attacks against the Defense Services which were defending the nation with their lives and eventually there were attempts to cause the disintegration of the Defense Services. These events almost destroyed the national psyche and the way of thinking, and national unity declined at an unprecedented rate. Sr. Gen. Than Shwe said that this situation was most evident when political parties were allowed to be formed and a total of 235 emerged in such a small country with everyone acting like self-proclaimed rulers. Furthermore, despite measures taken to bring about multiparty democracy step by step, some who could not wait followed the path of armed struggle as a short-cut to power. Instead of holding discussions patiently among ourselves inside the country to find a solution, these persons deserted the national convention, thought highly of foreign powers, and approached them. Continuing, Sr. Gen. Than Shwe noted that there are also those in the country who oblige the wishes of foreign powers. There are those who echo foreign claims about a lack of democracy and human rights violations in Myanmar [Burma]. He said these actions reflected the decline of national unity and a lack of patriotism. Therefore, he said the USDA was formed systematically with the objective to fill in the role of strengthening national unity. Sr. Gen. Than Shwe said acts of anarchy prevailed during the events of 1988 and that the USDA was formed to prevent similar events in the future and to promote the observance of law and order among the general public. He said the long-term goal for the trainees is the five aims of the organization [nondisintegration of the Union; nondisintegration of national unity; perpetuation of national sovereignty; promotion and vitalization of national pride; and the emergence of a prosperous, peaceful, and modern Union]. [passage omitted] He said the five aims of the organization are not temporary in nature, but will have an impact on the future and that these aims will remain forever. There may be political and economic changes in the future, but these aims are not likely to change. These aims will remain constant and firm. [passage omitted] Continuing, he said he would like to report to the trainees about endeavors being undertaken by the state. He said he would first like to explain an endeavor for national unity, that is, the matter of armed organizations. He said these organizations, which have existed for over 40 years since the achievement of independence, have been undermining the country's economic and social development and causing hardship among the general public. However, he said it is believed that if national unity is constructed, armed organizations will have an opportunity to operate democratically and politically within the framework of law. He said we have invited them in order to provide such an opportunity. He said because of this invitation, quite a number of these organizations are working hand in hand with the state. Organizations such as KNU [Karen National Union] have been invited to the talks. Mons, Karenni, and Kayah have also been invited. Some are still in the process of holding talks. The invitation has been extended with goodwill because it is believed that the bloodshed and fighting among our own brethren that has been going on for over 40 years is not good and that the time has come to enable the people who have been suffering since independence to live in peace and prosperity. He said it is known to the trainees how some organizations have responded to the invitation and are beginning to cooperate. Sr. Gen. Than Shwe said another outstanding endeavor today is the convening of the National Convention. Therefore, there are sectors dealing with the National Convention, the reestablishment of national solidarity, and national construction. National construction is related to national solidarity and they are inseparable. He said while the endeavor is being made to invite the armed organizations in the jungle, the legal political parties inside the country were invited to convene [at National Convention] in order to work for unity. These organizations will consult on the emergence of the state constitution. He said the old constitution has ceased to operate. In order to establish a new nation, a new constitution must be drafted when the old one ceases to operate and the new one has not emerged. He explained that the National Convention is currently being held in accordance with the policy of reestablishing national solidarity. He said the consultations at the convention have been quite effective. At present, basic principles have been laid down and work is being done on each chapter. He said two outstanding political endeavors are being undertaken -- the national convention to draft a new state constitution to establish a new nation, and the invitation extended to armed organizations for national solidarity and to enable them to work peacefully and democratically. He said he had pointed out two major points out of many political developments. Speaking about the economic sector, he said the economic system is being reformed in preparation for the nation that will emerge in the future. He said, as is known to the trainees, that a market- oriented economy is being established and the people are being allowed to work according to their own physical and mental abilities. He said at present unemployment is declining as more enterprises which provide work are established and people become more well-off. He said there is improvement in production as well as in trade. He said economic measures are being taken to suit the future nation which will be a democratic nation. Speaking about social development, Sr. Gen. Than Shwe said efforts are being made to develop villages and towns, construct sports facilities to promote moral development, and to promote the education and health sectors. He said that SLORC is laying down a sound political and economic foundation to ensure that the future nation that emerges is peaceful, prosperous, and stable. He said, meanwhile, efforts are being made for social and moral development. He said the USDA will work hand in hand with the SLORC in these endeavors. [passage omitted]
