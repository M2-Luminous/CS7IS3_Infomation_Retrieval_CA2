'Arafat tried to tell his people that Palestine was back. "Palestine and the name of Palestine have returned to the map of the Middle East," he said after signing the deal in Cairo on Wednesday night. But few seemed to be listening on the Gaza Strip and West Bank, where reaction was at best prudent. "I'm bitterly and cautiously optimistic," said 32-year-old sweetshop owner Taysir Al-Khudari. "The Oslo agreement did not fulfil our hopes and this Cairo agreement is no better. But what can we do? We have to accept it because the international situation is not good for us. Gazans were more occupied with stocking up with delicacies for Ramadan, the Moslem fasting month which starts this weekend. The market was packed with people queueing for the oriental sweetmeats "halawa" and "amardine." The eruption of joy which marked the signing of the Declaration of Principles for autonomy in Washington on September 13 seemed part of a distant past. "I danced for eight hours because I thought the Israeli soldiers were going to leave straight away or at least by December 13 at the latest," Taysir said. "But the deadline passed and nothing happened. There is no hope left here," he said, to nods of agreement among his customers. Army jeeps still patrol the mean streets of the Gaza Strip, watched by a resentful population of 780,000. "The occupation continues and the oppression will stay the same up to the last minute," said artificial limb manufacturer Hisham Saqallah. "I will start being optimistic when I see the last Israeli convoy leave." The reaction of the Islamic fundamentalist movement HAMAS, which opposes the Middle East peace process, was predictable but nonetheless severe. "Israel has imposed its conditions on the Palestinians, who could not make their voice heard," said Khalid al-Hindi, a HAMAS official. "This agreement gives Israel the right to continue to hunt down Palestinians. This agreement is good for Israel because it opens the door wide to the Arab world." Even 'Arafat's men were downbeat. At the PLO offices in Gaza City, official Safran Abu-Zayda said: "The agreement does not satisfy our demands. But if the occupation and (Jewish) settlement continue the accord will not hold," he warned. "Nothing has changed until now," said Fatah official Ahmad Hillis. "Today is the same as yesterday. We have learnt to be cautious because every time the Israelis block implementation of the agreement."
