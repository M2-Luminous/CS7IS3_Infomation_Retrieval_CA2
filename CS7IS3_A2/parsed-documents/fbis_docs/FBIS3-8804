According to the approved proposal, Aero Prague Co. is to eliminate all of its bank loans and thereby also the risk of bankruptcy. In the final stage, only four subsidiaries will remain in the Aero Holding--Aero Vodochody, Letov Praha, Technometra Radotin, and the Research and Testing Aviation Institute. The National Property Fund will keep 64.8 percent of the holding shares. Aero will hold 53 percent stake in the subsidiaries. The debt clearing will result from the capitalization of the main creditors' claims. The Investicni a Postovni Banka and CSOB [Czechoslovak Foreign Trade Bank] will each purchase 10-percent shares of the holding subsidiaries at 70 percent of the nominal value, and the Konsolidacni banka 27 percent. The tender for the purchase of majority stakes in Moravan Otrokovice and Motorlet Jinonice is to be evaluated in the near future. The Czech Frut Ovo Co. has offered $45 million for Motorlet, and the Canadian firm Pratt & Whitney has offered $1 million cash, $10 million in the form of know-how and $14 million in investments. The same Frut Ovo has offered $800 million for Moravan, while Bata offered only know-how. If the tender for Motorlet is not successful, a competition will be announced. If the talks with the bidders for Moravan are not successful. either, the Investicni a Postovni Banka will purchase the company, and the proceeds will be used to pay the Aero debts. A competition is also being considered for Let Kunovice if a suitable foreign partner is not found. Yesterday, the ministers also discussed the conditions for the purchase of Czechoslovak Airlines shares from Air France Co. by the Konsolidacni Banka. Minister Karel Dyba observed that the purchase of the French company's stake will also be discussed by the government later today, but he refused to publish any additional information.
