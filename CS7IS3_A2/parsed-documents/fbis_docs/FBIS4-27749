It will also create a good image and credibility in the eyes of other countries. the following points should be taken into account, however: 1. The application of the law against money laundering will involve several agencies, such as the Finance Ministry, the Bank of Thailand, the financial institutions, and the law enforcement agencies. Therefore, these agencies should jointly study the impact of the law. 2. The law should be considered in conjunction with the principles of the financial liberalization policy and the national economic development policy. 3. Other relevant laws and the money laundering laws of other countries should be studied for possible adaptation. 4. The methods and tricks used in money laundering, which are becoming increasingly complicated as time passes, should be monitored. 5. More steps that have to be followed by foreign investors should be taken into consideration, as well as the trouble these steps may cause them. 6. The increased burden and cost to financial institutions must be considered. 7. Legitimate rights of honest businesspeople must not be affected. In any event, before a money laundering law is in effect, effective control and monitoring measures existing in current laws can help prevent and control money laundering practices.
