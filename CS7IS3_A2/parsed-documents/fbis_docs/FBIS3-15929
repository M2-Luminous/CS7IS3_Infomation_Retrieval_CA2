According to the forecast of the Federal Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring Service, around 13-16 percent of the entire sown area of winter crops will have to be resown in the spring. Given that the area of winter-sown crops, which account for one-third of the grain harvest, has been reduced, the scope of spring field work should be drastically increased. At the same time, only 75 percent of available tractors and 76 percent of plows (81 percent) were in working condition as of the beginning of March (against 80 and 81 percent respectively at the same time in 1993), while fuel and seed reserves were considerably smaller that usual. The availability of mineral fertilizers stands at 30 percent of the requisite level, and herbicides at slightly more than 50 percent.
