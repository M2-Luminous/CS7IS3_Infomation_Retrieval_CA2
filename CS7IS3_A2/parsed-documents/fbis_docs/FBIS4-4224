Vice Premier Zou Jiahua of the State Council wrote a letter to all delegates attending the meeting, stressing that the civil aviation institution should continue to adhere to the policy of "safety first, precaution vital" and should step up civil aviation security work. Zou Jiahua pointed out in his letter: Civil aviation security is extremely important to upholding the nation's reputation, ensuring the safety of state property and people's lives, and advancing economic construction. Since the beginning of this year, the civil aviation institution has endeavored to improve management, and good progress has been made in work in all areas. A string of effective measures also have been taken to reinforce aviation security. Nevertheless, we must not be lax for a moment. The civil aviation institution must continue to conscientiously carry out the State Council's "Circular on Strengthening Civil Aviation Security" and "Measures on Stepping Up Anti-Aircraft-Hijacking Work," adhere to the policy of "safety first, precaution vital," and step up aviation security work. In his speech at the meeting, Chen Guangyi, director-general of the Civil Aviation Administration of China [CAAC], pointed out: Ensuring safety is the primary task of the civil aviation institution. Leaders at all levels and all workers engaging in civil aviation security work should ensure civil aviation security with a strong sense of being highly responsible to the party and the people. Since last year, the CAAC has endeavored to carry out the instructions and guidelines provided by the party Central Committee and the State Council; issued a series of regulations, decisions, orders, and circulars concerning reinforcing civil aviation security; built up and improved the training of the civil aviation security work force; increased aviation security personnel; improved air safety facilities and equipment; tightened security inspection; stepped up precautionary work; and launched an anti-aircraft-hijiacking struggle, and good results have been achieved. Chen Gguangyi said: The civil aviation institution should bear in mind that the whole institution is a single entity. Personnel at all posts should work strictly according to relevant laws, regulations, and orders. We should avert aircraft hijacking if we can, absolutely assuring the safety of the aircraft and passengers. All aircraft hijackers and attempted hijackers should be severely punished according to law. Major civil aviation leaders at all levels should personally take charge of security work; assurance of civil aviation security must be considered as important as assurance of flight safety. On the two sides of the Taiwan Strait joining forces in cracking down on aircraft hijacking and on repatriating aircraft hijackers to the mainland, Chen Guangyi pointed out: Illegal hijacking of civil airliners poses a serious threat to the safety of passengers' lives and property -- it is a grave crime. Over the last two years, we have taken a series of tight precautionary measures to prevent aircraft hijacking, and we ask the Taiwan authorities to repatriate aircraft hijackers to the mainland according to the "Jinmen Agreement" of September 1990. In the spirit of being highly responsible for the safety of the lives and property of passengers, including those of Taiwan compatriots, and with the good wish of promoting cross-strait exchange and economic cooperation, we hope the Taiwan authorities will take positive steps to support our efforts to crack down on aircraft hijacking. We have noted that concerned authorities of Taiwan have pledged "not to grant political asylum" to aircraft hijackers and that they will severely punish them. We also have noted that the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait and Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation have reached a common understanding that in principle all aircraft hijackers will be repatriated, and have agreed on the basic framework for the agreement on repatriating aircraft hijackers. We thank people from all sectors of Taiwan for giving forceful support to the demand that aircraft hijackers be repatriated to the mainland as quickly as possible. We believe that, as long as concerned departments of the two sides of the strait work hand-in-hand in resolutely and forcefully cracking down on aircraft hijacking and as long as hijackers are repatriated immediately, we will be able to fundamentally prevent aircraft hijacking from taking place and to provide reliable assurance for the safety of passengers' lives and property as well as for flight safety. Li Jizhou, assistant to the minister of public security, urged public security organs across the country to regard ensuring civil aviation security as a part of their jobs and to give full support to civil aviation departments in ensuring security work. He said public security organs of civil aviation departments should step up inspection of and supervision over the implementation of regulations and systems on civil aviation security. At today's meeting, Chen Guangyi, on behalf of the mainland's aviation idustry, expressed his condolences for the Taiwan compatriots, other passengers, and crew members of an airliner of Taiwan's "China Airlines" who were killed after it crashed at Japan's Nagoya Airport on 26 April, and gave his regards to the relatives of the victims.
