No hoarding of daily necessities has yet been observed, but the supply shortages and resulting runaway inflation expected from a steep escalation in tension would throw the economy into confusion, officials said Wednesday. To prepare for an emergency, the government has started checking fluctuations of consumer prices and the supply and demand of key consumer goods on a daily basis, they added. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is monitoring the prices of rice and other farm products, the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Korea movements in the financial markets such as interest rates, withdrawals, share prices and foreign investment, the ministry of trade, industry and energy the prices of manufactured goods, and the Ministry of Transportation foreign tourist arrivals. No unusual price movements for such items as rice and ham have been detected, the Economic Planning Board said. The government has started daily price checks in preparation for unexpected developments after North Korea bolted from the IAEA, but nothing unusual has been observed so far, a board official said. The government's daily checks come as tensions are expected to rise in the wake of North Korea's abrupt withdrawal, he added. In case the situation worsens and the economy weakens, the government will set in motion an emergency system. Purchases of food, fuel, first-aid drugs, flashlights and candles for emergencies are increasing and some prices are on the rise.
