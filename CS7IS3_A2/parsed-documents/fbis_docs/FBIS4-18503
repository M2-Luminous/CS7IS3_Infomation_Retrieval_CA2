In a written statement, President Kliridhis also notes that he appreciates the effort being made to avoid further failure in the discussions of the confidence-building measures [CBM's] but he strongly disagrees with ignoring the fact that the CBM's have been discussed since last May and since then the negative attitudes have come in every case from the Turkish side. President Kliridhis adds: Instead of this leading to the correct realization that the Turkish side does not have the political will either to implement the CBM's or to allow agreement to be reached on the substance of the Cyprus issue, and instead of suggesting to the Security Council that alternate ways to promote a solution be looked at, the resumption of talks on the CBM's is being requested. The president stresses: It is obvious that this is done in order to satisfy further demands by the Turkish side. The president continues in his statement: I have stated repeatedly and categorically to both of the UN secretary general's representatives, Joe Clark and Gustave Feissel, and to Mr. Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special coordinator on the Cyprus issue, that despite my objections to the second non-paper, which was actually submitted to satisfy Mr. Rauf Denktas, I avoided raising my objections in order to facilitate progress on an agreement. Mr. Kliridhis further says: I pointed out repeatedly that Mr. Denktas continues to raise objections and demand amendments. I could feel obliged to raise my own objections as well, but then the gap would widen. The president further notes: My firm position is that I will not accept discussion of any new document or discussion of any further amendments to the latest UN document. President Kliridhis concludes: However, I reiterate emphatically that I accept the latest UN document as it stands.
