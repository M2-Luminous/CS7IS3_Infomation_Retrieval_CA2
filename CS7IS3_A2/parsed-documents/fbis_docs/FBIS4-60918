You will recall that Leonid Kravchuk has appealed to parliament with an initiative to transfer the date of the presidential election from 26 June to a later date. This was supported the other day by 120 deputies in the Supreme Council. Combining with the communists and the Peasants' Party in a single bloc, the Socialist Party now has 36 percent of the seats in parliament. If it is remembered that Ukrainian communist leader Petr Symonenko gave up his presidential candidacy the other day, then Aleksandr Morozov has a substantial chance of winning in the presidential marathon; but for this to happen he needs to collect 100,000 voters' signatures for his initial official registration as candidate for the post of president.
