Representatives from various regions of Russia where arsenals of chemical weapons are located have just paid a visit here. They were acquainted with the fully automated production process. Specialists believe that this method of processing lethal substances is the best. According to a statement by a Ministry of Defense spokesman, the lesson provided by Chapayevsk has been learned. Henceforth the construction of all facilities connected with the destruction of chemical weapons will take place with the participation of the local authorities. It is obvious that this sort of facility is indispensable. After all, maintaining numerous storage facilities containing toxic substances is not just expensive, it is dangerous.
