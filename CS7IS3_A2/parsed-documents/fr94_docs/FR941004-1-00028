FR941004-1-00028 FR941004-1-00006 33 CFR Parts 166 and 167 [CGD 83&hyph;032] RIN 2115&hyph;AB29 Traffic Separation Schemes and Shipping Safety Fairways Off the Coast of California (CGD 83&hyph;032) agency: Coast Guard, DOT. action: Notice of termination. summary: This rulemaking project was initiated to modify existing traffic separation schemes (TSSs) and establish a shipping safety fairway (SSF) off the coast of California to preserve a right of way for navigation through areas which were expected to be sites of offshore oil and gas development. The proposal was based on port access route studies conducted in the early 1980's. Congress later placed a moratorium on oil and gas drilling off California, and in September, 1992, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) dedicated the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (MBNMS). The MBNMS encompasses the area where the Coast Guard had proposed the SSF to prohibit structures. The SSF is no longer needed because oil and gas drilling are prohibited in the Sanctuary. Additionally, the data that supported the proposed changes is now outdated. Therefore, the Coast Guard is terminating further rulemaking under docket number 83&hyph;032. for further information contact: Margie G. Hegy, Short Range Aids to Navigation Division, U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, (202) 267&hyph;0415. supplementary information: The 1978 amendments to the Ports and Waterways Safety Act (PWSA), 33 U.S.C. 1223(c), required the Coast Guard to undertake a port access route study to determine the need for traffic separation schemes or shipping safety fairways to increase vessel traffic safety in offshore areas subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. The Coast Guard initiated this study by publishing a Notice of Proposed Study on April 16, 1979 (44 FR 22543). For the purposes of the port access route study, the U.S. coastline was divided into 32 geographically defined areas. Study area 22 included the coast of southern California and study areas 23 to 25 included the central and northern California coast. Through public participation and government agency consultation, the studies evaluated potential traffic density patterns, waterways use of conflicts, and the need for safe access routes in offshore areas. The Study Results for the coast of southern California (area 22) were published on June 24, 1982 (47 FR 27430). An additional study of the Port Access Routes, Northern Approach to Santa Barbara Channel, was announced on July 26, 1984 (49 FR 30078), and results published on December 5, 1985 (50 FR 49861). The Study Results for the central and northern coast of California (areas 23&hyph;25) were published on October 14, 1982 (47 FR 46043). An additional study on Port Access Routes, Entrance to San Francisco Bay was announced on December 17, 1984 (49 FR 48946), and the study results were published on May 8, 1986 (51 FR 17071). The port access route studies recommended amendments to the TSSs off the coast of California and the designation of new SSFs to establish a comprehensive safe routing system for vessels proceeding to, from, or between the ports of San Francisco and Los Angeles-Long Beach. The Coast Guard published a proposed rule on April 27, 1989 (54 FR 18258) to implement the study recommendations. However, after considering information from public hearings, extensive written comments opposing the proposal, the Congressional moratorium on oil and gas drilling, and the effect of the MBNMS, the Coast Guard has determined that the proposed SSF is not needed. Therefore, this rulemaking is no longer necessary, and the Coast Guard is terminating further rulemaking under docket number 83&hyph;032. On August 24, 1993 (58 FR 44634), the Coast Guard announced a new study of the area to evaluate the need for routing measures in the approaches to California ports and the need for measures to regulate vessel traffic in the offshore California national marine sanctuaries to protect sanctuary resources. Dated: September 29, 1994. R. C. Houle, Captain, U.S. Coast Guard, Acting Chief, Office of Navigation Safety and Waterway Services.
