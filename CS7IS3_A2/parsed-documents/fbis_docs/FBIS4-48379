FBIS4-48379 "drafr096_a_94010" FBIS-AFR-94-096 Daily Report 16 May 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda MRND Militia Reportedly Fleeing to Tanzania MRND Militia Reportedly Fleeing to Tanzania EA1705163594 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura in English to Rwanda 1900 GMT 16 May 94 EA1705163594 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura English BFN [Text] Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development [MRND]'s militias who have been operating inside the RPF-controlled areas in Kibungo Prefecture are now losing the war and have started fleeing to Tanzania. The militias have been killing people in the countryside and at the same time attacking RPF soldiers. The militias have now run short of supplies of food and ammunition. They have decided to flee to Tanzania using canoes across River Akagera, according to (Nyirigira Mutabaruka) of Radio Muhabura who has been touring Prefecture Kibungo. Reports from the Tanzanian side of River Akagera tell us that thousands of people have been discovered camping in areas unknown to the UNHCR up to now. Most of these people could be the MRND's combatants who are fleeing after running short of food and ammunition. Most of the youthwingers who have been operating in Kibungo are now ordinary residents of Prefecture Kibungo. They were transported from Gisenyi and on reaching Kibungo, they went underground and started their terror campaign which reached a crescendo after the death of President Habyarimana. These youthwingers have been operating far away from home and cannot easily replenish their food and ammunition supplies given the fact that the Rwandan Patriotic Front is continuing its pacification of Kibungo Prefecture. The only option available for the youthwingers is to flee to Tanzania using canoes across River Akagera.
