Hofland: "The Spreading of the Scandal"] [Text] The scandal occupying U.S. politics under the collective name of Whitewater is approaching the point where it will become too big to be tamed. It is just like the legendary laboratory rat which has received too many growth hormones and is now showing signs of growing into a monster of Spielberg-like dimensions. As is the case with scandals, it is being cheerfully fed by the many people who have an interest in the destruction of the suspected victims. It is an omnivore of rumors, revelations, hatred, pleasure in the misfortune of others, panic, good intentions and the regular people's court of investigations. If it is not killed in time, then it will outgrow everyone, as happened with Watergate, which cost more people than Nixon their political life. Seen from a distance, the scandal is growing into a play where witches' cabals, purification and self-destruction can no longer be separated out. At this stage Whitewater already stands for an innumerable quantity of suspicions, errors, contradictory interests, shadowy affairs, embezzlements, a whole which in itself asks for clarifications. There is only one conclusion to be drawn: This could well last for a long time. The U.S. scandal, in addition to being theatre along the lines of drama, is also an obstacle which has virtually halted foreign policy. When Joseph McCarthy declared that he had a list of 254 members of the communist party who had infiltrated the State Department, he kept Eisenhower's and Dulles' hands full with more than a year of work. Watergate meant a temporary end to the rest of the world for the Americans. Reagan proved to have more understanding of scandal management. While the evidence piled up about his involvement in, or at least knowledge of the Iran-Contra scandal, his enemies did not succeed in damaging his presidency. He could not be disturbed as he continued to fight the evil empire and then wind down the Cold War. That was genius. When Bush took over, the Republicans' front had closed up again, the confusion about the smoldering scandal worked against his opponents and the urgency had disappeared. The Whitewater affair is totally different. At present everything would indicate that the zenith has yet to be reached. It is difficult to say how much hatred has been generated by Clinton over the last two years. He successfully pushed his affair with Jennifer Flowers into the background during the election campaign. He managed to overcome the disadvantages of his Vietnam past, he did not go there. Attempts to reveal others affairs have been derailed. His plan to reform the health care system is arousing fanatical opposition. The fact that the economy is recovering well under a Democratic presidency is not putting the Republicans in a good mood. Everything is contributing at present to making Whitewater the occasion for revenge. We know that after the end of the Cold War, U.S. interest in West Europe weakened considerably. The first cause is the concentration on the big domestic issues, the second is the European incapacity to solve the conflict in Bosnia. Other priorities are emerging within the limited field of Washington's interests. Last year at approximately this time the bomb exploded under the World Trade Center. Those responsible have been imprisoned for life. The initial investigation and trial led to a suspicion that they are part of a wider conspiracy. The suspicion has become stronger with the attack last week on four orthodox Jewish students, one of whom has in the meantime died. In the background the fear is growing that the conflict between Israel and the Arabs is being extended to New York. The unmasking of a CIA agent as a Russian spy has not boosted confidence in this famous secret service. Many murders occur in the United States, ever greater efforts to fight them are taking place, but political crimes and political terrorism traditionally arouse extra opposition, as shown by the fate of the Rosenbergs and Sacco and Vanzetti. Because then the efforts have to be mobilized against foreigners with dangerous political intentions. The latest indication that Washington wants the least possible involvement with problems in Europe, be it West, Central or East, can be found in the visit by Shevardnadze, once a faithful interlocutor of Reagan and now president of a distant, small country in a civil war. It is rare that a visiting president has been pushed into the well of oblivion so quickly, although he did receive a promise of $70 million in all sorts of aid, but without any perspective of U.S. participation in a UN peace force. The Whitewater scandal is developing in these circumstances. Even if things turn out well for the Clintons, in any case they will certainly have their hands full for a good time. This means that West Europe will be able to count on a U.S. presence even less than during the last two to three years. Fourteen days ago U.S. fighters under the supervision of NATO shot down four Serbian planes. The Europeans will have to content themselves with that example. As long as Whitewater lasts, Europe will have to clean things up itself. Politics are surprising. The only person who will presently be benefiting from an investment project in Arkansas 16 years ago, and the obscurity which followed it, is the ethnic chief Karadzic, who is investing in death and destruction.
