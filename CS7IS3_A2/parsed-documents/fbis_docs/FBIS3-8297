Does this mean that it is on the way up from its worst depression? [Kunik] Unfortunately not. Although it is true that, after a few years of recession, we have noted a slight increase in the output of steel and rolled steel products, as well as some improvement in the industry's economic situation, the condition of our sector is still critical. Our steel mills face the threat that the banks will block their accounts and that their supplies of power, gas, coal, and scrap metal will be discontinued. The majority of our steelworks show an adverse balance of payments. Exporting their goods often proves unprofitable, while the chances of selling them in the domestic market decrease steadily because there are not enough potential--and solvent--customers. [Nykiel] Are there no better prospects for 1994? [Kunik] There are no indications of any surge of activity in investment projects. Unless this happens, it is certain that we will witness a decrease rather than an increase in production. Sales dropped already in both January and February. In addition, our steelworks have found themselves caught in a costs-and-prices dilemma. The prices of energy and raw materials, which influence the costs of production, are dictated by official state monopoly-holders. Consequently, to balance their accounts, steelworks are forced to raise the prices of their products. But, by the same token, they become less competitive and lose potential clients in both the free domestic market and abroad. [Nykiel] We also hear of the danger of competition from outside.... [Kunik] ...which is most serious. Despite all of its official declarations, the government still does not treat the metallurgical industry as a strategic sector of the economy. There is practically no protection extended to the internal market (because imports tariffs alone are decidedly insufficient). As a result, the domestic market is swamped with cheap products from former CEMA countries as well as similar goods from Western countries. At the same time, the European Community, acting through Eurofer [European association of steel companies], imposes on us trading quotas that serve exclusively to protect the interests of EEC states. The EC's declared interest in restructuring the Polish metallurgical industry is more ostentatious than real, and it is largely restricted to making empty promises clothed in winsome gestures. In reality, major steel concerns have been preparing aggressive sales programs in order to reinforce their position in the Polish market by setting up whole networks of agencies selling their steel products here. [Nykiel] Is the Chamber of Metallurgical Industry and Trade unable to force the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the government to make and implement decisions that would allow you to throroughly restructure and modernize your sector? [Kunik] We notified successive ministers and prime ministers many times of our alarm at the deteriorating condition of our sector; we told them of the dangers threatening the metallurgical industry, and, at the same time, we suggested possible solutions that could avert these dangers. The central administration arrogantly left all of our messages and alarm signals unanswered. Recently, acting in conjunction with individual steelworking plants, our Chamber prepared a restructuring and modernization project, complete with a timetable of recommended implementation and consistent with all of the provisions written into the ministry's own study document. We submitted this project to the Industry Ministry and the government. We also drafted a proposal for setting up a dedicated institution that could direct the implementation of the project, as well as a separate proposal for creating a strong organization, Polish Steel SA [joint-stock company], to be endowed with the necessary powers and decisionmaking competence to protect the interests of the Polish metallurgical industry. Again, we have had no reaction at all to our proposals. This silence is surprising even to certain bodies within the European Community, which certainly expected the Polish Government to demonstrate greater readiness to help one of their more important state industries. [Nykiel] We often hear allegations that Polish steelworkers demand huge sums of money from the government--money the government simply does not have. [Kunik] That is not true. The main sources of funds for the financing of our restructuring operations will be bank loans and steelworks' own resources. We are first and foremost interested in persuading the government to introduce appropriate tax and investment policies and securing government guarantees on our loans because, without such guarantees, we will be unable to obtain funds for modernization and development from foreign banks. On the other hand, we pin our hopes on obtaining the necessary funds for social welfare provisions associated with restructuring the employment profile of the sector from both the budget and the World Bank--as we were promised according to a provision written into the ministry's study document. We estimate that, during the next six years, some 80,000 employees will leave the metallurgical sector. This problem cannot be solved by individual plants and their management on their own. The only thing is that we do not know who will end up with that particular milestone tied to his neck and dragging him into deep water.
