Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told journalists that the request had been decided after the arrest Friday evening of dissident Wang Fucheng, secretary-general of the Shanghai-based Chinese Human Rights Association. "This is now rather a lot, and we are starting not to appreciate it," Juppe said. "We have asked for an explanation, and we are awaiting a reply." Only hours after Wang's arrest, another leading dissident, Bao Ge, was picked up by police in Shanghai, a dissident source said. Bao was the fifth pro-democracy campaigner to be detained in China in eight days. Balladur told journalists that he may make a public statement on the wave of arrests later Saturday.
