FR940523-2-00016 FR940523-2-00007 With respect to the ``knowledge'' prong, petitioner asserts that resellers have not demonstrated that the producers did not know the merchandise was destined for the United States. As evidence to the contrary, they note that U.S.-specific labels were affixed to the merchandise in the PRC. Furthermore, petitioners note that Zunyi and Sinochem, the only PRC parties that responded in this review, both stated in their questionnaire responses that they were aware that some of their sales of potassium permanganate were destined for the United States. Petitioner also points to the fact that the Hong Kong resellers did not purchase directly from the manufacturer or producer. As mentioned above, export of the merchandise to the United States is not at issue. Finally, petitioner urges that even if a reseller in this case had been able to demonstrate that it qualified for a separate rate under the intermediate country reseller provision, Hong Kong or third country sales should not be used as the basis of foreign market value for any reseller, since there is reason to believe that sales through Hong Kong are made at below the cost of production. DOC Position: We agree with petitioner that none of the resellers have met the requirements for separate rates in this review. With respect to the ``enters commerce'' prong, we have considered the totality of the circumstances in determining whether it has been shown that this merchandise entered the commerce of Hong Kong before being shipped to the United States. No isolated factor, such as whether import/export fees or duties were paid or whether the merchandise was warehoused in Hong Kong was treated as controlling. Instead, we have evaluated all factors which may be relevant. In this case, there are compelling indications that the merchandise was never intended to be offered for sale in Hong Kong, and that it entered the territory of Hong Kong for the sole purpose of being shipped from there to the United States. The questionnaire responses of Yue Pak, He-Ro, and ICD (HK) clearly and explicitly indicate the following order pattern. First, a U.S. customer would place an order with a Hong Kong reseller for a certain quantity of potassium permanganate. Then the Hong Kong reseller would place an order for the exact same quantity with the PRC import/export company. The import/export company would then place an order with the manufacturer for the same exact quantity which was ultimately shipped through Hong Kong to the United States. Thus, the record shows that throughout the entire procedure, the merchandise was always intended only for the U.S. market. The treatment of the merchandise in Hong Kong, while not controlling, is also consistent with the fact that these shipments did not enter the commerce of Hong Kong. For example, Hong Kong law exempts from import/export declarations (and associated fees) shipments consigned under ``through bills of lading'' only. The fact that the Hong Kong resellers paid import/export fees suggests only that the merchandise was not shipped under a ``through bill of lading''. In addition, the fact that the Hong Kong resellers performed ``various tasks'' in Hong Kong in relation to the merchandise in and of itself is not sufficient to demonstrate that the merchandise entered the commerce Hong Kong. With respect to the ``knowledge'' prong of the test, we note that labelling placed on the merchandise in the PRC included references to U.S. Department of Transportation specifications, Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirements, and even a U.S. ``800'' telephone number for ``Chemtrec''. Many buyers throughout the world rely on U.S. standards regardless of origin or destination for a wide variety of products, and reference to a given country's specifications in labelling does not necessarily imply that the product is destined for sale in that country. Thus, the labelling in this case is not considered conclusive evidence of knowledge of the product's ultimate destination. However, the existence of an ``800'' number carries somewhat greater weight and no explanation has been offered for the inclusion of the number on the label. In fact, both Zunyi and Sinochem have stated in their questionnaire responses that they were aware at the time of sale that the merchandise was destined for the United States. After considering the totality of the evidence on the record with regard to the knowledge prong, including the ordering procedure discussed above in connection with the ``enter commerce'' prong, we determine that the evidence is consistent with knowledge by the producers that the merchandise would be sold to the United States, and that the resellers have failed to sustain their burden of proof with respect to this prong. Because no reseller has shown that its suppliers were unaware that their merchandise was destined for the United States or that the shipments of potassium permanganate entered the commerce of Hong Kong, we need not reach other aspects of the reseller test. Furthermore, since no reseller has shown that it is entitled to a rate other than that of its supplier(s), we need not reach the question of whether the resellers were selling below the cost of production. Therefore, our preliminary determination that the rate for all resellers for this review should be that of their suppliers remains unchanged.
