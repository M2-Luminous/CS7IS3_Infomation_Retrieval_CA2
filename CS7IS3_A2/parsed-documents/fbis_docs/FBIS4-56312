If the presidential election had been held between 25 and 29 April, 30 percent of Panamanian voters would have voted for Perez Balladares, 26 percent for Ruben Blades, 17 percent for Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, 14 percent for Ruben Carles, 2 percent for Eddy Vallarino, 1 percent for Samuel Lewis Galindo, 1 percent for Jose Salvador Munoz, and 9 percent were undecided or preferred not to answer. These results were based on 1,200 interviews. In the report, the CID-Gallup pollsters noted that, bearing in mind the rapid increase in support for Ruben Blades, they were unable to predict one week before the elections whether Ruben Blades or Perez Balladares would win. According to the polling firm, Perez Balladares' lead is larger than the 3-percent margin of error, but only slightly. In the latest CID-Gallup poll, one's attention is drawn to the difference in the support by region of the country for both Perez Balladares and Ruben Blades. In the survey, Perez Balladares had a support rating of 31 percent in the metropolitan area and 29 percent in the rest of the country for a total of 30 percent. Ruben Blades, meanwhile, had 33 percent in the metropolitan area and 18 percent in the rest of the country for a total of 26 percent. Blades has a 2-percent lead over Perez Balladares in the metropolitan area, while Perez Balladares has an 11-percent lead over Blades in the rest of the country. Nevertheless, bearing in mind the number of votes for each region, Perez Balladares has a 4-point lead over Blades at the nationwide level. The margin of error is 3 percent. In the trends section of the report, CID-Gallup indicates that in the March-April period, Perez Balladares registered a slight 3-percent drop, while Blades registered a 14-percent increase. CID- Gallup comments that if this trend continues, singer Ruben Blades could end up the winner. CID-Gallup ends its report by stating: We oppose the restrictions imposed by electoral tribunals on conducting polls and releasing their results just prior to Election Day, as is the case in Panama. According to CID-Gallup, it is clear that the situation could change in the final week before the elections, and it will be impossible to report the trends during this final week to the public.
