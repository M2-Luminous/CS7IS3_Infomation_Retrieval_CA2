The payment of wages and salaries before the religious festival and the repayment of part of Turkey's internal debts yesterday have left the Treasury without funds. The Treasury has drawn and used 122.5 trillion Turkish lira in the form of an advance from the Central Bank. That amount was the maximum it could draw from the Central Bank. It is now eagerly awaiting tax revenues to pay the workers and civil servants. The Central Bank and the public sector banks have moved to attract funds following the religious festival. Ziraat Bankasi [the Agricultural Bank] has taken measures to attract funds through high interest rates so as to meet its hard currency needs. Emlak Bankasi [the Property Bank], Halkbank [the Popular Bank], and Vakifbank [the Endowment Bank] have taken similar measures. The Treasury paid 16.5 trillion Turkish lira in wages and salaries on 11 March by using funds from the Central Bank. It repaid part of its debts yesterday by using the foreign currency it has in its accounts with the Central Bank. In a statement to SABAH, a high-ranking Treasury official said the Treasury's accounts will be in the "red" if the expected increase in tax revenues does not occur. Stressing that a very large part of the foreign currency acquired from Japan cannot be allocated for the payment of internal debts, the official asserted: "Some $725 million has been acquired from Japan. Of that, $225 million has been used to repay foreign debts. The remaining amount has not been touched. It has been added to Turkey's official reserves. But it is in the Treasury's accounts. The Treasury must transfer that resource to the Central Bank if the Central Bank moves to intervene in the money markets. We have not done so. That resource belongs to the Treasury. We have transferred a very limited amount from it for the payments that were effected yesterday. The amount allocated for the purpose was the maximum that could be transferred. The remaining amount is earmarked for Turkey's external obligations."
