FBIS4-66608 "jpnea021___94039" JPRS-NEA-94-021 JPRS Near East & South Asia 19 February 1994 SOUTH ASIA INDIA No Ceiling on Export Credit Envisaged No Ceiling on Export Credit Envisaged 94AS0240A Bombay THE TIMES OF INDIA in English 19 Feb 94 p 19 94AS0240A Bombay THE TIMES OF INDIA English CSO [Text] New Delhi, February 18--The government has nominated a member on the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) to deal exclusively with policy matters relating to export promotion in Customs and Central excise areas, and also to interact and co-ordinate with the ministry of commerce in such matters. Mr K. Vishwanathan will assume charge as member (export promotion) with immediate effect. This was one of the decisions arrived at a meeting held by the cabinet secretary, Mr Zafar Saifullah, on Thursday with secretaries and head of departments of about a dozen ministries and official agencies dealing with export-related problems. It was decided that there would be no ceiling on export credit where such applications were genuine. All export credit applications would be considered without reference to the 10 percent ceiling in the case of quality borrowers engaged in export and all cases of export credit rejection will be required to be put up to the chairman of the concerned bank. The meeting decided that a 24-hour customs clearance facility would be introduced at Delhi, Bombay, Madras and Calcutta airports and at Bombay and Madras ports, to begin with, by March 31. The cabinet secretary reiterated the overriding importance of exports as a national priority and a collective effort "in which each one of us is a player" involving the entire government including all connected ministries and agencies. While expressing his appreciation of the fact that awareness of the need for export promotion was gathering momentum, he was categorical that greater efforts were needed at the operating levels to translate strategies into action and to ensure prompt removal of bottlenecks through effective grievance redressal mechanisms. He wanted banks and financial institutions and all other connected departments to gear up their style of functioning to ensure that export activities were not hindered in any manner. The meeting reviewed in detail the action points concerning different ministries on export-related problems arising out of the last such meeting taken by the cabinet secretary in November, 1993. Ministries covered in the meeting included agriculture, commerce, telecommunications, civil aviation, labour, surface transport, textiles and posts. It was confirmed that a foreign post-office had started functioning at Varanasi and foreign post-offices would be opened shortly at Surat and Kanpur to cater to the growing need of exporters in those areas. The meeting noted that the electronic data interchange (EDI) for international trade had already been launched from Bombay well ahead of the scheduled deadline of March, 1994 and workshops were being held at all major port cities to enthuse and educate exporters to link up with the fast emerging EDI network. It was indicated that the cabinet secretary would hold two follow-up meetings to discuss fiscal and banking issues relating to exports after the budget session of Parliament.
