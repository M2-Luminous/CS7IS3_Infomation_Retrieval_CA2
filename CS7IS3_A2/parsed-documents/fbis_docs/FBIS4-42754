In a speech marking the renaming of the General Schwartzkopf barracks as the Lieutenant General Count von Baudissin barracks, Ruehe called for German "sharing of responsibility for the protection of freedom, against genocide and against disregard for human rights." If Germany does not take on this responsibility, then it is isolating itself in the community of nations. International Bundeswehr missions are therefore not a secondary military issue. They take account of increased international responsibility and are decisive for determining Germany's abilities as a member of Europe and its credibility as an alliance partner. Ruehe added that during their UN missions in Iraq, Bosnia, Cambodia, and Somalia the Bundeswehr soldiers had "proven their military capability and their great ability to empathize." In this way they visibly showed their support for the values of the constitution and solidarity in the community of nations.
