Speaking at a news conference, he noted that "the process of working out political decisions has been started through joint efforts." Those attending the talks had striven "to encourage the sides in the search for peaceful decisions, to prevent military actions and to assist in a settlement." The meeting adopted a joint communique which defines the priority moves. "The foundation has been laid for a new stage, when the main political forces of the world act on an agreed basis," the Russian minister said. He particularly noted the call on the conflicting parties to stop hostilities and to start talks in the next two weeks. The general position on the territorial issue is also of great importance whereby a Muslim-Croatian federation in Bosnia could have 51 percent of the territory and Bosnian Serbs 49 percent. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher explained at the news conference that it is essentially a question in this case of the parameters which were specified earlier which are now being proposed as "a basis for further progress." According to French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe the participants of the present Geneva meeting are prepared, if need be, to meet again next week.
