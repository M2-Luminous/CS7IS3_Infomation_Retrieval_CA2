Colonel Saykagepo Kortor, deputy chief of the AFL intelligence service, was arrested along with his three bodyguards and driver, who was released, the interim government defense minister disclosed. According to the driver, the four soldiers were arrested after going through the last checkpoint manned by the African peacekeeping force in Liberia, Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group [ECOMOG], in the Firestone plantation, which marks the entrance into an NPFL-controlled zone. This arrest occurs at a time when the disarmament of the Liberian armed factions is scheduled to start in less than two weeks, in accordance with a new agreement signed last week in Monrovia between the main factions in the Liberian conflict -- the interim government, the NPFL, and the United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia [ULIMO]. IGNU has called on ECOMOG and the UN military observers "to ensure the safety and release of the AFL soldiers." For its part, ULIMO has issued an ultimatum to NPFL to release Col. Kortor and his men "within 48 hours" or face "reprisals."
