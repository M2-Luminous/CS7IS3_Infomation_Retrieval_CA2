Dr. Nabil Kawkali, a Hebron University researcher, said that the economic losses cover all productive, consumer, social, cultural, and tourist sectors. If the military closure continues for a longer period, the losses will increase. He added that the labor and commercial sectors have suffered the most, because transfers of goods between the Palestinian occupied territories or with Israel have stopped. The agricultural sector comes next, as the military closure has compounded the losses of farmers, who have been suffering from consecutive losses. [passage omitted]
