And even there, whether they are legally valid or not, will have to be decided by the city court, since city Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak has rejected a protest from the prosecutor's office over the extension of the voting hours in the ballot, which took place 20 March. The fate of a further 25 seats will be decided in the fall. However, the new organ of representative power could prove noncompetent -- its legal authority is determined by the presence of two-thirds of elected deputies.
