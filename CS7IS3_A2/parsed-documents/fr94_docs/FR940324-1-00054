FR940324-1-00054 FR940324-1-00020 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Richard B. Geiger, Chief, Division of Transportation, Bureau of Indian Affairs. Telephone number (202) 208&hyph;4359. Office hours are from 7:45 a.m. to 4:15 p.m., EST, Monday through Friday, except for legal holidays. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Bureau of Indian Affairs is proposing this revision to incorporate the requirements and procedures of the Federal Lands Highways Program, 23 U.S.C. 202 and 204, and to reflect the policies of the FHWA for road systems on Indian reservations. The incorporation of these requirements will ensure that funds from the HTF are available for construction projects on IRR according to the needs of the reservation as prioritized by the affected Indian Tribes. A substantial backlog of needed road construction serving Indian reservations exists making the establishment of project priorities a necessity. The requirements of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), Public Law 102&hyph;240, 105 Stat. 1914 (December 18, 1991) and the policy of Indian Self-Determination, mandate that consultation procedures with Tribal Governments to determine these priorities should be established, subject to BIA approval of the expenditure of Federal Funds. Procedures shall be followed and periodically revised to ensure that the opportunity exists for the various Indian reservations to receive a fair and equitable share of funds from the HTF for construction projects on Indian reservation roads. These projects are funded according to their relative needs and to meet the legislative requirements established which affect Indian reservations.
