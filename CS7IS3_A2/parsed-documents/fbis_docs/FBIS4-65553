French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe repeated in the National Assembly today that it is a real case of genocide. In order to put an end to it, he suggests that a regional summit be organized: [Begin Juppe recording] Faced with the offensive by the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], the Rwandan Government troops have been carrying out a systematic elimination of the Tutsi population, which then, of course, resulted in the massacres becoming generalized. France has denounced this situation very vigorously. We support the efforts of the states of the region -- Tanzania, Zaire, and Uganda -- to achieve a cease-fire, and we advocate a summit of the heads of state of the region so that they can bring all possible pressure to bear on the warring sides -- the RPF on the one side and the Rwandan forces on the other -- to halt the hostilities and to resume the Arusha process, which, allow me to point out, was established in 1993 thanks to the efforts of France. This made it possible for the cessation of hostilities at the time, before the attack which was launched on the plane carrying the Rwandan and Burundi presidents. [end recording] Alain Juppe also announced that the French health minister would be going to Burundi and Tanzania tomorrow or the day after tomorrow with the teams of French doctors given the task of going to the aid of the refugees. On the political front, thus, France is proposing a summit of the heads of state of the region, in other words, the presidents of Tanzania, Uganda, and Zaire. We look at the reasons behind this initiative with you, Monique Mas: [Mas] Tanzania, first of all, because it was in Arusha that the peace agreement between the RPF and the Rwandan Government was signed last August. President Mwinyi had brought all his weight to bear to this end. Then Uganda, where the original core of the RPF was formed. Furthermore, its military commander, Paul Kagame, won his spurs in President Museveni's underground movement. Finally, Zaire, which remains a faithful ally of the Rwandan Government, which is having plenty of problems on an international diplomatic front at the moment. Paris considers it useful to get President Mobutu involved again at the same time as Ugandan President Museveni, whom France accuses of supporting the RPF. France itself has supported the Habyarimana regime financially and militarily. What Paris expects from this summit is a cease-fire in Rwanda between the government and the RPF. However, on the military front, the RPF has the wind in its sails, and, furthermore, it does not recognize the government as an interlocutor. On the other hand, for the government, negotiations would be the occasion for it to put itself forward as an obligatory political partner.
