He said he was hopeful about finding a solution to the country's chronic violence. Mohammed Youssoufou Saliou has the details. [Begin Saliou recording] The prime minister was serene and determined at all costs to get his country out of the vicious circle of violence. He essentially said there was cause to be hopeful about the country's situation. He was optimistic that a solution would be found to the differences that exist between the Union for Democratic Renewal-Congolese Labor Party Alliance and the presidential group. Regarding the thorny issue of the retrieval of illegally distributed weapons in Brazzaville, he said plainly that, since the beginning of the crisis, Brazzaville had become the dumping ground for Zairian arms trafficking. Furthermore, he said that 80 percent of common-law prisoners in Congo were Zairians. The victory of peace in Congo will be ephemeral if there is no peace or national reconciliation in Zaire. He said he hoped, therefore, that peace would be restored in Zaire. Answering several questions on cooperation between France and Congo, and especially cooperation with the French petroleum company, Elf, the prime minister said nothing clouded relations between Paris and Brazzaville and, even less so, relations with Elf. He strongly maintained that, on the contrary, relations between the two countries were stronger, more profound, and deeply rooted. [end recording]
