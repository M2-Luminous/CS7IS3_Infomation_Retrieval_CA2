Our international partners appreciate and recognize, above all in the light of our overcoming the reunification process, that through our savings and growth policies over the last year we have been successful in our balancing act aimed at limiting deficits while at the same time creating an important boost to growth. This also applies to January's investment and innovation package aimed at small- and medium-scale firms. Our financial policy is on the right track. We have enjoyed more significant success in terms of consolidation than many others. According to IMF calculations, Germany will achieve the best results in reducing the structural budget deficit by 1995. [applause] Together with Japan, we will next year have the lowest structural deficit among the leading industrial states. Our G-7 partners have acknowledged that this determined policy of consolidation will allow us to meet the criterion for joining the currency union on time, stipulated in the Maastricht Treaty as a deficit quota measuring 3 percent of GDP. An issue which was prominent at earlier conferences figured hardly at all this time around in Washington; namely, the question of allegedly excessive German interest rates. Looking back, our path of stringent budget consolidation twinned with cautious but steady interest rate cuts by the Bundesbank has proven to be wise, correct, and forward-thinking. [applause] This has enabled us to meet the markets' expectations regarding stability. It allowed Germany to attain low long-term interest rates by international standards during the difficult first few years following reunification. Germany's long-term interest rates are now 2 percentage points below the long-term average. Even the most recent interest rate fluctuation proved to be lower than in most other countries. For the first time in four years, the interest rates on the German capital market are lower than those of the United States. This represents a vote of confidence by the markets for Germany's efforts toward stabilization as well as future economic developments. The success of our economic and financial strategy has also stretched to inflation rates. The IMF as well as the research institutes expect a fall in inflation to an average of 3 percent in 1994. During the second half of the year it will fall back below 3 percent. However, the IMF will probably have to revise its prognosis on one point. A growth rate of 0.9 per cent for Germany as a whole in 1994 is, in view of the almost across-the-board upswing among the economic indicators, too little. I have therefore offered IMF director Michel Camdessus a bet that it will be substantially higher. Now that the research institutes have in effect joined in this bet with their prediction of 1 percent growth for western Germany and 1.5 per cent for Germany as a whole, I am relaxed about the inspection of my estimate at the end of the year. What Mr. Rexrodt [economic affairs minister] predicted in his annual economic report will in fact be bettered; he was right on target with his prediction. [applause] In the years 1992 to 1994 there was growth, for example, for eastern Germany of over 26 percent. That can be compared with the losses in production in the countries of Central and East Europe. You should just look at the places which have not had the benefit of the type of aid we have given in the transfer of funds from West to East. And the people in the former GDR would be in the same plight as people in Bulgaria and Romania if your [Social Democratic Party--SPD] policy were in force, and you should be ashamed if you do not take that into account. [applause] [passage omitted] Ladies and gentlemen: Today, Germany and Europe are in direct competition with the successful industrial nations of East Asia. North America has also formed itself into a strong economic bloc in NAFTA. We must derive our strategy of adaptation from these international developments. We cannot afford esoteric ideas based on a national framework. Last December's report on Germany as an industrial location and the action program for more growth and jobs show us confronting international developments. On the other hand, the SPD has nothing to offer but tired slogans about redistribution of wealth and the 10th edition of their standard jobs program dating back to the 1970s. We will only move forward on the narrow path of growth by setting the right course on tax policy. In the view of the research institutes there must be no additional burdening of those who make a special contribution to added value. We mean by this the so-called higher earners, whom the SPD see as belonging to an annual income bracket as low as 40,000 to 50,000 German marks. [passage omitted] The report of the institutes and the most recent international meetings underline that we are on the right path. The initial criticism with regard to an alleged burden on the world economy arising from reunification is being transformed more and more into an astonished recognition of what we are achieving in economic and financial policy in spite of the unique historic tasks. We can already clearly see the process of normalization reflected in the statistics. Public sector deficits, the level of borrowing, growth, the rate of inflation, and unemployment are at least following the international average. Often we can show better results that other comparable industrial nations. [passage omitted] All the efforts and all the difficult decisions have proven worthwhile. This is no wishful thinking. The clear figures and facts of the experts at home and abroad show we are right and the decision at the federal elections in October will be determined by these facts.
