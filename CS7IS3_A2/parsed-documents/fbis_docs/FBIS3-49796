The copyright bill, classified as urgent, was forwarded to the Sejm on 23 November 1994. Such a mode of proceedings was criticized by Zbigniew Romaszewski: "Urgent proceedings make it practically impossible for the Senate to influence this law," said Romaszewski. The "Solidarity" senator said that the producer's rights were too broad and proposed that the period in which they are binding be shortened from 10 to five years, which the chamber did (there was no vote against it), after the committees had issued positive opinions. It adopted the law, despite the negative stand by Deputy Minister of Culture Piotr Lukasiewicz, who explained that "the producer is not only a fat capitalist with a cigar in his mouth, but also the one who organizes the process of creating work." The new Copyright Law envisions absolution for owners of computer software which they obtained, in violation of the law, before the effective date of this law. "What would we look like if in an agreement with the United States, we decided that as soon as the agreement comes into effect, all automobiles stolen in the United States will be the legal property of the people who bought them?" protested Piotr L. Andrzejewski, on behalf of the Club of the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union "Solidarity." "The theft of computer software and the theft of automobiles are two entirely different things; a person who obtained given software in a non- prohibited manner cannot be told not to use it," argued Senator Jan Orzechowski of the Polish Peasant Party; the majority of the senators agreed with his view. "Poland is believed to be a real paradise for pirates. The production and sale of those people's products is a large sector of the economy; however, it is in fact like a tumor. Due to the fact that this sector exists, everyone is losing, except the pirates themselves," said Piotr Lukasiewicz, undersecretary of state in the Ministry of Culture and Art; he was for maintaining the absolution concerning stolen software. Among the proposals that the senators turned down was also prolonging vacation legis [preceding two words in Latin] from three to six months from the day the law is passed -- "to give appropriate establishments the time to become familiar with it." It was agreed that it will be lawful to perform literary, musical, and literary-musical works in public, free of charge ("if this is not done with a view to making a profit"), and to distribute them, without the author's permission, for "didactic and scientific purposes." The senators decided that a court of law must state the forfeiture of the "unlawfully manufactured specimens of works"; it may also, but is not obliged by the law, to state the forfeiture of the objects by means of which the offense was committed. Solidarity senators expressed doubts of a rather general nature. Piotr L. Andrzejewski stated that the Copyright Law violates the constitutional right to associate and introduces a "Stalinist criterion of the warranty of the right administration," which will be decided by the governmental administration. On Thursday [13 January], the Sejm also adopted amendments to the Geological and Mining Law.
