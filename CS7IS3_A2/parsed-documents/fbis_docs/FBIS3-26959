December 26 of this year marks the centenary of the birth of Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the people of various nationalities throughout the country and the founder of the CPC, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the PRC. During the days when the entire party and the people throughout the country ceremoniously commemorate the centenary of the birth of Mao Zedong with great respect, the vast number of party members, cadres, and the masses of Beijing Municipality, like the people in other areas of the country, cherish the deep memory and particularly warm feeling toward Comrade Mao Zedong. As early as the 4 May Movement, Comrade Mao Zedong came to Beijing twice to explore the truth of revolution and the road to the liberation of the Chinese nation and, enlightened by Marxism-Leninism, became a firm communist. On the eve of the national victory in the Chinese revolution, Mao Zedong and his comrades-in-arms devised strategies in Beijing and commanded the great army of a million people to cross Chang Jiang, occupy Nanjing, and put an end to the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. On 1 October 1949, Comrade Mao Zedong personally raised the first five-star red flag of the new China on the rostrum of Tiananmen and solemnly declared to the world that Chinese people were standing. After the founding of the country, Comrade Mao Zedong lived and worked in Beijing all the time. In the process of leading China's socialist revolution and construction, he was always concerned with the people and the various works of the capital. He left footmarks in many places and gave instructions to many people. This is what the people of Beijing Municipality will not forget. The purpose for the Beijing municipal party committee, people's congress standing committee, government, and committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Beijing Garrison in holding this forum marking the centenary of the birth of Comrade Mao Zedong today is to review Comrade Mao Zedong's great achievements, further study Mao Zedong Thought, always hold high the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and advance bravely; and to pursue the road to socialism with Chinese characteristics that was pioneered by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, persist in reform, open wider to the outside world, and express our deep memory of Comrade Mao Zedong with outstanding results in various work. 1. Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist and a great proletarian revolutionary, strategist, and theorist. His greatest historical achievement was to integrate the fundamental tenets of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of Chinese revolution, lead our party and people to find a correct road for new democratic revolution, fulfill the task of opposing imperialism and feudalism, and put an end to the Chinese history of semi-colonial and semi- feudal society; and to eliminate the exploiting class and the system of exploitation and establish a brand-new socialist system. Proceeding from China's reality, he then began to explore the road of building socialism. Based on the fundamental tenets of Marxism-Leninism and with Comrade Mao Zedong as the major representative, the Chinese communists came up with a theoretical summary of the series of original experiences in China's long practice of revolution and construction to form a scientific guiding thought compatible with China's conditions which we refer to as Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is extensive and profound. It has enriched and developed Marxism-Leninism with its original theory in the fields of philosophy, political economy, scientific socialism, military science, culture and art, and party building. It is the treasure-house of the theory of our party and the spiritual pillar of the Chinese nation and is the constant guide to our building of a modern socialist country. In the practice of leading the revolution and construction of China, Comrade Mao Zedong attached high importance to the great role of ideological theory. He demanded that we arm the whole party with Marxism-Leninism, regard the adherence to Marxist dialectical materialism as a conspicuous part of the party's building of ideological theory, and wage an unremitting struggle against idealism and metaphysics that deviate from dialectical materialism. Comrade Mao Zedong made many profound and brilliant expositions on the extremely great significance in studying and grasping Marxism-Leninism. He highly praised the following remarks of Lenin: "Without the theory of revolution, there would be no revolution movement." Comrade Mao Zedong maintained: Without the theory of revolution, it is impossible to achieve success in guiding a great political party of revolutionary movement. He pointed out: The salvos of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism. The October Revolution helped advanced elements of the whole world and of China to use the proletarian world outlook, that was regarded as the instrument to observe the destiny of our country, to reconsider the issues of their own." Chinese Communists, represented by Comrade Mao Zedong, found the proletarian world outlook, a sharp weapon we used to observe the issues of China, initiated the Chinese-oriented Marxism-Leninism--Mao Zedong Thought, and guided the whole party and all the people in the country to win a victory in the new democratic revolution. Right after the founding of the PRC, he again explicitly pointed out: "The theoretical foundation that guides our ideology is Marxism-Leninism." The Chinese Communists were able to make difficult and tortuous explorations in the revolution and construction of China and in the march from victory to victory precisely because they were armed with Marxism- Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. In studying Marxism-Leninism, what should be studied first? Comrade Mao Zedong maintained: What is most important is to grasp -- dialectical materialism and historical materialism, the essential components of Marxist philosophy. He repeatedly admonished the whole party: "Marxism-Leninism is science" and truth. The founding of Marxism-Leninism is an unprecedented big revolution in the history of mankind's understanding. Marxists and Communists "have applied materialist dialectics to many fields of the analysis of mankind history and the analysis of natural history and to many fields of the change in society and the change in nature, thus obtaining extremely great success." Comrade Mao Zedong called on the whole party to conscientiously grasp the proletarian world outlook and methodology of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, in approaching, analyzing, and solving the practical problems of China by studying the fundamental theory of Marxism-Leninism. Comrade Mao Zedong himself set a glorious example for us with his immortal philosophic works, such as "On Practice," "On Contradiction," and "Whence the People's Correct Ideas?," will radiate with the light of truth forever. Comrade Mao Zedong constantly stressed that the key to studying Marxism and Leninism is to be well acquainted with their stands, viewpoints and methods, and oppose subjectivism, dogmatism, idealism and metaphysics. In the study of Marxism and Leninism, if we fail to exert efforts to grasp their stands, viewpoints and methods, and understand only some phrases, we will surely fall into idealism and metaphysics; if we use them to guide our work, we will surely commit subjective and dogmatic mistakes. Comrade Mao Zedong firmly defended the Marxist dialectical materialism. He pointed out explicitly and profoundly that Marxism is a "theory which can be used as a criterion all over the world," that we should not treat it as a dogma but a guide to action, and that we should not "only study some phrases and sentences of Marxism and Leninism but study it as a science of revolution." Mao Zedong believed that subjectivism, dogmatism, and empiricism was all ideology and metaphysics, and that they all have the "characteristics of dividing subjectivism and objectivism and disconnecting recognition and practice." The ideology of bourgeois liberalization that negates the four cardinal principles emerged in the course of reform and opening up, while "leftist" ideology that negates reform and opening up has not conformed to reality and the national conditions of our country. As far as the source of the theory of knowledge is concerned, it also separates subjectivism from objectivism and disconnects theory from practice. Therefore, only by grasping the stands, viewpoints and methods of Marxism and Leninism well can we be able to uphold a correct viewpoint, correctly sum up experience, overcome difficulties, make less mistakes and do more work. Why should we study and grasp Marxism and Leninism ? It is because we want to apply them to solving practical problems. Comrade Mao Zedong stressed: " We should purposefully study Marxist and Leninist theories," "have a definite object in view," and "use the arrow of Marxism and Leninism to shoot the target of the revolution of China." He particularly criticized the aimless attitude of studying the stands, viewpoints and methods of Marxism and Leninism not for the purpose of solving the theoretical and strategic issues of the revolution of China but "to simply study theories," and strictly criticized the bad study work style of merely taking the "arrow" of Marxism and Leninism "in the hand, praising it repeatedly, saying that it is a `good arrow,' but not wanting to shoot it out." He pointed out sharply that if we fail to clarify and solve this issue well, "our party's theoretical level will never be raised and China will never win a victory in its revolution." Comrade Mao Zedong always upheld the viewpoint of attaching prime importance to the practice of dialectical materialist theory, constantly undertaken investigations and studies, and stressed that while correct ideology and understanding can only come from practice, they must be tested by practice. He believed that the "correct ideology of man can only comes from social practice," and that "a correct understanding can be formed through repetition, such as turning material understanding to spiritual understanding and spiritual understanding to material understanding; in other words, practice into understanding, and understanding into practice." We should test and develop truth in the course of practice. He held that our party's correct and unshakable tactics could never be formulated by a small number of people who stayed at home to "cudgel their brains to `think of ways' and `make decisions'" "based on their subjective desires," and that we should "learn about social conditions and conduct realistic investigations often." Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong advocated within the party the need to vigorously conduct investigation and study. "No investigation, no right to speak," "No correct investigation, no right to speak, either" were his famous maxims. It was our efforts to uphold and carry forward the party's fine tradition of investigation and study and to adhere to Comrade Mao Zedong's line of dialectical materialist theory of knowledge -- "practice-knowledge-again practice-again knowledge -- that enabled our understanding to be improved to a new height following developments in practice and enabled the cause of our party and people to advance in the practice of continuous exploration. Comrade Mao Zedong advocated the need to extensively launch an education movement to study Marxism-Leninism in the entire party and among the people throughout the country. He maintained that everyone should study some philosophy. Soon after the war of resistance against Japan, he called on the entire party to launch an emulation in studying Marxism-Leninism to "see who has truly learned something, learned more, and learned better." In 1942, he personally led the Yanan rectification movement and launched an extensive Marxism-Leninism education movement for studying dialectical materialism, historical materialism, and Comrade Mao Zedong's basic works on the rectification movement, such as "Transform Our Study," "Rectify the Party's Work Styles," and "Oppose Stereotyped Party Writing," thus liberating the vast number of party members from the mental shackles of dogmatism, empiricism, and, especially, Wang Ming dogmatism and then enabling the entire party to achieve unprecedented unity and further maturity and ensuring the victory of the war of resistance against Japan and success in the new democratic revolution in the country. After the founding of new China, he again issued calls on many occasions for extensively studying Marxism-Leninism and organizing "a powerful theoretical contingent in which millions of people study the theoretical foundation of Marxism, namely dialectical and historical materialism, and oppose various types of idealism and mechanical materialism." He called for "liberating philosophy from the classrooms and books of philosophers and turning it into a sharp weapon of the masses." This weapon, once mastered by the masses, will become a tremendous material force to transform society and the world. Thanks to Comrade Mao Zedong's advocacy and promotion, an atmosphere of attaching importance to theories and studying theories took shape in the party, which still benefits us a great deal. 2. The second-generation leadership collective of the party Central Committee with Comrade Deng Xiaoping as the core scientifically accomplished the important task of correctly appraising Comrade Mao Zedong and safeguarding the historical position of Mao Zedong Thought, a task concerning the future and destiny of the party and the state, and pooled the wisdom of the entire party and the people of the whole country with the tremendous political courage to blaze a new road of building socialism and the tremendous courage to pioneer a new realm of Marxist theory. It established, in a creative manner, the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. This represented another, even greater historical leap after our party successfully found a road for new democratic revolution and established the socialist system. It unfolded before the entire party and the people of the whole country a magnificent prospect for a prosperous, democratic, civilized socialist modern country. Comrade Deng Xiaoping inherited and developed Mao Zedong Thought, regarded adherence to and defence of Marxist- Leninist philosophy -- dialectical materialism and historical materialism -- as the most important and fundamental link, and used this philosophy to guide practice in China. He particularly paid attention to using the dialectical materialist theory of knowledge to guide the practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Following the "Cultural Revolution," Comrade Deng Xiaoping upheld the Marxist materialism and brought order out of chaos in the field of knowledge with a great Marxist's boldness of vision. After the smashing of the "gang of four," he took the lead in resisting and criticizing the erroneous principle of "two whatever," and supported, guided, and promoted the nationwide discussion of regarding practice as the sole criterion for testing truth, thus breaking with the trammels of "leftist" ideas. He always maintained that "true Marxists and Leninists must understand, inherit, and develop Marxism-Leninism in accordance with the present situation." "Marxists refusing to use new ideas and viewpoints to inherit and develop Marxism are not true Marxists." In light of the confusion and misgivings among some comrades within the party, he repeatedly stressed the necessity of "completely and accurately understanding Mao Zedong Thought," and the necessity of "being good at studying, mastering, and applying the system of Mao Zedong Thought to guide all the work. This is the only way to prevent us from cutting apart and distorting Mao Zedong Thought and from damaging Mao Zedong Thought." This enabled the whole party to again go back to the correct Marxist line of knowledge and laid ideological and theoretical foundations for the convocation of the third plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, which is of great historical significance. Another major contribution made by Comrade Deng Xiaoping to the party's ideological and theoretical building is the establishment of the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts using Marxist dialectical materialism as the weapon. Comrade Deng Xiaoping proceeded from China's reality to form the theory of the initial stage of China's socialism to formulate the party's basic line of "one central task and two basic points," and to seek the road of developing the socialism with Chinese characteristics, precisely under the guidance of the Marxist line of knowledge, thus making China's socialist cause embark on a new period of vigorous development. Also, precisely under the guidance of the Marxist line of knowledge known as emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, Comrade Deng Xiaoping thoroughly overhauled the long-standing conclusion of plans being the essential characteristic of socialism and pointed out "that having more plans or more markets is not the essential difference between socialism and capitalism. While a planned economy is not tantamount to socialism and capitalism has plans; a market economy is not tantamount to capitalism, and socialism also has markets. Both of plans and markets are economic means." "Whatever is conducive to the development of productive forces can by utilized." The third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee adopted the "CPC Central Committee's decision on some issues of establishing a socialist market economic structure," in line with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the 14th CPC Congress. This is an extremely important contribution made by Comrade Deng Xiaoping to the treasure-house of the Marxist theory. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has specifically and flexibly applied the development view of dialectical materialism of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought to the reality of building socialist modernizations. His noted inference is that "only development represents an essential criterion". All things in the world are in the course of ceaseless movement, development, and changes. They never remain in a period or at a level forever, so does socialism as long as it has become a brand-new social system. In dealing with this issue in the past, we lacked the viewpoint of Marxist theory of dialectical materialism; somewhat had one-sidedness in understanding the socialist essence; did not stress "the emancipation of productive forces through reforms"; and did not totally master the meaning between "emancipating productive forces and developing them". All of these have enabled us to experience a tortuous path and to pay for them. By studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and particularly studying his viewpoint and thought relating to development, we have suddenly seen the light and upgraded our understanding on socialism to a new realm. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Poverty does not mean socialism and extremely slow development does not also." By being divorced from development, we cannot firmly grasp the upholding of socialist systems, direction, and road. "The most fundamental task in this regard is to develop productive forces. In the final analysis, the socialist superiority should give expression to productive force development being faster or higher than that of capitalism and to steadily improving the people's livelihood based on developing the productive force". Then, "efforts should be made to prepare a foundation for entering the age of Communism". "By not doing so will we never be able to develop productive forces, to do away with the egalitarianism and the practice of eating from the same big pot, to improve the people's livelihood, and to bring the people's enthusiasm into play". Thus, the socialist undertakings of modernizations will come to nothing. Comrade Deng Xiaoping also pointed out: "We should not block localities that are able to achieve development and localities whose conditions meet should engage in development as faster as possible. It is nothing for us to worry about as long as these localities stress economic results and quality and develop the export-oriented economy". Based on this development ideology, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has formulated for the entire party a set of strategies, principles, and policies for accelerating the socialist development. The entire party and the people throughout the country should arm themselves with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought on development being an essential criterion and extremely play their enthusiasm and creativeness so as to promote the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics to forge ahead and bring about changes day after day. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has applied the Marxist philosophical viewpoint of practice being the first to the practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and urged the entire party to dare to try, to pioneer, and to take risk in building socialism. Upholding practice being the first, respecting the objective law, bringing the subjective initiative into full play, and "daring to try and pioneer," truly represent the upholding of Marxist theory of dialectical materialism. Marx once said: "Philosophers only adopt different styles to explain the world, however, the issue in this regard lies in changing the world". Those who have just sat there to talk about theories, indulged in empty talks, and not dared to do this or that, do not know Marxism even slightly. Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out: In fighting the revolutionary wars, "we have not learned them well in advance but we begin to study them after we have engaged in. Thus, fighting means learning." Comrade Deng Xiaoping also repeatedly emphasized that socialism is achieved through hard work. He said: Socialism with Chinese characteristics that we are developing has been "unheard of in China's several thousand years of history" and "an undertaking never developed in other socialist countries. Therefore, there is no ready experience to learn from. We can only learn in the process of work and explore in the process of practice." He urged us to "boldly experiment and blaze new trails regarding the endeavors whose worth we are certain" and never act slowly and overcautiously like women with bound feet. Otherwise, we "will be unable to blaze a good road or a new road and unable to pioneer a new cause." He repeatedly reminded people: "It is necessary to overcome fear and have courage. There must be someone to conduct the first experiment in any field. Only then can a new road be opened. We should be prepared for failure when conducting the first experiment. Failure is nothing serious." What is important is that we should have the ability to summarize experiences and "persist in what is right and rapidly correct what is wrong." This philosophical idea of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's has greatly encouraged and inspired our spirit and has extremely important guiding significance in accelerating China's reform, opening up, and modernization drive. Comrade Deng Xiaoping emphasized that in studying Marxist theory, we should achieve proficiency, find use for, become familiar with, and master the fundamental tenets. The classical works of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought are as vast as the open sea. In studying them, we should adhere to the principle of studying less more proficiently, and make them useful. Comrade Deng Xiaoping earnestly said to new and old cadres on many occasions: "Time and tasks are different for our current endeavor to build socialism with Chinese characteristics, and there is indeed plenty of new knowledge to study. This requires that we master the basic theory of Marxism to comply with the new reality because only then can we improve our skills to use basic principles and basic methods to actively explore ways to resolve basic political, economic, social, and cultural issues." We should "familiarize ourselves with the basic theory of Marxism to acquire a stronger sense of adherence to principles in work, a systematic approach, foresight, and creativity." He particularly pointed out: "The several hundred members of the party Central Committee and the several thousand central and local high- ranking cadres should take the lead in assiduously studying modernized economic construction." Standing at the crest of the tide of this era, Comrade Deng Xiaoping is not only a brilliant example for the entire party in emancipating the mind and conducting exploration bravely but also a brilliant example in the creative application of the fundamental tenets of Marxism-Leninism. Thanks to his mastery of the historical law governing social development with Marxist historical materialism, Comrade Deng Xiaoping is confident in the success of Marxism and communism. In view of the abrupt changes in East Europe, the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the serious setbacks and low tide of socialism in some countries, and some people's doubts and waverings about Marxism, Comrade Deng Xiaoping showed great foresight to point out: "I firmly believe that people who approve of Marxism will increase in the world because Marxism is a science, which uses historical materialism to bring to light the law governing the development of human society." This fully shows Comrade Deng Xiaoping's adherence to truth, loyalty to Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, and firm faith in working hard all his life for the communist cause. Comrades! When we commemorate the centenary of the birth of Comrade Mao Zedong, the most fundamental task is to uphold the theoretical foundation of the Marxist dialectical materialism, arm the whole party with Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, actually strengthen the building of the party's ideology and theory, and guide and promote the sustained, rapid, and sound development of the capital's reform, opening up, and economic construction. First, we should profoundly study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping in close combination with realities. Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping has collected Comrade Deng Xiaoping's most important and most creative works written in the process of forming and developing the theory of building the socialism with Chinese characteristics, thus being a scientific guide to our continuous advance. The central authorities have already adopted the decision of studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. We should carry forward the style of study of integrating theory with practice, that was initiated by Comrade Mao Zedong. In studying this book, we should have a good command of focal points, study and read original works in deptb, and profoundly comprehend the essence of guidelines. In close combination with the realities of work and ideology, we should conscientiously summarize the experiences gained from the practice of reform, opening up, and economic construction over the past dozen of years, further clarify all sorts of confused understandings of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and strive to master the theory of building the socialism with Chinese characteristics in an all-round and specific manner rather than in a fragmentary and empty manner in order to continuously push forward the cause of reform, opening up, and economic construction. Second, we should persistently implement the knowledge line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, continuously renew our concepts, continuously break with the trammels of idealism and metaphysics, and strive to avoid subjective one-sidedness. Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out: "Emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts are the quintessence of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and are the magic weapon to ensure that our party will be vigorous and vivid forever." By emancipating the mind, we mean extricating the people's ideas from the yoke of idealism and metaphysics; making ideas conform to practice and subjective things conform to objective ones; and persisting in dialectical materialism and seeking truth from facts. Emancipating the mind precisely means seeking truth from facts. On no account should we separate the emancipation of the mind from the seeking of truth, still less set any of them against the other. In recent years, we have launched mass discussions on emancipating the mind on four occasions in succession throughout the municipality, and every mass discussion has brought us a new leap in ideology and understanding and brought big enhancement to all items of work. It should be noted that the objective world undergoes constant change, and the ideas and concepts that reflect the objective world are also undergoing constant change. There is no end to the emancipation of the mind as a process of continuously deepening the understanding of the objective world. If we do not understand this point and pay no attention it, our ideas will become stagnant, rigid, and fall into subjective one-sidedness. At present, we should emancipate our minds to focus on the endeavors to accelerate the establishment of the socialist market economy system, to extend the degree of reform in establishing the modern enterprise system, to seize the opportunity to accelerate development and promote the economy of the capital to a new height every few years, and on the long-standing difficulties and hot issues that have prevented various departments and units from advance and the fear of difficulty resulting from this. Rapid construction of the capital and comprehensive progress in all sectors of society can be achieved only when we continuously emancipate our minds, eliminate ideological obstacles, free ourselves form the fetters of subjectivism and metaphysics, seek truth from facts, and proceed from reality in doing everything. Third, we should continue to vigorously develop the trend of investigation and study to put our policy decisions on a more scientific and reliable base. "No investigation, no right to speak." As far as the leaders of a locality or a department are concerned, no right to speak means no right to make decisions. Leading organs and leading persons who cannot make decisions, in reality, have no right to leadership although they assume leading posts. The investigation and study activities extensively conducted throughout the municipality since the beginning of this year have not only helped cadres enhance their understanding of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics but also built a bridge to integrate theory with practice. Through investigations and study, many leading cadres have achieved a good command of knowledge, namely emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, and learned to use the Marxist stand, viewpoints, and methods to analyze and summarize the new problems and new experiences in reform, opening up, and economic construction. Many new ideas, new measures, large-scale moves, and creations compatible with their respective localities and departments have been put forward, and the work of their units have also taken on a new look. The vigorous trend of investigation and study has had a good beginning in the municipality. The municipal party committee has conducted investigation and study four times this year. Next year, it should set forth topics for investigation and study, include it in its plans, assign persons to be responsible for it, and conduct it four times. The good tradition of investigation and study must persist on a long-term basis. Fourth, we should make continuous efforts to resolve the issues on world outlook and the outlook on life and truly join the party ideologically. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "A change in world outlook is a fundamental change." Only when we master the scientific, dialectical materialist, and historical materialist world outlook, can we embrace a firm communist outlook on life, truly join the party ideologically, never be subdued by force or shaken by poverty, be impervious to the temptation of wealth and high position, and never shake our communist faith under any circumstances. Many revolutionary martyrs did not yield or bend their will even when faced with the knife of the enemy. Today, as long as we embrace a firm communist world outlook and outlook on life, the plot of western hostile forces to effect our peaceful evolution will never succeed. Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping, and other old proletarian revolutionaries firmly embraced the communist world outlook, the communist faith, noble moral character, and the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people, thus becoming models for our times. Comrade Mao Zedong always stressed: "At any time and any place, communists should not put their personal interests at the fore, but should subjugate their personal interests beneath the interests of the Chinese nation and the people." He sharply criticized: "Selfishness, slackness in work, corruption and embezzlement, and the practice of being fond of the limelight are most contemptible." Those who indulge in such practices "do not understand at all what the proletarian idea is, what communism is, and what the party is." Under the new situation of developing the socialist market economy, we should guide the vast numbers of party members, leading cadres of the party in particular, to firmly embrace the communist world outlook and the communist outlook on life, to consciously resist and overcome the inroads of corrosive capitalist and feudal ideas, to consciously resist the influence from money worship, extreme individualism, and corrosive style of life, to honestly perform official duties, and to work diligently for the people so that they can truly become "noble persons," "pure persons," "persons absolved of bad taste," "persons conducive to the masses," and "persons with lofty ideals, moral integrity, cultural accomplishments, and a sense of discipline, so that they can struggle for the communist cause all their lives. If we pay no attention to remolding the outlook on the world and on life, we will eventually be eliminated by the times, and will certainly witness the situation pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong in which some persons always think: "What on earth are proletarian ideas, and isn't it the same old stuff? How can they know that it is not easy to obtain it." These persons will "have lack communist flavor all their lives, and thus they cannot but deviate from the party." Fifth, we must closely combine the building of ideology and theory with the implementation of the party's political line. The party's basic line of "one central task and two basic points" was formulated under the guidance of the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts and by proceeding from the basic conditions of our country. Therefore, this line has manifested the fundamental interests of the people throughout the country, is in keeping with the realities, and is scientific, correct, and unchanging for a long time. Only by understanding the scientific nature and correctness of this line in ideology and theory, can we even more consciously persist in the party's basic line without deviation for a hundred of years in line with the demands set by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. We should educate the vast numbers of party members, cadres, and the masses to always pay attention to the central task of economic construction, to always set to right the relationship between reform and opening up and the adherence to the four cardinal principles, and to always persist in the principle of "taking a two-handed approach and being tough with both hands." At the same time, we must continuously get rid of the interference from the erroneous "left" and right ideas. We should guard against the right, but should primarily prevent the "left." Only by unswervingly upholding the party's basic line, can we ensure that our country will maintain long-term stability and order, can we put our socialist cause in an invincible position, and can we again win the glory of the Chinese nation. Sixth, in studying Marxist theories we should particularly apply the Marxist "theory" at present to aim at overfulfilling the municipal "target" of becoming better-off in three years. In line with the current world situation and our country's reality, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has formulated the grand blueprint for the entire party and the people throughout the country regarding the realization of socialist modernization in three steps. As a matter of fact, people should eat their meal one mouthful after the other and cultivate their fields one by one. According to this saying, the current task of Beijing Municipality is to overfulfill the target of becoming better-off based on the results of having had the people dress warmly and eat their fill. We should accelerate the pace in reform, opening up, and economic development in line with the guiding principle of it being favorable for developing socialist social productive forces, for enhancing the comprehensive strength of socialist countries, and for upgrading the people's livelihood. Localities where conditions allow faster development should strive to achieve development as quickly as possible to contribute to the national undertakings of socialist modernization and to realizing the strategic target in three steps. Comrades: The Marxist theories of dialectical and historical materialism constitute a system of revolutionary ideological theories, which is most perfect, systematic, and scientific. The more than 100-year history has eloquently proven that the powerful ideologically theoretical weapon of dialectical materialism is invincible. The law of human historical development, which has been exposed by the dialectical materialism, tells us that socialism will replace capitalism as capitalism did in the feudalist society. Such historical progress cannot be changed by anybody. China is determined to become prosperous and the victory scored by socialism with Chinese characteristics in China cannot be blocked by any force. We should rally round the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core; uphold the dialectical materialism; earnestly study Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought; study contemporary Marxism in China, Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; and boldly march forward in line with our fixed fighting targets. We must realize the teaching by Comrade Mao Zedong during his life time, which reads that "China should make greater contributions to mankind." We must make efforts to build China, whose population accounts for one fifth of the total of the world, into a rich, strong, democratic, civilized, and socialist country. A success, itself, made by us in this regard represents an important contribution to mankind and will become the best commemoration offered by us to Comrade Mao Zedong.
