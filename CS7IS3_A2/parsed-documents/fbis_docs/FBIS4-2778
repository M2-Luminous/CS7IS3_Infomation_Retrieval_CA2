"By the end of last year, China was ranked the world's sixth-biggest country in beef output, compared with being in only 12th place in 1978," Vice-Minister of Agriculture Zhang Yanxi told a three-day national meeting on livestock development that ends today. Last year, China produced a total of 2.3 million tons of beef, a 28.9 percent rise over the previous year, said Zhang. The sustained growth in livestock production over the past decade has raised annual per capita meat consumption to 32.3 kilograms, which is the world average. Zhang attributed the success over the past 14 years primarily to a change in the type of cattle feed. Instead of using precious grain for feed, cattle breeders are using fermented plant stalks and other agricultural by-products. Since 1992, 59 pilot rural counties have been given the backing of the central government to use the stalks to raise cattle. The farmers have been provided with urea and plastic sheets, which are used to make the fermented feed. Now about 2 million farmers use this method, according to Zhang. Although the demonstration counties represent only 2.7 percent of the total rural counties in the country, beef production in those sites accounts for 15 percent of the country's output, Zhang said. Some of the counties' beef products are exported to Eastern Europe, the Middle East, the Commonwealth of Independent States and other regions. The biggest beef-producers include Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Anhui and Sichuan provinces. At the meeting, authorized by the State Council, honours for outstanding achievements in the livestock industry were handed out to individuals and units in Shandong and Henan provinces, Fuyang Prefecture in Anhui Province, Zhoukou Prefecture in Henan Province and 10 other counties. The utilization of plant stalks and agricultural by-products not only has helped boost the livestock industry but has also saved a large quantity of grain, which is usually used for feed. China's success has garnered world-wide attention and praise, Zhang said. "It is very significant at present to extend the technology and to develop the low-grain-consuming livestock industry, since the country's grain production in limited," Zhang noted. In the past decade, beef production has increased 20 percent annually.
