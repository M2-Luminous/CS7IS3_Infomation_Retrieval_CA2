SUMMARY: The Commission requests comments on a petition filed by Omak Community Broadcasters proposing the allotment of Channel 282C2 to Omak, Washington, as that community's second local FM transmission service.

The coordinates for Channel 282C2 at Omak are North Latitude 48&hyph;15&hyph;44 and West Longitude 119&hyph;31&hyph;58. Since Omak is located within 320 kilometers (200 miles) of the U.S.-Canadian border, Canadian concurrence has been requested.
