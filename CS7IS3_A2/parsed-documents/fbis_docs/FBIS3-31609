The exception is only the party SK-DJ [Communist League Movement for Yugoslavia], which condemned this uncivilized Greek act, and emphasized that the consequences would mostly be felt by the innocent citizens. However, the most obvious demonstration of the policy of double standards is best represented by the attitude of the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia], which, at a state level, came out against the UN intention to impose sanctions against Croatia, while it silently supported an illegal and damaging Greek measure, otherwise, immediately condemned throughout the world.
