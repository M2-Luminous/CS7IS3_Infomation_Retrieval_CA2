Scientists have linked ammonia emissions from livestock with acidification of forest soils, which causes parts of trees to wither and die. The research, carried out by the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology's Merlewood Research Station at Grange-over-Sands, Cumbria, has drawn attention to a source of pollution that up to now has been all but ignored in Britain. Since 1950 there has been a 50 per cent growth in emissions of ammonia over Europe and in some countries it may have doubled. Agriculture is believed to account for 95 per cent of these emissions and the new research indicates that large tracts of British woodland may be suffering as a result. The study, carried out by Dr Phil Ineson with funding from the Department of the Environment, concentrated on Scots pine and Norway spruce woods near a pig farm at Wensleydale in the Yorkshire Dales. Dr Ineson, writing in the Natural Environment Research Council's Nerc News, said measurements showed high levels of ammonia-linked pollution downwind of the farm and less upwind. Concentrations were highest during muck spreading and when pigs were moved on to the farm in the winter and spring. TIMES NEWSPAPERS LIMITED, 1994
