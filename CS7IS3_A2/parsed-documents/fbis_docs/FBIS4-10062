Congress President Carlos Roberto Flores Facusse explained that he understands the concern of the opposition political parties. They are annoyed because Lucio Izaguirre, President Reina's private secretary, charged there were opposition plans to destabilize the government. "This democracy is costing the Honduran people dearly, particularly the political parties, without whom there would be no state of law," he said. "To generalize in such a way is improper and constitutes an attack on the country's institutional structure. This is why we are taking these charges seriously and instructing the Constitutional Compliance Commission to stay abreast of the trends this investigation may uncover," he said. He said appropriate measures will be taken if, after examining the results of the investigation, he finds reason enough to believe that false accusations have been made that could violate the state of law or damage the dignity of the political parties. He also demanded the commission file a detailed report to the congressional plenum, explaining how well founded these charges are in order to reach the proper decisions. The commission members are Jorge Roberto Maradiaga, Rodolfo Irias Navas, Jose Raul Pineda Alvarado, Oscar Armando Avila Banegas, Gautama Fonseca, Hector Ramon Trochez, and Luis German Lagos.
