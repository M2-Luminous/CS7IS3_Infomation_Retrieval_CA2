The shells are falling close to the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) tent, the radio said. Provocations and ceasefire violations are on the rise in Mostar, city in southeast Bosnia, despite the negotiations which started five days ago in Vienna between the Bosnian Moslems and Croats on their joint federation in this former Yugoslav republic. Sarajevo radio said in a program, monitored in Belgrade, that Bosnian Croat snipers on Tuesday fired from the Mostar airport on the southern suburb of Gnojnice. Bosnian Croat Army Chief-of-Staff General Milivoj Petkovic said in Mostar that a joint Moslem-Croat army command for Sarajevo will shortly be set up and that in time it would be transformed into a federal command of the joint Bosnian army. He added that the deadlines for this remain undefined so far because this issue is as delicate as is the defining of the borders of the cantons within the future Moslem-Croat federation. Petkovic urged the forming of a joint, but not single federal army, the Croatian radio said. Following year-long heavy fighting in central and southeast Bosnia, the Bosnian Croats and Moslems on March 18 succumbed to U.S. pressure in Washington and signed an agreement on setting up a federation in Bosnia and a subsequent confederation with the neighbouring ex-Yugoslav republic of Croatia. Central Bosnia and the cities of Mostar and Stolac (both in southeast Bosnia) remain the stumbling block of the Vienna talks. Both sides claim they are entitled to these territories with a mixed population and neither show the least wish for a compromise.
