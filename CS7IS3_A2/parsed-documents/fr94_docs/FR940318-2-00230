FR940318-2-00230 FR940318-2-00116 II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the proposed Rule Change On November 19, 1993, the NASD submitted Amendment No. 4 to its proposed short sale rule or ``bid test'' applicable to stocks traded on the Nasdaq National Market to provide for an eighteen-month pilot program that would afford equity options market makers with a limited exemption from the rule if the short sales were effected to hedge options positions established as a result of bona fide market making activity. 2 This amendment reflected the NASD's efforts to strike a reasonable balance between the needs of equity options market makers to effectively hedge their long options positions through short sales 3 and the NASD's need to implement a meaningful short sale rule for the Nasdaq Stock Market (``Nasdaq'') that does not contain broad and sweeping exemptions that eviscerate the rule's effectiveness. 2 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33289 (December 3, 1993), 58 FR 64994 (December 12, 1993). 3 The options exchanges and options market makers have consistently argued, among other things, that the absence of an exemption from the NASD's short sale rule for options market makers will have an adverse impact on the liquidity and pricing of options on Nasdaq securities and that it is inconsistent with the Act to afford Nasdaq market makers an exemption from the rule and not options market makers. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31729 (January 13, 1993), 58 FR 5791 (``Amendment No. 3 Notice''). See also, e.g. , letter to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC, from the American, New York, Pacific and Philadelphia Stock Exchanges, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange dated February 18, 1993. Recently, however, the options exchanges have maintained that it is equally important for the efficiency of the marketplace that index options market makers be able to avail themselves of an exemption from the NASD's short sale rule for hedging purposes. Accordingly, the NASD is proposing another amendment to its short sale rule to accommodate the hedging needs of index options market makers. In particular, the NASD proposes to modify the equity options market maker exemption to include short sales effected by index options market makers. Specifically, under the proposed index options market maker exemption, an NASD member will be permitted, consistent with its quotation obligations, to execute a short sale for the account of an options market maker that would otherwise be in contravention of the NASD's short sale rule so long as: (1) The short sale is an ``exempt hedge transaction''; and (2) the options market maker is registered with a ``qualified options exchange'' 4 as a ``qualified options market maker'' on a ``qualified stock index.'' An ``exempt hedge transaction'' is defined to be a short sale in a Nasdaq National Market security that was effected to hedge, and in fact serves to hedge, an existing offsetting stock index options position or an offsetting stock index options position that was created in a transaction(s) contemporaneous with the short sale, provided certain conditions are satisfied. These conditions are as follows: (a) The security sold short must be a component security of the index underlying such index option; (b) the index underlying such offsetting index options position must be a ``qualified stock index''; and (c) the dollar value of all exempt short sales effected to hedge the offsetting stock index options position(s) does not exceed the aggregate current index value of the offsetting options position(s). 4 As with the equity option market maker exemption, a ``qualified options exchange'' is defined to be a national securities exchange that has received SEC approval of rules and procedures governing: (1) The designation of options market makers as qualified options market makers; (2) the surveillance of its market makers utilization of the exemption; and (3) authorization of the NASD to withdraw, suspend, or modify the designation of a qualified options market maker in the event that the options exchange determines that the qualified options market maker has failed to comply with the terms of the exemption and the exchange believes that such action is warranted in light of the substantial, willful, or continuing nature of the violation.
