TIMES, that Pakistan has managed to build six to 12 Hiroshima-type bombs as part of its clandestine nuclear weapons program is significant for two reasons. In the first instance, it is not the number of bombs that Pakistan has stashed away in the basement that is germane. The United States was aware as early as in 1987 that Pakistan was embarked upon a determined clandestine nuclear weapons program and had accurate estimates about how much fissile grade material Islamabad had stockpiled. However, Washington preferred to pretend that it did not know as part of the Cold War charade. What the L.A. TIMES story does is to draw attention to the many promises and pledges broken by Pakistan in its dealings with the United States over military aid to its clandestine nuclear weapons program. This is the first important inference, namely that in the past, whether it was in 1981 or 1985, the supply of lethal modern military gadgetry by the United States has not deflected Pakistan from its single-minded pursuit of a covert nuclear weapons program. That a respected U.S. daily is saying this may be reflective of the growing public disenchantment within the United States over proliferation perplexities. The second significant aspect is the inside the L.A. TIMES story provides into the deep divisions within the U.S. establishment over the Pressler Amendment and its interpretation. As the report points out, many senior-most officials in the Clinton Administration appear to be keen to condone Pakistan's nuclear quest under ardent advocates of waiving the amendment. However, there are more perceptive and informed voices, including that of Senator Larry Pressler, who are seized with the enormity of this seemingly casual one-time waiver. It does appear that the Clinton team is deluding itself that a one-time waiver of the Pressler Amendment would induce Pakistan to cap its nuclear weapons program and that the proliferation problem in the region will then be resolved. Nothing could be further from the truth. Whether Pakistan has one bomb in the basement or 12, this is a level at which the United States hopes it will capped. But, as the North Korean and Iraqi examples have shown, clandestine nuclear programs do not lend themselves to satisfactory external monitoring, and in any case this capping will not assuage India's anxieties over a bomb in the neighboring basement where even the elected prime minister is not allowed to visit the nuclear facility, let alone control it.
