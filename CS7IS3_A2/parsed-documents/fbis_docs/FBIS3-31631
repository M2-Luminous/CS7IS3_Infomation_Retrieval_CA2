The review drawn up by the Chamber of Commerce shows that 60-80 percent of the products of "Jugohrom," "Zletovo," FENI and the Skopje steelworks, intended for export, transit through Greece, that is the Salonika port, and out of the total raw materials and repromaterials, 50-60 percent are imported through Greece. Some 52,000 tonnes of crude oil are currently at the crude oil installations of "Mamidakis" and "Jet Oil" in Salonika, while 116 cisterns are loaded at the station in Salonika and Idomeni. A ship carrying 18,000 of phosphate for the smeltery in Veles was caught in the process of unloading, and only 28 wagons have been dispatched, so far. 800 tonnes of ferro-alloys are ready to be loaded, a wooden construction of 500 cubic meters has been stocked, and there are also some 400 tonnes of sheet metal awaiting delivery, at the same port. As it was said yesterday, at the meeting of the Chamber of Commerce, this points to an alarming condition and the need to find alternative solutions. Certain businessmen said that the government is giving out hopes of false optimism, and that something much greater is behind this Greek move, and that a strategy of reciprocity should be worked out. The idea to look for a corridor for transit of the goods, through FR Yugoslavia, was also raised.
