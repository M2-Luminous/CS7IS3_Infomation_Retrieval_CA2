Such a hypothesis is plausible, because Filali did not ask leaders of political parties to participate in the future government, during his consultations with these parties last week, the daily explained. According to the daily, Filali expressed during the consultations some ideas on a government of national consensus, the consolidation of dialog between the government and the parliament and proposed a political and social truce to pave the way for a coming phase in which the opposition can participate in the government, the daily added. The newly-appointed premier confirmed to political parties that he will work for the consolidation of the role of the prime minister which means, according to 'AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT', that Filali will actually assume all his tasks as premier. Filali will propose the list of the new cabinet to King Hassan II next Wednesday, the daily said. Leaders of opposition parties, namely those of the Istiqlal Party and the Socialist Union of Popular Forces had told the daily that they would not participate in the Filali government and expressed a reserved optimism as to the possibility to open up the channels of `a different dialog' between the government and the opposition. The daily said that the opposition parties will present a joint memorandum to Filali expressing their viewpoint on the questions raised during the consultations.
