The government promised to defeat terrorism and propel the electoral process forward. According to political leaders, there are serious public order difficulties in 17 of the country's 32 departments. [Liberal Party leader Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala] "Evidently, peace has been broken and, thus, security has deteriorated." The politicians also believe the recent intensification of violent guerrilla activities, including abductions and attacks, has restricted the candidates' freedom to move about in their regions. [National Conservative Council President Cornelio Reyes] "We have received reports from several congressional candidates who have to campaign in helicopters because they cannot use the roads in their departments." Confronted with such a situation, the government asserted it is necessary to challenge the terrorist threats. [Government Minister Fabio Villegas] "Our goal is to have the direct presence of our Public Force in 100 percent of the municipal capital cities in the country during the electoral process." Furthermore, the political parties charged that the actions carried out by the guerrillas have reached an intolerable level. [Reyes] "There are areas, for example, the Aguachica municipality, where the guerrillas have not allowed traditional parties to open a political office." [Turbay Ayala] "I don't deny there is violence. I, however, assert there will be elections." The government affirms the 13 March elections are guaranteed by the presence of more than 100,000 Administrative Department of Security, police, and Army members.
