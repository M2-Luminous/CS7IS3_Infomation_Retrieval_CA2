In its "Standpoint" column, the paper says that Fahd, who is a robot controlled by his American masters, is more eager than his masters to harm the Arab nation and its national security and does not hesitate to commit even the most odious crimes against the Arab people. The paper stresses that Fahd cannot stand to see a neighboring country, such as Iraq, turning into a radiant center, nor can he stand to see unity on his regime's border, such as the Yemeni unity. Therefore, he imagines that through his illegal money he can oppose the course of history and the free will of the Arab people in Iraq and Yemen, and that he can harm the Arab centers of strength and radiance. The paper says that it is not surprising that the Saudi ruler should slander Iraq and Yemen in one address full of hatred for every glorious and honorable Arab stand and all aspirations for unity. The Arab people know Fahd as a meek ruler and an obedient servant of his imperialist and Zionist masters. The paper adds that after this ruler instigated the colonialist powers, distributing among them the money of the Arab people in Najd and Hejaz [Saudi Arabia], and blocked an Arab solution to the so-called Gulf crisis, Fahd placed a land that belongs to the Arabs and Muslims at the disposal of the aggressive Americans and their allies to launch the 30-state aggression against Arab, Muslim Iraq.
