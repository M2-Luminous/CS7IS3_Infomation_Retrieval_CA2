He gave a positive assessment of today's talks between Crimean and Ukrainian parliamentary delegations in Kiev. According to him, the negotiating teams managed to reach understanding and to enter into dialogue in search for a compromise. "We have an impression that Ukraine's Supreme Soviet is determined to find a solution to the existing problems and realizes that the current complicated situation in the Crimea was prompted by certain reasons", Tsekov pointed out. "It is not a result of activities of some political extremists and radicals that have come to power. This situation is quite objective, and problems it is generating should be solved without any use of force, but solely by means of negotiations", he stressed. The Crimean parliament speaker believes a mutual compromise would determine "Ukraine's fate rather than the Crimea's future". He noted that "all that has been done so far just tended to drive the existing problems deeper down. In fact, tensions were gradually stirred up over the past eighteen months of a difficult transition period. Meanwhile, there are no grounds for fuelling passions at the moment. Assertions about stepped up military preparations in the Crimea do not correspond to reality. Although there are certain facts: Amassing of Ukraine's national guard troops, sending of armoured combat vehicles to Simferopol. But all this is not as serious as one could think", Tsekov said. He warned that the situation should not be further aggravated. This threatens to affect the upcoming season of summer vacations, and therefore to undermine the Crimea's local budget. "If one intends to foment a conflict in the Crimea, he will not need large military forces, 500 troops will be quite enough", the Crimean speaker noted. But combat operations on the peninsula would inevitably mean its separation from Ukraine forever, he stressed, citing the examples of Nagorno-Karabakh, Moldova's Dniester region and Abkhazia. "We do not want this to happen. Obviously the use of military force cannot solve the existing problems", Tsekov said.
