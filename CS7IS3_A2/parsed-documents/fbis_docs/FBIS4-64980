In any case, there is no comprehensive round of talks with representatives of German industry on such critical issues as Russian taxation or crime on the agenda. Even so, Economic Minister Guenter Rexrodt would like to raise the subject of taxation problems and ways of improving the conditions for investments, which include the delivery of railroad carriages for the Russian state railroad and the construction of a machine plant in Kamas. The Economics Ministry in Bonn says that despite its difficult situation, Russia remains an important economic partner for Germany. Business with the East continues to be important, especially for the new laender, which exported 53 percent of their output to Russia in 1993. Total German exports to Russia amounted to 11.4 billion marks [DM], and imports from Russia amounted to DM10.7 billion. According to the ministry, last year's collapse in trade between Russia and Germany has not continued any further. Between 1990 and 1992, trade between the two countries fell by almost one-half. All in all, the Eastern Committee of German Industry considers the development of trade with East Europe and the post-Soviet republics as positive, despite all the difficulties. The increase in Russian import duties in 1994 will probably have a bearing on exports of microelectronic components, electric home entertainment equipment, and cars. It is not yet known to what extent general trade will be affected. All the same, Russia has relaxed its tough import restrictions, a move that affects the traditionally most important sectors of Russian trade -- machine and equipment construction, says the Economics Ministry.
