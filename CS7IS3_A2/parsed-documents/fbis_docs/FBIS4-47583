K. Khludova and T. N. Grechenko; signed to press 26 Mar. 93] [Abstract] The effects of magnesium, cobalt, manganese, and barium salts on the electrical activity of large neurons from the central nervous system of the common snail were studied. A total of 147 neurons was studied; 47 of the neurons were completely isolated, and the remainder were studied while intact in the central nervous system. The neurons were immersed in normal saline and tested for membrane potential, action potential generation threshold and amplitude, and for the ability to become accustomed to repeated intracellular electrical stimulation. Glass microelectrodes filled with potassium citrate with resistances up to 50 ï¿½ohms were used to record the electrical characteristics. The same characteristics were studied after immersing the intact neurons for 5-10 minutes and the isolated neurons for 1-5 minutes in the same solution, but with the addition of cobalt, cadmium, and manganese chloride. When testing the effects of barium chloride, barium was completely substituted for calcium, and the neurons were immersed for 15-60 minutes. It was found that cobalt, cadmium and manganese ions block the permeability of the neural membranes to calcium and reduce their electrical excitability. Barium ions compete with calcium ions, increase excitability, reduce the action potential generation threshold, and activate the pacemaker mechanism. All of the heavy metal ions used in the study alter the electrical activity of only those neurons, the action potential of which is associated with permeability to calcium. They do not affect activity associated with sodium-dependent processes. The presence of barium ions blocks simple accustomization and facilitated transport processes.
