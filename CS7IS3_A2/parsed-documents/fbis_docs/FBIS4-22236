[Gukasov] If Russia had not proclaimed itself the legal heir of the USSR, would relations with the Baltic countries be so strained? [Laar] They undoubtedly would have taken on a completely different tonality, without the bass notes, in any case. The difficulty of today's situation consists in that Russia is actually not the legal heir to the USSR, whose legacy includes the numerous crimes of the previous regime, but is the heir mainly when it is advantageous to it, the great empire with all the claims to a mighty past. It is no accident that recently Russian politicians have been speaking more and more openly at the highest levels about restoration of the empire, masking this objective with the idea of protection of the Russian-speaking population in the countries of the former USSR. It is precisely on this soil that there are frequent disagreements between Estonian and Russian diplomats. [Gukasov] Why did the collapse of other empires--the British, the French--take place in a much more civilized way? In any case, the colonists were decent people and were in a condition to determine their own fate for themselves. [Laar] I would like to believe that, but my specialty is history, and therefore I can say that the disintegration of any empire has always been bloody. Our peculiarity lies in the fact that Bolshevism made everyone equally poor. [Gukasov] Estonian politicians love to use Finland as an example. But after World War II, Presidents Paasikivi and Kekkonen did everything possible to maintain normal relations mainly with their great neighbor to the east. It was because of this that Finland achieved economic prosperity and well-being. [Laar] Undoubtedly, the postwar Finnish leaders were able to draw the country away from the well-known Czechoslovak scenario and derive economic advantage for all of their people. It is useful for us Estonians to study the history of relations between Finland and its great eastern neighbor because we are very similar in terms of national character. But we must see that there are many difficulties in this country's economy and, incidentally, precisely because of its former orientation toward the USSR. Orientation toward Russia alone is very dangerous, especially for small countries. We cannot tie our destiny to such a large ship, on which anything could happen. All it has to do is list, and we will sink to the bottom. [Gukasov] Is it possible to consider nationalism a struggle for privileges for a particular group of people? [Laar] We in Estonia have no privileged nationality, because we are creating a rule-of-law state, where social relations are built on the basis of citizenship. And this--I want to emphasize--is in no way linked to nationality. I was surprised by the statement from Andrey Kozyrev to the effect that the Baltic states give citizenship according to nationality. I do not know about anyone else, but the Russian foreign affairs minister is quite well informed particularly about the Estonian law on citizenship. And I do not know what kind of country Estonia would be if all the leading posts were by directive filled only by Estonians. [Gukasov] Your attitude toward the Representative Assembly (PA) of the Russian-speaking population of Estonia. [Laar] Favorable. Recently the PA has been playing a useful role in Estonian society. A positive change has been made in the Russian society of Estonia. We are no longer arguing about whether they have to learn the Estonian language or not. We are speaking about how to do this better. [Gukasov] On 31 August 1994, the Russian Army will leave Estonia. Will that put an end to all the problems? [Laar] I hope that this event will take place at the scheduled time. We demand the withdrawal of the troops at all forums because this "sticking point" in the Baltic region is only to Russia's disadvantage. That same Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is constantly irritated: How is it that such little children create such big problems? Many Western diplomats have told me that whenever they want to break off a conversation with their Russian colleagues, all they have to do is mention Estonia or Latvia. The Russian diplomats immediately fall silent and leave without concealing their irritation. Long ago we prepared entire files of documents that would put things in motion immediately after the troop withdrawal. A year ago I sent Mr. Chernomyrdin a draft agreement concerning transit. And there was no answer. There is no logic in this. If the military problem is solved, the other spheres will approach the norm one after another.
