This is a topic that greatly fascinates the people. This record of the interview certainly can help the people ponder the issue deeply. [Question] Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, our party's second-generation leading collective, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, has explored diligently the road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and has formed a set of new theories. What is the relationship between this set of new theories and those established by the first-generation leading collective, which was represented by Comrade Mao Zedong? Please tell us something about this from your research and experience. [Gong Yuzhi] In the course of compiling the book The CPC's 70 Years, Comrade Hu Sheng has held discussions with us, and these discussions have led to the proposal of an idea, which is that concerning the division of the historical periods of the party, the historic status of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee should receive greater emphasis. That is to say, if we stand higher and look further ahead, we may consider dividing the party's history into three major periods, and the textbook on party history into three major chapters. The first chapter is about democratic revolution, and explains how the party led the people to begin the grand and vigorous revolutionary struggle -- which experienced two major twists, but had a relatively smooth development following the Zunyi meeting -- and eventually ended with a great victory, which was the founding of the PRC. The second chapter is the opening chapter on socialism, and discusses how the party led the people after the nation's founding to embark upon the road of socialism, to make important achievements in socialist construction, and to go through two major twists in the middle. It ends with another victory: The crushing of the "gang of four" and halting of the Great Cultural Revolution. The third chapter is the new chapter on socialism, which began from the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. It is still difficult to say when it will end. At present, I feel that we may further consider using the viewpoint of "the second revolution" to observe the historic status of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. Comrade Xiaoping said many times: "The reform is China's second revolution." It was in 1985 that he directly raised this proposition, but judged from his way of thinking, we may trace it back to an even earlier time. Comrade Xiaoping's speech -- "Emancipate the Mind, Seek Truth From Facts, and Unite to Look Forward" -- was, in fact, a report on the main theme of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. It said: "Realizing the four modernizations is a profound and great revolution." On the eve of the plenary session, he addressed the ninth meeting of trade union representatives, saying: "This is a great revolution to completely change the economically and technologically backward situation of our country, and to further consolidate proletarian dictatorship. Since this revolution has to change greatly the currently backward productive forces, it naturally must change in many ways the production relations, the superstructure, the management style in industrial and agricultural enterprises, and the manner in which the state manages them, so as to make them adapt to the needs of a large modernized economy." Here we can see that both before and after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, Comrade Xiaoping and the Central Committee of our party already had raised the issues of the new revolution and of China's second revolution from the angle of uniting modernization with reform. The Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee was the starting point for China's second revolution. Thus, we can stand on a higher and borader plain to sum up the 71-year history of our party: Two generations of mature central leading collectives led two great revolutions and achieved two historic leaps in integrating Marxism with China's practice. The mature first-generation central leading collective, with Mao Zedong as the core, led us to overthrow the three big mountains, found the PRC, establish the basic system of socialism, and accomplish the first revolution of China. In the process, it accomplished the first historic leap in integrating Marxism with China's practice. The theoretical achievement in this leap was Mao Zedong Thought. The mature second-generation central leading collective, with Deng Xiaoping as the core, led us to begin the second revolution of China, that is, to carry out profound reform for the achievement of modernization, and in the process, it has begun to realize the second historic leap in integrating Marxism with China's practice. The theoretical achievement in this leap is Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The assessment given by the report to the 13th party congress is: Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, our party has proposed a series of scientific theoretical viewpoints "that constitute an outline of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics." The assessment that the "outline" has been constituted carries a lot of weight and a sense of propriety. Comrade Xiaoping's southern tour speech has further used a new viewpoint for a new elaboration so as to upgrade the theory to a new level. [Question] There are two generations of leaders, two revolutions, two leaps, and two theoretical achievements. Do they illustrate the relationship between Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, judged from the main process of CPC history? [Gong] It is necessary to further analyze the relationship between the theories and practices of the second-generation central leading collective with Deng Xiaoping as the core, on the one hand, and the theories and practice of the first-generation central leading collective with Mao Zedong as the core, on the other. What is the relationship? I want to stress three conditions, which are correction, inheritance, and development. It will not work if we discuss only one condition, nor will it work if we discuss just two conditions; we have to talk about all three. The first condition is correction, which means correction of the theoretical and practical mistakes Mao Zedong made in his later years. [Question] You have published your work entitled "Under the Banner of Socialism With Chinese Characteristics," in which you first talked about inheritance when talking about this relationship. [Gong] That is also a way to write things. The purpose of this method is to stress the continuity and the inherited nature of the undertakings led by our party. Speaking from the actual process of historical turning points, the first thing is certainly correction of the mistakes made by Mao Zedong in his later years because there is a basic historical fact here: The 10 years of internal turmoil during the Cultural Revolution severely harmed the people in our country, and brought the party and the country to a difficult and dangerous situation. Escaping the mistake of the Cultural Revolution is the precondition for entering the new period. The crushing of the "gang of four" began a turning point in history. In the first two years, however, the process of this historical turning point met with some difficulties. The crucial problem at that time was whether we had the courage, resolution, and ability to face directly the mistakes made by Mao Zedong in his later years, and to handle properly the issue of upholding the scientific system of Mao Zedong Thought on the one hand, while one the other hand, correcting the mistakes he made during his later years. Why was there "two whateverism" and "hesitant progress?" In the final analysis, it was because the central leaders did not have the political and theoretical courage to solve the problem, and they lacked the resolution and ability to steer the helm of history so as to change direction. To the central leaders at that time, if these major mistakes were pointed out and corrected, Mao Zedong's banner would be lost, and knife would be lost. That is to say, they set up a simplistic opposition between correcting the mistakes and hoisting the banner -- in order to hoist the banner one cannot correct the mistakes; to correct the mistakes would mean losing the banner. Under these conditions, Comrade Xiaoping showed his courage, resolution, and ability as a proletarian revolutionary. Comrade Xiaoping dared to point out clearly the mistakes made by Mao Zedong in his later years, and to correct them resolutely. He also stressed that only by correcting these mistakes can we truly raise the banner of the scientific system of Mao Zedong Thought. Of course, when we talk about the mistakes, we have to look at the situation insofar as to when and to what extent we should discuss them. When Deng began, he said Mao Zedong Thought was a scientific system and that quoting fragmentary sayings out of context could in no way represent this system of thought. Later, he said that the theory and practice of the Cultural Revolution were basically wrong, and when he said this, it was not simply a problem of quotations. Here we see a process of understanding, as well as the art of guidance. Mao Zedong made great historical contributions to the party, to China's revolution, and to the founding and development of the PRC. His great creation was the integration of Marxism with China's practice; his problem was that he started the Cultural Revolution in his later years, and deviated from the correct line of integrating Marxism with China's practice, a line which he had established himself. Therefore, the new period must begin with correcting the Cultural Revolution mistake, and with "sorting out the chaos." Comrade Xiaoping's definition of "sorting out the chaos and bringing things back onto right track" was "correcting the chaos caused by the destructive Lin Biao and the `gang of four,' criticizing the mistakes made by Comrade Mao Zedong in his later years, and returning to the correct track of Mao Zedong Thought." The second condition is inheritance. "Bringing things back onto the right track" is inheritance. To sort out chaos and correct mistakes is not to completely overthrow the past, for we never can deny the things that have been proved correct through practice. Shortly after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, Comrade Xiaoping proposed the four cardinal principles our party must uphold, the fourth of which is "upholding Marxism- Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought." Mao Zedong Thought -- which has been proven as a scientific principle through the practice of revolution in China, and which includes all the positive fruit of Mao Zedong's thinking when he pondered China's own way of building socialism -- must be inherited and developed today. Without this relationship of inheritance, history is negated and severed, and we will lose our basic foothold and the direction in which we advance. [Question] We have read some materials stating that at the time there was a trend of thought on completely negating Mao Zedong, but Comrade Huang Kecheng came out to make a speech and publish an article. Comrade Xiaoping presided over the work of drafting the "Decision on Several Historical Problems of the Party Since the Founding of the Nation," and he demanded an overall assessment of Mao Zedong, and a special chapter on "the historic status of Comrade Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought" within the historic decision. Was the trend of thought on negating Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought that serious at the time? [Gong] It has to be divided into several levels and domains. One kind was the comments from overseas, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and society, and these comments were very strong, that is, they completely negated Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought. To this extent, they completely negated the CPC. The other kind was certain comments within the party, and even though some of these comments were rather extreme and some were rather erroneous, they were different in nature from the first kind. However, it is not advisable to look at historical questions with an agitated and absolutist attitude and without an analytical attitude. In the course of presiding over the work to draft the historic decision, Comrade Xiaoping spoke frequently, criticizing and refuting certain viewpoints; he was getting at something. In addition, some people specializing in theoretical work suggested that the concept of Mao Zedong Thought should no longer be used; they said that if Mao Zedong's name is used to name a certain system of thought, then Mao Zedong's "leftist" mistakes should be included as well. They held that it would be unjustifiable to include only the correct things while excluding the incorrect things. I disagree with this viewpoint. I think that since our party has used the concept of Mao Zedong Thought for so many years, if the concept were to be written off at a single stoke, this would not be beneficial politically, nor would it conform to history, and not conforming to history is not conforming to a scientific attitude. The fact of history is: The integration of Marxism with the practice of revolution in China has resulted in a scientific theoretical achievement. Can we deny this fact? As for how this theoretical achievement should be named, this is a secondary problem. Since in the past we have used Mao Zedong Thought to refer to this theoretical achievement, and Mao Zedong has indeed made the greatest contribution to the creation of this theoretical achievement, we have no need or reason now to cancel the term. What we should do now is to use practice to examine many of the viewpoints that were raised in the past, to see which have been proven correct through practice and which viewpoints practice has proved erroneous. In addition, we should use the name Mao Zedong Thought to refer to the scientific theoretical achievement of the central leading collective represented mainly by Mao Zedong, and should distinguish it from the mistakes made by Mao Zedong during his later years. The mistakes made by Mao Zedong during his later years must be negated, but Mao Zedong's great historical merits and the scientific theoretical achievement of Mao Zedong Thought never can be negated. We must adopt a scientific and analytical attitude when dealing with the history of the party and of the people's revolution. We must not write off everything at one stoke, nor must we completely negate its basic achievement when we have to correct mistakes arising from the historical process. Of course, neither can we lack the boldness and resolution to correct these mistakes while safeguarding the basic achievement. We must see clearly the following fact: Mao Zedong is closely linked to the history of the CPC and of the Chinese people's revolution. Completely negating Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought means completely negating the history of the CPC and of the Chinese people's revolution. In 1983, when the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping (1975-83) were published, I wrote an article for RENMIN RIBAO entitled "An Important Document of China's Marxism," in which I wrote: "Concerning the problem of how to deal with the mistakes made by Comrade Mao Zedong during his later years, as well as with Mao Zedong Thought, our party's political courage and leading ability have undergone the sternest test." Under conditions of the Mao Zedong cult reaching its zenith through the Cultural Revolution -- and that at that time the central leaders were still adhering to the two "whatevers," -- Comrade Xiaoping courageously came out and said: The two "whatevers" were not in accordance with Marxism; Mao Zedong made mistakes during his later years and those mistakes were serious. This demonstrated the great political courage of a Marxist. In the course of correcting this kind of mistake, there emerged a trend of thought that doubted and negated the historical status of Mao Zedong, as well as Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Xiaoping came out again to "prevail over all dissenting views," demanding that the party explicitly affirm the most basic achievement of China's revolution, safeguard Mao Zedong's historical status, and uphold and develop Mao Zedong Thought. The political courage in these two areas surfaced in an environment in which a great historical turning point was taking place. The political courage of Comrade Xiaoping in these two areas enabled our party to pass this great historical turning point in a relatively smooth, steady, and healthy manner. Without the first condition, there would have been no historical turning point, and we might still be dragging our feet along the original road. Without the second condition, the turning point might not have been good and might have caused chaos, and those things that completely deviated from the revolutionary track would have run rampant. These two areas faced a relatively strong kind of trend in which steering the helm of history required great political and theoretical courage, as well as the resolution and boldness of a revolutionary. [Question] This is the charisma of a great man, for no ordinary man could have done it. [Gong] Also he has to give reasons: Charisma, plus authoritativeness, plus reasons; and reasons mean theory. Comrade Xiaoping was situated in an influential position. In addition, he had such resolution and charisma, and he also gave reasons, which he discussed with the whole party, so as to concentrate the wisdom of the whole party. He not only broke the taboo of the two "whatevers" and corrected the mistakes made by Mao Zedong in his later years, but also gave a scientific explanation of Mao Zedong Thought, made a scientific judgment of the right and wrong things in history, and gave a scientific plan for the road to be followed in the future. That was the historical background against which the Sixth Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee made the "Decision on Several Historical Problems of the Party Since the Founding of the Nation." Why did a historic decision have to be made at that time? Because there was a need for a conclusion on the right and wrong things in the history of the Cultural Revolution. It was not an easy thing to judge and determine that the Cultural Revolution was basically a mistake, and to foster such a consensus within the party. The two "whatevers," first and mainly, involved three things: First, the Tiananmen incident; second, the "campaign to criticize Deng and strike back at the right-deviationist trend of overthrowing verdicts"; and third, the Cultural Revolution. These three things could not be shaken because they were decided by Chairman Mao. The Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee criticized the two "whatevers" and settled the first two things, but the third -- whether the Cultural Revolution was right or wrong -- was left unsolved. Later, the "historic decision" solved the third thing, clearly pointing out the basic mistake in the practice and theory of the Cultural Revolution, and analyzing the cause and development of the "leftist" mistake in the Cultural Revolution. Thus, the basic problems could be regarded as having been solved, and the problems that remained unsolved were less important ones, such as the criticism of the movie "The Biography of Wu Xun," which could be settled through other means and methods. Therefore, the "historic decision" was first, to "sort out the chaos," which was to clearly determine and completely correct the mistakes in Cultural Revolution; second, to "bring things back onto the right track," which meant, while correcting the mistakes, to affirm the most basic practical and theoretical achievements in China's revolution and socialist development, to affirm the historical status of Mao Zedong, and to affirm the scientific principle of Mao Zedong Thought. After adopting the "historic decision," the CPC Central Committee announced: The party's duty -- to sort out chaos and bring things back onto the right track in the area of guiding thought -- basically had been accomplished. [Question] Judging from the development of the party's undertakings in the new period, it seems that these two conditions alone are not sufficient. [Gong] These two conditions alone -- sorting out chaos and bringing things back onto the right track -- still remained within Mao Zedong's theoretical and practical domain, and were nothing more than correcting the incorrect things through practice and examination, and upholding the correct things. New innovations have to be made in the new period. Among correction, inheritance, and development, the combination of the first two means sorting out chaos and bringing things back onto the right track, and the combination of the last two means inheriting from the past and opening up a new situation. Overall reform means opening up a new situation, exploration, innovation, and development. The new period has met with many new problems. So-called new problems mean new conditions which we did not come cross in the time of Mao Zedong, as well as many problems arising from new needs, or problems we encountered in the time of Mao Zedong but we did not solve properly. From domestic to foreign policies, the reform and opening up have met with many new problems, which require innovative solutions from us. Regarding the problems of exploration and innovation, these cannot be solved simply by distinguishing the right things from the wrong things in Mao Zedong's theoretical and practical domains. To correctly understand the new problems arising from the new situation and to solve them innovatively, it is necessary to enable Mao Zedong Thought to have a new development. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, our party has indeed had a new development in the area of theory. It is very important to honestly understand and admit this point. It is a correction of the mistakes made by Mao Zedong in his later years on the one hand, and on the other, an inheritance from the scientific system of Mao Zedong Thought. At the same time, it is a new development in solving the new problems of the new period in which we face a new situation. [Question] That means a new theoretical framework has been formed. [Gong] Perhaps we may say that it has begun to take shape. As to the concept and language that should be used to sum it up, that is a decision for the central leadership. The 13th party congress used the wording "the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics." Since Comrade Xiaoping made his southern tour speech, I have noticed that some central documents have used the wording "the theory and line of building socialism with Chinese characteristics advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping," and the wording "Comrade Deng Xiaoping's idea of building socialism with Chinese characteristics." All these have further emphasized Comrade Xiaoping's status in establishing the theory, as well as the main content of "building socialism with Chinese characteristics." Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the inheritance and development of Mao Zedong Thought under new historical conditions. Why must we use a single concept to sum it up? Precisely because it has not simply added several trifles on the foundation of the theoretical achievement already secured by Comrade Mao Zedong, but has made a relatively great advance, and has involved a series of searches, new explorations, and new creations beginning to form a set of new theories, and so there has to be a new summation. I feel that on the one hand, there indeed has to be a new summation because a new theory has begun to take shape. On the other, just as proposing Mao Zedong Thought as a new concept at the seventh party congress did not mean abandoning Marxism-Leninism, advocating Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics at this time does not mean abandoning Mao Zedong Thought. From Mao Zedong's theory and practice, the root of and the preparation for the new theory can be found, and there is a linking spirit, which illustrates the relationship between Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and Mao Zedong Thought: Inheritance and development. [Question] You have just mentioned the linking spirit. Does this mean that between Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping there exist some common features? [Gong] I think it would be very meaningful to carry out a comparative study of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. For example, their greatest point in common is that they stressed "seeking truth from facts." When Comrade Xiaoping talked about Mao Zedong Thought, what he talked most was seeking truth from facts. He thought that this was the quintessence of Mao Zedong Thought. He said himself: I am one in the clique that seeks truth from facts. In his southern tour speech he stressed again: "Seeking truth from facts is the quintessence of Marxism. This must be advocated in stead of book worship. We do not rely on book worship to make our reform and opening up a success; we rely on practice and seeking truth from facts." I adhere to "one rule, which is that I believe Mao Zedong's words on seeking truth from facts." Some people are not comfortable with this advocacy; they think that there are several volumes of the works of Mao Zedong on a great variety of topics -- such as political theory, military theory, and cultural thoughts -- so how can we mention just the four characters "seeking truth from facts?" In fact, the ultimate reason why Mao Zedong Thought could have so many creations that suited China's conditions in the political, military, and cultural areas was because he could seek truth from facts and integrate Marxism with China's practice, and not just copy from books or foreign experience. When Comrade Xiaoping stressed that seeking truth from facts was the quintessence of Mao Zedong Thought and of Marxism, he wanted us to understand correctly and grasp the position, viewpoint, and method of Mao Zedong Thought, and to create new theories for ourselves in response to the new situation. The root of our socialist ideology is certainly the scientific socialism of Marx. They derived many concrete conclusions in those years, but from then to now, some 100 years have elapsed, and the situation has changed tremendously. Just as Comrade Xiaoping has said, we cannot ask Marx to provide concrete conclusions for us to solve the problems arising 100 or 1,000 years after his death. By the same token, Lenin cannot take responsibility for things that happen 50 or 100 years after his passing. The real Marxist- Leninists must inherit and develop Marxism-Leninism according to their understanding of the current situation. This remark was contained in his May 1989 speech. If the descendants confine themselves to the framework of concrete conclusions given by their predecessors, they will bind their own minds, feet, and hands. When Mao Zedong criticized dogmatism in the past, he said that we should not copy concrete conclusions, but grasp the basic position, viewpoint, and method, and use them to face China's reality and solve new problems. We also must study and learn from the scientific results of our predecessors, for we cannot do without knowledge. In the final analysis, however, we must apply those results to today's objective reality, raise new questions, and solve new problems. Therefore the ideological line of seeking truth from facts remains the most important thing. Regarding the concrete conclusions on socialism, one is the model provided by the Soviet Union, the other is the idea Mao Zedong had in his later years. Comrade Xiaoping did not copy from these, but grasped the spirit of seeking truth from facts, and brought all the past concrete conclusions on socialism, for examination according to the practice and development of today. By so doing he could make innovations, and have the great political and theoretical courage to break through the ideological trammels so as to open up a new situation of socialist reform, opening up, and modernization in China. For example, Deng Xiaoping and Mao Zedong, as strategists, have a very big point in common: In China's democratic revolution, one of the very important rules of Mao Zedong's strategic thinking was to go to the rural areas to establish revolutionary bases, and follow the road of surrounding cities, village by village. It was Mao Zedong who used and developed Marxism in an innovative way, found a breakthrough point in the rural areas where the rule of China's reactionary forces was weaker, and opened up the road on which China's proletariat and peasants united as allies so as to increase their strength. This was the revolutionary road with Chinese characteristics. The problem of rural areas and peasants has always occupied a central position in China's revolution. Today, Comrade Xiaoping is leading China to reform, and in his strategic thinking too, rural areas and peasants have always occupied a very important position in China's reform. Therefore, since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, China's reform has started from the rural areas, and has scored results. In my opinion, in China's revolutionary strategy and reform strategy, if the point of rural areas and peasants is grasped, China's characteristics are grasped. Those who do not understand China's conditions cannot understand this basic strategic point. Both Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping thoroughly understood China's conditions and Chinese history, and both of them have flesh-and-blood connections to rural areas, where the majority of the Chinese population is to be found, so they knew the status of peasants in China, and they knew how to grasp this basic point when solving China's problems. China's unbalanced revolutionary development is a problem we may cite as another example. Mao Zedong once expounded on this issue profoundly when he criticized "left-deviationist" dogmatism. He criticized the "left-deviationists" as having an acute revolutionary disease, meaning that they were anxious to realize a nationwide revolutionary peak, and they failed to see that in a big country such as China, the development of the revolution will be unbalanced in different periods and in different places, and this kind of imbalance originates from China's unbalanced political and economic development. Now we are carrying out reform, opening up, and modernization construction, and Comrade Xiaoping also has raised the issue of the unbalanced development of construction in China. It also includes two areas: First, the imbalance of development in different periods; for example, the imbalance of economic growth rates in different years belongs to this area. Second, the imbalance of different regions; for example, allowing some regions, enterprises, and people to become rich first, and the gradual advancement of opening up from the coastal regions to the interior, belong to this area. Speaking from strategic thinking, this is to grasp the unbalanced development of China, including political, economic, educational, cultural, and geographical imbalances, and proceeding from this basic point, to seek the most effective development method on the foundation of the unbalanced development, to stimulate development through the unbalanced development, and to realize comparatively balanced development in the future. To conclude, it is very meaningful to carry out a comparative study of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. Here we see common things, things that are linked, and things that are inherited from and surpass the predecessors. When descendants inherit things left behind by predecessors, and when they sum up the experiences and lessons of their predecessors, they should be able to see more clearly and walk more vigorously than their predecessors.
