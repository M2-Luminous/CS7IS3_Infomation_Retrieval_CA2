The meeting lasted longer than planned, and General Rabin was therefore somewhat late at the General Staff Academy, where he gave a lecture on the Israeli "science of victory." The Israeli Army has long been a subject of interest to some Russian military leaders as a possible model for organizing future Russian armed forces. Especially the process of raising extremely combat-efficient troops with conscripts and reservists, the organization of a really universal military conscription system, and other features that set the Israeli Army apart from the U.S. Army, which for several years has been proffered to our military as the key model to emulate. But even more than military cooperation with the Israeli Army, Russia is interested in the Arab arms market. Gen. Grachev admitted the similarity of the two countries' military doctrines and accepted in principle an invitation to go to Israel on an official visit, although its date has not been fixed: "The question will be considered at expert level." Since last summer an Israeli military attache -- Colonel Mikha'el Shtiglits (before 1972, a USSR citizen) -- has been working in Moscow. At the same time the Russian Federation Defense Ministry is only planning to open its attache office in Tel Aviv. Gen. Grachev announced that "only after the attaches have elaborated on the problem will it be possible to talk about the prospects for military cooperation." As a result, these talks between Generals Rabin and Grachev were devoted mainly to discussing the general political situation in the Middle East. A high-ranking participant in the negotiations on the Russian side told me that "matters of military and technical cooperation have not been discussed."
