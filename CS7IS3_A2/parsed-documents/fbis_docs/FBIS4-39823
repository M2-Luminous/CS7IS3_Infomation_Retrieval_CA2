"The Interparliamentary Assembly Council adopted this decision affecting the future of more than 700,000 people with practically no discussion," Vladimir Shumeyko said in an exclusive interview for an ITAR-TASS correspondent. He emphasized that, unfortunately, questions of state social assistance and legal protection for veterans of wars and military operations in various countries are being resolved with difficulty in the CIS, and advocated improving the system to implement interstate legal acts on assistance to veterans adopted within the framework of the CIS, including the monitoring of their execution by the sovereign states' supreme legislative organs. Shumeyko expressed the hope that the programs for material and everyday and medical provision for war veterans agreed by the CIS countries will be backed by budgetary finances.
