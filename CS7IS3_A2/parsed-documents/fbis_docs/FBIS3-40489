In order for our country to get people to understand and go along with further development of safe nuclear energy, it is highly essential to obtain the public's trust in advanced technical establishment of radioactive waste underground disposal treatment. The basic points to view are: 1) investigation of the geological surrounding conditions, 2) disposal techniques, and 3) performance evaluation. A confirmation of the updated results of these three important research issues and in addition, emphasis on the necessity of future technical progress is being made. The general contents of the investigation are being reported in series. The goal of our country's underground disposal research and development has been to concretely demonstrate the possibility of long term safety of the underground disposal for high level radioactive waste. At present, no specifications are being made on the type of rocks or designated areas but a wide range of geological surrounding conditions have been assumed. The disposal techniques that will cope with these environments are being studied and developed together, and generalized analysis and evaluation on the capability of the treatment system which has been based on the concept of the multiple barrier system has been in progress. For this reason, under the ``Important Subjects and Ways To Proceed,'' the important listings for research and developments have been decided on the three areas of: 1) survey study of geological surrounding conditions, 2) research and development of disposal techniques, and 3) the study of performance evaluation. The idea has been followed also in the ``Technical Report'' and the results of each study area have been organized respectively. The following articles report on the validity and progress made by the various studies together with the overall evaluation of its justification. Systematic, Comprehensive, Organized and Useful Survey Study of Geological Surrounding Conditions. In the study of the geological surrounding conditions, the first objective is to look into what is considered one of the most important items in relation to the disposal system. That would mean a survey of a wide range area of our country's surface to the deep underground and extract its characteristics concerning the geological environment. The systematization should be measured and the data should be applied to the study on performance evaluation. Secondly, in preparing for the future, when the time comes to evaluate a specific underground site in detail for its geological environment, it would be necessary to be ready with the utmost accuracy and reliable data that has been inspected and accumulated efficiently. In addition, the goal is to have necessary technical developments available for analyzing and evaluating the accumulated data so it can be put into practical use. From the ``Technical Report,'' extraction was made from the accumulated report and data in the area of earth science, and reports that would be useful in the future concerning geological environments viewed from waste disposal interests were systemized and consolidated. At the same time, a survey of the development of techniques and tools so that precise geological environmental data can be collected is being pursued. Furthermore, on deep geological environmental data, the necessary reports for performance evaluation is being prepared but since the actual data is limited to a portion, it has been learned that collection of more data would be necessary. At the present, the data concerned with geological environment of underground waste disposal, as far as collection is possible has been prepared systematically and comprehensively for a large area for the first time in our country. The data will be the basis for showing our country's characteristic geological surroundings and together it can be evaluated as useful for extracting subjects for survey studies in the future. Selection of Applicable Material for Artificial Barrier Research and Development of Waste Disposal Techniques. The research and development of waste disposal techniques have to be a method where long term safety can be guaranteed. In order to clearly make this concrete, the essential techniques are dependent on the individual artificial barriers and based on it, the goal for disposal techniques related to site design, construction and operation must be of utmost trustworthy one. In the ``Technical Report,'' the applicability of different types of material for structuring the artificial barrier have been compared and organized, and as a result, selections of example materials are displayed. Furthermore, a groundwork investigation of the technical feasibility of the design and execution of the disposal installation is being made together with a display of an example of a technically feasible system. The outlook has been that for the technical aspects necessary in building the artificial barrier, basically, existing technology will be applied for the design and the operation of the disposal installation. In addition, the topics for reliability improvements on individual essential techniques are shown and recommendations for future research and development are suggested. The above shows clearly the topics necessary for research and development. It emphasizes attaining utmost technical reliability and establishing concrete directions for technical development in design, construction and execution for artificial barrier and for the disposal site. Safety Security by Multiple Barrier System Performance Evaluation Studies. The study of performance evaluation first must begin with the possibility of high level radioactive waste directly affecting humans in the event of natural phenomena such as earthquakes and from other human causes and various activities. Research and survey must be made on the possibility of such occurrence and the magnitude of its effect. In addition, an awareness of the notion that deep stratum underground disposal for high level radioactive waste is the appropriately stable burying ground needs to be clarified. Secondly, in the event that radioactive products from high level radioactive wastes elute into underground water, the possible effects on humans and the eluted quantity need to be evaluated. The goal is to use the basis of these results and evaluate a technically feasible multiple barrier system. The possibilities of high level radioactive waste affecting humans directly caused by natural phenomena such as volcanic activities, upheavals and erosions have shown to be area dependent. Therefore, it is important to evaluate, concretely each individual area separately. However, according to the ``Technical Report,'' our country's geological environment conditions have been already widely surveyed and studied without specifying designated areas. It has been shown according to such summarized investigation that the concept of using deep underground for waste disposal burial location as being stable has been valid in our country. At the same time, it has been pointed out the importance that in the event an area is designated, there is a need to develop technical skills and methods to evaluate the phenomena that may be characteristic for the area. Next, on the technical feasibility of multiple artificial barrier systems, in the case of our country, the existence of the possibility of movement of radioactive products via underground water is an important consideration. Therefore, from this point of view, the geological surrounding conditions are being widely assumed and the underground water quality, its flow characteristics, the long term health of artificial barriers, and the control of the shifted radioactive products that have eluted through the artificial barriers etc. are being systematically constructed into a basic model so that the total multiple barrier system can be analyzed. By using this, the multiple barrier system's performance is being illustrated. As a result, when artificial barrier and disposal site can be matched with its geological surrounding conditions and when design and construction work are followed accordingly it has been shown that the performance of the multiple barriers can be maintained for a long term with safety assured. At the same time, in the event that appropriate design and construction work take place, the importance of accurate evaluation of the artificial barriers and its relative neighboring geological surroundings has been pointed out. By this means, arguments concerning evaluation methods of multiple barrier system performances have been made clear and the basic model necessary for analysis is understood to have been built. Further, in the future, in order that a reliable analysis be performed, important influential elements have been pointed out, and also the direction to be taken for future performance evaluation study is being made clear. In addition, important knowledge of concrete techniques for safety security based on the multiple barrier system concept has been acquired and it can be assessed that the technical foundation for planning safety security for underground disposal treatment is being made very clear. A Clear Statement of Concrete Know-How That is Generally Reasonable Summary of Evaluation. In the future, by performing further required research development and survey as needed, the geological environment can be grasped exquisitely and together, technical improvements and detailed analysis can be planned and it will be more and more necessary to attain high grade evaluation with confidence. The ``Technical Report'' states: 1) for the techniques necessary for designing and performing construction work for the artificial barriers and waste disposal installations, basically, existing technology can be applied, 2) concerning the performance of the multiple barrier systems, a comprehensive analytical method has been completed that has been centered around the performance evaluation of the new field (the area including artificial barrier and its neighboring underground), and 3) by taking into consideration the width of fluctuation, the results of analysis made on the assumed geological environmental conditions shown in examples indicate that if the artificial barrier and waste disposal installation are matched with the geological surroundings and the design and construction work is appropriate, the performance of a multiple barrier system can be maintained for a long duration. It clearly shows the safe and secure attainment in planning for an underground disposal treatment in our country as being technically possible. Assessing the above, in summary, the underground waste disposal research and development contained in the ``Technical Report'' has followed appropriately the article ``Important Subjects and Ways to Proceed'' and has faithfully proceeded accordingly. Also, pertaining to the information on safety and security of underground waste disposal, the knowledge of the validity of multiple barrier system has been obtained. Together, when considering that concretely, technical methods are becoming distinct, and therefore, at the present stage, it can be concluded that, in general, the entire technology appears reasonable.
