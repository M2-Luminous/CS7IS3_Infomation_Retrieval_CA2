FR940930-0-00030 FR940930-0-00006 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Bureau of Export Administration 15 CFR Parts 778 and 799 [Docket No. 940975&hyph;4275] Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR); Revisions to the CCL AGENCY: Bureau of Export Administration, Commerce. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) is amending the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by revising certain entries of the Commerce Control List (CCL) to conform with changes to the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) Equipment and Technology Annex. The MTCR is a multilateral forum; participating countries agree to control items contained on the Annex in order to limit proliferation of missiles capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction. Most of these revisions are based on technical consultations with MCTR countries held in September 1993, in London, and in December 1993, in Interlaken. Additionally, this rule makes other corrections and clarifications needed to make the CCL conform to the Annex. The revisions to the CCL made by this rule help to ensure that the items controlled by the United States in meeting its MTCR obligations are similar to those controlled by other MTCR participating countries. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule is effective September 30, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background This rule amends Part 778 to clarify missile technology licensing policy. Many of the changes to the Commerce Control List (CCL) made by this rule, directly reflecting changes in the MTCR Annex, consist of technical refinements that more precisely identify items controlled for missile technology reasons. The technical refinements in Category 1 either change certain paragraphs or add clarifying notes. In other cases, the CCL has been brought into line where it had diverged from the Annex. In Category 3, 3A01.a.1.a replaces 3A01.a.1, and resulting changes occur in 3D21 and 3E01. As telemetering and telecontrol equipment (5A20) are the only items in Category 5 on the Annex, the missile technology designation was removed from the ``Reason for Control'' paragraph of any other Category 5 entries. The GLV value limit for 5A20 is now $0. Since 7A27 now specifically controls airborne passive sensors, the GLV limit for that entry becomes $0. ``Specially designed components'' have been added to some entries to conform to the Annex. Finally, typographical errors in the definitions supplement have been corrected. Although the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA) expired on August 20, 1994, the President invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and determined that, to the extent permitted by law, the provisions of the EAA, as amended, shall be carried out under Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994, so as to continue in full force and effect and amend, as necessary, the export control system heretofore maintained by the Export Administration Regulations issued under the EAA.
