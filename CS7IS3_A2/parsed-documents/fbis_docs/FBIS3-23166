Report also mentions that AL-WASAT interviewed Jamal Najib Muhammad al-Nahdi, the main defendant in these explosions "in an Arab capital, during which he refused to be photographed" and after receiving assurances that "the interview will be published at least two weeks later to give him time to go to another place." The report says that al-Nahdi, age 22, was "one of the hundreds of Arabs who had joined an organization called al-Qa'idah [the base] to form a specialized and well-trained group of Arab mujahdin in Afghanistan in mid-1980. The report also says that al-Nahdi said he carried out three operations against the U.S. forces and boasted that he "confronted the YSP and challenged the United States." He admitted that he had fired "missiles on its forces at Aden airport, and detonated one of its positions in one of the city's hotels while the U.S. forces were on their way to Somalia late 1992." Later on, al-Nahdi says that he "is proud that he had foiled a U.S. scheme to use Aden as a rear base in its military operations in the region, Somalia, and elsewhere." He denies YSP officials' accusations of the "existence of an international Jihad organization and that he is one of the leaders of a major organization in Yemen." Elaborating on the first attack against the U.S. forces in Aden, al-Nahdi says: "We wanted to attack the YSP, but we hesitated because we feared there would be innocent people and Muslims among the losses. When the Americans came to Aden, we saw that this was a good opportunity. This was in November 1992. We learned from officials in the government that the YSP intended to permit the establishment of a U.S. base, specifically on Abyan coast." He later says "We videotaped everything, including the U.S. installations in the airport and the tape was later taken by intelligence head 'Adnan al-Bid, the son of 'Ali Salim al-Bid." Al-Nahdi affirms that "the idea of striking at the Americans in Aden was my idea. There was no organization behind us. Everything was planned and carried out in a period of not more than five days." After speaking about how he obtained weapons, al-Nahdi says that "the first operation was successful as the two missiles I and Wahib 'Abd-al-Salam fired hit their targets." According to al-Nahdi, the second operation was "to strike at the espionage headquarters the Americans had established in the Golden Coast Hotel." Al-Nahdi admits "he had placed a big bomb in the electricity room on the fourth floor below the U.S. espionage room. The explosion of the bomb was sufficient to destroy a major part of that floor as well as part of the fifth floor. The explosion killed a Yemeni hotel worker, an Austrian tourist, and others." Speaking about the third operation, al-Nahdi says "it was intended to scare as many U.S. soldiers as possible in the Aden Hotel yard." He added "We planted a time bomb that was set to explode at the time they always return to the hotel. But, God wished it otherwise. They were late to arrive that night" and that having noticed this, he ran "to defuse the bomb and change the time for it to go off. But, it exploded and I was wounded." He then says that he was arrested and taken to hospital.
