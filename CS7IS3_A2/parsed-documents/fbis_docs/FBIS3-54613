This is part of a giant arms and military equipment sale, worth tens of millions of dollars, by Israel Military Industries and other defense manufacturers. An agreement to this effect was recently been signed between private Israeli entrepreneurs and the Congo Government. In an appendix to the agreement, the Israeli company pledged to provide the Congolese Army with guidance and training. The "Congo deal" has recently been approved by the Defense Ministry's Defense Sales Department. At the same time, the deal also met some opposition due to the fact that Congolese loyal to the president have been fighting the supporters of the prime minister. It is important to note that the deal was made with Congo-Brazzaville in West Africa, and not with its neighbor Zaire, also known as Congo-Kinshasa. The company behind the deal is Lavdan, a subsidiary of the public corporation Qardan Investments [company names as published]. The names of the persons who are actually behind the deal are not yet known, but the man named in charge of executing the training project is Brigadier General Ze'ev Zakharin (Reserves), who is considered an expert in training foreign armies. Zakharin (45), served as the commander of the liaison unit to Lebanon and won praise for his work in training the South Lebanese Army. [passage omitted] Reacting to the report, the Lavdan company issued the following statement: "The deal mentioned includes the supply of equipment and guidance which the Israeli companies will provide to the African country. Beyond this activity, there is no network of persons or elements on behalf of our company in that country." The Defense Ministry spokesman reacted: "The Defense Ministry is not in the habit of addressing itself to publications concerning defense exports."
