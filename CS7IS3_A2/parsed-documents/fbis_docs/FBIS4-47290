N. Golubkin and V. V. Negoda; UDC 517.958:533.7] [Abstract] With application of the theory of a thin shock layer the article gives a formulation of the problem and a method for solution of the problem of optimization of wings with a short elongation in a hypersonic flow and at different angles of attack, the objective being ensuring a maximum aerodynamic quality. As a result of a parametric numerical study it was found that the optimum solution has two branches and the optimization process has a bifurcation character: with some wing span value there is a jumplike switch from one branch of the solution to another, accompanied by a fundamental change in the appearance of the optimized wing. The characteristic configurations of optimum wings are illustrated. An appreciable gain in hypersonic quality is obtained in a wide range of angles of attack. An algorithm is proposed for computing pressure in the inverse problem of streamline flow with a given form of jump. The pressure distributions on the surface of optimum wings are studied. Computations of aerodynamic forces are made by direct integration of pressure, making it possible to refine the maximum hypersonic quality value, which proved to be greater than that found by the authors earlier using an approximate formula. This article represents a continuation of earlier work along these same lines by the same authors (``Optimization of Spatial Configuration of Supporting Surfaces With Short Elongation at Hypersonic Velocities,'' ZH. VYCHISL. MATEM. I MATEM. FIZ., Vol. 31, No. 12, pp 1858-1870, 1991; ``Increasing Aerodynamic Quality of Wings With a Short Elongation at Hypersonic Velocities,'' PRIKL. MATEM. I MEKHAN., Vol. 56, No. 3, pp 392-403, 1992) and draws heavily on these materials. Figures 7; references: 9 Russian.
