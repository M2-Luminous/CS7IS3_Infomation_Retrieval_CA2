The Ramadan massacre, which was committed by a rancorous Zionist Jew at dawn last Friday, is one more piece of evidence to be added to hundreds of other pieces of evidence, which all prove that the persecution of the Jews was a big lie. This evidence exposes to the entire world the falsehood of the Zionist allegations that have been used to extort the West, which later adopted them to vent its wrath against the Arabs and Muslims. The political Israeli condemnation of the Ramadan massacre does not absolve the Israeli entity from direct responsibility for this massacre. What Rabin has said is not enough to deny his joy over seeing the Palestinian blood spilt over the floor of the Ibrahimi Mosque or to deny his happiness with that racist action by a Jew who was brought up according to a rancorous Torah ideology that views the Arab as the target at which all rifles must be aimed and the Muslim as a potential victim that must be chased until shot dead. There is no difference between Rabin, Sharon, Shamir, and the Zionist killer with his American and Jewish roots. There is no difference between the Palestinian being killed by regular soldiers or by settlers who carry all the instruments of death, except the military uniform. It is natural for the Zionist school to produce all those killers whose hands are stained with the blood of the Palestinian people and whose nails have torn our flesh, which has been scorched by their warplanes, tanks, and bombs. Besides, the world which happily watches massacres and is pleased to see peoples being torn apart by troubles and tragedies, cannot change from one massacre to another. It is hard, therefore, to believe that those who committed the massacre at the al-'Amiriyah shelter in Baghdad can be sincere in their sentiments toward the Ramadan massacre in Hebron. It is hard to expect them to be committed to ethics and values where the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre is concerned, while Muslims are being subjected to daily massacres, rape, death, hunger, and disease in Yugoslavia and behind the racist wall erected by the United States and its allies around the Iraqi people and their children's right to milk and their sick people's right to medicine. The Ramadan massacre by the Jews and their allies, the enemies of the Palestinian rights and people, the enemies of all Arabs and Muslims is not the exception, but the rule. Therefore, it will be difficult for us to believe the West's condemnation of the massacre unless it is coupled by real action which punishes the aggressor, works to establish a just peace, and puts an end to the Jewish allegations about their having been subjected to massacres and persecution.
