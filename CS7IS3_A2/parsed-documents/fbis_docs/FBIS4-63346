(ITAR-TASS) -- The Press and Information Department at the Russian Foreign Ministry today distributed the following report: "On 20 May Ukraine's Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko sent the Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev a letter informing him of the decision adopted by Crimea's Supreme Soviet to restore the constitution of the Republic of Crimea of 6 May 1992, which he believes could pose a threat to Ukraine's internal political stability and cause tension in relations between Russia and Ukraine. "The letter underlines that, in the event of a further escalation of the situation, Ukraine retains the right to take all necessary measures to safeguard unconditionally the state's territorial integrity, in accordance with its Constitution and law and in observance of the norms of international law. "In a reply message, Kozyrev says that the possibility of tension arising in Russian-Ukrainian relations because of Crimea cannot but cause concern and he agrees that international legal principles should be observed everywhere. But no less important is respect for the sovereign will of the peoples, restraint, and the need to exclude the use of force. All the problems arising between Ukraine and the sovereign republic of Crimea -- as part of Ukraine -- should be settled exclusively by political means. "The situation in Crimea confirms once again the need for settling as soon as possible the questions of the Black Sea Fleet, proceeding from the accords between the presidents of both countries. Russia is ready for this, the letter from A.V.Kozyrev says in conclusion."
