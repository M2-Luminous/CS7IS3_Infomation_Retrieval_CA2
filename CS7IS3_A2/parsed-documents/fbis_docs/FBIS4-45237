Primitive surveillance techniques have also made Ireland `the drugs capital of Europe' and the 500-mile coastline of West Cork and South Kerry has become a haven for the global drug runner, the British magazine Esquire said. The article claimed the seizures of drugs in the Cork area owed more to "nosy coastal dwellers" and carelessness than to law enforcement. A spokeswoman for the Revenue Commissioners said, however, that the National Drugs Team had an extensive mobile network and its operations were based on intelligence gathering and co-operation across Europe.
