Beijing would then have three groups working on the transition in 1997: the high-level Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) chaired by the deputy Prime Minister Qian Qichen, the 91 Hong Kong advisers appointed by the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and the local branch of XINHUA (the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY) and the district-level group. The creation of the lesser tier would help satisfy the enthusiasm of a number of community figures who want to become Hong Kong Affairs Advisers. A source said the appointment of advisers on district matters was a new idea which fitted Beijing's strategy of boosting ties at all levels following the breakdown of political co-operation with London. The source said that after declaring that it would step up its own preparations for the 1997 handover, Beijing had shifted the emphasis from seeking co-operation with Whitehall to expanding its so-called united front in the territory. Senior Chinese officials have indicated that they would increase the membership of the PWC and name a third batch of Hong Kong Affairs Advisers. It is understood that Beijing is still finalising the two lists of appointees and calculating the best timing for such an announcement. The Hong Kong and British governments already fear that the establishment of these groups ahead of the Preparatory Committee for the Special Administrative Region in 1996 is tantamount to creating an alternate power base to its own administration. It is understood that 10 more people would be named to sit on the 57-member PWC, which comes under the auspices of the National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee. Of the 57, 30 are local dignitaries and six of the 10 newcomers are expected to come from the territory. It is also expected that at least two more local delegates of the NPC will be enlisted. The front-runners are tipped to include unionist Cheng Yiu-tong, surveyor Kan Fook-yee and geography lecturer Victor Sit Fungshuen. It is understood that Beijing may approach a few senior government officials who have either been retired or left the bureaucracy. These include former treasury secretary Yeung Kai-yin and former secretary for education and manpower John Chan Cho-chak. But both have said privately they would not accept such an invitation. The source said it was now likely that the NPC Standing Committee would finalise the list of new PWC members at a meeting next month. It will also be around the time that invitations will be extended to the third batch of Hong Kong Affairs Advisers, whose number is yet to be decided but is said to be in the range of 50 to 100. In spite of the significant jump in the number of advisers, sources said local Xinhua officials began a few months ago to consider the possibility of naming a separate group of district affairs advisers. But a district leader who has been asked about the idea said: "I don't think it" appropriate now. It will create different classes -- on territory-wide and district affairs. "Those who are invited to become district affairs advisers might not be happy to accept the offer," he said.
