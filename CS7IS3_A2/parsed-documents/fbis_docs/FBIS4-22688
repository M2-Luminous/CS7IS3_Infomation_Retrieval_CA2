Outlines of a Secret Plan"] [Text] Amnesty and freedom--are they the same thing? One time I happened to be in Surgut and I could not restrain myself--I visited a famous site there--the hard labor colony. In terms of the number of "personnel"--1,600 people--it was no different from a full-fledged motorized infantry regiment! I know barracks: from those of flyers and people serving on submarines to those special forces and construction battalions. In the sleeping quarters, the dining room, the recreation facilities, and the work places in the Surgut hard labor colony, at least externally, things were better than in our units and subdivisions. The prisoners in the camp looked more cheerful and sharper than the soldiers in our garrisons. The commander of the colony was a colonel, just as colonels are at the "helm" of our divisions almost everywhere.... The "outside" and "demobilization"--what is the difference? If they were "taken" or "called up"--how are these different? "There" they begin with being "arrested" by the militia, and "here"--"recruitment" to the military commissariat. "There" they begin with the "agenda" and "here"--the same thing. "There"--"a training school" and "here"--"a training school"... But the soldier does not have such a benefit as--amnesty. For the soldier it is all the way, as for murder. This is true: Our army is constantly being threatened with cutbacks, but this does not affect people serving their stint on active duty, but for officers it means banishment, falling to the bottom. In any case amnesty is to the benefit of the government--the benefactor!--it always adds those who receive amnesty to the ranks of its supporters. The part of the army that is cut back is always an army against the government. Today, in addition to everything else, the army knows that on 4 October 1993 it was drawn, through deceit, into the dirty and bloody affair against its own people. With its help the regime, albeit only apparent and implied, held on--and this is called "digging in its heels." The army would not be likely to make the same mistake again. Now Yeltsin has a problem--how to get back the written order he gave to Grachev for the tanks to fire on the House of Soviets. It turns out that Pasha is not that simple--he...took it and "lost" it. The entire Ministry of Defense and General Staff are "looking" for it today. Amnesty has always been declared in honor of victory and the victors. The present amnesty is in honor of the new constitution, which essentially legitimizes the regime of occupation and plundering of the country. Whose victory is it, who is the victor? The new constitution, like any constitution, must be defended. But who will defend this one? Logically, if it is in honor of the new constitution, the criminals will walk through the gates of the camps, and from the moment of their release they will defend it. In general has anyone thought about the words "the government took advantage of criminals and criminal elements for its own interests"? What does this mean concretely? It took approximately two years to prepare the army for war against fascist Germany: In 1938 it was a standing army, like the Germans', and in 1939 a law was adopted concerning universal military service, just as the Germans had. Today the Moscow rulers are shouting to all the world: A terrible internal enemy has appeared in Russia--Russian nationalism. The internationalists have a precise formula for this: If the enemy does not give up, destroy him. And such things require a strong, well-trained army. Approximately two years ago Yeltsin headed up a commission on fighting crime. All the jails are now overflowing. There are three or four people for every bunk. But crime is growing immensely. Why? Did they arrest the wrong ones? They "arrested" the ones they needed--young people who had been in Afghanistan, who had served in the army, former militiamen, workers of the Committee on Security--in a word, the military commissariats were working, and they were "drafted into the army." Now 220,000 criminals are free. A "small but modern army"--the "Kremlin sergeants" say now. The only thing is that it is "small" in mind as well. The authorities already purport to be concerned that in April-May there could be a "social upheaval." Could this not happen at 0400 on 22 June? Why April-May? Is it not because by that date it will be possible to "release from the ranks" those 220,000 amnestied "demobilized" people, to "relocate" them, to station them so that they will be able to look around the localities, go on "reconnaissance" missions, look over the future "battlefield"?... Two years these young people who are supposed to be criminals have spent in "training school." The brigade--the platoon, the shop, section--the battalion...every platoon, every battalion has its number. The "battalion of defenders of the Kremlin No. 666"...throughout the entire world they are called "death squadrons." But that will come later; first--the circles of prison camp hell. The masters there since the times of the NKVD [People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs] People's Commissar Iyeguda, for Russians Yagoda. He was the organizer and inspiration for the GULags of 1931-1938. Among the GULag chiefs was his kinsman-Berman. During this period the main thing is to be able to crush a person as an individual, to frighten him to the point of animal terror so that it seems to him that there is no way out, and if there is, there is only one--the noose. It is impossible to bring the present-day criminal to such a condition in the camp--he is at home there, he is his own person there. But it is the criminal--the sadist and the pervert, the drug addict and the tuberculosis patient, the psychiatric patient and the torturer--they perform this "educational work" under the wise leadership of the "citizen boss." The criminal is like the division commander, the senior man in a regiment of new recruits. In the language of criminals, a person who has committed a "minor offense" and is in jail, not knowing what for--this person is an "ox." And after the "ox" is already beginning to try the noose on his neck for size, suddenly the "citizen boss" says to him approximately the following: "A new constitution has been adopted. It has been signed by President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin. According to this constitution Yeltsin is fighting for your amnesty. Pray for Boris Nikolayevich because out there, on the outside, he has many enemies. They do not want you to have amnesty but our president is a go-getter..." and he gives the person, as they say nowadays, a light at the end of the tunnel. The "ox" goes around to everyone explaining that "our own father, the savior Yeltsin" must be protected, and there is nobody on the outside except him to stand up for the "ox" and there are enemies out there: fascists and nationalists. "Do you agree?"--This is how the "government has taken advantage of criminals for its own purposes." In the colonies and camps this or approximately this was the way they asked the people they needed right after Yeltsin pushed his constitution through. But this question was raised especially pointedly after 4 October 1993. At that time Gaydar called out into the streets of Moscow those same "oxen," but they were "demobilized" in a different way: "For good work"--ahead of schedule. As they say: "Master, the assignment has been carried out." In April-May of this year a real "small but modern army" will be put to work. They will think long and hard, for example, about such a "special case" as when the military general and hero of Afghanistan Gromov suddenly, when Yazov was still in office, became deputy minister of internal affairs. As a counterbalance to the patriot and statesman Yazov? To train a regular professional army against the internal enemy, about which we had not heard a single thing at the time? A few more than 220,000 people are now being released--not many more than there were in the 40th Army with Gromov as commander. The regimental horizons were calculated and taken into account. The patriots: "Hoorah! Our victory!" It is not much of a victory when criminals grant freedom to honest people and seem to change places with them. The patriots must clarify: This amnesty is the beginning of a large-scale operation. It was begun by forces that fired from tanks at the House of Soviets. Then there was a concrete task--to destroy soviet power. Lieutenant Colonel Yushenkov--a teacher of Marxism-Leninism at the Academy imeni Lenin and now one of the fiercest supporters of the occupiers, does not conceal the fact that amnesty will be the beginning of a civil war in which they, the "democrats," will destroy "Russian fascism," meaning everything that is national and Russian from time immemorial. They planned this amnesty way back two years ago. "Taking advantage" of the Duma's patriotism, they released about a dozen of "our" people. Anpilov, for example, immediately took up his "atom bomb"--the microphone...but "they" used this amnesty to create and mobilize an entire army. It went through its "combat training" in such model-demonstration hard labor camps as I saw in Surgut. In April-May everything will be like in training sessions where they choose up sides: The "reds" will be ardently in favor of...the Kremlin, the "blues" will persistently defend and protect...the Kremlin. For a large combat training maneuver they usually plan for 15-20 corpses, and the causes of death vary, but, as a rule, they are caused by carelessness and drunkenness. The "reds" and the "blues" are only conventional designations for soldiers of the same army of "Kremlin sergeants." Each only depicts the opponent, the enemy. More than 15 or 20 corpses are planned for the Kremlin walls during April-May. Everything is envisioned, even what Yeltsin will say at the funerals. In addition to everything else, he will announce an edict there concerning the introduction of a state of emergency throughout the country for two years. "Victory!" Yushenkov will shout heart-rendingly. And the appointees will rush to their places. To all the posts and positions. For two years. And "our people" will be returned to their cubicles. The journalists and Poltoranin are worried that there will be no money for paper. How Poltoranin toys with them! He knows that in a month or two all these problems will evaporate because all that will be left will be two or three occupation newspapers like IZVESTIYA and MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS, and there will be plenty of paper for them. And they should not delude themselves and placate themselves with the idea that confusion and even panic, incoherence and even hostility will constantly reign in the Kremlin's corridors. This will occur on the floors housing the uninitiated. That is the way it is designed. You must know Yeltsin. When he was first secretary of the Moscow City Committee he had two party city committees: One was his own personal one, almost his family, which did all the work, and the city committee which all Muscovites knew--it signed papers and hung flags throughout Moscow on revolutionary holidays. And today there are two Kremlins: One Kremlin makes the decisions and the other one runs around making stupid announcements, conducts pointless news conferences, squabbles, intrigues, they scheme against one another, and, looking intelligent, make predictions and produce models. But all these are people "researchers." But they are not allowed within machine gun range of Yeltsin's holy of holies. So "that Kremlin" works, like a finely tuned mechanism, without interruptions and failures. Ultimately to hell with them, with this "second Kremlin," if there were any improvement in the country. But, after all, it is quite the opposite. Is everything calculated? Have we been sentenced? Is there no way out? But...and again the last hope--our national army. Even today it must know that in April-May or a little sooner or a little later under the walls of the Kremlin the "reds" released under amnesty from the prison camps and the "blues" from the same place will earn their "ransom." They will have no "refuseniks," there will be none who are timid. Each has placed his life on the line--freedom or back to the hell of the criminal zone. If there is a person--an article will be found!--everybody who has received amnesty knows this is true. They will burn and slaughter, take scalps and disembowel people, as in the House of Soviets on 4 October 1993. The reason? Luzhkov will permit Anpilov to hold a rally. Luzhkov will permit the National Liberation Front to picket the Kremlin, etc., etc. Army, save Russia! Three months is all the General Staff will need to bring order to the country's economy. It has all the specialists, departments, and administrations needed for this. Three months is all the army will need to bring order into the country, to put an end to the civil war, even that which is blazing in the outlying regions, the mafia, and gangsterism in the cities. What next? Next--that is no longer a problem for the army, but for the nationally elected Duma. Armies have a task: To pull the cart out of the swamp, to put things on a firm basis--and then back to the barracks. The clock has been set, the time has been checked. The operation against the Russians has entered its final phase....
