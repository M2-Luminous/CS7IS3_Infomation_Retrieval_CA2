The council will work along with Common Market institutions, and its role will be to promote and assist in the economic affairs of the Israeli business sector in the Common Market. The initiative to establish the Israeli-European council is that of the coordination bureau of the economic organizations in Israel. The council will be headed by two chairmen--the Israeli one will be Dan Proper, president of the coordination bureau and president of the Industrialists' Association. Dani Gillerman, president of the Society of Commerce Bureaus, will serve as his deputy. The European chairman has yet to be selected. The council's administration will include 12 members who are representatives of economic organizations and representatives of the business world from Israel, and 12 addition ones from among the Common Market countries. The council, which will serve as a sort of lobby to promote Israel's dealings in the market and vice versa, will open its office in Brussels, and a portion of the financing of its activities will be executed by institutions of the European Community (EC). Present at the festive meal in Brussels were Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres; Common Market President Jacques Delors, who welcomed its establishment; Dan Proper; Yoram Blizovski, director-general of the Industrialists' Association; and Marcel Shaton--Israel's commerce representative in Brussels. The leadership of the Industrialists' Association stayed in Brussels for three days for talks with representatives of the Common Market and administrators. "We feared a significant change in mood toward us," Proper related upon his return. "The market revealed a willingness for a series of benefits for Israel's position. Among other things, we reached an understanding on the subject of their extremist declaration regarding the disgrace of the Arab boycott," he added.
