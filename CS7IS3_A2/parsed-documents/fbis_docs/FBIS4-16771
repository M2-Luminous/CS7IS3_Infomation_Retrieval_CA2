Thus, in the past five years (from December 1988 to December 1993) the proportion of Russian citizens considering glasnost and freedom of expression important for themselves has declined from 51 to 12 percent. This finding has been reported by the Institute for the Sociology of Parliamentarianism directed by Nugzar Betaneli. The poll conducted in March and April 1994 showed that even in Moscow, where democratic trends prevail, the level of socio-psychological intolerance has grown: The number of those who think that not everything in Russia (people, parties, movements, and mass media) should enjoy equal freedom of expression has grown from 28 percent (May 1993) to 43 percent (March 1994), while another 2 percent believe that everyone's freedom of expression must be limited.
