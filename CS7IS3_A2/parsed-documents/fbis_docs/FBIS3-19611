[Debre] I do not look for rewards in my position, and I can assure I have found none in it. My role is a difficult one, I am very much aware of it. My aim is to ensure that the RPR remains an effective force, my wish is to support the government's action, and I hope to contribute to the election of Jacques Chirac to the presidency of the republic. Because of family tradition, my education, and my temperament, I do not like indifference and resignedness. In fulfilling my duties, I am giving a definite direction to my political commitment. From my position, I can observe the interplay of political forces and opposing interests, the limits of the loyalty of some, and the extent of the loyalty of others. Above all, I have had the pleasure of meeting women and men who are committed to fighting for the ideas in which they believe, disinterested activists, who often expect nothing in return for their political commitment. [Portes] With what feelings is the RPR following the development of relations between [RPR President] Jacques Chirac and [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur? [Debre] Leaders and activists are of course asking themselves questions about the relations between Jacques Chirac and Edouard Balladur. Our leaders do not want a split to occur. In their view, there should be no competition between Jacques Chirac and Edouard Balladur in the presidential elections. If there is any competition, it should be settled directly by the two men involved. As for the activists, they are legitimists by nature. [Portes] In other words? [Debre] The older members, those who adhered to our movement at the time of general de Gaulle or Georges Pompidou and who have developed in a Gaullist tradition, are favorable to Jacques Chirac because he led the Gaullists to victory and, through his action, prevented the disappearance of Gaullism from public life. The others, those who have joined us in the last few years, following the creation of the RPR or after 1988, are obsessed with divisiveness -- the divisiveness that made us lose. For all these activists, everything that has happened until now -- victory in the last general elections, Edouard Balladur's appointment to the prime ministership -- seems to originate in a plan developed by Jacques Chirac and Edouard Balladur. They therefore feel that there was a sort of pact between the two men. They do not understand why some would like to breach this "pact" and call into question a winning team -- the aim of this strategy being Jacques Chirac's election to the presidency of the republic. [Portes] What about the deputies? [Debre] The majority of the RPR's deputies are loyal to Jacques Chirac because they feel that he ardently upholds their beliefs. There are some deputies, on the other hand, who are -- legitimately -- concerned that the Left might come back into power. "Make sure there is only one candidate," this is what they are telling us. [Portes] Do you regret some of your remarks concerning the government's policies? [Debre] I have never disowned my own convictions, nor have I ever betrayed my loyalty to Jacques Chirac. However, I have come to realize that, sometimes, what I have said has shocked certain members of the government. The government is engaged in a difficult and unpopular action. As a deputy, it is my duty to support it, and this is precisely what I have always done through my voting in Parliament. But it is also my responsibility, as the RPR's spokesman, to show those Frenchmen who placed their trust in us in 1993 that, when I meet them today and they tell me their views, I do not then fail to transmit these views to our leaders. Now, I am concerned to see that some, engrossed in the difficulties of their task, are imprisoned in their own job, in their own unshakable beliefs, and no longer have the ability or the time to listen to what the French have to say. However, a majority leader must not only support the government's policy, he must also act as a link between public opinion and the government. What sometimes may have looked like criticism of the government was not intended as such in my mind. My aim was simply to warn the government, to say: "Watch out, we are drifting off course." Frankly, I cannot imagine for a minute that anybody has any good reasons to wish the government to fail in its task. [Portes] What mistakes did the government and the majority make over the past year? [Debre] We have not sufficiently denounced the Socialist budget, and we are now paying for its consequences. Moreover, we should have been much more active up until October, we should have carried out much more profound reforms, thus taking full advantage of that very short period of time when a government has the opportunity to act without hindrance. Finally, I believe that, through certain decisions and appointments, we have given the impression that cohabitation was turning to complacency. [Portes] Can you give us an example of this? [Debre] In the field of employment, the government was right to attempt to launch economic recovery. What was done in the spring and the Giraud law were a good starting point. However, we were too conformist, traditional, and not sufficiently innovative. Why did we not say last year, for example, that any company hiring an unskilled youth in 1994 would be exempted from paying three fourths of its social security contributions? Why procrastinate? Why remain stuck in the same old frozen schemes? [Portes] Quite a few observers and economic analysts believe that recovery is just round the corner. Do you share this view? [Debre] As far as I can tell from observing my own region, it looks as if the crisis is under control. But I do not belive recovery is imminent. [Portes] Do you believe the government has the political means to continue carrying out reforms? [Debre] I think we did not take enough advantage of the grace period during which a government is in the position to carry out many reforms. Today the government has fewer opportunities to do so. I hope it will find new opportunities. [Portes] How? [Debre] We must put back on the agenda what was initially envisaged, namely, the plan based on experience gained during 1986-1988, and which was subsequently conceptualized by Edouard Balladur at various stages. This plan placed the prime minister and the government outside the presidential perspective. Such a positioning, in fact, enabled the government to focus on reform and on France's renewal. However, some members of the government are giving the impression that they have abandoned this aim and that they are addressing electoral requirements. In order to restore the image of an efficient government that is entirely devoted to helping the country emerge from the crisis, the government must show unambiguously that it is not concerned about the presidential election, given that the prime minister is not a candidate. In this way, the government could indeed recover its credibility. Otherwise, the closer we move to the presidential election, the less credibility the government will have. This would also satisfy those who are denouncing the background noise that is spoiling the government's action. [Portes] Do you think that Jacques Chirac can put forward a project without implicitly criticizing the government's policies? [Debre] Yes, most definitely. Through his attitude and his voting in Parliament, Jacques Chirac has always supported the government unfailingly. With this sort of record, he will be able to develop an agenda which will not be focused on the past or at short-term prospects, but which will be geared to the future, apart from and beyond the government's performance. You cannot win the presidential election by looking back at the past, but rather, you must put forward a plan, an aim. [Portes] Are you in favor of a single majority candidate, and of organizing primaries for the presidential election? [Debre] I would like to see a single majority candidate for the presidency, and I would like this candidate to be Jacques Chirac. As far as primary elections are concerned, it is a good idea, but organizing them is up to the political forces, it is not the state's responsibility.
