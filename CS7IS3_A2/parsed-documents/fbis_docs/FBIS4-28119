Parliamentary sources said the opposition camp, led by the Liberal Democratic Party, pushed for a Hosokawa testimony, encouraged by budget committee chairman Tsuruo Yamaguchi. Yamaguchi, a Social Democratic Party member, proposed that both the ruling coalition parties and opposition parties should decide unanimously on whether or not Hosokawa testifies before the Diet about his personal finances, an issue which drove him out of power in April. Yamaguchi said the Hosokawa issue should be determined after testimony by Hosokawa's former secretary Masatoshi Miyama, who the opposition camp alleged has a good grasp of the former premier's monetary affairs.
