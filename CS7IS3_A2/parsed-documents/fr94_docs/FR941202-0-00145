FR941202-0-00145 FR941202-0-00013 In the NPRM, we made a rough estimate of perhaps 2500 situations per year in which blood would catch a test that breath could not. Commenters did not present data suggesting that the number would be significantly higher; we tend to think, at this time, that the estimate may have been too high. We have concluded that it is not worth subjecting employees to an invasive testing procedure and incurring the other disadvantages of adding blood alcohol testing to our program to capture this probably small number of cases. For this reason, we are withdrawing the proposed authorization of the use of blood in some post-accident and reasonable suspicion test situations, and we will not include blood testing as a part of the DOT alcohol testing program. As noted below, we are issuing a final rule establishing a temporary reporting requirement concerning missed reasonable suspicion and post-accident tests. We believe that following this course will be less disadvantageous to employers than some commenters appear to believe. There is no requirement in the DOT rules_and never has been_that employers buy their own EBT for every conceivable location in which a reasonable suspicion or post-accident test could occur, including every company facility or location. We expect that companies may move EBTs around from facility to facility for scheduled tests such as pre-employment and random tests. For the non-scheduled reasonable suspicion and post-accident tests, we expect employers to take reasonable steps to ensure coverage. We recognize that tests will not be able to be completed in some instances. That is why, for example, the reasonable suspicion and post-accident testing provisions of the alcohol rules issued by the operating administrations on February 15, 1994, tell employers to discontinue attempts at testing after eight hours but require them to keep a record explaining the inability to conduct the test. Consortia and third-party service providers can often provide both more economical service and wider coverage than employers would find possible on their own. Reimbursable agreements among employers, even across various industries, could make EBT and BAT services available in locations where a single employer would not have coverage. The operating administrations will also provide guidance and work with their employers to ensure appropriate coverage by employers. Finally, the Department recognizes that there will be some situations in which the best good faith efforts on the part of an employer (as distinct from an abdication of the effort) cannot result in a test being completed. That is, we acknowledge and accept the fact that there will be some ``missed'' tests. The Department's judgment on this issue is based, to a considerable extent, on the premise that there will not be excessive numbers of ``missed'' tests. This premise, while based on a logical view of how our program will work, is not, at this stage, based on hard data. This is because the alcohol testing program has not begun yet, so there is little data on which we can rely. (That is, the first MIS reports for alcohol are not due until March 15, 1996. The first MIS reports for drugs are not due until March 15, 1995, so we do not even have comprehensive data yet for drug testing in most of the affected industries which might serve as a basis for inferences about the alcohol testing program.) For this reason, the Department is modifying an existing regulatory requirement to generate relevant data. All the operating administration alcohol testing regulations include a requirement for employers to prepare and maintain on file a record of when a post-accident or reasonable suspicion test is not administered within eight hours. At this point, the employer must stop attempts to administer the test. This is, in other words, an existing requirement to document a ``missed'' test and the reasons for it. This requirement applies to all covered employers. For a three-year period beginning January 1, 1995, the Department will require those employers who transmit an MIS report to the Department to transmit a copy of these records along with their MIS report. They should be sent to the same address as MIS reports are sent for the operating administration involved. Reports should be sent to the operating administration only at the time that MIS reports are sent. That is, the employer should send a year's worth of reports (a separate report for each ``missed test'') to the operating administration at one time. Employers should not send reports concerning tests which are conducted within the 8-hour period, only concerning tests that are not conducted because more than 8 hours have passed since the triggering event. (The existing rules also require employers to document when a reasonable suspicion or post-accident test cannot be conducted within two hours. This requirement remains in effect, but employers are not required to report to DOT concerning tests that are conducted more than two but less than eight hours after the triggering event. This is because such tests, while perhaps of diminished value, are not truly ``missed tests.'') The rule specifies the information that would be part of the records. The required information is the following: (1) Type of test. Is the test a reasonable suspicion or post-accident test? (This information is not required from railroad employers, since FRA has always conducted post-accident blood tests and does not conduct post-accident breath alcohol testing parallel to that conducted under other operating administrations' rules. All ``missed tests'' under the FRA rule would be reasonable suspicion tests.)
