"The brigade-strength North Korean border troops have recently been reinforced to the strength of a corps consisting of 30,000 to 40,000 men," Vice Unification Minister Song Yong-tae said. Speaking at a panel talks at the National Assembly, Song said in the past loggers at North Korea-run logging yards in Siberia used to be granted special outings on Kim Il-song's birthday, April 15, the biggest public holiday of North Korea. "We have a report indicating that this year no outings were allowed at all for their loggers in Siberia," Song said. He said there had been no particular signs of armed provocation on the part of North Korea. But, people there have lately been whipped into producing more military supplies in addition to daily necessities, and Kim Il- song's birthday is being observed in low-key celebrations this year, Song said.
