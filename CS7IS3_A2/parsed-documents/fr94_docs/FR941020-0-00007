FR941020-0-00007 FR941020-0-00003 History On May 13, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class E airspace at Dubuque Regional Airport, Iowa; Fort Leavenworth, Sherman Army Air Field, Kansas; Hutchinson Municipal Airport, Kansas; Manhattan Municipal Airport, Kansas, Olathe, Johnson County Executive Airport, Kansas; Olathe, Johnson County Industrial Airport, Kansas; Topeka, Forbes Field, Kansas; Fort Leonard Wood, Forney Army Airfield, Missouri; Jefferson City Memorial Airport, Missouri; Kansas City, Richards-Gebaur Airport, Missouri; and St. Joseph, Rosecrans Memorial Airport, Missouri. Currently, this airspace is designated as Class D when the associated control tower is in operation. However, to have controlled airspace to the surface for IFR operations at these airports when the towers are closed, there must be two-way radio communication capability and weather observations. When these control towers are closed, there are no weather observations until the tower reopens. As noted in the Airspace Reclassification Final Rule, published in the Federal Register on December 17, 1991, airspace at an airport with a part-time control tower should be designated as a Class D airspace area when the control tower is in operation (56 FR 65645). The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes that there is an immediate need to remove these Class E airspace areas since they do not meet the requirement of Class E airspace. Accordingly, since this action involves the revocation part-time control tower should be designated as a Class D airspace area when the control tower is in operation (56 FR 65645). The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes that there is an immediate need to remove these Class E airspace areas since they do not meet the requirement of Class E airspace. Accordingly, since this action involves the revocation of Class E airspace as a result of loss of weather reporting capability, notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are unnecessary. Furthermore, to avoid confusion on the part of the pilots flying in the vicinity of Dubuque Regional Airport, Iowa; Fort Leavenworth, Sherman Army Air Field, Kansas; Hutchinson Municipal Airport, Kansas; Manhattan Municipal Airport, Kansas; Olathe, Johnson County Executive Airport, Kansas; Olathe, Johnson County Industrial Airport, Kansas; Topeka, Forbes Field, Kansas; Fort Leonard Wood, Forney Army Airfield, Missouri; Jefferson City Memorial Airport, Missouri; Kansas City, Richards-Gebaur Airport, Missouri; and St. Joseph, Rosecrans Memorial Airport, Missouri, and to promote safe and efficient handling of air traffic in these areas, I find that good cause exists, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d), for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71 Airspace, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (Air). Adoption of the Amendment In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 71 as follows: PART 71_[AMENDED] 1.
