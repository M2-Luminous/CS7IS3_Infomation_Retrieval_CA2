Deputy Fu Quanyou pointed out: We must increase the intensity of logistical operations reform, speed up the pace of reform, and achieve higher efficiency and greater logistical capability through reform. We must carry forward the fine traditions of plain living and arduous struggle, strive to display the five types of revolutionary spirit initiated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the 64-character pioneering spirit initiated by Chairman Jiang Zemin, and expedite the PLA's modernization of logistical support through reform.
