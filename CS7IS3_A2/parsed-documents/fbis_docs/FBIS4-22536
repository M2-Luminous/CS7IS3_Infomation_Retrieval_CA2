But don't think I'm complaining: I realize the Vice President of the Georgian Academy of Sciences is extremely busy, he's only in Tbilisi for a month and there are all kinds of people waiting to see him. Anyway, I did not sit idle while waiting: the Vice President's assistant made me a copy of the main points of the paper which Iver Prangishvili had given that day before a meeting of the Presidium of the Georgian Academy of Sciences--"A Conception-Program to `Save' the Republic of Georgia." I read it eagerly. Iver Prangishvili is the director of the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of Problems of Control, the chief designer of AES [nuclear power plant] automation systems for Russia (formerly the Soviet Union and, in fact, the CEMA [Council for Economic Mutual Aid] countries), a professor and department head in Moscow's Physics Engineering Institute, the President of the Society of Georgians Living in Russia, the President of the Georgian Engineering Academy, the Honorary President of the Georgian Reformers Union, and a member of numerous international academies and associations. I will try to give SAKARTVELOS RESPUBLIKA's vast readership a closer acquaintance with Batoni Iver and show the man and personality behind the resume. I confess I got this vital information from the people closest to him (his wife, his assistant and coworkers). Academician Iver Prangishvili is 63 years old, married to Tsiala Gugunishvili (an energy engineer); his son Archil is a doctor of technical sciences (incidentally, this young man was recently handed his doctor's degree--the first ever Georgian one--by Head of State Shevardnadze himself); and, so far, one grandson, a year old, who bears the same name, bless his heart. "He is kind and good-hearted, always trying to make you feel good; he never acts superior. When we are in Moscow, he's at the Institute from 9 in the morning until 10 at night, and after he comes home he works until nearly three o'clock in the morning. Even on weekends he doesn't stop for a minute [as we can see, an academician's lot is not easy--T.E.]; he loves to read fiction, he's musical--he loves Chopin and Schubert. He's a loving grandfather, and everybody loves him" (his wife). "He is kind and good-natured, he has a rare gift for sympathy, and he knows art very well. Every time he goes to Moscow he leaves me a thank-you card for our work together" (his assistant). "He is energetic and industrious and thinks on a vast scale. In Moscow, even on the highest echelons, he is able to use his fame and authority to help Georgians of various ranks working in science, economics, or politics, who come to Moscow. It's amazing how many kinds of `Georgian' concerns he can deal with during a two-week sojourn in Moscow. He is very humble, and not just for show" (close associates). When it comes to humility and simplicity, I would like to say that several times I had to push him a little--surely forgivable in a journalist--to get him to talk about himself. [Ebanoidze] Batono Iver, you gave a paper today to the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences, the significance of which is clear from the title--"A Conception-Program to `Save' the Economy of the Republic of Georgia." I've looked at its main points. We keep hearing the word "save" these days, and we have all kinds of saviors. How do you envision the country's salvation? [Prangishvili] The Conception-Program to "save" the people from hunger and cold and stabilize the economy was prepared late last summer by an initiative group from the Georgian Academy of Sciences, the Georgian Engineering Academy, and the Reformers Union. It was submitted in September to the Head of State, who made use of several of the main points in a speech to Parliament. The Conception-Program discusses problems that need to be solved immediately. These include basic supplies of essential resources, in particular food, fuel, and energy for the population and the economy. It presents proposals for urgent measures in the most basic sectors--industry, agroindustry, fuel and energy, and transportation. In order to realize practical implementation of the economic reforms called for in the Conception-Program, the following conditions are necessary: 1. Put a stop to the tense crime situation and mafia organizations by instituting a state of emergency (mafiosi, also criminal organizations and individuals, do not like reforms and discipline); 2. Rather than a parliamentary republic, we need a republic with a strong head of state or president. 3. Institute strong discipline to rally the people and restore trust in the government (if the leaders can overcome the grave crime situation and correct it in short order, they will regain the people's trust); 4. Get rid of hyperinflation in the very first stage of reforms; we know that reforms are impossible in a time of hyperinflation. In general, it is most expedient to carry out reforms in sequence--first economic reforms (food!), then spiritual (freedom of speech and information), and finally political (parliament, a multi-party system, broad democracy). In continuing the transition period, we need to reject the "shock therapy" model which calls for a swift transition to the market economy. It is too painful and will only work with massive foreign investment. For the transition period we need to create a mixed, multi-sector model which will ensure a relatively mild, gradual, and painless transition to the market economy. In announcing a modified transition period, we have to form three provisional sectors of the economy. The purpose of the first sector, the one that "saves," is to create the minimum amount of goods necessary for the estimated 5.5-million population's needs (1,500 kilocalories per capita). These goods need to be produced and distributed on a ration card basis, with strict state control, so that everyone gets his share of bread, milk, cheese, and other products providing a total of 1,500 kilocalories (below that amount, irreversible physiological impairment from hunger sets in). The "save" sector must produce the essential foodstuffs providing the necessary calories (5.5 million times 1,500) at prices affordable to pensioners, and also meet people's transportation, fuel, and other minimal consumer needs. During the first stage, this sector must turn out 50 percent of total goods output. The second sector should be the regulated market sector. Out of 300 to 400 product items, the state regulates the prices of 19 or 20 of the basic prime necessities, not by directive but by economic methods (favorable credits, tax breaks, and so on). During the first stage this sector will produce about 25 percent of total production output. The third sector will be the free market sector; its role, importance, and share will gradually increase along with economic reforms. Prices in it are free, regulated by supply and demand, without state intervention. In the first period, the free market's share of the economy will be set at 20 to 25 percent. This is the most efficient sector, because it makes maximum use of people's personal initiative and interest. Alongside these three basic sectors there is also the "shadow" economy, which, in terms of its nature and effect, is quite different from shadow economies abroad. In other countries, the shadow economy is chiefly mixed up with narcotics, pornography, fraud, and tax evasion; in our country, the shadow economy chiefly involves the theft and sale of state and public property and mass speculation in gasoline, bread, flour, and other goods. The transition period covers three to six years; at the end, we will convert to the market economy and the state "salvation" sector will no longer be necessary. [Ebanoidze] Specific points in your paper deal with the vital importance of the fuel and energy, agroindustrial, and communications complexes. [Prangishvili] Let's start with fuel and energy. The only way to "salvation" here is to institute a state of emergency in power consumption. We have worked out a three-stage conception-program of energy development. The first stage runs through 1995, the second runs through the year 2000, and the third runs through 2005. We have worked out a mathematical model and run a computer simulation to find a scientifically substantiated optimal variant of energy development. During the first stage (1994-1995), an additional 6 billion kwh of electricity must be generated, for which, in particular, a tenth and eleventh power unit will have to go on line in the Tbilisi GRES [state regional power plant], and existing GESes [hydropower plants] will have to be renovated to boost their generating capacity and reduce losses. During the second stage (1995-2000), we will need an additional 6 billion kwh, for which a base-load 600-megawatt TES [thermal power plant] will have to be built near Kutaisi and which will run on local Tkibuli coal. A number of small and medium-sized GESes will have to be built. For the agroindustrial complex, the Conception-Program provides a balance of minimally essential supply and demand of basic food items for the current year. The grain requirement this year in terms of physiological norms equals 2 million tonnes. Of this amount, the republic can produce 0.6 million tonnes; hence, we will have to buy 1.4 million tonnes abroad. We have calculated the necessary amounts of meat and meat products, milk and dairy products, sugar, potatoes, and vegetable oil and the amounts of money involved. In order to alleviate the meat problem, the program recommends enlisting U.S. aid to build 40 modern hog farms in Georgia with the capacity to produce 100 million tonnes of meat annually. Plans call for keeping half the meat, the bones, and all of the hides in the republic; the United States will take the other half of the meat and sell it in third countries to pay the costs. The program proposes that orchard and garden products be used to meet the needs of Tbilisi and Rustavi. Let's see what innovations there are in the communications complex. Let me say generally that Georgia's communications network will be changed totally; Georgia is going to have a modern communications system. One innovation will be a 2000-number cellular radio communications network. The project will be done by a U.S. firm; it will be implemented in May of this year, using World Bank credits. With the help of the Siemens Company, a new 200,000-number digital telephone exchange will be built in Tbilisi to replace the old 100,000-number exchange, half of which no longer work anyway. Also to be built in Tbilisi is a joint Georgian-Turkish optical cable plant. Some of the product will remain in Georgia, while the rest will be sold abroad. A new local and long-distance digital telephone exchange will be built in Kutaisi and Batumi, accommodating 30,000 numbers. Austria's Teletra Company is going to build two stations for modern satellite communications. There are other innovations as well. [Ebanoidze] The "salvation" program calls for using the results of scientific-technical research done in Georgia and the adoption of new, modern technologies. [Prangishvili] Clearly, rapid adoption of scientific-technical advances will play a big role in saving the republic's economy. Therefore, the new technologies, methods, and advances developed by our scientists are broadly recommended for a variety of economic sectors. The list of items I will tell you about now is really impressive: The adoption of new, energy-saving technologies; the production and use of new medical treatments; the use of non-toxic biostimulants to boost grain yields; the establishment of bamboo plantations and the adoption of a new technology to make our own paper from it; the production of new medicines, vitamins, and extracts using local raw materials; the preparation of a liquid suspension (mixture) of coal for efficient use; and others. Let us focus in more detail on a few items. In the sphere of energy-saving technologies, the pulse-delivery principle in electrical and gas installations (instead of constant delivery) yields a 30-percent savings. We can use it in kitchen ranges, electric and gas stoves, and boiler facilities to excellent economic and ecological effect. This new principle is already being adopted in the republic's enterprises. We have also received orders from other countries. The non-toxic biostimulants which our researchers have developed make it possible to double yields of corn, wheat, soy, beans, sugar beets, onions, coriander, and other vegetables using practically no fertilizer, thus producing ecologically clean, toxic-free products. Large-scale (100-hectare) experiments in Lanchkhuti Rayon have been very encouraging and ought to be extended to other territories. A third example--producing a coal suspension to use for fuel--reduces coal consumption by several dozen percent and enhances the ecology (pulverized coal mixed with water is used as fuel). [end of Prangishvili's answer] The Institute of Problems of Control in the Russian Academy of Sciences is a world class research center. Iver Prangishvili has been connected with it for many years: he was the head of a laboratory from 1964, deputy director for science from 1970, and he was elected director in 1986. Let's look at that word "elected": if a 2,000-man collective in Moscow prefers a Georgian over two Russians to serve as their leader, you have to think that this man must greatly surpass them in terms of personality and business qualities. Iver Prangishvili is now in his ninth year as Institute director; among his numerous duties is that of carrying out vital missions for that vast country: for example, working out a conception for managing the overall development and improvement of Russia's economy, dealing with problems of reform and administration in Russia, and drawing up appropriate recommendations. Since it was established, the Institute has turned out over 100 qualified Georgian specialists, including two other academicians--Vakhtang Chichinadze and Mindia Salukvadze. Iver Prangishvili has supervised the training of over 50 candidates and doctors. Of the Georgians working with him now, doctors of science Avtandil Anuashvili, Vladimer Zhorzhikashvili, and Aleksandre Shubladze are heads of laboratories; five are senior science associates, one is a doctoral candidate, and several are graduate students. [Ebanoidze] Batono Iver, as you know, we Georgians often lose our sense of moderation--with all our numerous political parties, universities, commercial schools, newspapers, generals, banks, and travel agencies in one little country.... Now consider all the academies: the Academy of Sciences, the Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the Academy of Engineering (not to mention colleges such as the Academy of Painting), the Military Academy.... I've heard, as well, that a Medical Academy and an Academy of the Humanities are looming on the horizon.... And later, maybe, an Academy of Literature and Academy of Art.... Right now, though, will you tell us about the Academy of Engineering, which you are the President of. Does it justify its existence? [Prangishvili] I envisioned the Academy of Engineering as a bridge between fundamental science and production. To put it figuratively, fundamental science ends with formulas, new principles and methods, which then need to be calculated, developed, designed, and put into production. The Academy of Engineering includes several engineering centers which foster the revival of production and the development and adoption of new technologies. From this standpoint, the Academy of Engineering is already playing a positive role. [Ebanoidze] Now, as the President of the Society of Georgians Living in Russia, would you please tell us what it does. [Prangishvili] The Society has 95,000 members. Its purpose is to help Georgia and the Georgian people. We try to make Russia better acquainted with Georgian culture, Georgian traditions, our various accomplishments. The Society and its members put on benefit concerts and other cultural and educational events. The Society's financial base comes from members' contributions. We have helped around 10,000 Georgian refugees in Russia with lodging, jobs, travel back and forth, costing 50 million rubles. We have spent millions of rubles to make and distribute Georgian musical records. Our funds were also used to publish two or three editions of the newspaper DEMOKRATICHESKAYA ABKHAZIYA in Moscow, to provide the Russian people with correct information about what was going on in Abkhazia. We have organized and financed several television broadcasts about events in Georgia. I should tell you that our budget is over 100 million rubles. [Ebanoidze] Batono Iver, could you tell us a little about your own personal scientific interests, perhaps singling out some of your more significant recent works? [Prangishvili] Generally, I'm working on problems of control [words illegible]. They include scientifically substantiated control of enterprises, organizations, and sectors, the control and optimization of technological processes of complex systems and facilities. Recently, my colleague Doctor of Sciences Avtandil Anuashvili and I discovered a new principle of visibility, and on its basis we developed the world's first computer system to visualize "invisible" phenomena and objects. Our discovery makes it possible to see objects and phenomena which radio and optical locators can't pick up and the human eye can't usually see (for example, the ultraspectrum and the infraspectrum). We have developed a system and device--sensory transformers which, if the human eye is equipped with such electronic-optical sensors, it can see objects and phenomena that are invisible today and, if it exists, "parallel life" as well. There are some other really nice and interesting things, but we can talk about them another time. [end of Prangishvili answer] My last meeting with the Vice President was on 21 January. The next day he headed for Moscow, and from there, on 24 January, to Tashkent. On 25-26 January, the capital of Uzbekistan was hosting a conference of members of the International Congress of Industrialists and Businessmen, participated in by a Georgian delegation headed by Iver Prangishvili. The conference discussed measures to quickly restore economic ties among enterprises of the former republics of the USSR and establish new, mutually beneficial relations. Just before Batoni Iver was to fly to Moscow again, I wished him continued fruitful activities "outside of Georgia"--fruitful for Georgia and in general.
