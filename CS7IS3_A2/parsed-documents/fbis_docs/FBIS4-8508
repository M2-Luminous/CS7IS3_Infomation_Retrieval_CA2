The peacekeepers -- 14 Canadian peacekeeping troops and three UN military observers of unspecified nationality -- were taken by the Serbs to a barracks at Ilijas, Annink said. Cifluk lies just inside the heavy weapons exclusion zone around Sarajevo ordered by the United Nations in February. A French UN soldier was wounded Thursday morning by Serb sniper fire, UN spokesman for Sarajevo Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Pernod said. He said the soldier was hit while manning an anti-sniper post near Vrbanja bridge on the front line not far from central Sarajevo. He was rushed to hospital for surgery but the spokesman had no details on his condition. Nineteen French UN troops have been killed so far in ex-Yugoslavia while more than 250 have been injured, the spokesman said. The incidents came amid heightened tension in the capital and other points in Bosnia after NATO air strikes against Serb attackers besieging the eastern Moslem enclave of Gorazde, a UN-declared safe area. Sarajevo was rocked Wednesday by two series of explosions that marred a two-month old ceasefire, as Bosnian Serb strongman said he had "cancelled" all accords with the United Nations after the air strikes, saying he could no longer trust the world body. Earlier Wednesday, Radio Sarajevo said Serb forces continued an offensive against Gorazde, despite an announcement Wednesday by Russian envoy Valeriy Churkin that he had brokered a ceasefire around the enclave.
