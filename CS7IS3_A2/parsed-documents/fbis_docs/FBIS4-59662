On the Shabwah axis, our troops completed the mopping up of Bayhan district from the elements of secession and apostasy in cooperation with the honorable citizens of Bayhan district. Our forces yesterday regained control of Mulhim Brigade with its heavy and medium weapons, including 22 tanks, five katyusha BM-21 vehicles, a number of armed crews, and a large quantity of ammunition. A number of officers, NCO's, and soldiers from the Mulhim Brigade joined the legitimacy troops, announcing their adherence to unity, democracy, and Constitutional legitimacy. On the Abyan axis, our Armed Forces continued their advance and are now closing on al-'Alam point. On the al-'Anad-al-Hawtah axis, the 14th Battalion of the 22d Infantry Brigade, with all its ordnance, joined the forces of Constitutional legitimacy. All members of the battalion announced their refusal to fight with the forces of rebellion and the gang of apostasy and secession in the Socialist Party leadership. At the same time, the forces of legitimacy continued their advance toward al-'Anad Base and took control of the area in which the base is located on the Ta'izz-Aden-al-Dali' crossroads. They then completed their seige of the base from all the directions to allow the elements deceived by the gang of apostasy and secession at the Socialist Party leadership the opportunity to join the forces of Constitutional legitimacy. Today, our Air Force pilots carried out their missions in the battlefield, achieving the set objectives. All planes returned safely to base. Our Armed Forces units continue to receive in succession the officers, NCO's, and soldiers who are joining the Armed Forces, the forces for protecting unity and Constitutional legitimacy. They voiced their rejection of the instructions and hegemony of the secessionist, rebellious forces and their denunciation of that gang and its major crimes against the people, the Armed Forces and security troops. They also expressed their readiness to sacrifice for the sake or unity and to protect Constitutional legitimacy and democracy in the country. Here we underline the dark fate which the secessionist rebels must meet thanks to the heroism of the entire Yemeni people, headed by those who take pride in belonging to the Armed Forces and security troops, who defend the people and the homeland and its eternal achievements, and who confront any one who may be tempted to infringe on them. They are, and will always remain, the men protecting the lives of all citizens and the homeland's security and stability and protectors of property, freedoms, rights, and honor in all governorates and cities. Those who circulate lies and spread false rumors will only fail. In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful: And soon will the unjust assailants know what vicissitudes their affairs will take. [Koranic verse]
