FR940503-2-00117 FR940503-2-00081 [Docket No. 50&hyph;206] Southern California Edison Co. San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, Unit 1; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) to Facility Operating License No. DPR&hyph;13, a possession-only license held by the Southern California Edison Company (SCE or the licensee). The exemption would apply to the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, Unit 1 (SONGS 1), a permanently shutdown plant located at the SCE site in San Diego County, California. Environmental Assessment Identification of Proposed Action The proposed action would grant an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) to the extent that SONGS 1 would be exempted from participation in the industry retrospective rating plan (secondary level financial protection). The licensee requested the elimination of its required participation in a letter dated February 2, 1993. The Need for the Proposed Action SONGS 1 was permanently shut down in November 1992, and defueling of the reactor completed in March 1993. Upon licensee certification of the defueling on March 9, 1993, Amendment No. 150 to Facility Operating License No. DPR&hyph;13 became effective, changing the license to a possession-only license. The exemption addresses withdrawal from participation in the industry retrospective rating plan. Since SONGS 1 no longer contributes as great a risk to the retrospective rating plan participants as does an operating plant, this reduction in risk should be reflected in the indemnification requirements to which the licensee is subject. Approval of this request would allow a more equitable allocation of financial risk. Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action The proposed action does not involve any environmental impacts. The proposed exemption is in a subject area, changes in surety, insurance and/or indemnity requirements, for which the Commission in 10 CFR 51.22(c)(10) has determined that a license amendment would meet the criteria for categorical exclusion from the need for either an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement. Since the proposed action does not involve a change in plant operation or configuration, there is reasonable assurance that the proposed action would not increase the probability or the consequences of an accident or reduce the margin of safety, no changes would be made in the types or quantities of effluents that may be released offsite, and there would be no significant increase in the allowable individual or cumulative radiation exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmental impact. With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed action does not affect non-radiological plant effluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant non-radiological impacts associated with the proposed action. Alternatives to the Proposed Action Since the Commission has concluded that there are no measurable environmental impacts associated with the proposed action, any alternative with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated. The principal alternative would be to deny the action. This would not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation and would not enhance the protection of the environment nor public health and safety. Alternative Use of Resources This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in the Environmental Assessment related to the conversion of the Provisional Operating License to a Full Term Operating License issued to Southern California Edison Company for the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, Unit 1, on September 16, 1991. Agencies and Persons Consulted The NRC staff consulted with a representative of the State of California regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action. Finding of No Significant Impact The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption. Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment.

Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 22nd day of April 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Seymour H. Weiss, Director, Non-Power Reactors and Decommissioning Project Directorate, Division of Operating Reactor Support, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.
