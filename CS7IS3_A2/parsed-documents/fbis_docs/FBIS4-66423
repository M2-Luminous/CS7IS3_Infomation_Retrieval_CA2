Superficial as it sounds, paint removal is not something ``green'' technology can afford to gloss over. Any impurities left on polypropylene bumpers -- the primary kind used in Japan -- weakens the strength of the recycled product. At best, tinted bumpers can expect to come back to life as foot rests or spare-tire buckets. Hence the importance of the new method developed jointly by Nissan Motor Co. and Mitsui Petrochemical Industries Ltd. While all the major automakers have been working to develop recycling technology, Nissan claims it is the first to achieve 100 percent paint removal. Nissan's method combines the use of an alkaline solvent with hulling technology derived from rice polishing. First, used bumpers retrieved by Nissan-affiliated dealerships are sent to Mitsui Petrochemical to be crushed. The resulting mass is then immersed in a hot alkaline solution where polyester contained in the molecular structure of the paint is dissolved. To remove the final traces of primer, force is applied to the surface using the hulling technology. Other materials are carefully removed by filtration. FIGURE As well as completely removing paint, this technique has the advantage over existing methods of being able to process bumpers made by other automakers and is lower in cost. There are three other bumper-paint removal techniques: a hydrolysis method that uses pressure and high temperature, a compressed vibration method and the ``cyclone'' method. The hydrolysis method was developed jointly by Toyota Motor Corp. and Toyota Central Research & Development Laboratories Inc. In this procedure, the paint is chemically decomposed to form a gel, which is then fused and mixed. Hydrolysis has proved effective for engineering plastics with heat plasticity, but is difficult to use on products made by other manufacturers. What's more, the physical properties of the resulting products are reportedly inferior to those made using the Nissan technology. The compressed vibration method is used by the Gifu research center of Ein Co. BMW Japan Corp. began recycling used cars in January, and is entrusting all of its bumper recycling to Ein. Ein's method removes 99.4 percent of the paint, but it is rather expensive and Japanese automakers have shied away from it. The cyclone method is currently being developed by Sumitomo Chemical Co. This technology involves pulverizing the paint into units several hundred microns in size. The drawback is that it wastes a lot of energy and is also very expensive. Even with its advantages, Nissan's technology is not problem-free. Profitability remains the biggest obstacle to be cleared. At present, Nissan is using the technology to recycle only about 2 tons of bumpers every month, most of which are used as replacement bumpers for the firm's Bluebird models. The company reportedly needs to process about 500 tons per month to make the exercise profitable. For that reason, Nissan is seeking the cooperation of other automakers. Despite the technological successes, there is still much ground to be made in recycling auto parts. Reprocessed bumpers still amount to only a drop in the bucket compared with the total number discarded. And while it is possible to recover used bumpers from dealers, there are no established channels for recovering heavier parts.
