This was disclosed by the Croatian permanent mission at the UN, which has submitted a formal request to this effect to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. The text of the request stresses that the efforts made by international mediators have so far produced no results that could be described as significant progress in implementing UN Security Council resolutions. By signing the Zagreb agreement Croatia has shown its readiness to resolve the problem of its occupied areas peacefully. But the Serb side -- by refusing to resume the talks -- is showing that it is not willing to accept the UN Security Council resolutions, while the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is continuing and speeding up the silent integration of these areas into its state system, the official request by the Croatian mission says.
