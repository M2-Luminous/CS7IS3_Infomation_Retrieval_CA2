Chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee Sen. Sam Nunn and other congressmen told South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-joo that they expect some progress be made in ongoing negotiations between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) as one side, and the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as another side. They said that dialogue, at least for now, is the best way for solving the nuclear problem. The U.S. congressmen arrived here last week after visiting Russia and Japan. According to latest reports, the IAEA is expected to wind up working-level negotiations with DPRK on inspections of the DPRK's nuclear sites in a day or two, and dispatch a team of inspectors to Pyongyang. The DPRK, South Korea and the U.S. are expected to simultaneously announce their positions on three issues when the IAEA team arrives in Pyongyang. The three issues are inter-Korean exchange of special envoys, suspension of the "Team Spirit" joint South Korea-U.S. military exercise, and high-level talks between Pyongyang and Washington. Pyongyang is expected to announce that it will resume inter- Korean talks, and is willing to open working-level contacts with Seoul to discuss mutual nuclear inspections based on the south-north non-nuclear declaration. Seoul will announce that it is willing to suspend the "Team Spirit" exercise, while Washington is to announce that it will hold a third round of high-level talks with Pyongyang on condition of the IAEA nuclear inspection and inter-Korean talks.
