When Pawlak's government was being formed, over one-third of respondents were afraid that the rate of privatization might be slowed down. Currently, almost 70 percent think the government has neither speeded up privatization nor slowed it down. Let us recall that, over the first quarter of this year, only three enterprises were subjected to capital privatization (the smallest number since 1990.) Between the beginning of 1990 and September of last year, 76 companies were sold through capital privatization. The biggest number (23) changed owners in the first half of 1993. Twelve percent of the CBOS respondents think that the government's lack of interest is the main obstacle in the privatization process. A definitely larger number of respondents think that politics is not the main reason behind reducing the rate of transformations. According to those people, privatization is being slowed down first of all by lack of Polish capital (47 percent), poor legislation (44 percent), and the bad economic situation of enterprises (41 percent). Those who think privatization is beneficial for the economy come primarily from the managerial cadre and intelligentsia. They also reside in large cities, have higher education, are well-off financially, and sympathize with right-wing political parties. Every fifth respondent is convinced of the harmful effects of privatization on the economy. This view is predominant among farmers, the poorest members of society, and those holding left-wing views. A significant proportion of respondents remain afraid of the effects of privatization on the company where they work. For almost half of all employees of state-owned enterprises who were polled, privatization brings along more fears than hopes for a better future. They are afraid that privatization will mean the end to guaranteed employment and that the level of social benefits will deteriorate. Respondents who view as positive the effects of transformations on the company where they work say that labor discipline and labor efficiency will increase. "The poll's results may mean an increase in social support for a continuation of policies of Solidarity-derived governments. Respondents are beginning to reconcile themselves with the notion that the election programs of the Democratic Left Alliance and the Polish Peasant Party were just part of the election game," write CBOS commentators in their concluding remarks. * * * The poll, entitled "Society's Position on Privatization After the First Six Months of Left-Wing Rule," was conducted between 14 and 18 April on a sample of 1,207 adult Poles.
