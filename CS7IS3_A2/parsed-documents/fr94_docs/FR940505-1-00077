FR940505-1-00077 FR940505-1-00012 Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(d) is based largely on draft guidance and model rules developed by members of the CARB/California Air Pollution Control Officers Association's (CAPCOA) Technical Review Group included in ``Reasonably Available Control Technology and Best Available Retrofit Control Technology (RACT/BARCT) for Adhesives and Sealants,'' as presented in a workshop on September 30, 1993. In addition, portions of the proposed FIP rule are based on Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) Regulation 8, Rule 51, Adhesive and Sealant Products; VCAPCD Rule 74.20, Adhesives and Sealants; and SCAQMD Rule 1168, Control of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from Adhesive Application. Evaluation of the environmental, economic, socioeconomic, and other impacts of the proposed FIP rule's requirements was partially based on the information provided in the BAAQMD and VCAPCD staff reports for their respective rules. As described in the technical support document, uncontrolled VOC emissions from affected facilities are projected to total 2.64 tpd in 1999 and 2.99 tpd in 2005. Implementation of this proposed rule is projected to reduce those emissions by 1.29 tpd and 1.47 tpd respectively at a cost of $890 per ton of VOC removed (1989 dollars). (f) Can and Coil Coating (Sacramento). Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(e) controls VOC emissions from certain metal container, metal closure, and metal coil coating operations in the Sacramento nonattainment area. Emission reductions are achieved by: (1) limiting the VOC content of various can and coil coatings; (2) allowing the use of add-on control equipment that achieves a 90 percent capture efficiency and 95 percent destruction or removal efficiency in lieu of meeting the VOC limits on coatings; and (3) restricting application of can and coil coatings to application methods and equipment with high transfer efficiencies. The proposed rule applies to facilities that apply coatings to metal containers, metal closures, and/or metal coils. Facilities that apply 1 gallon per day or less of spray coating, however, are exempt from the requirements of the proposed rule. Sacramento and Placer counties have implemented can and coil rules (SMAQMD Rule 452 and PCAPCD Rule 223) similar to this proposed FIP rule, although not as stringent. Currently, no sources exist in El Dorado and Sutter counties. Therefore, while the rule is proposed for implementation in the entire Sacramento ozone nonattainment area (as described in 40 CFR 81.305), most of the near-term emission reductions are projected to occur in Yolo and Solano counties. Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(e) is based largely on SCAQMD's Rule 1125, Metal Container, Closure, and Coil Coating Operations. Portions of the proposed FIP rule are based on the following: CARB's ``Determination of Reasonably Available Control Technology and Best Available Retrofit Control Technology (RACT/BARCT) for Metal Container, Closure and Coil Coating Operations'' (July 21, 1992); San Diego County Air Pollution Control District (SDAPCD) Rule 67.4, Metal Container, Closure, and Coil Coating Operations (1990); and SMAQMD Rule 452, Can Coating (August 21, 1990).
