The specialists gave the warning at a meeting here on the eve of the ``World Water Day.'' At the meeting, the specialists sounded the alarm with a series of figures. The average volume of water resources of Guangdong Province is about 186 billion cubic meters, ranking fifth in China, and the per capita volume is about 2,800 cubic meters, ranking tenth in China, 20 percent higher than the average for the whole country, but less than the world's average by one-third. The specialists pointed out that these water resources cannot be fully utilized because of extremely uneven distribution in terms of time and place. Each year, 80 percent of the water flows into the sea as floods, while the volume of water is very small in dry seasons. Zhanjiang is one of the five dry areas in China. Water pollution has intensified the contradiction between supply and demand of water resources. The water shortage will spread from coastal and economically developed areas to other areas except the ``Xi Jiang corridor.'' At present, the economic development of coastal areas such as Shanwei, Shenzhen, Zhanjiang, Honghai Bay, Daya Bay, Shangxiachuan Island, Hailing Island, Donghai Island, and Haian, have been seriously impeded by the shortage of water resources. In view of the increasingly serious crisis of water resources, the specialists urged the whole society to strengthen the sense of water, and to change the practice of using water at will and of using water free of charge. They called for unified planning for water resources, rational development and exploitation of water resources, saving water, and using market mechanisms to protect water resources.
