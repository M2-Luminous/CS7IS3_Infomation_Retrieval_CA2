Croats and Bosniaks discussed canton borders of the Federation, Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic said at the end of this morning's round of talks. The maps are still in front of the negotiators. Where is the solution? I think that we made an important step forward and our standpoints on central Bosnia are converging, Kresimir Zubak, the head of the Croat delegation from Bosnia-Herzegovina said, adding that the delegations are continuing to present their views on Herzegovina, and that the process of harmonization continues. It seems that the main reason why no agreement has yet been reached are the internal cantonal borders of the Bosniak-Croat Federation. [passage omitted]
