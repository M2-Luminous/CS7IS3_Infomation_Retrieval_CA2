Sosa said he does not favor controls, but the government is prepared to adopt any necessary measures. The minister made these statements during a news conference he held after being questioned by the Chamber of Deputies. [Begin Sosa recording] Such matters are being reviewed by the president at cabinet meetings. What I said was that when this kind of measure becomes necessary, it must be considered. What is happening, however, is that we are hoping that this will not become necessary. [end recording] The questioning took place as planned; that is, there were four rounds of questions. A total of 24 congressmen took the floor. At the session, Minister Sosa reviewed important aspects of the current economic and financial situation in the country. He said the government does not favor nationalizing the banks, but it has not ruled out the possibility. Referring to the eight financial institutions in which the government has intervened, the minister said that intervention boards have 30 days to decide whether these banks should be liquidated or restructured. He also spoke about privatization processes, noting that they are necessary to keep the state from suffering huge losses. He said he does not favor the privatizing of Venezuelan Petroleum or the Venezuelan Corporation of Guayana. He also discussed the disparity between assets and liabilities. He noted that the Central Bank of Venezuela must find a way to trim the shortfalls. The minister said nonrestructured foreign debt has risen to 250 billion bolivares, adding that this has produced domestic outlays of approximately 150 billion bolivares. After the session, "Union Radio News" consulted the various parliamentary factions to learn what their position would be on a censure vote. The social Christian Party and Democratic Action were cautious in their responses. They said they will wait until President Rafael Caldera speaks about this vote. Radical Cause, however, is maintaining its position in favor of a censure vote.
