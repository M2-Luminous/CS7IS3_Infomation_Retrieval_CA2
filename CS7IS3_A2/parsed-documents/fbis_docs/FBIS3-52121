"According to our information, President Mubarak, who is displeased with the disappearance of Mr. al-Kikhya, has given his orders to competent authorities to do all that is possible in order to clarify this matter," said Muhammad Jibril, who represents the National Front for the Salvation of Libya in Cairo. He said the Front had urged Mubarak to "adopt a firm stand" against the party responsible for the abduction of al-Kikhya, leader of the National Rally which is opposed to Libya's leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi. Jibril said the "silence" which had prevailed over the past week over al-Kikhya's case only encouraged al-Qadhdhafi to commit other similar acts against members of the opposition. The opposition had accused Libyan agents of kidnapping al-Kikhya who vanished on December 11 after leaving his hotel in Cairo where he was attending an Arab human rights conference. Libya denied last week any involvement in the affair, saying al-Kikhya was the victim of a feud between opposition groups. "This silence gives way to other regimes to kidnap or liquidate dissidents living in Egypt," Jibril added. The Egyptian president's political advisor, 'Usamah al-Baz, found no cooperation from Libyan officials during a visit to Tripoli on December 19 aimed at tracing the 63-year-old al-Kikhya, who was foreign minister under al-Qadhdhafi in the 1970s and represented Libya at the United Nations between 1976 and 1980.
