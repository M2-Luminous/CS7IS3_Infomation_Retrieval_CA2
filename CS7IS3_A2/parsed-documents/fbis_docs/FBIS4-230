Independent Electoral Commission Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler said in a statement on Tuesday [5 April] he had reported the working committee's conclusion to State President F W de Klerk, the Transitional Executive Council, African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela and kwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi. "The IEC has indicated that in the light of the report, political measures were required. As such measures fell outside its brief, the IEC, as in the past, did not make any proposals," the judge said. The IEC is nevertheless continuing with its planning of elections in the province as a whole, and envisages providing the optimal level of voting facilities possible in those areas unaffected by the political climate in kwaZulu." He said the effect of the recently-proclaimed state of emergency in kwaZulu/Natal could not be gauged as yet, but the IEC anticipated it would "significantly contribute to the performance of its mandate". An in-depth study was under way and would be followed by an inspection in loco by two IEC commissioners later this week. They would report to the full commission on April 9. Mr Justice Kriegler said the working group, set up on March 28, consisted of heads of relevant kwaZulu government departments, representatives of the South African Department of Home Affairs, the South African Police and the IEC. He said the working committee gave the following reasons for its assessment that an election was not feasible in kwaZulu: - "the high level of political intolerance and fear, as well as large-scale intimidation, which factors have led to the current state of emergency; - "the kwaZulu civil service and tribal structures/authorities are, at present, unable to fully assist the process for a free and fair election; - "due to time constraints, the IEC will not be able to follow the prescribed protocol required to confirm, evaluate, and secure the voting stations; (and), - "the South African Police and the kwaZulu Police do not foresee that they will be in a position in the present political climate to adequately ensure that the elections are free and fair. This is due to the additional demands on its manpower resources relating to the level of violence (present as well as future), normal policing duties and normal election-related duties."
