The company, co-financed by the Tianjin port and a container firm of the Republic of Korea, is the thirtieth joint venture to be built in the port. The port now has eight container berths capable of handling over one million containers yearly. The container turnover time has been shortened to 21 days from the previous 45 days due to a land-and-water coordinated transport system with more than 120 inland container relay stations built in Baotou, Zhengzhou, Xian, Chengdu, Yinchuan and Lanzhou cities. The company has opened over 50 water routes for scheduled container shipments to more than 160 countries and regions around the world.
