According to the head of state, when deciding about the individual candidates, what voters must weigh up is whether they have served well the interests of their immediate communities and whether their private lives are in order. The president of the Republic, in his speech on radio tonight, thought it important to stress that no one can question the voters' choice of party. Arpad Goncz hopes that as a result of the elections, a government will be formed which enjoys the trust of the majority of citizens, but which also takes minority opinions into consideration, one that fosters the national traditions and that is ready for interest coordination, and one that strives for social justice. The head of state affirmed that for his part he will do everything in order that Hungary should have a parliament that is ready to serve and a government that observes freedom, the well-being and prosperity of every person, as well as the vital interests of all Hungarians.
