To be registered, the group must win over six people. In an interview with Interfax, the group's co-chairman Yevgeniy Bushmin said two more members of RC -- Rashid Ismaghilov and Vladimir Yuzhakov -- are negotiating to switch over as well. And, according to Bushmin, one or two members of the New Regional Politics group could be expected to join the "Decembrists" ranks. Bushmin refused to identify these. Another leader of the December 12 Union group, Irina Khakamada, told Interfax she was dissatisfied with the RC's decision to show understanding if some of its members sided with the Decemebr 12 Union group. In Khakamada's view, the RC could have moved to help Decenber 12 devotees by campaigning for their official recognition and rights as a group in parliament. On Friday Gennadiy Burbulis also announced his decision to leave the Russia's Choice group.
