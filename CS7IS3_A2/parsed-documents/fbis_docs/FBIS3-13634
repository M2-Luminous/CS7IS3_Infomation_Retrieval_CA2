According to U.S. Embassy Information Service here Wednesday, at a meeting in Washington convened for specialists on non-proliferation issues, Carter said that the United States, would like to control the export of "everything" to Iran and Iraq. Explaining the Clinton Adminstration's Counter-Proliferation Initiative (CPI), he noted that Defence Secretary Perry and Central Intelligence Agency Director Woolsey will announce soon the new position of a deputy director for military support at the CIA's Counter-Proliferation Centre. In the past, he explained, too much of Pentagon's counter-proliferation focus had been on characterizing and cataloguing individual nation's weapons program. In the future, the official suggested, the focus will be on what actions to take after certain countries acquire weapons of mass destruction.
