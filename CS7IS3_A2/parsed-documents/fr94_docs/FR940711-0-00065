FR940711-0-00065 FR940711-0-00019 Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;103&hyph;441 (30 CFR 764.17), hearing requirements for designating areas unsuitable for coal mining and reclamation operations, Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;731.760 (30 CFR 779.24, 779.25, and 780.14 for surface mining, and 783.24, 783.25, and 784.23 for underground mining), permit application cross sections and maps showing hydrologic information, and Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;323.310 (30 CFR 785.19), special areas of mining, specifically alluvial valley floors. Because the proposed revisions to these previously-approved Utah rules are nonsubstantive in nature, the Director finds that these proposed Utah rules are no less effective than the Federal regulations. The Director approves these proposed rules. 2. Substantive Revisions to Utah's Rules That Are Substantively Identical to the Corresponding Provisions of the Federal Regulations In a parenthetical note, existing Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;524.661 (1) incorporates by reference Figure 1 in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 817.67, which shows the maximum allowable ground vibration for blasting operations, (2) cites its administrative procedures statute at UCA 63&hyph;46a&hyph;3(7)(a) as the authority for incorporating this figure into its rules, and (3) indicates that the figure can be viewed in the Division's office. Utah proposed to delete the reference to its statutory authority for incorporating the figure from the Federal regulations into its rules. This deletion does not render Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;524.661 less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.67(d)(4)(i). In fact, the proposed State rule includes requirements that are substantively identical to the requirements of the Federal regulation. Therefore, the Director approves the proposed rule. 3. Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112, Scope of Rulemaking and Promulgation of Rules Utah proposed to delete Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112&hyph;100, relating to scope of rulemaking. The effect of this proposed deletion on the Utah program is nonsubstantive because (1) this rule only generally described Utah's authority to promulgate rules for its statutes and (2) the concepts contained in this rule are repeated with more specificity at Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112&hyph;200, which Utah proposed to recodify as Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112.
