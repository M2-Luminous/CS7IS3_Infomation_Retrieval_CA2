These deliberations have been going on for some time now. Government and party officials view this congress as the one preceding the succession of Papandreou and see it as an important one for the future direction of PASOK. A crucial factor in developments is the health of National Economy and Finance Minister Yeoryios Yennimatas, who has apparently been forced to withdraw from the contest. A large gap has apparently been created, because he was considered the favorite in the contest to succeed Papandreou. Yennimatas' health gave an opportunity to other "hopefuls" for this position within the government to assert their views and policies on the current economic policy and, thus, automatically appear as possible successors. Some of the names mentioned include Alternate National Economy Minister Ioannis Papandoniou and PASOK Deputy Ioannis Pottakis. However, only Commerce and Industry Minister Konstandinos Simitis can be considered to be politically close to Yennimatas; he is probably excluded because he does not want to move to Sindagma Square [government headquarters]. PASOK officials' interests are centered on the congress. Through their moves, which began some time ago, they seek to gain favor with party organizations and, if possible, gain friendly delegates at the congress. Reports note that Interior Minister Akis Tzokhatzopoulos, who is secretary of PASOK's Central Committee, has had, until now, sufficient support and access to all organizations. National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis is far behind and does not have access to all organizations. Furthermore, his past also works against him because he was once removed from PASOK. A decisive role in developments will be played by the many people closely associated to Yennimatas. Their interest, of course, is centered on the alliances that will be formed before the congress. Konstandinos Laliotis; environment, town planning, and public works minister; does not appear to have any such aspirations. It should also be noted that he frequently differs with Tzokhatzopoulos on issues such as public works and flood prevention. As things stand right now, it is estimated that the contest will be between Tzokhatzopoulos and Simitis. Anyway, the road is still long and the stance of Papandreou, who controls the time when succession will be discussed, will certainly be decisive. It is a well-known secret that from Maximos Palace, Papandreou looks at the presidential palace next door with interest. The distance, anyway, is small....
