In 1990, shortly after the collapse of the communist system, Stasi members tried to sell gold worth up to 2 billion German marks [DM]. Investigations are now under way as to what happened to the money. A secret note by the Federal Intelligence Service (BND) revealed the following: The Stasi cover company Impag offered the Swiss company Jenzen AG 50-100 tonnes of gold. At the time the gold was deposited with "West European banks." The Stasi submitted the following offer: "The delivery will be carried out in the form of 12.5-kg bars." The market value of the gold was DM1.05 billion to DM2.1 billion. The Stasi offered a discount of 10 percent of the gold price quoted at the stock exchange to obtain the money quickly. Strangely enough, the secret document has disappeared in the safes in Bonn. Investigations are not being carried out.
