In a press statement, Bangko Sentral [Central Bank] Governor Gabriel C. Singson said the move "marks another important step in foreign exchange liberalization." Considered the most successful mode of easing the country's debt burden, the debt-to-equity program has historically accounted for about 30 percent of the total external debt which has undergone restructuring. Debt converted under the program reached $1.87 billion out of the total $6.382 billion recorded from 1986 to 1993, the Bangko Sentral's 1993 annual report shows. The debt-to-equity program was launched in 1985 as a mechanism to reduce the country's external debt and to encourage the entry of the then elusive foreign investments. Under the program, investors are allowed to buy Philippine debt papers, redeem these at a higher price and invest the proceeds in eligible projects. The investor gains from the spread between the redemption price at which he sells the paper to the Bangko Sentral and the price at which he buys it from the secondary market. The program also augurs well for the Bangko Sentral as it is able to retire its debt at deep discounts. The mechanism was revised in 1990 particularly to retire the then Central Bank's $900-million outstanding obligations to foreign banks over a three-year period which ended last year. The MB decided to defer the program in September 1993 due to low investors' interest during the eight auctions as a result of the steadily declining discounts on Philippine debt paper in the secondary market. The MB, however, resumed the program's implementation in January this year. At present, outstanding registered foreign investments under the program amount to about $398 million. Prior to the liberalization, investments under the conversion program were subject to a restrictive repayment schedule. "Principal capital originally could not be repatriated except on a five-year staggered basis commencing not earlier than three or five years after the original investment was made, depending on whether it is classified as preferred or less preferred investment. For a less preferred investment, dividends were also subject to a four-year freeze period," the Bangko Sentral said. Mr. Singson said the move was likewise aimed at easing the continuing upsurge in dollar inflows which has been buoying up the peso exchange value since the first quarter of this year. With the dwindling amount of foreign investments utilizing the debt-to-equity approach, some bankers doubted whether the volume of dollars that will be siphoned out from the system via the scheme will be that significant. A chief executive officer of one of the resident foreign banks in the country told BUSINESS WORLD while the move sends a positive signal to foreign investors, it remains to be seen whether others at this stage would want to sell out with the relaxation in the repayment of dividends. "It usually takes time to find corporate buyers so the reaction time will be long," he said.
