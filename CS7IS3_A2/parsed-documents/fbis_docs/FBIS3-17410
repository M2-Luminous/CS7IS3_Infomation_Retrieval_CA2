Speaking at a news conference in Moscow Thursday, Shokhin pointed out that his appointment would be followed by a reshuffle in the government. His consultations with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin within the next few days will focus on such spheres as economics, finances and external economic relations, including those with former Soviet republics. Shokhin added that no one had relieved him of his duties as Russia's representative at the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and that he would supervise these issues in future. He also said that until he was appointed as vice prime minister it was the prime minister who directly supervised the financial and economic spheres. However, Chernomyrdin had come to the conclusion that this was too difficult considering the huge number of other problems, he said. Shokhin said that reformists who had left the government, such as Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov, did not believe that the government would convince the IMF to grant Russia the second part of the systematic reconstruction credit worth $1.5 Bn. Nevertheless, Chernomyrdin had succeeded, Shokhin said. Shokhin pointed out that strict credit and financial policies consistent with IMF requirements required the annulment or suspension of a number of social programs with consent by the parliament. The programs, worth a total of Rbs [rubles ] 90 Tn, grant privileges and subsidies to enterprises, regions and some social groups. Shokhin said that the groups included residents of Russia's northernmost areas, servicemen and policemen. He put special emphasis on the fact that it was necessary to involve social and political mechanisms to smooth the effects of this measure as much as possible in the form of a social accord treaty to implement the decision.
