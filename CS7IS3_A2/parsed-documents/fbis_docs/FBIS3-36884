Dotsuk: "We Shall Not Divide Into `Ours' and `Theirs'; place and date not given] [Text] [Dotsuk] Nursultan Abishevich, in a recent speech you said that 1994 will be a turning point for the better for Kazakhstan. Yet the start of the year has already been marked by soaring prices, inflation, and a decline in the tenge exchange rate. In speaking of imminent economic stabilization, what are you relying on -- specific calculations and reassuring figures on the course of economic reform, or your intuition as a politician? [Nazarbayev] I am sure that this year will be a turning point for Kazakhstan. This is no prediction caused by some flash of illumination. It is based primarily on the real advances achieved in the course of economic reforms. Despite many difficulties and stoppages and even setbacks, the reforms are proceeding and are producing tangible results. The main thing is that the structure of our economy is being restricted on the move. Last year, with an overall decline in industrial production, three-fourths of all enterprises nonetheless found a way out of the labyrinth of the crisis and ensured an increase in physical volumes...in the majority of cases, by developing new commodities: ferromanganese, arc-welded pipes, welding rods, dozens of types of equipment, chemical output, structural and construction materials, television sets, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, and audio and video equipment. We have even begun the production of Kazakhstani automobiles, albeit only in small batches for the time being. So, while the production of weapons--in which the Soviet Union used to trade--or other output for which there is no market is being wound down, we do not greatly regret it. We will give our attention and support to those who, working for Kazakhstan's needs, consistently restructure themselves and adapt to market conditions. Of course, all this still does not attest to the existence of a mixed economy. But for Kazakhstan, where only yesterday the public consciousness did not even allow the idea that we could produce complex electronically based equipment for ourselves and where even people of the older generation, in contrast, for instance, to the Baltic countries, had no idea of what private ownership was, taking such a step forward in less than two years is undoubtedly an achievement. As for inflation and a certain decline in the tenge exchange rate, we did take all that into account beforehand. It would be naive to say that we can immediately acquire a very hard currency. After all, the same thing is happening with the ruble and the currencies of the other CIS countries. [Dotsuk] You have always said that sovereignty is not an end in itself, that the main thing is a real improvement in people's lives. Tell me, Nursultan Abishevich, have you even once regretted that the Kazakhstan Government did not agree to Russia's "constraining" terms and decided to leave the ruble zone? [Nazarbayev] Any state signing particular interstate agreements assumes the determination of the obligations to the other side. Part of its sovereignty is thus delegated to it. Many conditions, including "constraining" ones, as you call them, can be accepted if they will bring prosperity and help to introduce new technology and so forth. If it were Japan, for instance, why should we not waive some principles for the sake of the people's welfare. But Russia itself is having a hard time right now, and it can hardly consider Kazakhstan's interests in some way. The conditions set by A. Shokhin were unacceptable to us. He openly asked us to leave the ruble zone, and we knew that this was an IMF recommendation. In brief, we have no claims against Russia. Ultimately, every state must decide its own financial problems freely and independently. Ultimately, the CIS countries should reach a supranational currency that will circulate in the CIS. I would very much like this to take less than 30 years, as it did in West Europe. [Dotsuk] Nursultan Abishevich, the "Russian theme" has become more acute in the Republic now.... [Nazarbayev] I will be frank: This subject is artificially being made acute. I will immediately note that I do not accept a concept like the "Russian-speaking population." Who among us is not a Russian speaker? After all, all Kazakhstan speaks Russian, including 99 percent of Kazakhs. And if we do accept this term willy nilly, then we have to include in it representatives of the more than 100 ethnic groups living in Kazakhstan -- Germans, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Greek, Koreans, Dungane.... And the context in which this term has usually been used recently in no way reflects their national interests. They say that the Kazakh language is driving out Russian, primarily in the educational system. But is that the case? Right now, 270,000 students are studying in Russian in Kazakhstan, which is 78 percent of the total number. More than 57 percent of the schoolchildren learn only in Russian in Kazakhstan--and that is all with Kazakh as the official language in the Republic. You must realize that the relevant constitutional norm was introduced by no means as a formal sign of statehood but primarily because the language of the Kazakhs in their motherland was on the verge of disappearing. The state's duty and our human duty is to prevent that. Before speaking of migration, let's make a small digression into the history of this question. The point is that the Kazakhs' ancient land has always received for various reasons -- historical, political and social -- representatives of various peoples, mainly from the European part of Russia. Since the days of Ivan the Terrible and Petr I "fugitives" appeared in our land. Later migration began to acquire the nature of Russian state policy connected with the creation of a convenient bridgehead for military and economic penetration to the East. The first mass wave of migrants included peasants from every corner of Russia -- victims of land repartition, cossacks called to defend the frontiers of the empire. It was then that the "Cossack lines" -- the Ural, Siberian, and Gorkiy lines passing across the Kazakhs' land -- emerged. The second large wave of Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Polish immigrants was caused by Stolypin's land reforms and the desire to drag our territories into this overall repartitioning. At that time nearly 2 million people moved to Kazakhstan. And finally just recently masses of volunteers poured into Kazakhstan to develop the virgin lands and to work at the "construction sites of the century." That was in fact the third and largest stage in migration to Kazakhstan. It was then that the demographic situation which in principle has persisted to this day was determined. Naturally, people came to us with different aims and feelings. Whereas the settlers of the first waves tried above all to attach themselves to the land and to farm, the latter came with a purely worldly aim -- earning money and going back home. Naturally, for the deported peoples the desire to return home was generally foremost. But irrespective of whom cam here and how, by no means the least and perhaps even the first part in determining that Kazakhstan became their home was played by the Kazakh nation and its traditional qualities like openness, hospitality, and good-neighborliness. What, ultimately, is the crime of the Kazakhs, more than one-third of whom died during the enforced collectivization and who have remained a minority in their own motherland? Is it worth mentioning that the majority of those who came to Kazakhstan left they were the "masters of their lives" here since for them the entire Soviet Union (read -- Russia) was their home. But with the enormous country's collapse many stereotypes began to change. And naturally, many people began to feel they were abroad. There was a revival of the view that their stay on our land was temporary and there was a desire to return. But has this phenomenon--which is entirely natural, given all our upheavals--become a massive and overwhelming one? I shall cite figures on this score which are by no means exhaustive. Last year, more than 200,000 Russians left Kazakhstan. That is undoubtedly a lot and was a great loss for Kazakhstan. But we must also mention something else: Migration flows in both directions have never ceased. Even in the "prosperous" 1980's, 80,000 to 100,000 people left Kazakhstan every year and slightly more came. Last year, too, nearly 160,000 Russians moved permanently to the Republic. And they were Russians! And only about 60,000 of them were from regions that, to put it mildly, are not distinguished by their stability. We must also consider that after the creation of Kazakhstan's own armed forces a large number of servicemen left Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan's army is small and officers together with their units naturally left the Republic. But it is wrong to speak of some gigantic flow of refugees from Kazakhstan unless, of course, you are setting yourself a particular aim. There are no refugees at all, there is freedom for each person to choose his place of residence. Those are two different things. And we receive openly those who come to us. The amendments which I recently made to the law on citizenship, taking advantage of my additional powers, were indeed connected with simplifying the procedure for taking citizenship when members of the families of Kazakhstanis move to the republic, and not only for them. Of course, I do not say that there are no problems in this matter, particularly problems connected with the tyranny of bureaucrats who, incidentally, forget their national feelings when there is extortion and bribery (a Kazakh takes money from a Kazakh, a Russian from a Russian). Russian citizens probably are also aware of this. I am very worried by the departure of Germans. More Germans than Russians have left the republic. I understand the feelings of people seeking to return to their historical homeland, especially as the majority did not come to Kazakhstan at their own wish. But in talks with Germany's leaders I always raise questions of expanding the presence of German business in Kazakhstan. We have plenty of land. You only have to work, to raise children, to make your family's life a prosperous one. And do you need dual citizenship under these conditions? You ask what danger it presents to Kazakhstan. It does not present a danger to the Kazakhs! You cannot split the multinational Kazakhstan society into two parts. You cannot have "ours" and "theirs." I suggested and continue to suggest a simple and feasible way out of the situation: When he moves to Russia let a person freely acquire its citizenship. If you come to live in Kazakhstan, you acquire Kazakhstan citizenship. And even better, introduce within the CIS framework a common document enabling people to live wherever they like irrespective of citizenship. And then the question of "dual citizenship" will disappear of its own accord. [Dotsuk] How is the situation with the CIS taking shape today? Do you believe that formation is still promising? [Nazarbayev] I have never considered it unpromising, otherwise I would not have put forward so many initiatives for the integration, primarily the economic integration, of our states. The recent meeting in Ashgabat confirmed that the further we go in different directions the more rapidly we will feel the need to unite. It seems to me that there are enough signed documents regulating work and mutual cooperation within the CIS to see us through to the end of the century and it is now time to fill work with specific content, unraveling, albeit slowly, but nonetheless painstakingly, the knots of contradictions which emerged largely artificially over the past two years. I do not know, perhaps someone does not like talk of a single economic area but I have long been suggesting to all neighbors that they remove all customs barriers and open up their borders. By all means, let us sign a treaty. [Dotsuk] Previously, when the officials of two governments could not agree on particular issues, you and Yeltsin would intervene and the problems would be resolved. Recently, Yeltsin does not seem to be "playing up" to Kazakhstan very much. Should we think that your personal relations with him have cooled? [Nazarbayev] I am surprised, although I can imagine why you reached that conclusion. Boris Nikolayevich complained that, in terms of resolving mutual economic problems unskillfully, our governments, ministries, and departments were putting us in an awkward position, and he was right. After all, how many meetings, talks, and agreements there have been. We met six times last year just to discuss the ruble zone! We still did not achieve anything. And the heads of state seemed to be guilty here. In general, the bureaucrats have not resolved anything, not even after our summit meetings, when we reached the same opinion on many issues. And the economy is starting to live increasingly by market rules and not by orders from above. We maintain relations constantly and consult each other on a very broad range of problems. Only for some reason the press has stopped reporting that a telephone conversation has taken place between the presidents on a particular topic. [Dotsuk] In connection with the abolition of the ruble zone can it be said that Russian-Kazakhstani relations have nonetheless become more complex? [Nazarbayev] I would not draw that conclusion. It has already been reported that we and Russia have concluded a treaty on mutual payments in the fuel and energy complex. None of us owes anyone anything. We and Russia are equally interested in strictly observing our treaty commitments. There are also other mutual decisions -- treaties are being prepared on military cooperation and joint space projects. Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin's visit to Kazakhstan was fruitful. The talks on the ruble zone belong to yesterday. [Dotsuk] A few words about Russian-Kazakh relations in the sphere of military cooperation. The situation is obvious: Unless Kazakhstan and Russia sign a treaty on military-political cooperation and documents on the joint use of former strategic projects, both sides will lose out -- Russia is deprived of bases for scientific and military tests and for Kazakhstan these test ranges become a heavy burden since the republic cannot cope with them alone. Is Kazakhstan prepared for serious compromise steps to preserve existing unique military-technical complexes? [Nazarbayev] Compromise presupposes mutual concessions, not unilateral ones. Kazakhstan has always stated its readiness to resolve all problems with Russia on mutually advantageous terms. Of course, the military complexes that have been created have an enormous scientific and technical potential. And we shall preserve it -- on an equal basis with Russia or independently. But here we must consider that the Baykonur test ranges and cosmodrome in Kazakhstan occupy enormous territories. Approximately as much territory as the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and the former GDR taken together -- over 13 million hectares of land artificially removed from economic circulation. In addition the military regularly occupied a further 3.5 million hectares of agricultural land for their experiments. And one can understand people's attitude toward these mostly lethal establishments. We know that the fuel for the "Proton" booster rocket contains a highly toxic component like heptyl, which is in the top danger category. So after launching, the missile's separated stages with this heptyl simply fall from the sky onto the ground and are no birthday present to the local inhabitants. We must calculate the size of the territories polluted by this poison. [Dotsuk] Are you not troubled that when Clinton came to the CIS he met with all the "nuclear" presidents except the Kazakhstan president? [Nazarbayev] My talks with Clinton lie ahead. IN the very near future I am to make an official visit to the United States at the U.S. President's invitation. And I am not troubled by this fact for the simple reason that I had a thorough discussion of questions of nuclear arms in the CIS with Albert Gore during his visit to Kazakhstan. We also talked of the subject of William Clinton's talks in Moscow. In addition back in December last year our parliament ratified the decision to accede to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty without outside pressure. And it was these problems that the U.S. President was discussing with Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. There was no need for Kazakhstan to attend. In conclusion, I want to wish all Russians and KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA readers and journalists happiness, prosperity, and health. I would like you always to be objective and to describe in a balanced and well-intentioned way how people are living throughout the world, including in our country -- the Republic of Kazakhstan.
