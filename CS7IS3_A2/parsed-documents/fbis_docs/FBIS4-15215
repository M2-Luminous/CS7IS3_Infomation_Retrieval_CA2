Mikhail Poltoranin, chairman of the Intelligence Policy Committee of the State Duma, said in an interview with Kyodo News Service in Tokyo that the new group will help prevent Russian democratic forces from being splintered. The State Duma is the 450-member lower house of the Russian parliament. The group will consist of Poltoranin, former Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar, former State Secretary Gennadiy Burbulis and other reformist politicians, he said. The establishment of the new group will be pushed to help accomplish Yeltsin's recent proposal to have the Russian parliament adopt a declaration committing all political forces to seek to achieve national reconciliation, he said. Poltoranin said he is convinced that Yeltsin will agree to join the new group, saying the president is aware that he has drawn his political strength chiefly from reformist politicians. "The president is aware that his support base comes from reformists and he would end up losing his power if he lost their support," he said. Poltoranin dismissed as false propaganda the rumors that the health of Yeltsin has deteriorated to a level so bad as to make it difficult for him to engage in his presidential duties.
