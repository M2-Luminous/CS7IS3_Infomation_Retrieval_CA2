The "weekly report for company management," published by the Expansion publishing company, pointed out that the government has established a strategy toward pacification which stresses reforms and dialogue." But the report warned about signs that "the government has not yet decided on a unified line of action and the skirmishes among political groups linked with the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI, official) and the government are reason for concern." In that framework, which was created by the emergence of the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) on 1 January in the southern State of Chiapas, TEF indicated that "for now the financial outlook seems stable and optimistic, but that unknown events in the near future might change this stability." TEF specialists noted that current "financial analyses are underestimating the weight that political events are going to have on the economy during 1994." They pointed out that if the political strategy had "efficient and relatively speedy results," the government would have "a wide margin to maneuver to preserve economic reform and prevent 1994 economic policy objectives from being altered." They added that the economic objectives include overcoming inflation, encouraging a "microeconomic" revolution, and reactivating the economy in accordance with healthy public finances, stable exchange, and an orthodox monetary policy. They warned that "to change the economic policy in response to the Chiapas conflict would be suicidal: to throw overboard all that has been achieved, running the very high risk of causing political instability." TEF analysts also believe that it is possible for Mexico to close 1994 with a 6.5-percent inflation rate, 1.5 percent over official estimates, and with a 2.5-percent growth in GNP, that is half a point below the official figures. According to TEF, there are skirmishes among "groups close" to PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio because of the importance that Manuel Camacho, the commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas who was one of Colosio's rivals for the PRI nomination, now has. TEF added that there is "clear evidence of conflict in government circles between 'doves' (conciliators) and 'hawks' (intransigents), not only regarding the Chiapas conflict, but regarding whether or not there should be an opening in the political system. Which line will prevail and at what expense?" The publication said that "it seems possible that, even if its definitive solution takes a while, the Chiapas conflict remains isolated in the national scenery and that an `epidemic' which might spread to other poor areas of the country is not likely. However, this possibility will be very costly and it will influence -- we do not know to what extent -- the political strategy of Salinas' successor." President Salinas appointed Colosio as the PRI candidate, but according to analysts, following the emergence of the guerrillas, Colosio "has begun to `appear' as a weak candidate, and the skirmishes and pressures among PRI members are undeniable."
