Banco del Cafe, Inc. and the Central American Bank of Economic Integration (BCIE) recently signed a loan agreement for $1 million for projects to bolster production activities of agricultural enterprises, industries, tourism, and small and medium-sized businesses. This is the fourth loan signed with Banco del Cafe in less than a year, thereby bringing total financing to $5.5 million.

After analyzing the contents of the agreements with creditor countries, the Monetary Board concluded that the terms will not adversely affect the balance of payments or the money in circulation in the country. Willy Zapata, president of the Central Bank and the Monetary Board, noted that the negotiations are in their final phase and that it is estimated that they will conclude in late March. Because of the crisis of the 1980's, the country was left without reserves and was forced to suspend its foreign debt payments. Last year, it was allowed to renegotiate its overdue debts through negotiations with the Paris Club. In these renegotiations, the creditor countries gave Guatemala 20 years to pay its debt with a 10-year grace period. "This means that Guatemala will begin paying its debt in the year 2003," Zapata remarked.

With this second disbursement, the amount the IDB has given Guatemala totals $122 million of the $132 million in loans agreed upon. The remaining $10 million will be disbursed within a few months. The modernization program is aimed at making credit to Guatemalans more readily available through the banks. It also seeks "to expand the operations of the national financial system to promote capital flow and credit to all sectors and to people who want to participate in the country's development."
