FBIS4-13193 "drnes075yy_94005" FBIS-NES-94-075 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Arab-Israeli Talks PLO, Israeli Negotiators Continue Cairo Meetings PLO, Israeli Negotiators Continue Cairo Meetings Developments in Talks Updated JN1804175494 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Arabic 1430 GMT 18 Apr 94 JN1804175494 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Arabic BFN [Report from the "With the Events" feature] [Text] The Israeli-Palestinian talks within the context of the Security and Civilian Affairs Committees continued in Cairo today. To learn the latest developments in this regard, let us move to our correspondent 'Umar Zaydani [in Cairo]: [Begin recording] [Zaydani] The security talks held between Israel and the PLO today primarily addressed the issue of security, prisoners, and the repatriation of deportees. Muhammad Dahlan [the PLO delegate in charge of the prisoners' issue] informed us that the Palestinians are demanding the release of 8,300 prisoners. Last week, it was agreed that only 5,000 prisoners would be released. The talks have continued regardless of the statements being made by either Hamas or the Israelis, Dahlan noted. Reports have revealed a willingness on the part of Hamas to halt violence in return for a halt to the pursuit of Hamas personnel by the Israeli security authorities. [Dahlan] I am not interested in what Hamas or the Israelis are saying. We are negotiating the release of all prisoners. [Zaydani] [Words indistinct] [Dahlan] No, there are no [words indistinct] or (?bargains) over the prisoners currently under way. The number of the prisoners whose release we demand stands at 8,300. [Zaydani] Muhammad Dahlan also informed us that six deportees will be repatriated tomorrow, and 10 others will be repatriated on 21 April. Among the deportees who will return from Libya and Algeria are Salih Abu-Sa'id and Nasim al-Farrah. Moreover, the Legal Committee resumed its meetings today. Progress was made in the deliberations of this committee. The Israelis submitted a working paper, whereas the Palestinians submitted another working paper during the deliberations of this committee. The two papers are currently being addressed, as Khalid al-Qidrah, head of the Palestinian delegation to the Legal Committee, said: [Al-Qidrah] We cannot speak of differences right now. The Palestinian and Israeli working papers are being debated and negotiated. God willing, there is progress. I do not want to delve into details. But, indeed, there is progress. [Zaydani] With regard to the negotiations on the launching of a Palestinian radio and television station, these negotiations were interrupted for some time soon after they had been started. This was because the Palestinian side backed down on an initial agreement reached in this regard in Cairo in February. Radwan Abu-'Ayyash [Palestinian negotiator in radio and television affairs] left the negotiations for consultations with Nabil Sha'th. As for (Shlomo Vax), he informed (Gabi Johar) of the differences with the Palestinians. These differences concern the extent and scope of the frequencies to be used by the Palestinians. They also concern the range of these frequencies. Unless the Palestinian back down on these demands, the Palestinians will not have a Palestinian radio and television station. A source close to the Israeli delegation informed us that Israel is willing to meet the Palestinian demands regarding all that concerns the radio and television station. The Israelis are also willing to meet demands regarding frequencies for civilian communication equipment and police communications equipment. However, the Palestinians also want frequencies for airports and ports, something not enshrined in the agreement. [end recording]
