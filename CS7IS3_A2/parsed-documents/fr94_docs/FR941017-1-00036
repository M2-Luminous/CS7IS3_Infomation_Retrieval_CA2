FR941017-1-00036 FR941017-1-00008 50 CFR Part 675 [Docket No. 941089&hyph;4289; I.D. 092694A] RIN 0648&hyph;AF02 Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Proposed rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This proposed rule would implement Amendment 21a to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI), and would prohibit the use of trawl gear in specified areas surrounding the Pribilof Islands. This action is necessary to protect areas of biological importance to certain crab stocks and to reduce interference with seabird and marine mammal populations. It is intended to promote the objectives of the FMP. DATES: Comments must be submitted by November 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be sent to Ronald J. Berg, Chief, Fisheries Management Division, Alaska Region, NMFS, P.O. Box 21668, Juneau, AK 99802 Attn: Lori Gravel, or delivered to the Federal Building, 709 West 9th Street, Juneau, AK. Copies of Amendment 21a and the environmental assessment/regulatory impact review (EA/RIR) prepared for the amendment are available from the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, P.O. Box 103136, Anchorage, AK 99510, telephone: 907&hyph;271&hyph;2809. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ellen R. Varosi, 907&hyph;586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Fishing for groundfish by U.S. vessels in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the BSAI is managed by NMFS according to the FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI. The FMP was prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. ) (Magnuson Act), and is implemented by regulations governing the U.S. groundfish fisheries at 50 CFR parts 675 and 676. General regulations that pertain to U.S. fisheries are codified at 50 CFR part 620. This action proposes regulations to implement Amendment 21a to the FMP. If approved, this amendment would prohibit the use of trawl gear in specified areas of the EEZ surrounding the Pribilof Islands. A description of, and reasons for, the proposed measures are presented below. Fishing for groundfish using trawl gear is authorized in the waters off St. Paul, St. George, Walrus, and Otter Islands (Pribilof Islands area) under regulations at 50 CFR part 675. In addition to providing habitat for commercially important groundfish, the Pribilof Islands area provides the necessary habitat for blue king crab, juvenile groundfish, Korean hair crab, marine mammals, seabirds, and their prey species. The rocky benthic habitat immediately surrounding the Pribilof Islands area provides essential food resources and protection for juvenile crab and fish species, which are prey species for marine mammals and seabirds. NMFS trawl surveys indicate that during 1975, the historic estimated abundance of blue king crab in the Pribilof Islands area decreased significantly. During 1980&hyph;1992, the abundance decreased from 106 million animals to 10 million animals, according to the estimates obtained from NMFS trawl surveys. Unlike other crab species, blue king crab populations do not extend uniformly across the Bering Sea shelf, but are found in isolated populations located in waters surrounding the Pribilof, St. Matthew, and St. Lawrence Islands. As a result of the decrease in crab abundance, commercial crab fisheries in the Pribilof Islands area have not been authorized since 1987. Continued trawling under the current FMP for groundfish in the Pribilof Islands area could jeopardize the recovery of depressed blue king crab stocks and the productivity of marine resources living in this habitat. The Pribilof Islands area contributes an essential food resource of prey species that allows for optimal foraging and breeding opportunities for marine resources dependent on the habitat in this area. Fish, crab, seabird, and marine mammal populations are dependent on the habitat that the Pribilof Islands area provides. Although sea lions and red-legged kittiwakes are listed as a threatened species and as a candidate for threatened species, respectively, this action would further protect these species. The northern fur seal is listed as depleted under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. During the breeding season, approximately two-thirds of the northern fur seal population, and an estimated 88 and 92 percent of red-legged kittiwakes and Alaskan thick-billed murre, respectively, breed in the Pribilof Islands area. The Pribilof Islands area also provides the rocky habitat necessary to protect fish and crab populations during their juvenile stages. In 1989, the Central Bering Sea Fishermen's Association initiated a proposal to establish areas closed to trawling in the Pribilof Islands area. The intent of this proposal was to protect this unique habitat and ecosystem so that it could contribute long-term benefits to the fisheries surrounding the waters of the Pribilof Islands area. At its meeting in September 1991, the Council requested that an analysis be prepared to identify those areas needing protection. The State of Alaska Department of Fish and Game prepared a draft EA/RIR for that proposal. The Pribilof Islands habitat conservation area was determined by the Council at its April 1992 meeting, based on an analysis of the distribution of crab and groundfish species.
