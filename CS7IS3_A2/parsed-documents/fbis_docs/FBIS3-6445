Hata is scheduled to visit Russia on 19 March. According to the disclosure, Japan plans to extend $60 million in aid in two stages to help promote reform in Russia. In the first stage, $40 million is to be used for specific projects. The main feature of the aid program is the opening of a "Research Center for Education on Japanese Business Management" (tentative name) to be utilized for a business management course under the Moscow University's economics department. The purpose of the research center is to teach Russian students about Japanese business management and financial know-how, among other topics. Approximately $10 million is to be appropriated for the research center's construction. The aid program is aimed at promoting a smooth transition of the Russian economy to a free market economy by taking full advantage of Japan's experience -- as a nation which has developed into an "economic superpower" -- in postwar rehabilitation and reconstruction. Japan is the first nation to extend such an aid program, the primary objective of which is to foster human resources. This aid program is in line with agreements made at the summit meeting of major industrialized nations (G-7) held last April. These agreements have served as the basis of Japanese aid to Russia. Japan and Russia have previously considered plans to work out specific projects on the basis of documents drawn up between the governments of the two nations regarding agreements on implementing Japanese support in promoting reform in Russia and humanitarian aid. The two nations worked out the agreements during President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Japan last October. The research center to be constructed on the campus at Moscow University is scheduled to open in September 1995. Courses are to be set up on such topics as the privatization of state-run enterprises, banking and financial know-how, and the Japanese language. Business experts at private Japanese firms and banks are to be sent to the research center as instructors. Future plans are to model the research center after the so-called "business schools" in the United States. It is hoped that the research center "will become a center for personnel exchanges between Japan and Russia," (as stated by a Foreign Ministry source). Foreign Minister Hata plans to sign papers for the agreement on construction of the research center when he visits Russia. In addition, there are plans to set up training facilities, called "Japan Centers," in Vladivostok and Khabarovsk. Here, seminars will be held on business management, the Japanese language, and other subjects for businessmen, public employees, and students. Another $10 million is to be appropriated for the construction of these facilities.
