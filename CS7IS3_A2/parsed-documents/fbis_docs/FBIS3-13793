The elimination of the name of Jerusalem from the occupied territories in the implementation articles of the resolution and voting for each section of each paragraph of the resolution are some of what Washington has imposed on the Security Council. Two preliminary sections of the Security Council resolution say that the Council was shocked by the horrendous massacre of the Palestinian worshipers at Abraham's Mosque and is concerned over the Palestinian casualties in the occupied territories as a consequence of that massacre. America was the only state which did not agree with the total text of the resolution and abstained from voting for its first two sections.
