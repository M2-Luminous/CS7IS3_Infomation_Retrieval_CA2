It was Guebuza who represented the Maputo government in the negotiations with Renamo that led to the signing of a peace pact in Rome in October of 1992. The present Rome contacts are aimed at easing the implementation of the peace accords and the elections set for October 27-28 of this year in Mozambique. During meetings held at the Foreign Ministry here the Maputo government reiterated its gratitude to Italy for its contribution to the pacification of the African country. Italy, in fact, in addition to helping with the peace process, is top contributor to the United Nations fund for turning the former Mozambique rebel movement Renamo into a political party. The UN special envoy to Mozambique, Aldo Ajello, only recently pointed out that the Italian government had given three donations totalling 6.28 million dollars, out of a total of 15 million dollars donated. The fund was set up in May 1993 with the aim of persuading Renamo to implement the peace plan signed in Rome in 1992. It was initially to have 10 million dollars; this was later raised to 15. The next biggest contributor after Italy is Holland with one million dollars, followed by Sweden, South Africa, Switzerland and Luxembourg. A second fund to fund campaigns of all Mozambique parties for October elections will receive donations to the tune of some three million dollars, Ajello said.
