But the urgent efforts of Moscow have saved peace in the Near East. The tragedy in Hebron on 25 February brought about a pause in a Near East settlement. The negotiations and, together with them, the hopes for an end to the most inveterate conflict in the Near East also were broken off. But Igor Ivanov, first deputy Russian minister of foreign affairs, set off on 27 February for Tunis, where the PLO has its headquarters, and then to Israel also. Andrey Kozyrev was in daily telephone contact with the Palestinian and the Israeli leadership. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation issued several decisive statements on the Near East, which express new ideas for an acceleration of the reconciliation of the Arabs and the Israelis. Viktor Posuvalyuk, special representative of the president of Russia for a Near East settlement, flew to see Yasir Arafat on 7 March. And on 11-12 March, Minister Andrey Kozyrev himself visited Tunisia and Israel with messages from President Yeltsin, conducting intensive negotiations with the leadership of the PLO and Israel. And the outcome--Yasir Arafat has declared his readiness to return to the negotiating table. Russia has rescued, apparently, a seemingly hopeless situation. Idle Fuss Following Moscow's successful demarche in the Bosnian conflict, which made it possible not only to avert a NATO military operation against the Serbs, but also to stabilize considerably the situation in Bosnia, the world once again began to talk about Russia as a great power whose legitimate interests could not be ignored. At the same time, on the other hand, arguments concerning new rivalry between the Russian Federation and the United States and Moscow's imperial ambitions were set in motion. And when Russian diplomacy intervened just as energetically in surmounting the crisis in the Arab-Israeli negotiations, it came to be argued in places that Russia had intruded into a sphere of vitally important American interests and had displayed "inordinate independence." It is forgotten here that, first, Moscow and Washington operate, in accordance with the mandate of the Madrid Peace Conference, on an equal basis as co-sponsors of the Arab-Israeli negotiations; second, the Near East region is for Russia no less, and even more, important than for the United States, considering its direct geographical proximity to the southern borders of the Russian state; and third and finally, the efforts of Russian diplomacy were geared to the salvation of the peace process in the region, which more than corresponds to the Americans' interests. Why the United States was this time unable to achieve what the Russians achieved, displaying on this occasion a strange passiveness in mediation, is another matter. Not Moscow's fault but Washington's dereliction consisted in the Americans' dragging out the adoption of an effective UN Security Council resolution guaranteeing a nonrecurrence of the Hebron tragedy. After all, one further such incident, and the file of the Madrid process may be closed. And it is by no means in the interests of either the Arabs or Israel to bury the 30 months of efforts of the complex and, at times, dramatic dialogue. New Ideas The essence of the Russian proposals expressed since Hebron amounts to the quite simple, but very ample format: 1) the peaceful Palestinian population of the West Bank and Gaza obtains international guarantees of security under the conditions of occupation up to the final resolution of all problems, primarily via the dispatch of international observers; 2) soundings are made concerning the possibility of the convening of a second plenary session of the Madrid Conference; 3) the Arabs and the Israelis resume negotiations, and, first and foremost, the PLO and Israel accelerate realization of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. It was the first two points that were given a guarded reception by the United States and part of the Israeli Government. Their allergy to the proposal concerning the organization of Madrid-2 was particularly strong. For some reason or other, some prominent politicians in these two countries considered that Russia had conceived a desire to substitute for the present form of negotiations new ones, at which international patronage would prevail over direct bilateral dialogue. But the explanations of the Russian diplomats dispelled all misgivings, with Yitzhak Rabin included: Two years and six months have elapsed since the Madrid Conference, and entirely new factors, of an extra-negotiation character included, are operating, and it would for this reason be better to evaluate collectively the path that has been covered, ascertaining its positive and negative aspects, and on the basis of a thorough analysis determining the prospects of development of the peace process for the future. After all, it is now sufficiently clear that the Madrid formula has worked positively for the Palestinians and the Jordanians, but has proven unproductive for the Syrians and the Lebanese. Disputes arose also over how to guarantee the security of the Palestinian population. Moscow proposed a flexible option: Inasmuch as Israel has a negative attitude toward a UN "umbrella," the role of aegis of international presence could be performed by the two co-sponsors, with the enlistment of the countries that both the Israelis and the Palestinians find suitable. It was on this issue that Russia needed the support of the Americans, who skirted the demands of the Palestinians in silence, which evoked the accusation against Washington on the part of the Arabs of one-sided sympathy for Israel. Ultimately, the Russian plan for stimulation of a Near East settlement was approved by both Israel and the PLO--as a result of the lightning visit of A. Kozyrev, both parties agreed that Russia and the United States should be the guarantors of the security of the Palestinian population of the West Bank and Gaza and that a second session of the Madrid Conference could be very productive for imparting new international impetus to the peace process. On 12 March, Yasir Arafat, leader of the PLO, after negotiations with the Russian minister, gave his long-awaited consent to a return to the negotiating table. Also interesting is the fact that the Russian minister of foreign affairs brought the Palestinian leader from Jerusalem additional concessions of the Israeli Government, which were so much needed for a resumption of the peace process. As far, however, as the talk about Russian-American rivalry in the Near East is concerned, it was conclusively buried at the meeting of the minister of foreign affairs of the Russian Federation and the U.S. secretary of state in Vladivostok on 14 March, at which both sides confirmed their intention to continue to jointly advance an all-embracing and lasting peace between the Arabs and the Israelis. What Next? Nonetheless, there are no grounds for undue optimism as yet. The Palestinian unrest on the occupied territories continues, and, consequently, people continue to die. Islamic extremists are threatening vengeance for the tragedy in Hebron. Radical Palestinian groupings are putting pressure on Arafat to terminate the negotiations with the "Zionist enemy." Iran, where large demonstrations of solidarity with the Palestinian fundamentalists are taking place, is adding fuel to the fire. The Yitzhak Rabin government is in a difficult position also. The Israeli Labor Party members have made many good-will gestures and have accommodated a substantial part of the manifestly overstated demands of the PLO. This has given rise to the incitement of an atmosphere of hysteria by forces of the right, which are attempting to split Israeli society and stimulate the anti-Arab mood in the country. It is now sensed more than ever that the governing coalition is being torn between the firm intention to achieve peace agreements with the Arab countries as soon as possible and the entirely justified need to ensure the security of the state of Israel. It is perfectly obvious that a hand of friendship from outside needs to be extended to Rabin at the present difficult moment, and the Arabs should be doing this also. However bitter their feeling following the act of vandalism at Hebron's Al-Ibrahimiyyah Mosque, it should be understood that an Israeli Government made up of the political opponents of the Labor Party would never agree to the compromises that Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres have made. In the interests of a future peace, it is essential now to be guided by pragmatic considerations. Something else is clear also--as long as Israel controls the occupied Arab territories, its army must guarantee the security of all its inhabitants more dependably. It would be expedient for this even now to begin negotiations on the status of the settlements, where the most extremist Israeli groupings frequently find refuge. Nor can the settlers be permitted to freely roam around the Palestinian localities with weapons, inasmuch as this could provoke new bloody outbursts. But the most important thing, which would make it possible to knock back the escalation of tension and instill confidence in the successful outcome of the peace negotiations, is the immediate fulfillment of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. Having hoisted the PLO flag on their land, the Palestinians would really sense the first fruits of peaceful cohabitation with the Israelis. It is essential here to seek in parallel tangible progress in other areas of the negotiations also. Only then will a favorable background for the accomplishment of the tasks outlined in Madrid back in 1991 have been created.
