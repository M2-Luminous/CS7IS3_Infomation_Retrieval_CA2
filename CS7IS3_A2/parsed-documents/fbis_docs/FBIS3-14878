The Russian delegation led by Acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin was involved in the G-7 finance ministers' meeting there. The delegation also held bilateral talks with finance ministers of the U.S., Germany and France as well as IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus and representatives of the Paris and London Club of donor countries, the source said. More importantly, he said, the G-7 countries reaffirmed their plans for further cooperation with Russia despite the resignation of Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov. At the same time, it was pointed to the need to pay greater attention to social security matters. For his part, Dubinin said that welcome as G-7 aid might be, Moscow would largely rely on its own resources. The source said the G-7 finance ministers were invited to attend an EBRD-sponsored meeting in St Petersburg at the end of April intended to continue the dialogue. On Russia-IMF talks in Moscow, the ministry official spoke of understanding reached on main issues though the two sides were still at odds on technicalities such as Russia's budget deficit. The government plans a Rbl [rubles] 58 Tn [trillion] deficit this year. The Finance Ministry is ready to cover only Rbl 37 Tn of the proposed figure at the cost of CBR credits which makes up about 5 percent of the GDP. Inflation will be reduced to 8-9 percent by the end of 1994 (It ran at 22 percent in January) if the budget parameters are observed.
