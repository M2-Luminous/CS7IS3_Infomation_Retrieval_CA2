Latvia's Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs believes that Yegor Gaydar's resignation will not influence Russian-Latvian economic relations. He told Interfax that over the past two years the volume of economic contacts between the two countries had decreased so much that it would not be serious to talk about any further deterioration. He believes that whenever possible the Latvian government will continue economic dialogue with the Russian government irrespective of the changes in it. He described Gaydar's resignation as "Russia's inner political games" which will have no decisive impact on the neighboring states."
