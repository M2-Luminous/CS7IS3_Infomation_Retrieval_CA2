According to the decision adopted by the session, an important and pressing basic task before us is to make strenuous efforts to establish a large, unified, open, competitive, and orderly market [tong yi kai tang jing zheng you xu da shi cheng 4827 0001 7030 2397 4552 3630 2589 1645 1129 1579 1034]. A market system is the core of the market economic system and the base where the role of the market mechanism can be brought into play. Without a perfect market for commodities and essential factors, the basic role of resources distributed by the market will be out of the question. What kind of a market do we intend to establish? To make it simple, it should have the following features: Unified and not decentralized, open and not closed, competitive and not monopolized, and orderly and not confused. Unified, open, competitive, and orderly are the essential requirements of a market economy. Openness is the premise of economic activities, competitiveness is the source of economic efficiency, and rules are the guarantee for economic order. Only when the market is unified, open, competitive, and orderly can the role of the market mechanism be brought into play, can the optimized distribution of resources be ensured, and can vitality and efficiency of the economy be maintained. Since reform and opening up, China's commodity market has developed rapidly, the market for essential factors has been nurtured, and the role of the market mechanism has been brought into play in certain fields. However, we should admit that China's market system is still at the initial stage, which cannot meet the needs of the rapidly developing economy and which has restrained the national economy as a whole like a bottle neck. For this reason, it is necessary to accelerate the pace of market building. The following three outstanding problems should be resolved at present: Market decentralization, market monopoly, and confused market order. I. Market decentralization refers mainly to barriers erected between regions. Some localities proceed from their partial interests, restrict the activities of neighbors, practice local protectionism, and limit the flow of commodities and resources. When there is a short supply of a certain commodity or resource, they try to restrict its outflow. When a certain local commodity is unmarketable, they restrict the inflow of fine quality commodities from other localities. The artificial barriers hinder the flow of commodities and the establishment of a unified market nationwide. From a short-term point of view, the barriers may protect the interests of a certain locality and its enterprises. From a long- term point of view, however, it will harm the interests of that locality and its enterprises because such protectionism runs counter to market rules, rejects competition, and plays a negative role of protecting backwardness. A child cannot grow up in its mother's bosom and an enterprise which has not withstood storms will not be competitiveness. The establishment of a unified market is the trend of the times. The sooner we open up, the sooner we will benefit. Otherwise, we will suffer. This has been proved by the practice of many localities. In establishing a unified market, besides removing barriers erected between the regions within the country, it is also necessary to make preparations to connect our market with that of the world. When China's status as signatory of GATT is resumed, we will further open our market to the outside world. Only by taking part in competition in the market without barriers as early as possible can enterprises adapt themselves to the storms in the domestic and international market. The removal of barriers erected between regions does not mean that we do not want to develop regional markets. The development of regional markets is not equivalent to erecting barriers. A regional market is formed by the natural technical features of commodities, regional production, and consumption rather than by administrative and artificial barriers. We should develop such a regional market, which will become a component part of the unified national market. In market building, the establishment of some regional markets in light of administrative divisions is a normal phenomenon. As long as we do not make such a market inflexible, it will conform to economic laws and converge with a unified national market. The key to breaking through regional barriers and establishing a unified and open market lies in deepened reform. On the one hand, acceleration of reform of the financial and taxation system, implementation of a separate taxation system, and transformation of the financial contract system can weaken the foundation of interests of local protectionism, which will help remove market barriers. On the other hand, acceleration of enterprise reform, establishment of the enterprise bankruptcy system and a social insurance system, and invigoration of enterprise competitiveness in the market can alleviate the pressure of the government in undertaking "protection" responsibility. Naturally, the state must also adopt legislative means to ensure that the market is open and to stop the practice of erecting barriers. II. Market monopoly refers mainly to monopoly by departments and trades, monopoly by a unitary state economy, and monopoly related to some outdated policies. Since reform, the structure of China's departmental monopoly and of the public economic sector unifying the whole country has been smashed. Other economic sectors are now allowed to enter a number of fields and nonpublic sectors are allowed to take part in economic development and competition, which have enormously invigorated these fields. Nevertheless, there are still some competitive fields which are monopolized by some departments and nonpublic enterprises are still restricted from operation in some fields. It will be impossible to ensure fair competition if there is inequality in fields where certain nonpublic enterprises are allowed to enter. Moreover, to encourage some enterprises to explore reform experience, the state offered some preferential policies during the initial period of reform which were absolutely necessary and which played an enormous role in promoting reform and economic development. When the reform measures are popularized, however, the continued retention of the "preferential policies" for certain enterprises will be unfair to the vast number of other enterprises. As such a "monopoly which is related to policy" does not conform to the establishment of a market which encourages fair competition, it should be removed in the course of deepened reform. The greatest harm of market monopoly is that it rejects competition, which hinders nurturing of the market, reduces economic efficiency, and gives rise to disorder and corruption. In the course of the transition from a highly centralized planned economy to a market economy, the most important and arduous task is to smash monopolies. Naturally, while the state must exercise a monopoly over a small number of special commodities which are related to the lifelines of the national economy, restrictions on other departments and economic sectors should be lifted and they should be allowed to take part in competition and promote development. Even in the trades where a state monopoly is essential, it is necessary to introduce a competition mechanism, carry out competition between enterprises, and increase efficiency. In order to better implement the policy of coexistence of various economic sectors based on the predominance of the public sector and encourage the normal growth of nonpublic sectors, it is necessary to effect a shift from the basis of ownership to industrial needs in formulating policies, abolish discriminative and restrictive policies, gradually recall special preferential policies offered to certain enterprises during a specified period, abolish monopoly policies, and ensure fair competition. In order to weaken and eventually remove the powers of resource distribution of certain government departments, it is necessary to increase the scope of government reform and change the functions of government organs so they can shift from microeconomic activities to comprehensive management and delegate powers to the market and enterprises. The state should also formulate anti- monopoly laws and protect competition. Some comrades are worried that the lifting of restrictions on the market and elimination of the monopoly of the public economic sector will shake the position of socialist public ownership. The predominance of socialist public ownership should be manifested in the national economy and control over the lifelines of the national economy rather than the superiority in the quantity of state enterprises or the undertaking of all trades and professions by state enterprises. Only by eliminating monopoly and encouraging the common development of various economic sectors can we arouse the enthusiasm of all fields to resolve the difficulties of capital shortages in China's construction and promote economic prosperity. Although the individual and private economic sectors have developed rapidly in recent years, they are still insufficient. The output value of the individual and private enterprises in China accounted for only 4.1 percent of the country's total industrial output value in 1992. Therefore, there is still a wide scope for their development. Competition requires a certain scale. In other words, there must be a considerable number of enterprises in each trade. Only when there is a large scale of competition can we have full competition and give play to its role. In China, which has a vast territory, large population, and huge market, it will be impossible to meet market needs without competition of scale. Competition is also conducive to economy of scale because we can allow the best to survive through competition, merge enterprises and concentrate assets, and form an economy of scale. Such economy of scale will be the result of competition on equal footing. As it is not "a plate of assorted dishes pieced together" by force, which rejects competition, it will inevitably turn out genuine efficiency of scale. III. The confused market order at present has attracted public attention. The chaotic phenomena of counterfeit goods, short measures, false advertisements, illegal pooling of funds, tax evasion, and smuggling have disrupted normal market order, given rise to corruption, and harmed the interests of enterprises and the masses. A special feature of the chaotic phenomena is not keeping promises, not observing to rules, and defying laws and discipline. Some people say that this is the result of a market economy, which is a complete misunderstanding of the market economy. A market economy is not an economy without order. A market economy is an economy which adheres to rules and the legal system. In the course of a market economy, the market body is diversified, economic policy decisions are decentralized, and economic connections are complicated. To ensure effective operation and fair and full competition of the economy, it is necessary to strictly establish market rules and effectively maintain market order. The practice of many developed nations has proved this point. They have used a mature market economy to overcome the initial deficiencies of a commodity economy. The establishment of a socialist market economic system is an unprecedented cause. The occurrence of the chaotic phenomena will be unavoidable in a change of the system from the old to the new. The substitution of a new system for the old one and the frictions between the two will inevitably result in management loopholes, a vacuum in regulations, lax discipline, and misbehavior. As the chaotic phenomenon is due to insufficient rather than excessive development of the market economy, the problem can be fundamentally resolved only through accelerating reform and expediting market growth. He who carries out full competition by following the principle of fairness, honesty, and trustworthiness is the most effective defender of a market order. The abolition of market monopoly, barriers, and inappropriate means of competition will fully develop competition and exert great market pressure on enterprises. Enterprises will have internal binding force by speeding up the reform of the enterprise system and genuinely developing a mechanism of assuming sole responsibility for profits and losses. The establishment of market rules, strengthening of market management, and enhancement of a sense of trustworthiness, contract, and law will plug loopholes and further restrain enterprise behavior and standardize market order. Concrete analysis should be made of the chaotic phenomena. It is necessary to resolutely resist the chaotic phenomena as they run counter to the basic rules of a market economy. Some phenomena are regarded as "disorder" from the traditional planned economic viewpoint, but economic vitality and the bud of a new system from a market economic viewpoint, which should be vigorously supported and not contained. Although some phenomena are related to "chaos," they are caused by market stagnation, reflecting the needs of accelerating market development, which must be standardized and guided rather than simply negated. For example, the chaotic phenomenon of illegal lending which took place in the financial field was a reflection of the capital market stagnation, which can only be effectively resolved by vigorously enhancing the building of the capital market. In short, we should learn how to apply the method of a market economy to curb the chaos and introduce reforms rather than restriction for the chaotic phenomena. With the checking of the chaotic phenomena as the opportunity, we should accelerate the pace of reform, smash the vicious cycle of "opening up resulting in chaos, chaos in restriction, and restriction in rigidity," and enter a new realm of orderly development. Market oriented reform has boosted the economy and improved the people's living standards. China's economy has never been so vigorous and the market has never been so prosperous as the one today. Despite the chaos amid vitality, vitality is essential. We may say that the chaotic phenomenon is the price paid for reform and development and that there can be no success without a price. With the spirit of holding ourselves highly responsible to the people, we should work conscientiously, be bold as well as prudent, and try to exchange the greatest success for the least price. As this year is a crucial one for implementing the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, we should be determined to make strenuous efforts to promote reform in a down-to-earth manner; earnestly resolve the problems of market barriers, monopoly, and chaos; remove obstacles in market building; and push the market forward in a unified, open, competitive, and orderly direction.
