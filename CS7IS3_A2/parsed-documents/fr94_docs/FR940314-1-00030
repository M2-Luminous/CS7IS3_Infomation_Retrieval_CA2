FR940314-1-00030 FR940314-1-00008 For some of the vehicles tested by the agency, deliberate action by the driver appears to be necessary in order to remove the key without the transmission becoming locked in ``park.'' Such action is necessary where the driver must either hold the shift lever between ``park'' and ``reverse'' with one hand while removing the key with the other hand, or keep the thumb button depressed on the shift lever while removing the key. NHTSA tentatively concludes that there is no basis to believe that drivers would deliberately make such efforts to defeat the transmission shift lock. Therefore, the agency believes that permitting such systems would have no safety consequences, and that the existing requirement is unnecessarily design-restrictive with respect to these systems. For other of the vehicles tested by the agency, it is possible that a driver might inadvertently remove the key without the transmission becoming locked in ``park.'' This could happen, for example, if the driver moved the lever so that it appeared to be in ``park'' but was in fact short of the full ``park'' position. However, in order for such systems to result in any adverse safety consequences related to child-induced rollaway, it would be necessary both for the driver to inadvertently fail to place the lever fully in the ``park'' position and for a child to then play with the lever and/or the parking brake in a way that creates a rollaway. NHTSA believes that either event would occur only very rarely and has tentatively concluded that the possibility of both events occurring together is minuscule. Therefore, the agency does not believe that it is necessary to address this remote possibility in a safety standard. NHTSA notes that its safety standards are intended to address unreasonable safety risks and not all conceivable risks no matter how remote. The agency believes that its proposal is consistent with other actions that it has taken in this area. For example, while NHTSA decided in the May 1990 final rule to require transmission shift locks for automatic transmission vehicles, it also decided, based on a review of accident data, not to require such locks for manual transmission vehicles. This did not mean that there was no conceivable risk of child-induced rollaways for manual transmission vehicles, but instead that the risk was sufficiently small that the agency did not believe it was necessary to address in a safety standard. Similarly, in June 1990, NHTSA denied a petition for rulemaking submitted by Mr. W. A. Barr requesting that the agency issue requirements to address inadvertent vehicle movement associated with shifting automatic transmissions into ``park,'' in part because of lack of evidence that the extent of the alleged problem was great enough to warrant Federal intervention. NHTSA is also proposing to amend the Purpose and Scope section of Standard No. 114 to clarify that the purpose of the requirements at issue is to reduce the incidence of crashes resulting from the rollaway of parked vehicles with automatic transmissions as a result of children moving the shift mechanism out of the ``park'' position. That section currently indicates that the purpose of the requirements is to reduce the incidence of crashes resulting from rollaway of parked vehicles. NHTSA contemplates making the proposed amendments effective 30 days after publication of a final rule. The agency tentatively concludes that there is good cause for such an effective date, since the amendments would impose no new requirements but instead provide additional flexibility to manufacturers with no measurable impact on safety. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures NHTSA has considered the impacts of this rulemaking action under Executive Order 12866 and the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. This action has been determined to be not ``significant'' under either. As explained above, the proposed amendments would impose no new requirements but instead provide additional flexibility to manufacturers, with respect to transmission shift lock designs, with no measurable impact on safety. Also as stated above, the agency estimates the annual consumer cost savings of adopting the proposed amendment to be a maximum of $6.75 to $14.00 per affected vehicle. Accordingly, a full regulatory evaluation is not required.
