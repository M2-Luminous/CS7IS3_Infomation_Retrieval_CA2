In his opening address to a special general conference in Ulundi on Saturday, the IFP president said the current constitution should be opposed and called for "the courage to enter the politics of resistance". "I say no to the present constitution and I say as this constitution stands, I do not see how we can enter elections." He said if the IFP capitulated and played the ANC/SA Communist Party political ball game, this would lead to future violent clashes between "the people" and an ANC government. "This constitution as it now stands is an arena for struggle to the finish. Within its provisions, there is no scope for constitutional or political settlement." The IFP president said he was prepared to compete with any political leaders or party under a fair and just constitution. He would not, however, subject IFP members to a constitution which was "totally wrong" for the country He rejected arguments that kwaZulu and the IFP would come to nought if they did not contest elections. "I say there can be no governance of kwaZulu/Natal without the active acceptance and participation of the IFP. "This is a region where we dominate. No foreign forces shall come into it to rule over us." The Inkatha leader again rejected the Transitional Executive Council, saying he would neither recognise nor obey it. On the future of the Zulu monarchy, Mr Buthelezi said his position had to be constitutional entrenched, and anything less, "I am just not prepared to accept".
