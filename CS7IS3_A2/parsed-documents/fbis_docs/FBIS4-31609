The heaviest attacks on the republic of Srpska were launched in the Brcko area. There were also enemy provocations on other front lines, Mladic said. "We are going to continue our full compliance with what we agreed to in Geneva, i.e. to refrain from offensive operations and we are going to tolerate their attacks as long as they are not a serious threat to the republic of Srpska and the Serbian people," the chief of staff of the army of the republic of Srpska said. He also said that the army of the republic of Srpska "will not allow enemy forces to enjoy their leisure." "We are following all their efforts to consolidate their ranks within this month of cease-fire and to arm themselves and prepare offensive operations, something they hinted at even before their arrival in Geneva," General Mladic said.
