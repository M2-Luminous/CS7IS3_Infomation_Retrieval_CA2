The most intense artillery attacks, merely a preparation for fresh infantry attacks on the defense lines, were aimed against Boderiste and Vranovaca. With the substantial support of tanks and artillery, chetniks in the region of Boderiste tried twice to break through defense lines, but were on both occasions forced to withdraw with losses in manpower. At approximately 1300 chetniks moved in for a fierce tank-infantry attack in the Vranovaca region, supported by artillery and self-propelled antiaircraft artillery. After major battles that lasted until 1420 the enemy was forced to retreat." Deronjic then reports that "a transport helicopter" arrived to "evacuate seriously injured enemy soldiers" after the battle. In conclusion, he also expresses the opinion that, in the shadow of the situation in Gorazde, "the chetniks are trying to quickly fix the problems on the battlefield that have caused them the biggest headaches." Correspondent from Bihac Mirza Sadikovic reports that "Karadzic's fascists are today attacking Buzim and the nearby areas; they also continue to attack and attempt infantry breakthroughs on the defense lines in this region, the 5th Corps of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army's zone of responsibility." Sadikovic further reports that "throughout the day Abdic's paramilitary formations have been shelling the border regions in the Cazin area at various intervals, provoking infantry clashes. The aggressor indiscriminately shelled other defense lines in the 5th Corps' zone of responsibility and the Headquarters of the Croatian Defense Council, especially in the Bosanska Krupa area of the battlefield, and opened fire with antiaircraft artillery and heavy machine guns." A report from the Srebrenica Press Center claims that "the Serbian aggressor has been systematically exhausting Srebrenica. Beside exhaustion through starvation, he is also increasing provocations along the lines of encirclement and at the same time concentrating manpower and military hardware on the occupied territory of (Vlasenica), (Vratovac), and Srebrenica in the direct vicinity of the demilitarized zone. Recently the aggressor has been carrying out [word indistinct] propaganda activity in Srebrenica and also stepped up surveillance of this [words indistinct]." An announcer-read report on the situation in Sarajevo notes "increased concentration of manpower and arms around the town." It is reported that "four 105 mm howitzers, two antiaircraft guns, two self-propelled antiaircraft artillery pieces, and four 76 mm ZIS [expansion unknown] are positioned in the region of Pavovac; two ZIS are placed behind the Lukavica barracks. All the weapons are dug into the ground and turned [word indistinct] in the direction of Sokolovic Kolonija and Hrasnica. The enemy today continued with infantry arms provocations along defense lines and in the suburbs."
