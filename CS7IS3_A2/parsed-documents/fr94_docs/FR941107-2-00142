SUMMARY: The Office of Personnel Management is initiating a study on the feasibility of establishing a mandatory interagency placement program for Federal employees separated by reduction in force. This advance notice invites written comments from all interested parties. DATES: Written comments will be considered if received no later than January 6, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send written comments to Leonard R. Klein, Associate Director for Career Entry, Office of Personnel Management, Room 6F08, 1900 E Street NW., Washington, DC 20145&hyph;0001. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Diane Bohling, 202&hyph;606&hyph;0960, FAX 202&hyph;606&hyph;2329. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Public Law 103&hyph;337, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995, was signed into law by the President of the United States on October 5, 1994. Section 1066 of this law requires the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to conduct a study on the feasibility of establishing a mandatory interagency placement program for Federal employees affected by a reduction in force and report the findings to Congress no later than April 5, 1995. This program would supplement the existing Interagency Placement Program and internal placement efforts conducted by individual agencies. For purposes of this study, the law defines an interagency placement program as one that requires an agency to offer a position to an employee of another agency affected by reduction in force if the position cannot be filled through a placement program of the agency in which the position is located, the employee to whom the offer is made is qualified for the offered position, and the geographic location of the offered position is within the commuting area of the residence of the employee or the employee's present or last-held position. Such a program would not affect internal agency placement programs including, but not limited to, merit promotion, upward mobility, and reassignments. Under the law, the term ``agency'' means an Executive agency as defined in section 105 of title 5, United States Code, except that such term does not include the General Accounting Office. The term ``Federal employees affected by reductions in force'' means Federal employees who are separated, or are scheduled to be separated, from service under reduction in force pursuant to regulations prescribed under section 3502 of title 5, United States Code, or procedures established under section 3595 of such title. The law provides that OPM conduct this study in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and seek comments from the heads of all appropriate Federal agencies. This notice is to request input from all interested parties on this issue and any other options to assist Federal employees affected by downsizing. Information gained during this study will be used to submit a report of findings to Congress and may result in proposals for regulatory or statutory changes. James B. King, Director.
