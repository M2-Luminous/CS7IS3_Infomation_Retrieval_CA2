In an interview granted to PRENSA LATINA, Juan Contino, first secretary of the Union of Young Communists (UJC), has announced that stemming from the grassroots organizations of the respective student federations, this segment of the population is also expressing its concerns and proposals regarding complex aspects of Cuba's economy. He said a large part of the 500,000 members of the UJC belong to the worker and peasant sector. They are participating in this analysis in response to an appeal by the Cuban Workers Federation (CTC). Contino said it is incredible to see the diversity of opinions that emerge in these forums and how youths between the ages of 14 and 25 (approximately pre-university and university level) state opinions on ways to reduce money in circulation based on experience in their own fields. Their views are then submitted to group analysis. Contino said disagreements do occur but do not pose antagonizing views, because they stem from an identity of principles and actions of historic generations of the revolution and the younger generation. With the integration of students into these debates, the national consensus is expanded to promote decisions that permit balancing the fiscal deficit of some $4.2 billion pesos (equivalent to dollars at the official rate of exchange) and cutting excessive money in circulation by 10 billion pesos. The youth leader said although the Federation of Midlevel School Students (FEEM) and the University Students Federation (FEU) are autonomous and independent organizations, youths who belong to these organizations are more attracted by UJC activities. He said adolescents and youths between the ages of 25 and 30 require more attention. The former because they are at that age between childhood and adolescence, full of complications, and the latter because they are not interested in big parties or large gatherings, This is reflected in recreation, he explained, where though discotheques in the country have increased to 37 and though there are 100 recreational facilities in the country, the particular demands of the different age groups of a population of 5.7 million residents from 0 to 30 years have yet to be met. The 33-year-old economist, together with the person heading the UJC in lieu of current Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, has the assessment of recreational facilities, given that the last congress was positive, despite the fact that resources were drained by the country's difficult economic situation. He said, nonetheless, approximately 2 million people have enjoyed recreational activities sponsored by the youth organization.
