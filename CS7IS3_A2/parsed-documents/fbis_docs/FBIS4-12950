The sources said that U.S.-Jordanian contacts over the past few days resulted in an initial agreement containing a number of points on arrangements in Jordanian territorial waters and inside al-'Aqabah Port. Their aim is to ascertain Jordan's compliance with the Security Council resolutions concerning the economic embargo imposed on Iraq. The sources added that the point that angered the Jordanian monarch is the proposal that U.S. soldiers and observers be allowed to inspect containers inside the port. Early in the week reports said that an agreement had been reached between Washington and Amman to ease the al-'Aqabah Port blockade. Meanwhile, a Jordanian Foreign Ministry source has ruled out a visit to the region at the end of the month by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, despite the official U.S. announcement of the date of the visit. The source told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the delay in signing an Israeli-Palestinian agreement on arrangements for withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho is bound to change the date and program of the anticipated visit. The U.S. secretary was expected to attend the signing ceremony in Cairo, that is in addition to a number of European foreign ministers. The Jordanian sources said that the continuation of the al-'Aqabah blockade is the result of Jordan's repeated rejection of the U.S.-Israeli pressures -- which have reached the point of going beyond diplomatic behavior -- designed to force Jordan to hasten to sign a separate peace agreement with Israel, as they are not content with the signing of the agenda. The sources added that whenever the course of the negotiations with the Palestinians in Cairo and Paris becomes complicated and the signing of the principles agreement, which was expected to take place on 20 April, is delayed, more pressure is exerted on Jordan by every possible means to push it toward signing a peace agreement.
