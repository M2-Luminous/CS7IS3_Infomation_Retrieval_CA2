FR940830-0-00043 FR940830-0-00009 b. No Monies Received From the Indigent Proposed §124.516(b)(2) would have established, as one alternative criterion for certification, that a facility received no monies directly from persons with incomes up to twice the poverty level, exclusive of amounts charged or received for purposes of obtaining reimbursement under third party programs. Several commenters urged that this criterion be revised to permit receipt of funds from such persons, on the grounds that it is unrealistic to expect a facility to receive no money from such persons. It was suggested that the criterion be revised to permit receipt of funds up to some amount, such as 10 percent of operating revenues. The Department has not accepted this suggestion. This criterion was intended to accommodate those exceptional facilities which routinely provide all services at no charge to persons unable to pay or which entirely serve populations ineligible for uncompensated services and are thus unable to comply with the regulations. Facilities that collect monies from patients with incomes below twice the poverty level do not come within the intent of this criterion. It should be noted, however, that such facilities may nonetheless be able to qualify for the compliance alternative under a different criterion of the regulation, if they have a ``program of discounted health services'' and receive the requisite amount of philanthropy. See §124.516(b)(2) below. Another suggestion made with respect to this criterion was that amounts collected from patients as part of their Medicaid ``spenddown'' be considered to be included under the exclusionary language of this section, so that collection of such monies by a facility would not render it ineligible under this criterion. This suggestion has likewise not been accepted. Spenddown amounts are clearly not within the scope of the exclusionary language as written, as Medicaid eligibility does not exist until the patient has spent down the requisite amount, and therefore they are not amounts charged that are reimbursable. Nor do we think the language should be revised to permit inclusion of spenddown amounts in the amounts permitted to be charged or claimed. As stated above, this criterion is intended to cover a narrow class of facilities_ones which can be considered to be meeting their Hill-Burton obligation because they are in fact not receiving monies directly from any patients who would otherwise be eligible for Hill-Burton uncompensated services. Permitting collection of spenddown amounts would thus not be consistent with the intended scope of this criterion. This criterion has been revised, however, to require that the facility demonstrate that it met the criterion for the preceding three fiscal years. This revision brings this criterion into line with the 10 percent philanthropy criterion of §124.516(b)(2), which also requires a demonstration of compliance over the preceding three years. The purpose of the three-year demonstration in both cases is to give the Secretary a basis for the conclusion that a facility applying for certification in fact comes within the intended scope of the compliance alternative because of its characteristics and problems, and that certification is not made based on what may be a one-time aberration in the facility's circumstances. See §124.516(b)(1) below. Another commenter suggested that, in view of the difficulty many nursing homes have in finding individuals who are eligible for uncompensated services and not also eligible for Medicaid, the Department create a new eligibility category for persons in nursing homes with incomes up to four times the poverty level. In fact, the Secretary is considering such a change to the regulations; an NPRM proposing to establish a new ``Category C,'' consisting of persons with incomes up to three times the poverty level was recently published. 59 FR 15693 (April 4, 1994). It should be noted that, should this latter policy subsequently be adopted, the Secretary would expect to revise §124.516(b)(1) below to be consistent with the revision in the underlying regulations.
