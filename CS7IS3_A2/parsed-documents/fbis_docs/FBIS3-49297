This sounds all very fine, but the other EU countries do not accept his words on faith, but will judge the Greek presidency by its actions. For one cannot assume from the outset that Athens will not succumb to the temptation of promoting its own interests in its relations with Bulgaria, relying on the authority and opportunities offered by its term of leadership of the European Union that has just begun. The EU presidency provides great opportunities to the country exercising its functions. One such opportunity -- and a very important one -- is that the country in question determines the agendas of the various EU bodies, and can speed up or slow down the consideration of important problems. For Bulgaria, this is of great importance. For a number of reasons, a slowdown occurred in Bulgaria's relations with the European Union, which it is now necessary to make good. Greece is able to help or hinder this process. Athens is perfectly well aware of this. It also knows that certain profound differences exist in Bulgarian-Greek relations regarding Balkan problems, such as the Macedonian question. It is up to Greece to decide whether or not it wants Bulgaria's relations with the European Union to expand. It is also up to Bulgaria to decide how to respond to any particular situation, and its response should be an honorable one.
