"It is true North Korea has massed troops and weapons in areas along the truce line," said Yi. "But, this is far from being anything new." He emphasized that there have been no signs of any unusual military movement in North Korea in connection with the nuclear question. "In fact, I am displeased at those foreign press reports that tended to describe the Korean situation as a crisis," Yi said. He said the basic position of the government is that the two Koreas should regard each other as partners in pursuit of coexistence and co-prosperity. "However, we cannot accept North Korea as a partner only in a circumstance where they behaves as if they have nuclear arms in their hands and persist in trying to communize the whole peninsula," he said. In his testimony, Deputy Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok said North Korea may possess plutonium enough to produce about two atomic bombs, but at the moment it is hard to say North Korea has produced nuclear weapons. Yi said whether North Korea has developed nuclear arms would be determined once full international and inter-Korean nuclear inspections are implemented thoroughly. Yi who is also national unification minister said the exchange of special envoys between South and North Korea should be carried out before third-round U.S.-North Korea talks take place. When special envoys are exchanged, the two Koreas would discuss the nuclear question and the issue of implementing the basic South-North agreement, he said. Also speaking at the assembly session, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said that the disused Russian submarines being sold to foreign countries are of a kind which can be used as none but scrap. Of the 12 disused Russian submarines, one has been delivered to North Korea, said Han, adding that he understands Russia is planning to send a verification team to North Korea to witness the disintegration of the submarine sold to North Korea. Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae told the assembly that at the moment it is not proper for his ministry to take the initiative in repealing the Team Spirit exercise system. "The Team Spirit is one of the strong means of pressuring North Korea into giving up nuclear development," Yi said.
