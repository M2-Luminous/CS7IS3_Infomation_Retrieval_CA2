Officials say this is not a simple change of the pay cycle--from once a month to once a year. But it ties management's earnings to government wishes to invigorate State enterprises. Aside from performance, salary will be decided by individual enterprises' fixed assets, their tax payment and profit turnovers to the State as well as local average income level. The reform aims to separate management payments from ordinary workers to promote self-constraint within enterprises, Wang Chongguang, an official with the Ministry of Labour, told China Daily. Directors and general managers of State enterprises will shoulder more responsibilities and risks with the change. "The new system encourages managerial staff to work as hard as they can because the better their performance, the more they get," said Wang, who is in charge of the distribution division within enterprises. The annuity is to be divided into two parts: the basic salary and the risk income. According to Wang, the basic wage is about equal to annual total income under the existing monthly payment system. Risk income will depend on how much profit directors bring to their enterprises as well as to the owner--the State. The new system stipulates that directors can only get their full basic wage if their enterprises meet annual fiscal goals. If their enterprises turn over more taxes and profits to the State, directors' bonuses, or risk income, can be 50 to 200 percent more than their basic salary. Directors whose firms fail to reach targeted quotas, however, will receive lower pay than the basic annuity fixed by the State. But the Ministry of Labour did not specify the degree of income reductions. "The system is formulated on the ground that the average production cycle usually lasts a relatively longer period than that for issuing monthly wages," Wang said. "To judge the performance of a director, one has to know the enterprise's economic indexes, including the industrial output value. But the indexes are not available until the end or the beginning of a year," he added. The system is waiting for State Council's approval. Once endorsed, it will be put into effect within a few months and 327,000 directors and general managers of State enterprises will be affected. For the first year, they will get pre-payments of their income to cover daily expenditures. It is hoped that the move can motivate top managers of State enterprises to improve overall firm performance, Wang said. Presently, State enterprises play a dominant role in China's various economic sectors, but an estimated one-third of them are in the red and their workers lead a comparatively poor life. The annuity system is a continuation of reforms, not a fresh move to boost State firms, Labour Ministry officials say. As early as 1986, the country mapped out reforms to regulate salaries of management at State enterprises. That regulation said directors could be paid one- to three-times higher than common workers depending on profits. The regulations to a certain degree, motivated directors. Yet during the implementation, problems cropped up. Some managers, even those of money-losing enterprises, did nothing but try to increase their own income. Many directors received far more than was permitted by the regulations. Common complaints focused on directors abusing their power to make profits. The malpractice was largely checked during the national anticorruption campaign last year. But the rational parts of the system, such as more bonuses for managers with outstanding achievements, have also been dropped in many parts of the country. "The annuity system is a concrete step to deepen the reform on the management of State-owned enterprises," said Xu Yanjun, also with the Ministry of Labour. The system is in line with the goal of defining the property rights of State enterprises. Under the new practice, directors and managers will serve as the legal representatives of State assets at their enterprises. They are responsible for maintaining and increasing the values of the properties, said Xu. Previous enterprise reforms have failed to touch the property rights of State-owned firms. The annuity system can help to promote a sound property relationship within enterprises and speed up the integration of a modern enterprise system, Xu said.
