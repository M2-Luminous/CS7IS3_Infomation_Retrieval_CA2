Seventy seven families from the Kathalcharri evacuee camp here numbering 282 refugees trekked over a bamboo bridge erected temporarily by Bangladesh to Ramgarh on the other side. Assuring the refugees of safety and security, the Bangladesh minister for communication, Col (retd) Ole Ahmed, who came over to Sabroom to participate in a meeting organised by the Indian Government, said, "We are prepared to do everything to make their resettlement smooth. I ensure them that they are not going to an area of uncertainty but only to their home." Describing this as a "unique and historic" event the Tripura governor, Mr Romesh Bhandari who played an active role, said there was no reason to doubt the genuineness and sincerity of these assurances of the Bangladesh Government. The governor however said that such fears and apprehensions that were being expressed, needed to be taken note of by "our Bangladesh friends. In the initial stages particular attention would need to be paid on this count so that apprehension and fear could be replaced by confidence and trust. The Union of state for home, Mr P.M. Sayeed, who also described this event as "historic" said that India had accepted them when they came here following atrocities and killings, but it had been at a considerable cost to the people of Tripura. The Centre, he said, had given them free rations and spent over Rs [Rupees] 43 crores for their upkeep. Mr Sayeed said, "We have not involved any third country and we have shown that we can solve our problem by ourselves.
