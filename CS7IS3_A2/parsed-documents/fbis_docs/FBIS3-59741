The device was completed in its Central Research Institute in Itami City. This type of device is being put into use only by a limited number of corporations, such as IBM in America and NTT. Currently, the major domestic semiconductor manufacturers are using other equipment at the national research institutes. It appears that the use of this facility will greatly accelerate Mitsubishi Electric's development of future generation semiconductors. By using electromagnets, the SR device deflects the orbit of high energy electrons accelerated nearly up to the speed of light and produces highly intense linear SR in a direction tangential to the orbit. The equipment consists of a LINAC [linear accelerator] device to produce electrons; a synchrotron to accelerate the electrons; and a superconducting SR ring which produces radiation. The SR facility developed and brought into use by Mitsubishi Electric is a device that has the distinguishing features of being compact and low cost for industrial use. In particular, Mitsubishi succeeded in reducing the circumference of the electron beam orbit in the recently completed superconducting SR ring from more than 10 meters in conventional types to 9.2 meters, making it the smallest compact model in the world. The amount of liquid helium consumption has been reduced to 3 liters per hour which is a fraction of the quantity used in conventional facilities. It is estimated the entire cost of the synchrotron facility is several billions of yen. Mitsubishi Electric's person in charge of semiconductor development sees the possibility of the economic feasibility of using the SR facility in real semiconductor plants (because SR from a single SR unit can be simultaneously supplied to a maximum number of 20 processing units.) It is expected that the SR will be used for DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) chips in the 256 megabit--1 gigabit range. Hitachi Ltd. and other big semiconductor makers, using the equipment at the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics, Ministry of Education, are advancing in research and development. Mitsubishi Electric is using the SR from the completed SR facility to begin the development of semiconductors within the company and is planning to promote the marketing of the SR equipment.
