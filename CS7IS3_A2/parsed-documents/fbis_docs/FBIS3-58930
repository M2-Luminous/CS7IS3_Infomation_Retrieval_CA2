The last two budgets will now cost the average family an extra 12.52 pounds a week. Responding to the Treasury figures, which dented the Tories' claim to be the party of low taxation, Mr Clarke said he would continue to "impose whatever tax is necessary" to secure growth and boost employment. He seemed unabashed by the figures and said he would continue with the tax rises to bring down public borrowing. That would ensure that the confidence in the recovery was maintained. "I will do what is necessary, some of it unpopular, in order to create the right conditions for growth to continue," he said. "First you have to create the wealth. Helping business get the jobs has to be the first priority. Then my aims of low taxation can be achieved." Tories were clearly shaken by the figures, which were released by Mr Stephen Dorrell, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, in response to questions from Ms Harriet Harman, Labour's Treasury spokesman. Senior backbenchers said it was now politically essential to cut taxes before the next election. Although Mr Clarke said the Treasury figures were meaningless because take-home pay had risen significantly, Tories fear that the loss of their most potent political claim could be extremely damaging. Mr John Townend, chairman of the backbench finance committee, said: "We are the party philosophically of low taxation. If we lose that label we are in trouble." The Treasury figures show that a married couple with two children, living on an income of 19,450 pounds will now lose 21.9 percent of their income in income tax and national insurance contributions, compared with 20.9 percent when Labour was last in office in 1978/79. Once VAT [value-added tax] and other indirect taxes are added, the figure rises to 35 percent. The Treasury says that the overall rise in average earnings has increased the average family's income by 14.40 pounds a week -- but only 1.88 pounds of that will be left after the tax rises. A family with an income of 14,590 pounds a year -- three quarters of average earnings -- will have to pay 9.52 pounds a week more in tax from April, while the bill for a family on 21,175 pounds will leap by 21.58 pounds. Mr Gordon Brown, Shadow Chancellor, said the Conservatives' failure to admit the truth about their tax policies meant that "the country will never trust them on tax again." Mr Clarke, interviewed on BBC TV's Breakfast with Frost programme, stoutly defended his decisions and those of his predecessor, Mr Norman Lamont, to raise tax. "I have to impose whatever tax is necessary to get us more jobs and more growth," he said. "That is my duty and no Chancellor can ever tell people that he will never put up taxes." He remained committed to delivering "the lowest taxation that would be responsible in the circumstances. It is only if you actually create the wealth the country needs...then you are able to keep taxation down and carry on spending on the great public services. "But first you have to create the wealth. Helping business get the jobs has to be the first priority. Then my aims of low taxation can be achieved." The Government had demonstrated its commitment to sound finances and his aim was to allow people to keep as much of their money as possible. "I will put down tax when I possibly can," Mr Clarke said. "It is one of my political aims. Taxes will always be lower under me than they would be if I were replaced by a Labour Chancellor or a Liberal Chancellor." He remained upbeat about Britain's economic prospects: "We are on course to get rid of the borrowing," he said. "I think that has given a great boost to confidence, to the economy, and we see the growth emerging, every prospect of the recovery getting stronger. "My judgment had to be: can this recovery stand the tax, will the horse get over Becher's Brook when it gets there in April?" Mr Clarke went on: "I was confident that it would when I had the Budget in November. I am more confident now because all the figures coming out show that we have restored confidence. The economy is growing in a way no other major economy in West Europe is." Mr Brown accused Mr Clarke and Mr Major of attempting to deceive the country. "The Conservatives are now making the biggest tax demands in history," he said. "The Chancellor cannot deceive his way out of the Tory tax embarrassment." Mr Townend echoed the views of many Tory backbenchers' when he said it was now "absolutely essential" that Mr Clarke should reduce taxes to at least the level they were in l992 and preferably lower, before the next election. "All those spending ministers who were saying it was more politically damaging to cut spending than to put up taxes have now seen their chickens coming home to roost," he added.
