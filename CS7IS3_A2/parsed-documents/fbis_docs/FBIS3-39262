Schoenhuber was the one who wanted the meeting, Streibl said. Since his decade-long personal contact with Schoenhuber had never been interrupted, he told himself: "Why not?" After all, after his resignation as minister president, he has had a number of talks with politicians from other parties. The contents of this personal talk with Schoenhuber was "neither secret nor political." They primarily discussed joint memories of the time when both of them worked closely with Franz Josef Strauss and Edmund Stoiber. Streibl denied any intention to leave the CSU and even to join the Republikaner. Streibl: "Schoenhuber did not try to persuade me at all." Bavarian Culture Minister Hans Zehetmair was "completely surprised" about Streibl's contacts with the Repulikaner. On the private SAT-1 television station, Zehetmair said that the Republikaner are the declared opponents of the CSU.
