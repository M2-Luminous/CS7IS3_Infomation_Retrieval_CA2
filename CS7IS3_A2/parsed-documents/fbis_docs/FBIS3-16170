Fuel and Energy Complex: Two Months' Results"] [Text] Despite the extremely grave financial crisis, the explosive situation in mining regions, the prestrike situation of the Tyumen oil workers, and the unusually cold February -- despite all these factors, Russia's fuel and energy complex is continuing to operate in fairly stable conditions. The reduction in energy resource production volumes is comparable to the rate of decline in 1993. This is demonstrated by current data on the work of the Russian Ministry of Fuel and Energy for the first two months of this year submitted by sector structures (see table). The decline in oil extraction, not counting extraction by joint enterprises, corresponds approximately to last year's level -- 12-14 percent. Among major joint-stock oil companies, "Surgutneftgaz" has seen the smallest reduction (20 percent). Regarding gas extraction, the picture is more rosy: Some of the decline (0.4 percent) is taking place at the expense of oil extraction associations, whereas the "Gazprom" Russian Joint-Stock Company has actually increased extraction slightly in comparison with last year (by 116 million cubic meters). Two associations that are not part of the "Gazprom" Russian Joint-Stock Company have increased extraction by even larger amounts -- the "Norilskgazprom" state enterprise (by 3 percent) and "Yakutgazprom" (by 12 percent). During January and February 1994 exports of Russian oil outside the Commonwealth were a few percentage points lower than last year's level, amounting in absolute terms to 11.5 million tonnes (about 20 percent of extraction). Russian gas exports to countries outside the Commonwealth was maintained at last year's level of 17.8 billion cubic meters (or 17 percent of extraction). Owing to the insolvency of consumers in the former USSR republics, volumes of oil and gas deliveries to these consumers have continued to decline. The former republics' debts for energy resources supplied as of 1 February 1994 were already 2.5 trillion rubles [R], of which R1.5 trillion are owed by Ukraine (including R1.2 trillion for supplies of natural gas), and R390 billion are owed by Belarus (of which R310 billion are for gas). The overall snowballing of the amount owed by consumers of the fuel and energy complex, which has already passed the R16-trillion mark, is bringing the complex to a standstill. It has no choice but to take the traditional chance that the debtors will pay up, or...shut off the oil spigots and gas valves on the pipes, which is what the "Gazprom" Russian Joint-Stock Company has already partially done in relation to Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova. It seems that this "incentive" for drawing partners into true market relations is starting to work. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | |February actual figure |January-February | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | |1994 |1993 |percent |1994 |1993 |percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |Extractio-|22.5 |27.5 |81.9 |49.8 |57.9 |86.1 | |n of oil | | | | | | | |and gas c-| | | | | | | |ondensate | | | | | | | |million t-| | | | | | | |onnes exc-| | | | | | | |luding ex-| | | | | | | |traction | | | | | | | |by joint | | | | | | | |enterpris-| | | | | | | |es | | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |Extractio-|51.6 |52.1 |99.2 |108.8 |109.2 |99.6 | |n of gas | | | | | | | |billions | | | | | | | |of cubic | | | | | | | |meters | | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |Extractio-|24.3 |26.6 |91.4 |49.0 |53.4 |91.7 | |n of coal | | | | | | | |million t-| | | | | | | |onnes | | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |Electrici-|71.8 |74.6 |96.2 |146.5 |154.0 |95.1 | |ty produc-| | | | | | | |tion acco-| | | | | | | |rding to | | | | | | | |Ministry | | | | | | | |of Fuel a-| | | | | | | |nd Energy,| | | | | | | | billions | | | | | | | |of kilowa-| | | | | | | |tt hours | | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
