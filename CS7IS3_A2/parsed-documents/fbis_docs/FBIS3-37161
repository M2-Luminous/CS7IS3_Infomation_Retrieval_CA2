The threat was made at a news conference here by Anatoly Ezhelev, president of the Emergency Committee for the Protection of the Press. The committee, formed last month by the Union of Russian Journalists, called on the government to take urgent measures to "save freedom of the press" by paying debts and subsidies it owes to state radio and television, as well as the country's largest newspapers. "People's right to receive news has become very expensive," said Ivan Laptev, president of Izvestia publishing house. President of Russian state radio-television Oleg Popchov said that the relationship between journalists and the government amounts to "a dialogue of the deaf." Half of Russia went without television programming on Thursday after communications companies went on strike over the government's refusal to pay an 80-billion ruble ($50 million) debt. The strike ended when the prime minister promised to pay the debt.
