Here with us is someone who will give us some details about the demonstration. It is already headed downtown. It left the assembly area approximately 15 minutes ago. They said they are headed downtown, and will pass by the Supreme Court of Justice and the Congress and will wind up at the National Palace. Let us listen: [Begin recording] [Unidentified person, shouting] [Words indistinct] [Celis] What is your name? [Tilin] Juan Tilin. [Celis] Why is this large number of peasants demonstrating? [Tilin] This is one of the demonstrations scheduled for today to continue to demand that the Government provide a concrete response to the petition we presented on 16 November demanding a minimum wage for farm workers. We made the formal request on 16 November to the government, to the Labor Ministry, to the proper officials so that we would get better wages for farm workers in view of the difficult moment we are experiencing. The most difficult economic situation is evidenced in the farms along the southern coast, in farms in diverse parts of the country where the workers don't even receive minimum wages. Furthermore, the treatment accorded to the workers is infrahuman. The Labor Ministry has done nothing up to now. That is the reason for this demonstration. [end recording] [Celis] We can tell you that at El Trebol there is a large group of peasants of the GAM [Mutual Support Group] who are waiting for the two groups coming from Aguilar Batres and Roosevelt Avenues to join them in order to march together to downtown. As we reported earlier, another large group of peasants is marching on the Salvador highway and another on the highway to the Atlantic. They will meet at the National Palace to submit their petitions to the president and tell him about the problems the farm workers in the interior are experiencing.
