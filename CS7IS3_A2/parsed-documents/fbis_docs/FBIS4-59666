The northerners, loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, captured al-'Anad airbase on Monday, opening the way for a push toward Aden, 50 kilometers (30 miles) to the south. "Fierce battles have raged around Al-'Anad since the early morning," said one of the witnesses. The southerners, backed by warplanes were "trying to push back the advance" of pro-Salih forces on the southern stronghold of Aden, said the witness. He added however, that northern forces seemed better equipped and more organized than their southern rivals. The northern troops, backed by tanks, artillery and anti-aircraft batteries, captured the base on Monday and cut off southern troops, an AFP photographer said. But the southerners later claimed to have recaptured the base, and the intensity of Tuesday's fighting made it impossible to say who was in control. Southern warplanes were bombing the newly-won northern positions, defying anti-aircraft fire. The two sides lurched into civil war on May 5, after months of arguing over how to run the country, formed from the unification in May 1990 of conservative North Yemen and poorer, Marxist South Yemen.
