It is the first visit by the Czech Republic's defense minister to France since the division of the former Czechoslovakia. It aims to emphasize the new shape of French-Czech relations in the military sphere in the spirit of the agreement on cooperation between the two countries' armed forces which was concluded by France and Czechoslovakia in April 1992 and which has been assumed by the Czech Republic, a source close to the Czech delegation told CTK. Baudys, Chief of the Czech Army General Staff Jiri Nekvasil, Director General of the Defense Ministry Foreign Affairs Division Jaromir Novotny and other members of the delegation are discussing with their French colleagues the questions of European security and some specific forms of cooperation. The delegation will focus on the preparation of French-Czech joint military exercises which are to be held in both countries this June. The joint exercises will mark a fundamental change in military relations between the Czech Republic and France. In the Cold War period the French Army was charged with the assignment of occupying the Czech lands in case of a war conflict. During the visit Baudys will be shown French combat and communication equipment. He will visit, for example, a base of Mirage-2000 jets and the Matra firm. At a meeting with Leotard this evening Baudys will discuss the situation in the former Yugoslavia. Czech participation in the celebrations to mark the Western Allies' landing in Normandia in 1944 will probably also be discussed.
