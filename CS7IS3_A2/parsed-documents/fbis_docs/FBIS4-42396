However, Bonn Government spokesman Dieter Vogel said on Monday [30 May] that there has not been a formal agreement with the other partner countries to give up the earliest possible date possible under the Maastricht Treaty, 1997, and to start monetary union not before 1999. At the Franco-German Financial and Economic Council in Mulhouse (Alsace), Finance Minister Theo Waigel said that Germany would fulfill the Maastricht criterion regarding the deficit quota by 1996 at the latest. In the medium term, the conditions for the debt level would be achieved, too. According to Vogel, Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who also attended the Franco-German summit in Mulhouse, left no doubt that stability in European Union countries must have precedence over the timetable. In financial circles in Bonn, it has been said that under the Maastricht Treaty it has actually been clear that the majority of partner countries could not fulfill all criteria for debt level, deficits, and interests before the second possible deadline in 1999.
