Quotas of Chinese imports are even lower than in 1993, so that trade deals that have already been concluded can no longer be implemented. Last but not least, virtually no orders can be placed because it is not known how many import permits will be issued. This is endangering the existence of importers. All this can be blamed on EU errors in the management of quotas. The restrictive practice is jeopardizing export chances.
