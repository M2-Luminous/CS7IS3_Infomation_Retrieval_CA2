This amendment is being referred to as the law on bilingual signs. We have asked Pal Csaky, chairman of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH] Club of Deputies, whether the Hungarian coalition will support the bill in parliament. [Csaky] We have proposed several times that the limit be lowered to 10 percent. We did not propose this for the sake of the Hungarian minority, but in the interest of the other ethnic minorities in the Slovak Republic. Should, however, only a limit of 20 percent guarantee the passage of this much-needed law, we will accept this and will give our support to the bill. I hope that the bill will be passed, although there are still some problems. These should be sorted out predominantly at the political level. [Pankovcinova] What problems do you have in mind? [Csaky] The list of admissible names in the language of minorities that is to constitute a separate supplement to the law will contain the Slovak and Hungarian names of communities. Experts are now holding discussions on what name to give every community. I do not consider this approach fortunate. The name that is being used at present should be accepted, in my opinion. After all, the law's objective is to calm passions and to give citizens a feeling of being at home. [Pankovcinova] You are talking about calming passions. Are you not afraid of the opposite? When the same bill was discussed in the National Council of the Slovak Republic several months ago, the plenum approved the motion by a Slovak National Party deputy that the limit be raised to 30 percent, which eventually blocked the bill's passage. Is there no danger of the same situation recurring? [Csaky] The 20 percent limit is the maximum in Europe. In Finland, for example, the limit is 7 percent. Slovakia is in store for a bitter election struggle, in which everything, including this law, will be used and misused. This is also signalled by the counter-proposal put forward by deputy J. Rea (Movement for a Democratic Slovakia). This counter-proposal only repeats the proposals made by the former government of Vladimir Meciar, which are unacceptable to us. I am calling for wisdom and tolerance. If we really think that Slovak society should become more democratic, then no one can object when, at the points of entry and exit of a community, the name of the community is given also in the language of the minority. The Slovak name will remain the official name of the community that will be used on maps, in telephone directories, bus and train schedules, etc., even though former Minister of Transportation and Communications Hofbauer misleads the public by claiming the opposite.
