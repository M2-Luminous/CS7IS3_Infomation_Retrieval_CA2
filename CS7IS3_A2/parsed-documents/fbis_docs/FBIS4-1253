There are reports that the UNITA team has demanded that the Electoral Law be reviewed. Alves Antonio, our correspondent in the Zambian capital, reports: [Begin Antonio recording] Good evening. At the Lusaka peace talks UNITA has defended the need to review the Electoral Law. The specific principles contained in the point on the conclusion of the presidential elections has continued to dominate the talks. The two teams again met alone today in a bid to find ways and methods to overcome the stalemate. Though the practical results of the meeting are not known yet, official sources believe that the government and UNITA teams are about to strike an understanding. Meanwhile, Radio Angola learned earlier this evening that UNITA is now pushing for a review of some chapters in the Electoral Law. The United Nations has rejected that request. The United Nations believes that respect must be shown for Angolan sovereignty and for this country's democratic institutions. In view of that, the Electoral Law review now requested by UNITA will be entirely up to the Angolan Parliament where, incidentally, 60 seats are reserved for UNITA. Official sources close to the talks have said that UNITA's request has been set aside. Other reliable sources have told Radio Angola that this country's Electoral Law is a perfect [as heard] document that is superior to similar laws in many other countries. In view of that, those sources regard the review of that document as inopportune. They also noted that UNITA itself had helped draw up the Electoral Law. Meanwhile, the United Nations has already expressed an interest in providing material and financial assistance to the process of the second round of presidential elections. Such assistance would include participation by observer, security, control, and verification personnel. There is the belief that the Lusaka peace talks may experience new developments within the next few days. It is a matter of waiting and seeing. [end recording]
