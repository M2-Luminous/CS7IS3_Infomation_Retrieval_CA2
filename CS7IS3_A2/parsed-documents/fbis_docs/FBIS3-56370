Turning back to the Russo-American summit in Moscow, he noted that its main task to hold it in the conditions of mature partnership was completed. "The main sensation of the summit is the absence of a sensation. We are proceeding to institutional and systematic partnership," Kozyrev stressed. In his opinion, the Moscow meeting marked a stage in the development of smooth Russo-American trade. He singled out "the uranium bargain" as supplementary to the space deal and said that both contracts covered a long period (10-15years) and could fetch billions in profit. He noted that in Moscow the presidents also discussed economic partnership. "In economics, partnership means something other than a short-term credit or a portion of humanitarian aid. It's day-to- day work to integrate markets in international systems rather than to "patch up a hole." It means negotiations with a long prospective and realization that Russia is a great economic power. That's precisely what was done at the Moscow summit, Kozyrev said. He specifically stressed that "least of all" did he regard the Russo-American-Ukrainian understandings as the chief result of President Clinton's visit to Russia. The agreements concerning the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine "are important, but they will bear fruit only during their implementation. There is nothing new in these accords," he said. Kozyrev recalled the signing of similar accords with Ukraine. "At a CIS summit in Almaty two years ago, an agreement was signed to oblige Ukraine to follow Belarus and Kazakhstan in becoming a nuclear- free country and remove weapons... Then, numerous meetings followed in Crimea, Moscow, Kiev, etc. Interaction on this problem with Americans is nothing new either since the Lisbon protocol was signed with U.S participation." Nonetheless, Kozyrev hopes that now when the accords are fixed at the level of Russian, American, and Ukrainian presidents, they will yield result. "All of us are full of optimism. It would be strange, if the agreements, signed by the presidents, remained on paper," he noted.
