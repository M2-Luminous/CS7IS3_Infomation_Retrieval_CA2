FR940503-0-00026 FR940503-0-00007 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;ACE&hyph;06] Establishment of Class E Airspace; Sullivan, MO, Sullivan Regional Airport AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action establishes Class E airspace at the Sullivan Regional Airport, Sullivan, Missouri. The development of a standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) at the Sullivan Regional Airport, Sullivan, Missouri, utilizing a new nondirectional beacon (NDB) has made this action necessary. Controlled airspace extending from 700 to 1200 feet above ground level (AGL) is needed. For aircraft executing the approach. The area will be depicted on aeronautical charts to provide a reference for pilots operating in the area. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 u.t.c., June 23, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dale L. Carnine, Airspace Specialist, System Management Branch, ACE&hyph;530b, Federal Aviation Administration, 601 East 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106; telephone number: (816) 426&hyph;3408. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On January 7, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class E airspace at the Sullivan Regional Airport, Sullivan, Missouri (59 FR 4611). Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. This amendment is the same as the proposed in the notice. Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above ground level are published in paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A, dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) establishes Class E airspace at Sullivan, Missouri, extending from 700 feet AGL to 1200 feet AGL. The development of a SIAP based on a new NDB located on the Sullivan Regional Airport, Sullivan, Missouri, made this proposal necessary. The intended effect of this rule is to provide adequate Class E airspace for aircraft executing the NDB SIAP at Sullivan Regional Airport. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a ``significant rule'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulation Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
