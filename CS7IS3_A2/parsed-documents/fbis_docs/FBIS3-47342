"By almost any measure, be it the stock of foreign investment in Japan as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), or the import penetration of foreign manufactured goods, Japan's economy is markedly less open than any other developed economy," said Joan Spero, under secretary of state for economic, business and agricultural affairs. Spero is on a four-day visit to Japan to push stalled talks on a bilateral trade framework before U.S. President Bill Clinton meets Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Washington on February 11. "Quite frankly, progress to date in the talks has been disappointing," Spero told a news conference at the Japan National Press Club. "We are looking for real results in these (framework) talks and not cosmetic agreements." Saying Japan is responsible for 60 percent of the U.S. global trade deficit, Spero added, "clearly, there is something wrong in the basic structure of our economic relationship." "While this imbalance is due in part to broad macroeconomic forces, it also is a consequence of the structural relationship between Japan and the global economy, and the inadequate market access that foreign firms encounter in Japan," she said. Spero dismissed what she views as "repetitive and inaccurate claims" going around in pubic debate in Japan in the past few months that Washington is seeking specific market share targets. Spero said, "This misinformation, or disinformation, has obscured an understanding of the purpose of the framework." She said the framework is aimed at addressing macroeconomic imbalances, reducing sectoral and structural barriers and promoting an open and freer economy in Japan. During the July 1993 talks between Clinton and then Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, Tokyo committed itself to "significantly" decrease its current account surplus and expand its global imports of goods and services, she said. In order to correct chronic economic imbalances and market access problems, Japan and the United States agreed last July to come up with "a variety of qualitative and quantitative indicators" to assess whether they are "moving in the right direction," Spero said, calling for "results" in specific bilateral trade areas like autos and financial services. "These are changes that will benefit not just foreign firms but Japanese as well," she said. Elaborating on the indicators as sought by the U.S. under the July accord, Spero cited U.S. auto dealers planning to operate in Japan. As a quantitative measurement, the number of U.S. auto dealerships should increase in Japan, she said. But qualitative aspects, such as their location and how they are operated, are also important, she added. "The constant portrayal by some Japanese that our framework proposals are managed trade is wrong. Our goal is to unmanage trade in Japan, not to manage it," she said. It is not time for the two countries to discuss whether or not they have agreed to adopt trade measurements but it is time for them to "get down and begin serious discussion" on ways to open specific markets, she said. Spero voiced hope that ongoing negotiations between Japan's ruling coalition parties and the opposition camp on political reforms will not hinder progress in Japan-U.S. trade talks.
