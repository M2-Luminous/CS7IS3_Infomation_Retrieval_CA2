Addressing a session of the Supreme Soviet of his unrecognised republic, he claimed that the said forces were "deliberately destabilising the financial situation on the left-hand bank of the Dniester River, striving to make Tiraspol more tractable in the talks on the withdrawal of the Russian 14th Army and on problems linked with its property". The Dniester parliament today discussed the acute money shortage in the region. Tiraspol had refused to use Moldovan leis on its territory and decided to leave in circulation the Soviet money, annulled in all the CIS republics. This resulted in the catastrophic destabilisation of the financial system and led to the growth of inflation. "The 60 billion roubles now in circulation are not enough to meet current expenses," Chairman of the Dniester Bank Vyacheslav Zagryadskiy told the parliament. He said that the government should deliver to Tiraspol the new money printed in Russia for the Dniester region. But "this cannot be done now due to the ban imposed by the Russian leadership," he noted. The Dniester parliament decided to address an appeal to the Russian president, the State Duma and the Council of the Federation, asking them to help the Dniester administration solve the problem of cash money.
