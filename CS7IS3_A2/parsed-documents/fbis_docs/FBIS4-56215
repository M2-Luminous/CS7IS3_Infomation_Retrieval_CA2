FBIS4-56215 "drlat084_a_94019" FBIS-LAT-94-084 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Vice Foreign Minister on `Harassment' Vice Foreign Minister on `Harassment' FL2904214094 Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 1700 GMT 29 Apr 94 FL2904214094 Havana Radio Rebelde Network Spanish BFN [Text] In an interview with reporters, Vice Foreign Minister Isabel Allende gave her very personal impressions regarding the harassment that Magda Montiel, participant in the Nation and the Emigre Community conference, is suffering in Miami. Journalist Roberto Cavada recorded part of the interview with Allende. [Begin Allende recording] In the first place, I was very surprised that Magda Montiel was being harassed simply for having come to Cuba for the Nation and the Emigre Community conference, a meeting that had clear and specific goals: to find formulas to normalize relations, find paths, and listen to the emigre community. Those emigres came from all over the world. They came to express ideas which have been considered by the Cuban Government. As a result of her participation -- at least from what I heard on Cuban radio during the interview with Magda -- she is now in a very difficult situation. Magda sounded very upset and I believe I even heard a child crying in the background. I believe this is incredible and I believe any honorable human being would feel the same way. It is a behavior that only right-wing extremists could have, people who are obviously very far from being faithful to principles that they claim to defend around the world: principles such as pluralism, freedom of speech, and freedom to be faithful to one's principles. I believe Magda Montiel has been faithful to her principles. She has principles and ideas, and she came here to express those ideas, not to agree with ours. Let us assume that one of our ideas were involved -- and I am not saying that is the case -- but let us assume that Magda were to agree with one of our ideas. Is that a crime? Is that a felony? Is that sufficient reason to harass her as people were harassed during fascist times or during the most reactionary periods? I am truly appalled by this. I believe that what is happening in Miami, far from benefiting the far right, in the long run -- and I am saying in the long run, which is my personal opinion -- will make many people ask questions, not only in the United States, but outside of the United States. It should make thousands of Cubans in Miami, and in all parts of the world, who did not attend the meeting or were not interested in the meeting ask why people behave this way. [end recording]
