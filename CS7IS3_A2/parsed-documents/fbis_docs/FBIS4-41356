I will answer laconically: I see Ukraine as an independent and prosperous state ruled by law and order, by decency and professionalism. Only such societies are viable, in which human dignity is the highest criterion. The level of civilization in such societies is determined by their attitude toward their own history, regardless of how tragic that history may be. We will not be given another version of history. The most grave sin is to mock the memory of past generations for the sake of a momentary political gain. The biblical story of Ham, who was damned for his disrespect for his father in a moment of weakness, can be applied at any time. The same refers to the simultaneously blessed Japhet and Shem, who "turned their faces so that they would not see their father's nakedness." My concern for Ukraine is not a concern for antiquated things, Cossack's breeches, and parochialism; it is a problem of making fresh gains -- from declared "independenceness" [nezalezhnitsvo] to economic self-sufficiency which is a prerequisite for safeguarding our real sovereignty. To accomplish this task, I formulate my program according to the principle paraphrased in John Kennedy's well-known statement: "Ask not what Ukraine can do for you; ask what you can do for Ukraine." I know that -- owing to some "knights of the pen," who "neatly" extracted one convenient phrase out of context -- I am being portrayed as an unsuccessful prime minister who, so to say, has been trying to clarify for a long time exactly what type of society we shall build. In the end, he resigned without having grasped anything. Nothing could be further from the truth! It was not up to the prime minister, but up to the Supreme Council to determine the model of society we wish to build. The president had to say his meaningful word, too. The prime minister, as chief executive, had to be only informed of the general doctrine. The law is the law -- the activity of every branch has to be performed within the limits of their plenary powers. Every epoch -- especially an interim one -- should have its philosophical concept and principles. Without these principles, government activities transform themselves into a daily routine of "trial and error." Furthermore, the people can become a nation only if they are united by a common idea, if they are assured of their historical destiny. This should have been determined immediately and without delay. The traditions of our society and the conclusions of our leading sociologists should have also been taken into account. Our sociologists conclude that our people, as a whole, are deprived of national consciousness. They have no clear social direction for the future. Their new ideal, a strategic goal, is proposed primarily by making comparisons with other, more prosperous countries. Unfortunately, this is not done on the basis of their own historical experience. Ukraine, yet again in its tragic history, has come to a crossroads. That national ideal, which was proposed on 1 December 1991, exhausted itself the very next day. Still, it was formulated precisely: independence and separation from Moscow. What next? What form of government should we adopt: presidential or parliamentary? What state: unitarian or federal? What final form of social, political, and economic system is desired by Ukraine? What role in the production process has to be granted to private business, the state, and corporate entities? Which model of social protection and market regulations is more attractive? Will Ukraine maintain (and if the answer is "yes," then by what means) its orientation toward socialist values (which have become an everyday reality in the majority of EC countries), or, on the contrary, will it gravitate toward the system of capitalist competition, of which the United States is a model? These questions cannot be avoided. All these options were endlessly and fruitlessly argued. In the end, a state of uncertainty prevailed. At best, this uncertainty bears witness to intellectual weakness and professional incompetence of the ruling elite. At worst, it was the consequence of direct sabotage on the part of certain forces seeking to fish in murky waters. Some high officials of the ruling elite tried to compensate for their lack of constructive ideas by forcing conflicts concerning problems arising between former USSR countries over territorial and military issues. It was the time when the imperial itching had just started to develop in our neighbor country. For some time, external factors drew public opinion away from internal problems, but it has only reaped dubious dividends. This was not a "horse" on which we could ride into the world community. Valuable time was being lost, while our young Ukrainian statehood was sucked more and more into the whirlpool of economic crisis imported, to a great extent, from the "Gaydarized" [pun on Russia's former prime minister name] Russia by Ukrainian supporters of the IMF model. The content and direction of the IMF model is intended to bring the technologically backward countries of the former USSR into the global market after the devastation of all their enterprises and branches capable of competition with Western firms. Regions of the former USSR were to produce only those commodities which were disadvantageous for the West (due to their lack of profit potential or lack of raw materials) or undesirable due to environmental reasons. Ukraine was to assume the role of Europe's backyard. The former Soviet nomenklatura, which had come into power in the newly created republics along with "businessmen" of the shadow economy, supported this model joyously, seeing an opportunity to "grabatize" statehood and share it with foreigners. Millions of working people were facing, after the abolishment of collective exploitation by the CPSU nomenklatura, the "bright" prospect of working for the new masters of appropriated enterprises. The ruling elite of the newly created states were to protect the newly born capitalism by means of severe restrictive measures until nouveau riches would be so efficient as to pay decent wages for their employees. However, how long would it take for our "wild capitalism" to assume a "humane face?!" The model of forced liberalization, which was thrust on us by the West, ignored the fact that mass bankruptcies can trigger a social explosion. Now, workers are facing only one alternative -- to become either nationalist extremists or leftist radicals. This is already a dangerous thing. Today's society is showing signs of hysteria on the one hand, and decline, apathy, and even doom -- on the other. Does one need any other evidence of a catastrophic situation of our society in addition to widely known facts testifying to the polarization of wealth and misery? If so, then let us take a look around: A blind desire to get rich and the bustling activity of mainly professionally incompetent people, who attempt to rule the state and build the market, are introducing chaos and profanity into society. Variations of this profanity could be heard in the arias of "the Varangian guest" on the attractiveness of an absolutely free society, in which the state assumes only the role of a "night watchman." It is high time to start living by our own wits, because overseas "well-wishers" take care of their own interests first. Ukraine has to rely more on its own resources, proceeding from the fact that one year (and, all the more, 11 months when I was prime minister) is not enough time for a minimal stabilization period. To put an end to general disintegration and pilfering, we should realize the following (and this is supported by the experience of those countries which have overcome their low level of social differentiation and specialization): The state will be forced to use stringent measures for securing law and order, as well as legal sanctions against those violating the "rules of the game" established by the state in the realm of business, the pilfering of national wealth, and neglecting the norms of social life. Let us not forget that habitual, moral, and legal regulators in force in developed Western countries were attained over the course of many centuries. Thus, the minimum program for Ukraine consists of the implementation of a "social state" doctrine oriented toward overcoming social erosion and the structural ambiguity of society. The emphasis is being placed here on safeguarding equal rights for all sectors of the economy -- private, cooperative, state, and corporate -- along with guarantees for the essential needs of citizens in the sphere of health care, education, and pensions. The building of the "social market economy" is a program of the utmost importance for Ukraine, which will be carried out simultaneously with the view for a more stable period, following the creation of conditions for efficient economic activities of the people who have already acquired necessary commercial, professional, and other habits after the narcosis of totalitarianism. Thus, the key issue today is not that of a social ideal, but of a concrete model for social relations during the stabilization period. Taking into account the fact that a split with society along the "socialism-capitalism" line again looms, the issue should be shifted from the "either-or" opposition to the personal level. People who adhere to some principle or another should have the freedom of choice within the borders of one state, just as it is in China (one state, but two social systems) or, for instance, in Israel (private sector, but also collective farms -- kibbutzzim). We should make our way into a new system of coordinates: We have lived, and we will continue to live, in the immediate future under the circumstances of a multisystem society with private (domestic as well as foreign) and other (state, corporate, and cooperative) sectors on the principles of equal rights for all forms of property. The interests of these systems will be defended by political parties which, in the end, will find their social basis. A democratic state, oriented toward the social protection of its citizens, will assume the role of a director in the competition of social groups; it will be also authorized to soften the ruthlessness and anarchy of the market in the period of initial capital accumulation. In the private sector, where the efficiency of labor is higher (as well as the exploitation of hired workers), wages will be higher, as well. At state enterprises, work will be easier and the level of social protection will be higher, but wages -- lower. This does not represent any discrimination, because even in the most democratic societies people are born with equal rights, but with different possibilities, talents, and capabilities of intensive work. One thing must be guaranteed -- the man should have the right to choose, while the state has to safeguard this right in all its aspects. Such an idea of Ukraine's own way can be productive during an interim, stabilization period, when the idea of socialism has already lost its former charm, whereas the idea of capitalism still looms. However, one should take pains to prevent this idea from assuming a grotesque "all-Ukrainian" form, which would evoke a negative reaction on the part of other ethnic groups in our state and discredit the Ukrainian idea in general. We should get rid of that peculiar complex of isolationism and mistaken treatment of independence, which were born by the long period when our national pride was hurt. We should get rid of that "independenceness" which continues to fence us off from the world with a wall of parochial egoism and spiritual outmodedness. It is necessary to make way for a qualitatively new level of consciousness of a statesman advocating independence -- this man should not be afraid of self-realization in the processes of global and regional integration in the sphere of business, social activity, and culture. Only the implementation of the slogan "Ukraine without hirelings is a Ukraine of proprietors" can, in the end, safeguard decency and order in the privatization process, and henceforth -- trust in the forces of our people and the might of our state. It has already become proverbial that the foundation of any state is, in the first place, the so-called middle class. These circumstances will not be created by themselves, whereas the inactivity of the state, incapable of choosing its own course, as we all see, leads to social chaos. The signs of a catastrophic situation of the Ukrainian economy are increasing in number; this jeopardizes the political gains of independence and the very possibility of advancing toward a civilized society. The situation of a "wild market," in which, owing to financial machinations, "fat cats" are making their fortunes, is a challenge for the worker who attaches the improvement of living to honest and competent work as well as to the desire to live in a society guided by human values. Ukraine can be led out of the crisis only by millions of farmers, workers of industry, health care, science, education, and culture, as well as by civilized entrepreneurs whose honest work should have been morally and materially stimulated by the state long ago. For the time being, the reforms have not activated this principal source of national revival; they did not produce a stimuli for investments in the development of production as well as in undertaking activities in industry; they did not persuade common people to work honestly and with full commitment. This is why I do not have the least doubt that wide segments of the population will support the slogan of "law and order." Moreover, to clamber out of the abyss of Mafia-like anarchy, the people will demand the introduction of firmer forms of state life with a high level of personalized responsibility at all levels of power. Such is the demand of the interim period. Without safeguarding these circumstances, there will be no civilized Ukraine. This has been, and remains, my stance.
