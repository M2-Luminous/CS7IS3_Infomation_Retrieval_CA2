CPPCC members have given play to democracy, pooled their wisdom, and offered many good opinions and proposals that have a bearing on the overall situation. This shows the province's CPPCC members have made progress in grasping and discussing state affairs and doing substantial work, and democratic parties, mass organizations, and CPPCC members have played an increasingly important role in the scientific and democratic decisionmaking of the provincial party committee and government. Pu Chaozhu said: Facts show that Yunnan's CPPCC work has realized pleasing conversion in three aspects, namely: In participating in government and discussing state affairs, CPPCC members have changed from grasping directly perceived and partial issues to grasping major events and state affairs; they have changed from giving play to the individual's role in participating in government and discussing state affairs to giving play to the collective roles of democratic parties; and changed from their proposals being loosely connected with practical work to direct, good, proposals. Pu Chaozhu dealt with understanding in the current situation, readjustment of the industrial setup, Yunnan's economic development, further giving play to the roles of the CPPCC and united front, and further augmenting and improving party leadership in CPPCC work.
