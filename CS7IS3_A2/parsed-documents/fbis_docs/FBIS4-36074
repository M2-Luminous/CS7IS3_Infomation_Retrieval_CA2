Another 1,200 northern troops have been reported missing while 901 are being held prisoner by southern forces backing Salih's rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid, a military spokesman told the northern-controlled SABA' news agency. He said the number of prisoners being held in "concentration camps in Aden" had been supplied by the International Committee of the Red Cross. It was the first official, if partial, toll to be given since fighting broke out on May 5. Late Saturday a southern leader said in Cairo that 80,000 people had been killed, wounded or made homeless in the fighting, without giving a breakdown.
