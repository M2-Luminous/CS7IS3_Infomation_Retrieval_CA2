The amendments were passed with 72 votes for, one against and six abstentions. Under the law, a group of half a million citizens will be able to put forward their proposal for a new constitution within three months after the amended law comes into force. The passed amendments also provide for a possibility of holding a nation-wide referendum on basic principles of the future system of the state. The amendments also oblige the National Assembly to use all constitutional bills prepared by the previous Sejm and Senate. Senator Jerzy Madej, independent, the only opponent of the amendments, pointed to the fact that should they be adopted, the time of work on a new constitution would be elongated. The argument came up frequently in the discussion but finally the senators decided that the public should participate in the work on a constitution. Also on Thursday, the Senate unanimously decided to put forward an amendment to the law on the relations between the state and the Evangelical-Augsburg (Lutheran) and Evangelical-Reformed (Calvinist) Churches. The amendment provides that donations for the churches' charity work would be exempted from tax. For the Roman-Catholic and Orthodox churches the right has already been legislated. The senators stressed in the discussion that churches should have equal rights in Poland and praised the civil virtues of the Protestant churches. The Senate will meet for the next session on April 28 to discuss the report of the ombudsman on his work and the Senate's amendment to the law on unemployment. The Senate is also to decide then whether Senator Andrzej Gawronik, a businessman, should be deprived of his immunity and stand trial.
