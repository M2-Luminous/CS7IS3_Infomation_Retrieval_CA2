In Kossuth Radio's Late Evening Chronicle on 2 January, Orban added that, although this is only an "experiment of thoughts" without knowing the number of mandates, it is a politically feasible version. Especially because many factors are pushing events in this direction. According to Orban, his party would not take part in a coalition that is organized on the basis of the Hungarian Socialist Party's [MSZP] program, and would not happily participate in one that is guided by the MDF's economic program. Reacting to Orban's statement that a FIDESZ-MDF-SZDSZ-KDNP big coalition could be established after the 1994 elections, Attila Zsigmond, spokesman for the MDF's parliamentary group, said that many more hypotheses and coalition versions will be mentioned in the coming months. Therefore, until the first round of the elections is over, we need not attribute much significance to this suggestion, either, and he added that "we do not wish to fire at clay pigeons." As a matter of fact, six weeks ago, MDF Administrative Chairman Sandor Lezsak said that the FIDESZ's anti-church attitude makes it completely unsuitable for the MDF to consider a coalition with it. "The KDNP will not make any written or verbal agreements or contracts, be it secret or open, with anyone before the elections, and it is too early to talk about events that will come after," Vaszlo Varga, deputy chairman of the KDNP said in reply to our correspondent's question. "We pay special attention to ensuring that the KDNP participates independently in the elections. It is our firm view that we can only decide with whom we enter a coalition after the election results and the programs are known. Any other news to the contrary is a figment of imagination," Varga said. SZDSZ Chairman Ivan Peto is rather fed up with the coalition speculations. In his view, some people are constantly opening and closing doors in the rather drafty domestic political life -- however, these approaches and alienations cannot really be interpreted until the country is past at least the first round of the elections. As a matter of fact, the FIDESZ chairman has many times said that, in his view, a liberal bloc would be the optimal solution, which means that he would not be very happy to form a coalition with the MDF. Then he said that they are also open toward the KDNP and the MDF but did not completely rule out cooperation with the MSZP, either -- although it is also true that, in the meantime, he warned the SZDSZ that should it join ranks with the possibly victorious socialists after the elections, it would turn into a small MSZP. "When we -- or others -- would be threatened by turning into a small or big Christian or nationalist party, Orban could not exactly say but I hope that we will be able to avert the lurking danger even without his advice," Peto said. According to MSZP member Laszlo Kovacs, it is difficult to make out what the FIDESZ chairman is up to. "A few weeks ago when, in an interview with a German newspaper, [then interior minister] Peter Boross did not exclude the possibility of an MDF-FIDESZ coalition, Orban was talking about provocation." "I believe that a party first has to be successful at the elections, has to win them, and only then is it worth deciding about the coalition partners," Kovacs continued. "In my view, the FIDESZ is doing exactly the opposite. It is probably trying to compensate for its continuously decreasing popularity in recent months by distancing itself from the MSZP." Kovacs thought it possible that the MSZP might be forced into opposition even if it wins the elections. Should this happen, in his view, it will mean that the parliamentary parties do not accept the will of the electors, namely that the majority would like to see the representatives of the winning party in government.
