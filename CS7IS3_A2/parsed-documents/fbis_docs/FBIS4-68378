It was signed by the city's mayor, Anatoliy Sobchak, the president of the Union of the Association of Enterprises, Viktor Kharchanko, and the chairman of the Trade Union Federation, Yevgeniy Makarov. The parties agreed on joint actions regarding questions of socioeconomic policy, regulation of labor relations, provision of the necessary guarantees for workers, and prevention of labor conflicts. In particular, the agreement envisions prompt payment of wages. If there is a delay of payment for a period of more than a month, for workers of enterprises financed from the state budget, the amounts that are delayed will be indexed taking into account the higher consumer prices during this period. Upon signing the agreement St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak noted that last year such an agreement was completely justified and the city avoided large conflicts and strikes.
