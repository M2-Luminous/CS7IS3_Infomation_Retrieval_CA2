Mitric: "They Want `Radio Station'"] [Text] Two national parties of the Hungarians and the Croats are "spiting" the state of Serbia and "making waves" in the domestic and international public in order to reheat the demand for [word indistinct] autonomy of the Hungarians and the cultural autonomy of the Croats from Tivat to Subotica. The Serbian Constitutional Court has, so far, quashed four failed decisions of the Subotica assembly and, some time soon, it is supposed to discuss the statute according to which the Croatian language is in official use in Subotica. When this decision was being passed recently, Jelisaveta Palfi, who was the secretary of the communal assembly then, warned the councillors that these proposals do not adhere to the Constitution and the law and for doing so she earned "a dismissal" at one of the following sessions of the communal assembly. Her fate was shared by Erika Sarvat-Barati, secretary of the communal assembly in Senta, whom the councillors suspended from work merely because she warned them that they cannot annul the Serbian laws and Constitution by raising their hands. Milovan Salatic, president of the district court in Subotica says that with the introduction of the Croatian language as an official one, the FRY Constitution has been violated: "The Constitution stipulates that the Serbian language of the ekavian and ijekavian diction and the Cyrillic script is officially used in FRY. On the territories inhabited by the ethnic minorities, their languages and scriptures are in the official use too, in accordance with the law. However, here in Subotica it is not the Hungarian language that is controversial, but the Croatian. The FRY did not internationally recognize Croatia nor has Croatia recognized Yugoslavia, and thus the Croats in Yugoslavia do not have the status of an ethnic minority. For the time being, they are merely citizens of Serbia," Salatic says. Even after the placement of the third advertisement, the councillors Hungarians and Croats did not endorse the appointment of the current editor, Slavica Lakicevic, to the post of chief editor [of the radio]. As the sole "publicly stated" reason they quoted an editor's "blunder" when Zeljko Raznjatovic Arkan appeared as a guest on the Serbian program. "Disregarding the national and political implications of such a decision and its unconstitutionality, a question emerges as to how [words indistinct] carry out such a decision," Slavica Lakicevic, chief editor of the Serbian program, wonders. The employees of Radio Subotica are dissatisfied that the founder is "disciplining" them. They have received maximum support from their listeners, especially Bunjevci [ethnic group of supposedly Croatian origins -- English term unknown] who, calling into the program yesterday, claimed that they actually did not know the Croatian language. "Wherever the Democratic Community of Vojvodina Hungarians has power, with the help of their sympathizers they are passing the decision to suit their "[word indistinct]" so that when the minorities are in question, political tensions would constantly be present in Serbia, while there are portraying the abolition of these unlawful decisions of theirs to the world as a threat to their minority rights," Dragan Bozinovic, the governor of the Sava-Backa district, says. "With such decisions, they openly demonstrate their desire to be "a state." Bozinovic believes that had the Serbian Constitutional Court been more expeditious in assessing the constitutionality and legality of the Statute of the Subotica commune, this latest "scandal" about the Croatian language entering the program of the Radio Subotica "through the back door" would have been avoided. However, [words indistinct] yesterday after the creation of "a case," president of the commune Jozef Kasa raised his voice and stated that the Serbian program of the Radio Subotica is interpreting the decisions of the assembly arbitrarily, misrepresenting them deliberately.
