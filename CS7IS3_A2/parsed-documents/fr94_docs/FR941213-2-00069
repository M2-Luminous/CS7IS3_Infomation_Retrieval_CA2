FR941213-2-00069 FR941213-2-00045 [Docket Nos. 50&hyph;277 and 50&hyph;278] In the Matter of: Philadelphia Electric Company, et al. Exemption I. Philadelphia Electric Company, et al. (PECo, the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License Nos. DPR&hyph;44 and DPR&hyph;56, which authorize operation of the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, (PBAPS) Units 2 and 3. The licenses provide, among other things, that the license is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the Commission now or hereinafter in effect. The facility consists of two boiling water reactors located in York County, Pennsylvania. II. It is stated in 10 CFR 73.55, ``Requirements for physical protection of licensed activities in nuclear power reactors against radiological sabotage,'' paragraph (a), that ``The licensee shall establish and maintain an onsite physical protection system and security organization which will have as its objective to provide high assurance that activities involving special nuclear material are not inimical to the common defense and security and do not constitute an unreasonable risk to the public health and safety.'' It is specified in 10 CFR 73.55(d), ``Access Requirements,'' paragraph (1), that ``The licensee shall control all points of personnel and vehicle access into a protected area.'' It is specified in 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) that ``A numbered picture badge identification system shall be used for all individuals who are authorized access to protected areas without escort *␣*␣*'' It also states that an individual not employed by the licensee (i.e., contractors) may be authorized access to protected areas without escort provided the individual ``receives a picture badge upon entrance into the protected area which must be returned upon exit from the protected area *␣*␣*'' The licensee propose to implement an alternative unescorted access control system which would eliminate the need to issue and retrieve badges at each entrance/exit location and would allow all individuals with unescorted access to keep their badge with them when departing the site. An exemption from 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) is required to allow contractors who have unescorted access to take their badges offsite instead of returning them when exiting the site. By letter dated September 8, 1994, the licensee requested an exemption from certain requirements of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) for this purpose. III. Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.5, ``Specific exemptions,'' the Commission may, upon application of any interested person or upon its own initiative, grant such exemptions in this part as it determines are authorized by law and will not endanger life or property or the common defense and security, and are otherwise in the public interest. Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55, the Commission may authorize a licensee to provide measures for protection against radiological sabotage provided the licensee demonstrates that the measures have ``the same high assurance objective'' and meet ``the general performance requirements'' of the regulation, and ``the overall level of system performance provides protection against radiological sabotage equivalent'' to that which would be provided by the regulation. At the PBAPS site, unescorted access into protected areas is controlled through the use of a photograph on a combination badge and keycard. (Hereafter, these are referred to as badge). The security officers at the entrance station use the photograph on the badge to visually identify the individual requesting access. The badges for both licensee employees and contractor personnel who have been granted unescorted access are issued upon entrance at the entrance/exit location and are returned upon exit. The badges are stored and are retrievable at the entrance/exit location. In accordance with 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5), contractor individuals are not allowed to take badges offsite. In accordance with the plant's physical security plan, neither licensee employee nor contractors are allowed to take badges offsite. Under the proposed system, each individual who is authorized for unescorted access into protected areas would have the physical characteristics of their hand (hand geometry) registered with their badge number in the access control system. When an individual enters the badge into the card reader and places the hand on the measuring surface, the system would record the individual's hand image. The unique characteristics of the extracted hand image would be compared with the previously stored template in the access control system to verify authorization for entry. Individuals, including licensee employees and contractors, would be allowed to keep their badges with them when they depart the site and thus eliminate the process to issue, retrieve and store badges at the entrance stations to the plant. Badges do not carry any information other than a unique identification number. All other access processes, including search function capability would remain the same. This system would not be used for persons requiring escorted access, i.e., visitors. Based on a Sandia report entitled, ``A Performance Evaluation of Biometric Identification Devices'' (SAND91_0276 US&hyph;906 Unlimited Release, Printed June 1991), and on the licensee's experience with the current photo-identification system, the licensee stated that the false accept rate for the hand geometry system is comparable to that of the current system. The biometric system has been in use for a number of years at several sensitive Department of Energy facilities. The licensee will implement a process for testing the proposed system to ensure continued overall level of performance equivalent to that specified in the regulation. The Physical Security Plan for PBAPS, Units 2 and 3, will be revised to include implementation and testing of the hand geometry access control system and to allow licensee employees and contractors to take their badges offsite. The licensee will control all points of personnel access into a protected area under the observation of security personnel through the use of a badge and verification of hand geometry. A numbered picture badge identification system will continue to be used for all individuals who are authorized unescorted access to protected areas. Badges will continue to be displayed by all individuals while inside the protected area.
