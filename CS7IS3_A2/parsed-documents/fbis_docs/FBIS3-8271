Tudjman has outdone his own ideal, and Milosevic has become owner of not only the Serb souls but "the father of all Croats," too. Tudjman has become more of a Serb than Milosevic -- not because he wants to, on the contrary. However, he was caught in the net he and Milosevic had woven in Karadjordjevo, intending it for Bosnia. Like Milosevic, the leader of the Croats did not even mention the number one world event until his visit to the "friendly state of Romania," during which he condescendingly stated that the ultimatum may play a certain role in the Bosnian conflict, but that the bombing of the Serb positions would lead to an escalation of the war -- no less and no more than that. In front of the entire international community, including the Serb Orthodox mother Russia, Tudjman sides with the almost abandoned Karadzic. The Croat leader has irretrievably become hostage to Milosevic's stratagem and his own greed for the territory of someone else's internationally recognized country. Paradoxical or not, the fact is that he now has to save Milosevic by defending his part of their joint plan -- wiping Bosnia off the world political map. With the removal of the Serb artillery (by hook or by crook) from the positions at the Sarajevo encirclement, certain -- possibly crucial -- instruments of dividing Bosnia in the way that the two had planned and carried it out have been taken to pieces. It took the international political and military giant two years of unprecedented brutal killing of a small state and a people -- the Bosniak one -- to move. Slow reactions are characteristic of the internal logic of a huge mechanism. However, once the machinery is started, it is constantly accelerated and is difficult to bring to a standstill. Tudjman feels that the end to the international community policy that indifferently acknowledged new "realities on the ground" is near. The ultimatum to the Serbs hangs over Croatian policies in Bosnia as a heavy lead cloud, too. However, its president, who has long ago put everything on one card -- the division of Bosnia into two parts -- has gone too deep into its blood-stained mire to be able to get out of it. This is why, in a state of panic, he gave the statement in Bucharest. Franjo Tudjman must do what is impossible: save the now questionable job of breaking Bosnia in two, which is well under way, while, with the new, changed attitude of the international community, which has been getting into full swing of stopping the bloodshed, avoiding economic sanctions or an ultimatum similar to the Serb one. Another possibility is going a few years back, breaking off the ghostly engagement with Milosevic, and giving up on the so-called exclusive Croatia at the expense of the neighboring Bosnia. What he is going to opt for can best be discerned in his program address to the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community] Presidency and HDZ representatives in the parliament. Those who may still have had illusions or doubts were finally given a first-hand answer to the question who the real creators or the Croatian policies toward Bosnia are and who are the executors. Tudjman did not directly respond to Miko Tripalo's [official of the Croatian National Party] accusations, which said that three years ago, he had arranged a dual division of Bosnia with Milosevic, but said that, regarding Bosnia, he "carried out the only possible policy," that he "anticipated and realized," and that "our people in Herceg-Bosna and Boban and everyone else carried out and will carry out this policy." He swung his rhetorical sword before the parliament representatives and pointed it even at the pope himself, reproaching him for the desire for the establishment of a new community of the Southern Slavs. Moreover, says Tudjman, "the pope claims that the cause of all the evil in the present-day world is the exaggerated and extremist nationalism, for which leaders rather than the people are to blame, that nationalism has led to a new paganism -- the deification of the state." In that context, Tudjman recognizes himself. The pope supporting sovereign Bosnia-Herzegovina and expressing solidarity with its people who have suffered so much suits his politics even less. By imputing this to the Vatican, Croatia is losing its last friend. It, therefore, seems that there is no going back for Tudjman and Croatia. He has chosen the same loner's way as his model Slobodan Milosevic. They are faced with the same future. Disputed and isolated by the world, they will be each other's only support and solace.
