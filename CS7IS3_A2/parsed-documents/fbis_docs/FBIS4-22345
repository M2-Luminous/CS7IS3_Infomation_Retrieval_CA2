Yerin, minister of internal affairs; place and date not given: "The Growth of Crime Can Be Stopped If All Forces in Society Get Involved in Fighting It, Believes V.F. Yerin, Minister of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation"] [Text] The minister informed journalists about this at a news conference, adding that a reduction in the rate of growth of crime last year was successfully achieved through collective efforts, although the exceptional role of the functionaries of the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] organization and the militia cannot be diminished. In essence, they are waging, in peacetime, a real war on the escalation of violations of the law which is invisible to the eye of a common citizen. At present, the signs of crime can be seen in the increased number of serious crimes: murder, robbery, and criminal violations in the economic area. All of this is very alarming. The minister thinks that being better informed about the actions of the militia is necessary so that the faith of the people of Russia in the possibility of defeating the criminal underworld will be reinforced. To this end, law enforcement organs must strengthen contacts with the journalist corps. The examples given suggest that objective publications that are beneficial immediately receive practical evaluation through the actions of MVD organs. On the contrary, unconscientious pen-pushers not only misinform the mass reader in so-called "made-to-order" pieces but also clearly play into the hands of those who are on the wrong side of the law. Until recently the authors got away with such information, whereas now, in an aggravated situation bordering on an emergency in terms of tension, special attention will be paid to such opuses. A report to the people of Russia that was published in the press is an example of open information on the operations of the internal affairs organs. In the opinion of V. Yerin, this is the continuation of a tradition started by V. Bakatin in his time. The excessive atmosphere of secrecy in which the MVD organization was continuously shrouded is alien in spirit to a genuine democracy. The minister sees hopeful prospects for rooting out the criminal flaws of our reality in the provisions of the Federal Program for Crime Control in 1994-1995. As V. Yerin admits, he is not particularly fond of directive documents; in solving practical tasks, he sees the benefit of primarily practical actions. However, the advantage of the newly developed program, and its specific distinction from related directives, edicts, and decrees, is that it is based on a set of specific endeavors which are truly capable of bringing an end to the exuberant bloom of evil anomalies in the life of our society. First of all, the financial support program is realistic. All ministries and departments participated in its development, and each of them is financially responsible for a portion. The state budget accounts for just about 2 trillion rubles [R], which did not make the Ministry of Finance tremble. In particular, the program comprehensively embraces measures to eliminate the obstacles into which the organs applying the law usually run. Consider, for example, illegal trafficking in weapons. The program requires that functionaries of the MVD organs and militia employees verify in detail the "biography" of each firearm from the fitter's bench where it was made to the criminal shot fired. Since the process of inquest and subsequent investigation is on occasion incomplete because of the absence of exhaustive data on the instance of violation of law, the Federal Program calls for creating specialized bureaus for debriefing people who for various reasons are not capable of making an important report on their own. Of course, the program pays much attention to the methods for combating corruption and organized crime. However, in this instance everything will depend on laws which deputies at various levels will pass soon or will not pass for a long time to come. In the words of the minister, it is also important that the program takes into account social protection for marginal populations--the cadre reserve of career criminals. The program also has a point on support for the victims of criminal actions. Notably, communications between the militia and the population on the principle of a fire alarm call will finally be put in order. In general, this means restoring justice: After all, we remember well how prompt the response of the 02 service was in recent times.... It is a pity that we again have to restore things that operated without fail in the past. The minister asked journalists to refrain from excessive emotions--the MVD is flexing and will flex its muscles in the future, although this is not to say that these muscles can be used contrary to the law. The MVD is first of all an organ applying the law whose actions are strictly based on upholding the law. There are many skilled and well-versed criminal investigators within the organization of the MVD, although, in the words of V. Yerin, there has been a certain slump in their work. The young directorates for combating organized crime drew praise from the minister, whereas the former Department for Combating Theft of Socialist Property, which is currently an organ for combating economic crime, was rebuked for being slow to adjust to the new situation. A question by a correspondent from Baku concerning cooperation between the Russian Federation MVD and the law enforcement organs of nearby foreign countries drew a categorical response from V. Yerin: Foreigners not protected by diplomatic immunity incur criminal liability under the laws of Russia, especially when such violations of the law as illegal importation of drugs to the territory of Russia are committed. It appeared that the man from Baku took offense, although he should be taking offense at his countrymen who have turned the markets of Moscow into a drug market! The minister answered a question by the leader of the Pamyat Society, D. Vasilyev, on the attitude of the MVD toward various political groups: If it occurs to Pamyat or another entity of any political hue to create their own armed units, the MVD will immediately use all lawful sanctions against them. At the same time, V. Yerin agreed that D. Vasilyev's remark about the inadequate cultural standard of the actions and professional training of individual militia functionaries was quite legitimate. One would think that D. Vasilyev's well-meaning wish that the guardians of the law would behave better will be taken under advisement. In response to a question put by our newspaper--is it not high time to begin patrolling the streets?--the minister stated that he is prepared to take the harshest criticism but, in his opinion, young soldiers who have not seen action cannot be placed in areas where bullets fly. Apparently, this is a more suitable role for pedestrians, who have every right to defend themselves.... Some information media were reprimanded for exaggerating the role of the "Russian mafia" abroad. Information on opening up a direct channel for police communication between Russia and Germany sounded sensational. In his concluding remarks V. Yerin praised Mayor of Moscow Yu. Luzhkov for the proper interpretation of the tasks of the militia and the allocation of official housing and monetary and technical resources for the city militia. Well, it is possible that new times will begin in Russia, if everything that was mentioned at the press conference is indeed implemented.
