FR941116-2-00083 FR941116-2-00065 The Licensee consented to the issuance of this Confirmatory Order during a telephone call between Ms. B.J. Holt and Mr. Wayne Slawinski, of the NRC Region II staff, and Dr. Cecil Smith, Assistant Vice President for Environmental Health and Safety, and Mr. Joseph Allgeier, Radiation Safety Officer, of the Licensee's staff on November 4, 1994. Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202, I have also determined that, based on the Licensee's consent to this Order and the significance of the necessary program improvements described above, the public health and safety require that this Order be immediately effective. IV. Accordingly, pursuant to sections 81, 161b, 161i, 161o, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR Parts 20, 30 and 35, it is hereby ordered that, effective immediately, License Nos. 34&hyph;00293&hyph;02, 34&hyph;00293&hyph;14 and 34&hyph;00293&hyph;15 are modified as follows: The Licensee shall complete the specific action items within the time limitations stated in the Radiation Safety Improvement Plan submitted to the NRC in its letter dated August 2, 1994, as supplemented by letter dated September 15, 1994. If additional time is required to meet a step or goal, a prior written request must be submitted with the reason for the request and the new time frame for completion. Until approved in writing by the Regional Administrator, Region III, the previously approved schedule must be met. The Regional Administrator, Region III, may relax or rescind, in writing, any aspect of the above condition upon a showing by the Licensee of good cause. V. Any person adversely affected by this Confirmatory Order, other than the Licensee, may request a hearing within 20 days of its issuance. Any request for a hearing shall be submitted to the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, ATTN: Chief, Docketing and Service Section, Washington, D.C. 20555. Copies also shall be sent to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20555, to the Assistant General Counsel for Hearings and Enforcement at the same address, to the Regional Administrator, NRC Region III, 801 Warrenville Road, Lisle, Illinois 60532&hyph;4351, and to the Licensee. If such a person requests a hearing, that person shall set forth with particularity the manner in which his interest is adversely affected by this Order and shall address the criteria set forth in 10 CFR 2.714(d). If a hearing is requested by a person whose interest is adversely affected, the Commission will issue an Order designating the time and place of any hearing. If a hearing is held, the issue to be considered at such hearing shall be whether this Confirmatory Order should be sustained. Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202(c)(2)(i), any person other than the Licensee adversely affected by this Order, may, in addition to demanding a hearing, at the time the answer is filed or sooner, move the presiding officer to set aside the immediate effectiveness of the Order on the ground that the Order, including the need for immediate effectiveness, is not based on adequate evidence but on mere suspicion, unfounded allegations, or error. In the absence of any request for hearing, the provisions specified in Section IV above shall be final 20 days from the date of this Order without further order or proceedings. An answer or a request for hearing shall not stay the immediate effectiveness of this Order. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 8th day of November 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. James Lieberman, Director, Office of Enforcement. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;28256 Filed 11&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7590&hyph;01&hyph;M
