Yesterday at Villa San Martino, [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi's headquarters, a meeting, described as "technical and electoral," took place between the parliamentary floor leaders of the League, Roberto Maroni and Francesco Speroni, and two Rooting for Italy officials, Domenico Lo Jucco -- Marcello Dell'Utri's assistant on Publitalia and the man in charge of finding and selecting Rooting for Italy's candidates -- and Roberto Cipriani. The purpose of the meeting was supposed to be an examination and perhaps the drafting of the list of candidates that the League- Rooting for Italy alignment would field in the constituencies of northern Italy. Silvio Berlusconi himself spoke at the meeting, which lasted eight hours, though he declined to enter into technical details. [Northern League Secretary] Umberto Bossi's presence "in spirit" was much stronger; as the meeting was still in progress he issued a provocative communique to the news agencies: "Berlusconi must think about the Center and South; woe betide him if he thinks of taking away our votes in the North." Berlusconi quipped in reply, "a little local color is always pleasant," but this did not at all alter the substance of the dispute. Clearly, after their long-distance argument, Speroni and Maroni (the latter still recovering from the incident with [Pact for Italy leader] Segni) had to be cautious: "There is no political agreement yet; it is necessary to surmount divergences and mutual mistrust. But we are very close," they announced at the end of the meeting. Later, in the evening, Bossi expressed his thoughts on television, setting the conditions for alliance with Rooting for Italy: "Berlusconi stood in parallel to the old political system. We will accept him only if he helps us to implement economic liberalism and to put an end to the abuse of the welfare state. We will accept him, above all, if he presents himself as a mediator between North and South, if he succeeds in reconciling the country. In this role he does not even need a party. Let it be clear, however that it is we who are in the North -- not Berlusconi." So, leaving aside all the "isms," Bossi's message is tantamount to an ukase: Berlusconi can serve to bring votes from the South, where the League's presence is small, but be absolutely must not establish himself in the political fabric of the North. Berlusconi owns television networks, newspapers, and money, but according to Bossi, he does not yet enjoy any support among the voters. "He wants to be a political leader," the League's secretary said, "but that is for the voters to decide." In other words, if Berlusconi wants to put forward a blueprint on which basis to seek 50 percent of the candidates that the new alignment will field in the various constituencies, this would all take the form of a plan contrary, alternative, and opposed to Bossi's. "We would pursue our own path. Berlusconi would no longer be our mediator, and we would do without him." This is how the first "technical" meeting between the League and Rooting for Italy ended -- with diktats and quips. Now Berlusconi will have to impart substance to his capacity for mediation in order to reassure his potential ally. But yesterday there was talk about candidates, too: "Tiziana Parenti was thinking of standing in Milan," Speroni said, "but for magistrates there are considerations of geographical incompatibility." It seems virtually certain, however, that Bossi will stand as the League's candidate for central Milan. The progressive bloc might field the writer, Umberto Eco, against him.
