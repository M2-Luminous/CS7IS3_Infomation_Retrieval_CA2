The committee says the Government should consider powers to order people to stop driving in cities when air pollution reaches levels which spark asthma attacks. It says voluntary exhortations used at the moment may not be enough. One in 10 children are thought to be suffering from asthma -- double the rate 10 years ago. In 12 years the annual cost of treatment had risen from £50 million to more than £350 million in prescription charges alone. The committee says children are subject to a cocktail of chemicals from motor vehicles which could be at least part of the cause. Passive cigarette smoking and home pollutants such as dust mites could also be a factor. The report says: "While the evidence is not conclusive, the long-term trend in road traffic would be consistent with the observed trends in respiratory allergies, and vehicle exhausts are the primary cause of pollutants. Government failure to monitor the situation is criticized by the committee, which says the UK has by far the smallest number of air monitoring stations in the European Union.
