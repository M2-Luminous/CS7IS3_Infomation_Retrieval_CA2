He Too Is To Resign" -- first paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA introduction] [Excerpts] Rome -- Eliminating the old powers, wherever they are, and starting again from the beginning. Alfredo Biondi, deputy speaker of the old Chamber of Deputies and potential successor to [Chamber speaker] Giorgio Napolitano, explains that the logic of the "new broom" is the logic of the majority system, and that this requires the majority to assume its responsibilities in every area. [passage omitted] [Ricci] What does this [shift to the majority system] mean for the office of speaker of the Chamber of Deputies? [Biondi] With the majority system, the majority is responsible for leading parliament. [Ricci] In both the Chamber and the Senate? [Biondi] In the Senate, which is the second institutional body of the state, tradition demands that the speaker position be given to a person with the highest qualifications and who also has a certain independence. But in the Chamber too, it is important to have someone who can offer reliability and balance. I have always guaranteed this and I believe that, in parliament, the problem lies in the organization of dissent. Consent, the majority already has. Hence the need to secure the role of the opposition. For example, if the speaker ought to come from the majority, I also find it natural that the speaker's office include opposition representatives. [Ricci] And the committees? [Biondi] The majority has always held the chair of the committees. [Ricci] But Communist Renewal, for example, maintains that this reasoning does not apply to those parliamentary bodies with a more specific control function. [Biondi] It is true that I too do not believe that this criterion applies to bicameral committees. We can even have here chairpersons coming from the opposition. Certainly, to them too applies the criterion that the persons appointed should guarantee balance and reliability, as has not always been the case. [Ricci] And the administration? What criterion ought to apply: the American "spoil system," in which the victor in the elections changes most of the top levels in the administration, or the European one, with a clear separation between state and politicians? [Biondi] The European one. [Ricci] Why then does your colleague [Center Union member] Costa talk of changing at least 120 state appointments? [Biondi] Costa is talking about a meritocratic reselection, not a political purification. The bureaucracy which has survived under the protection of ministers has, in recent years, been the bastion of conservatism. The minister needs to have the courage and the opportunity to select for himself those people he wants to work with. [Ricci] Is this what is happening with the "professors" of the RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation] board of directors? [Biondi] Anyone appointed by speakers of chambers which have now been dissolved ought to ask himself whether he should remain in the post to which he was appointed. [Ricci] And control bodies like CONSOB [Commission for the Supervision of Companies and Stock Exchanges] and the Antitrust Committee? [Biondi] These are collegiate bodies, where there is the possibility of integration, and hence, naturally, of internal flexibility. Naturally, anyone finding the new government's policies incompatible with his own ideas can always resign. [Ricci] But it is these bodies which will have to examine closely the entrepreneurial activities of the probable future prime minister. [Biondi] [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi has said that he is ready to sell and I believe him. Politics, I can assure you, is a contagious craft. On the other hand, he has a dominant position in television and I am ready to recognize that, without this, Forza Italia would still have been successful, but in a more limited way. As an old liberal I say that this dominant position is incompatible with freedom. [Ricci] One moment. Here we have two different problems. One is that of Berlusconi's entrepreneurial activities. [Biondi] And here I am saying that his position today is incompatible with the office of prime minister. Even politically, he would become a puppet target of a thousand polemics. Obviously he is entitled to safeguard his own assets. He should not strip himself of everything like Francis of Assisi. [Ricci] And the second is that of television pluralism. [Biondi] And here I say that the government is not everything. Parliament is sovereign and is able to review the Mammi law [on broadcasting], achieving a better pluralism, one which excludes duopoly, but, I add as an old liberal, oligopoly as well.
