The watch words "mobilization iron cuts iron" were launched by Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who maintains the hope of returning. Deputy Evans Beaubrun thinks that the president-in-exile fluffed his entrance into the new year. The legislator interprets President Aristide's statements as a sort of convocation to civil war. He hopes that the population rejects this proposal of indian wrestling, just as they reject a solution of a clean sweep advocated by other sectors. The year 1994 is the year for compromise, according to Deputy Beaubrun.[passage omitted] Another legislator, close to the National Front For Change and Democracy [FNCD], interprets differently the statements made by the president on 1 January. Isaac Garcon, from FNCD, sees the message as an encouragement to the people in order to keep them mobilized in favor of democracy. [Passage omitted] Mayor Evans Paul also reads differently the watch-words "iron cuts iron": [Begin Paul recording in Creole] I do not know what the president meant by "iron cuts iron," but I know, considering the framework of democracy in the country, iron also could mean the Constitution. Iron also could mean the law, respect for democratic principles that we have always defended. I do not want people to interpret the word iron as violence because the president always speaks in images. For someone who always respects principles, the law, the Constitution is iron.
