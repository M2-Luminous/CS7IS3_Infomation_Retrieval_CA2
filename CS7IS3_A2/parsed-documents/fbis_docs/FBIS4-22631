FBIS4-22631 "jpusr042___94007" FBIS-USR-94-042 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 30 March 1994 RUSSIA ECONOMIC & SOCIAL AFFAIRS Results of Ostankino Financial Audit Viewed Results of Ostankino Financial Audit Viewed 944F0568A Moscow NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA in Russian 30 Mar 94 p 2 944F0568A Moscow NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA Russian CSO [Report by the Auditing Directorate for the Administration of the Russian Federation President: "`Ostankino' Is Selling Itself, Continuously Lowering the Price"] [Text] In 1993, the expenses of the RGTRK [Russian State Television and Radio Company] "Ostankino" were financed by the Russian Ministry of Finance from the Russian Federation Budget for the sum of 103.7 billion rubles [R]; of this amount, R82.8 billion, or 80 percent, were used to pay for the services of the Russian Ministry of Communications and R20.9 billion were spent for its own needs. As of the beginning of 1994, the company owed R50.3 billion to state enterprises which provide for dissemination and retransmission of radio and television programs and R1.8 billion to the Television Technical Center (TTTs). At the same time, despite its difficult financial situation (...) it continues to use budgetary funds for unauthorized purposes. Because of the lack of appropriate supervision by the management of the RGTRK "Ostankino" (the former chairman V.I. Bragin), individual television studios illegally permitted an increase in the volume of broadcasting established for them last year (...). Television and radio advertising, which is one of the company's principal sources of commercial income, is being broadcast practically without supervision. The Main Commercial Advertising Board was established only in May 1993. There were cases in 1993 in which subunits were given budgetary appropriations without accounting for the funds they received from commercial activity. Thus, the Television Program Board was allocated R38 million at the same time that the studio's expenses were covered in full by the incomes received from advertising activity. Some R21 million were allocated without justification to the "Radio Podmoskovya" studio as well. A spot check at five studios established that the unpaid placement of advertising in 1992 added up to R45 million. In 1993, the liabilities totaled R441 million. Incomes from commercial activity in 1993 amounted to R11.2 billion, although according to the expert assessment of the sociological center of the RGTRK "Ostankino," the company should have received no less than R60 billion in profit from airing advertising alone. This estimate is confirmed by a check made of activity following the purchase of a license to air television serials in exchange for advertising time. Estimates show that the RGTRK "Ostankino" could have received nearly R1.3 billion from the contract signed 16 February 1993 by the company's acting director, I.Ye. Malashenko, with the "Premyer SV" Advertising Agency for collaboration in purchasing the rights to broadcast the television serial "Twin Peaks" from the World Vision Company and to organize its showing on the RGTRK channel (we will return to this in our concluding remarks--NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA [NYeG]). This agency was granted 120 minutes of advertising time, without the appropriate economic accounting, for all 30 series of the film, which amounts to a minimum of about R596 million when the total cost of hiring the film was R159 million. Moreover, the "Premyer SV" was given the exclusive right to select and place advertising in the time belonging to the company (180 minutes) with a 30-percent discount from the estimates; as a result of this, the agency was provided with additional income totaling R273 million. In 1993, some 27 minutes of the company's advertising time were not used during the course of the contract's implementation through the fault of the "Premyer SV." However, demands were immediately made by the "Premyer SV" Advertising Agency for an additional 69 minutes of advertising time for the television serial's transfer to other time periods during the election campaign, and this can bring it an income on the order of R393 million. Despite the fact that this violation was called "force majeure" circumstances (the circumstances were favorable!--NYeG), because it was necessary to comply with the Russian Federation President's Edict No. 1792 of 29 October 1993, the company met the agency's demand without reservation. Moreover, it paid R57 million for the services of the Russian Ministry of Communications for the advertising time actually used. (Something else would have been strange: if the advertising agencies were to bear responsibility for the president's actions--NYeG). With the connivance of the RGTRK "Ostankino" management, the activity of commercial enterprises and institutions has been neglected by the company's subunits. As of the beginning of 1994, founders have not had data at their disposal on the number of enterprises and the payments made to their charter funds. The company is not receiving income from the activity of commercial structures. During the audit of the RGTRK "Ostankino," the "VID" Television Company, the "Intervid" Corporation, the Television Technical Center, the "Vzglyad," "Telekanal 2x2," TV "Servis," "Sodeystviye," and a number of other enterprises directly connected with television and radio broadcasting which collaborate with the company were checked as well. It was established that individual enterprises owe the company for payment of services, and cases of nonpayment of taxes were revealed as well. In accordance with the laws in force, they have been charged additionally for payments to the budget of R1.1 billion. The court examination of the suit involving V.I. Bragin, former chairman of the RGTRK "Ostankino," has continued for nearly a year. At the same time, several judicial decisions have been made by the Higher Arbitration Court. At the present time, the statement registering a protest has been recalled by the company's acting chairman, A.N. Yakovlev. The dispute continues to be unsettled... (There is no question that the authors of the report are much more competent than the court. This is a customary privilege of those close to the president. Further details in concluding remarks--NYeG.) It has been established that some contracts not only do not protect the company's economic interests, they are simply not advantageous for it. Thus, a contract was signed on 7 October 1993 by the RGTRK "Ostankino" Studio for Children's and Young People's Programs with the closed-type joint-stock company "INMAK" and the Association to Promote the Development of Children's Television (a limited partnership) to show publicity subjects of the "INMAK" AO [Joint-Stock Company]. In this case, the funds for airing the advertising should be transferred to the current account of the association, which is not part of the company's structure. A contract signed on 12 July 1993 between the RGTRK "Ostankino" (former Deputy Chairman Yu.N. Bandura) and the "Jeronimo, Ltd." Firm for collaboration in purchasing the rights to show films from television companies in West Europe and the United States, as well as in organizing their showing on the company's channels, provides for the income from advertising to go into the foreign firm's current account. In conformity with the "Supplement to the Gentlemen's Agreement" made on 24 July 1993 by former RGTRK "Ostankino" Deputy Chairman Yu.N. Bandura and Mr. (I. Amors), president of the "Ostankino Development" Enterprise, 100 minutes of advertising time are transferred to the company from this enterprise at a price of $3,000 [presumably: per minute]. So the enterprise sold the company a "commodity" which it did not officially have at its disposal. Nevertheless, at the instruction of the former managers of the RGTRK "Ostankino" (V.I. Bragin and Yu.N. Bandura), the company transferred $300,000 to the account of this enterprise in October 1993. In 1993 the RGTRK "Ostankino" (former Chairman V.I. Bragin) signed a contract with the "Kamaka" TOO [Limited Partnership] for the firm's transcription of television materials and their subsequent sale of the right to show them to commercial television companies. In the period from July to December 1993, the "Kamaka" TOO transferred 360 cassettes to the company containing 432 programs, of which 382 were taken from the Gosteleradiofond [USSR State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting Holdings]. For this work, the firm received R25 million, that is, the funds were spent for transcribing programs already existing in the state's holdings. The company has not received any income from this contract to date. The RGTRK "Ostankino" has received no profit from a transaction concluded in 1992 with the American corporation "U.S.S.U. Arts Group," which was granted the exclusive right to use recordings of classical music stored in the archives of the Gosteleradiofond (incidentally, the transaction was also concluded by Yu. Bandura!--NYeG). A founding contract has not been concluded yet between the Russian Federation Government and the RGTRK "Ostankino" to regulate relationships between the founder and the company, as stipulated by the Statute on the Russian State Television and Radio Company "Ostankino" and confirmed by the Russian Federation President's Edict No. 421 of 2 April 1992 "On guarantees to stabilize the information and activity of the Russian State Television and Radio Company "Ostankino." The lack of a unified concept in the field of state television and radio broadcasting has led to the point that orientation of the company's activity has been defined chiefly by the position of its managers, seldom by the broadcast studios themselves. (So that's where the problem lies!--especially with respect to Ye. Yakovlev and "VID"--NYeG.) From the NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA Editorial Staff Tha anonymous authors of the report, who gave a good account of themselves at the start by identifying the completely obvious problems of "Ostankino," fulfilled a social and political order at the same time, in our view. Those Ostankino characters who have been the most free in their judgments have been the subject of administrative wrath first of all--the ones from "VID" (we may wonder if the auditors were unaware of the damage inflicted on "VID" by Bragin's excommunication of its leaders), Yegor Yakovlev (The court decisions are of no concern at all to the inspectors. They found in themselves the strength and the right to declare him "illegal.") Of course, Malashenko must be given a pat as well--the NTV which he heads is much more liberal and talented than the official "Ostankino." And at the same time, outside the limits of the report, which we are publishing with certain abridgments, there is the reckless private business of the technical employees, the fantastic dimensions of "indirect advertising," and the studio corruption leading to ordered slaughters. And most importantly, there is no attempt made to explain why it was to the advantage of Bragin and K [presumably: the company] to decentralize advertising and close their eyes to Mr. Bandura's transactions.
