FR940511-1-00050 FR940511-1-00012 Specifically, State plans would be required to include: (1) Policies on ``reasonably related'' (see §255.1(e)(4) and §257.21(a)(6)); (2) definitions of ``mentally or physically incapable'' (see §§255.1(m) and 256.1(a)(5)); and (3) decisions on whether States have opted to provide TCC without formal requests, during gaps, and in voluntary closure situations (§256.1(a)(6)). If States take advantage of the other new options available to them, they would also have to report on their criteria for determining ``higher quality'' care (§255.1(i)(2)) and conditions and limitations for in-home care (§255.1(n) and §257.21(o)). The proposed rule would reduce reporting burden at §255.1(i) through its elimination of the requirement for surveys of special needs rates. These amendments to the IV&hyph;A State plans are being submitted to OMB. Similarly, the proposed revisions for the CCDBG program will produce minor changes and additions in the CCDBG plan. Grantee plans will have to include additional information about immunization policies pursuant to the amendments at §98.41(a)(1) (see §98.16(a)(10)). Depending on their response to the proposed amendments and clarifications, Grantees may also be revising plan sections on in-home policies (§98.16(a)(7)(ii)), the definition of protective services (§98.16(a)(6)(vii)), and payment rate differentials (§§98.16(a)(12) and 98.43(e)). Amendments to the CCDBG plans will also be submitted to OMB. ACF has submitted a copy of this proposed rule to OMB for its review of these information collection requirements. Other organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments regarding the information collection requirements should direct them to the Administration for Children and Families (address above) and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, room 3208, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503, Attn: Laura Oliven, Desk Officer for ACF. Order of Preamble and Regulations The preamble begins with a discussion of four areas where the proposed regulations for the title IV&hyph;A child care programs and CCDBG address similar issues_payments for higher quality child care, payments for children with special needs, providing in-home care, and the effects test. We first discuss these four issues from a common perspective. But, where needed because the respective statutes for the programs differ, the general discussion on these topics is followed by a discussion of the proposed regulatory change in the context of the specific program, either the Block Grant or the applicable title IV&hyph;A program(s). It is our intent that where these proposals address a common issue, the proposed changes result in policies that better enable States to coordinate these programs into a more cohesive child care system. Comments which identify the potential for conflicting policy between programs as a result of these proposals are especially encouraged. Following the discussion of these four issues, we discuss additional changes specific to the CCDBG (part 98) followed by proposed changes specific to the title IV&hyph;A child care programs (parts 255, 256, and 257). The proposed regulations follow the order of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and are presented after the preamble, beginning with the CCDBG followed by the title IV&hyph;A child care programs.
