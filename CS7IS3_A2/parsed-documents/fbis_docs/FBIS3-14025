The international community, however, is sitting like a silent spectator. The United Nations and major powers worldwide do not feel the need to play their required role in obtaining the right of self-determination for the Kashmiris or the protection of Bosnia. When it comes to the interests of the United States and European nations, the United Nations and its Security Council suddenly become very active. The silence of the world over the present situation in occupied Kashmir and Bosnia is deplorable and unbearable. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto addressed a meeting of the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva and tried to call the attention of the international community to the problems in occupied Kashmir and Bosnia. She said, "The present situation in Kashmir is unacceptable, and so is the silence of the world." The prime minister made it clear to the meeting's participants that the people of Kashmir have a very simple desire: independence. "You cannot suppress the freedom fighters for very long," Bhutto said. "Atrocities and extremities cannot last very long. This is a lesson of history, and despite India's atrocities and suppression, the people of Jammu and Kashmir have made its efforts futile." Madam Benazir Bhutto has definitely advocated the interests of the people of Kashmir very effectively. Her speech was greatly praised and the issue was declared a great cause of concern. The real problem, however, is to see if the international community will do something to stop Indian atrocities against the Kashmiri people and whether they will help them gain their right to freedom. In the past, the United Nations and other international forums praised the efforts of Pakistani representatives and diplomats; however, they did not take any practical steps to help the Kashmiris get their independence. The conscience of the international community is dead, and it is not willing to do anything to stop the savage acts of the Indian armed forces in Kashmir. In this situation, relations between India and Pakistan have become extremely tense. Pakistan tried to resolve this issue by holding talks, but India's stubbornness prevented it from making any progress. Pakistan has not proposed any new plans. Instead, it is still firm on the principle of resolving the Kashmir issue of independence through the UN resolutions. If India continues to violate human rights in occupied Kashmir and practices its stubbornness in declining to recognize the right of Kashmiris to freedom, then there will be no guarantee of peace in South Asia. Resolution of the Kashmir problem according to the wishes of the Kashmiri people is very important for establishing peace in south Asia. *
