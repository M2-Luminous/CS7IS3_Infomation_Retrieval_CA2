"Growth could be a little higher," he stated at a news conference with which he yesterday concluded a two-day visit to Spain, during which he met with the king, the prime minister, the economy minister, and representatives of the financial and academic communities. Camdessus believes that the phenomena and the turmoil created by the atmosphere of corruption "cannot delay investment decisions amply justified by the macroeconomic prospects and the growth potential" of the Spanish economy. The IMF chief concludes from the contacts held over the past two days that "there are already some initial figures that clearly point to an economic recovery, such as the value-added tax revenue and the performance of the balance of trade and the housing market." In addition, at his meetings with Spanish bankers, he was informed of the existence of "signs" of a revival of investment, which would thus become "the second driving force of growth, giving way later," he added, "to a recovery in domestic consumption," the variable that has fallen furthest during the recession, owing to the "2-percent" increase in the family savings rate because of the fear of unemployment. The IMF director general yesterday sought to make quite clear his support for the government's economic policy, a policy that should extend and accelerate the structural reforms. "It is very satisfactory that, despite the recession, the Spanish Government has undertaken a crucial dual initiative to restore sustained and job-creating growth -- the reduction of the public deficit and the far-reaching measures to make the labor market more flexible." Michel Camdessus emphasized that the "budget deficit in the first quarter was well below" that of a year ago. In his opinion, "the government has decided to do many important things; it must now implement them, and quickly," and so he expressed his "joy" at the "good prospects" of the reform of the labor market being approved in the Cortes. The IMF, he pointed out, "supports what the government is trying to do" with the labor reform, and "there are already promising results concerning the introduction of some measures," he said, referring to the apprenticeship contract, stressing that "this is the direction that must be taken if people want this country to reduce its high unemployment rate through growth and labor flexibility." He warned, however, that further steps should be taken in order to ensure that "the small and medium-sized enterprises are not afraid to recruit." It will be necessary "to continue to reduce the obstacles to finalizing labor contracts, continue to cut labor costs, improve vocational training, and increase the quality of the job supply, because this country must create skilled jobs and can do so, although it will take time." Camdessus regretted not "having been able to reach agreement with the trade unions" in the course of his "brief" visit, and expressed his intention to meet with them "before the October meeting in Madrid." The most critical assessment that Camdessus made concerning the Spanish economy's performance was in taking the view that keeping inflation between 4 and 5 percent -- a level that is "certainly too high" -- will force the Bank of Spain to cut interest rates cautiously. Control over inflation and the public deficit will make it possible in the long term to ensure sustained growth with lower interest rates. Michel Camdessus would not answer in specific terms a question on whether the conduct of the former Bank of Spain governor and the former Civil Guard director general invalidates one of his "prescriptions" against corruption -- improving officials' training and pay. "I will not talk about specific cases until justice has been done, because the presumption of innocence applies to everybody." The IMF official emphasized that "corruption is a universal scourge," and pointed out that "where it is not known, it is hidden under some form of totalitarianism." The important thing "in Spain, on the other side of the Pyrenees, and in any developed country" is that corruption be prosecuted, that there be strong and democratic institutions, and that "some trees" be prevented "from hiding the quality and the high sense of public service existing in the Spanish administration."
