UPP leader Kim Tong-kil and NPRP leader Pak Chan-chong will have a joint press conference at the National Assembly Monday morning to announce their union. Kim and Pak will say that their union does not mean giving up full-scale union of the opposition parties, but it is rather a first stage aiming at union of all the opposition parties in the future, including the main opposition Democratic Party and New Korea Party. The unified party, whose name is not decided yet, will also try to admit independent lawmakers to be a formal negotiating body in the National Assembly. Now UPP has 12 lawmakers and NPRP has one, so according to the rules of the National Assembly, the unified party will be able to be a negotiating body if seven lawmakers join it in addition.
