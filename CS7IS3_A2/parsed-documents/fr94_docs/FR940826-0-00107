FR940826-0-00107 FR940826-0-00018 This interim rule also makes clarifying changes to three cross-cutting program provisions in the HOME rule. First, this interim rule amends §92.257, ``Religious organizations,'' to remove a reference relating to control of wholly secular entities established by ``primarily religious organizations'' to rehabilitate or construct housing which will therefore not be owned by such primarily religious organizations. The Department recognizes the important role served by religious groups in providing lower income housing. This change conforms the rule to the same principles and tests applied in the Community Development Block Grant regulations at §570.200(j) and in the section 202 program for elderly housing assistance. This clarification is intended to indicate the availability of no lesser role in the HOME program for entities established by a ``primarily religious organization,'' a term equivalent to what the United States Supreme Court describes as a ``pervasively sectarian institution,'' one in which ``religion is so pervasive that a substantial portion of its functions are subsumed in the religious mission.'' Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.S. 734, 743 (1973). Second, this interim rule revises §92.353(e) to set out the requirement that HOME participating jurisdictions must comply with the requirements of a Residential Antidisplacement and Relocation Assistance Plan (Plan). The change reflects a statutory amendment to the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy made by Section 220(b) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. A participating jurisdiction with a Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) must follow a Plan identical to its CDBG Plan. A participating jurisdiction that is not a CDBG grantee must follow a Plan that meets the requirements of the applicable CDBG regulation (24 CFR 570.606(c) for a local jurisdiction and §570.488(c) for States). A certification requirement related to this provision is also added to §92.10(c)(4). On July 1, 1994, HUD published a proposed rule at 24 CFR part 43 (59 FR 34300) describing proposed changes to Plan requirements. The deadline for public comments was August 1, 1994. Finally, this interim rule also amends §92.354(a)(2), regarding Davis-Bacon Act applicability. The change is intended to make clear that construction contracts covering 12 or more units, disregarding the number of projects involved, are subject to Davis-Bacon requirements. Also, dividing a single project into multiple construction contracts for purposes of avoiding Davis-Bacon requirements is not permitted. III. Findings and Certifications Justification for Interim Rulemaking The Department has determined that this interim rule should be adopted without the delay occasioned by requiring prior notice and comment. This interim rule simply constitutes the implementation of statutory language with the exercise of little or no discretion on the part of the Department and makes a number of clarifying changes to existing provisons. As such, prior notice and comment are unnecessary under 24 CFR Part 10. This rule is being published as an interim rule and not as a final rule because the HOME program regulation at 24 CFR part 92 has not yet been issued as a final rule. Environmental Review A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk. Regulatory Planning and Review This interim rule has been reviewed and approved in accordance with Executive Order 12866, issued by the President on September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Any changes to the interim rule resulting from this review are available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk. Impact on Small Entities In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the undersigned hereby certifies that this interim rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, because jurisdictions that are statutorily eligible to receive formula allocations are relatively larger cities, counties or States. Regulatory Agenda This interim rule was not listed in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April 25, 1994 (59 FR 20424) under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Federalism Impact The General Counsel has determined, as the Designated Official for HUD under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, that this interim rule does not have federalism implications concerning the division of local, State, and federal responsibilities. While the HOME Program interim rule amended by this interim rule was determined to be a rule with federalism implications and the Department submitted a Federalism Assessment concerning the interim rule to OMB, this amending rule only makes limited adjustments to the interim rule and does not significantly affect any of the factors considered in the Federalism Assessment for the interim rule. Impact on the Family The General Counsel, as the designated official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this interim rule would not have significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being. Assistance provided under this interim rule can be expected to support family values, by helping families achieve security and independence; by enabling them to live in decent, safe, and sanitary housing; and by giving them the means to live independently in mainstream American society. This interim rule would not, however, affect the institution of the family, which is requisite to coverage by the Order. Even if this interim rule had the necessary family impact, it would not be subject to further review under the Order, since the provision of assistance under this interim rule is required by statute, and is not subject to agency discretion.
