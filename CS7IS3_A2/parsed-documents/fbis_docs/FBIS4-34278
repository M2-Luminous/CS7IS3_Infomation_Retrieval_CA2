Conservative Party candidate Andres Pastrana has accused President Gaviria of breaking the principles that require his impartiality in electoral matters, asserting that Gaviria has clearly acted to expressly promote the candidacy of Liberal Party candidate Ernesto Samper. Pastrana said: "The political guarantees necessary for this campaign to take place under conditions of equality and impartiality do not exist." (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 9 Jun 94 p 6A) Ernesto Samper asked former Envigado Mayor Jorge Meza, who faces a scandal as a result of presumed links with drug traffickers, to abstain from participating in campaign activities to promote his candidacy. Samper welcomed a statement by Bishops Conference President Pedro Rubiano, who said that the Catholic Church does not favor any candidate. He added that he "did not deem appropriate the strategy used by the other candidate to establish religious differences among Colombians." (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 9 Jun 94 p 6A) On 9 June, Ernesto Samper said that Pastrana has adopted an unnecessarily aggressive and intolerant position that does not benefit Colombian democracy. According to Samper, Pastrana "is thoroughly exploiting" the media "his family owns" to attack him politically and personally. President Cesar Gaviria yesterday told Pastrana that no actions by his government have sought to favor, openly or tacitly, any of the presidential candidates or to influence the current electoral contest. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 10 Jun 94 p 6A) Ernesto Samper and vice presidential running mate Humberto de la Calle rejected on 10 June what they called a "dirty war" on the part of Andres Pastrana, whom they accused of seeking to provoke a "religious clash" in the country. During a news conference, he noted that "Pastrana's campaign, by resorting to the old slander policy, has spread accusations of all types that have made some prelates disregard the instructions made at the Bishops Conference." (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 11 Jun 94 p 7A) According to two polling companies cited by local media, Pastrana appears to be the favorite to win the 19 June elections. The figures created confusion among voters, because they contrast with the results obtained during the 29 May elections when Samper beat Pastrana by a narrow margin. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 1825 GMT 11 Jun 94) On 10 June, a telephone tap was discovered in Ernesto Samper's office. Samper said: "This is an unprecedented action, and whoever did it is a scoundrel." (Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Canal A Network in Spanish 1800 GMT 11 Jun 94) Regarding the alleged telephone spying against Samper, Pastrana said: "That is not my style nor that of my campaign. I believe that the security organizations must clear up this situation and that, if there are any accusations, they must be made through the pertinent organizations." (Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network in Spanish 1200 GMT 13 Jun 94) Ernesto Samper ended campaign activities today to begin the last week of meetings with fellow Liberal leaders. Samper called attacks by Monsignor Dario Castrillon unfair, adding: "Liberals are also Catholics, and we will not accept having a conscientious veto among Colombians, because of an act of religious fanaticism inspired by Pastrana's campaign." Pastrana is also preparing to close the last week of his campaign. Pastrana stated: "I seek to govern for all Colombians, not just for a minority." (Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Canal A Network in Spanish 1730 GMT 13 Jun 94) During the weekend of 11 June Monsignor Dario Castrillon rejected Samper's alliance with Protestant groups and asked Catholic Liberals not to vote for Samper because, according to him, Samper promotes abortion and denies the rights of most Catholics. Pastrana denied any favoritism by the Church and said: "Colombians do not want a candidate such as Samper, who encourages violence. Colombians are weary of violence; we want peace. Nobody is stirring any clashes. Samper is the only one who has invented this war." Samper's campaign denied 14 June that their presidential program includes promoting abortion or denying the rights of Catholics. (Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Canal A in Spanish 0000 GMT 15 Jun 94) During an interview, Samper said he believes Pastrana does not have enough political experience because he has not occupied a post at the national level. He added: "I am willing to give Pastrana a ministry so that he may complete his training." The country wants changes and new spaces, which we are willing to open. The new country is the one that supports me, the blacks, Indians, independent sectors, and demobilized guerrillas, Samper concluded.
