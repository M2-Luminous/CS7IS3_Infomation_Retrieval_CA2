ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Commission requests comments on a petition filed jointly by Integrated Broadcasting Company, Inc., requesting the substitution of Channel 231C1 for Channel 231C2 at Okmulgee, Oklahoma, and the modification of Station KTHK(FM)'s license to specify operation on the higher class channel, and by KRIG, Inc., requesting the substitution of Channel 286C3 for Channel 232A at Nowata, Oklahoma, and the modification of Station KRIG(FM)'s license to specify operation on the higher class channel or alternatively to substitute Channel 285A for Channel 232A at Nowata and the modification of Station KRIG(FM)'s license to specify the alternate Class A channel. To accommodate the allotment of Channel 286C3 to Nowata, the Commission also proposes to substitute Channel 280A for unoccupied and unapplied-for Channel 285A at Pawhuska, Oklahoma. Should no interest be expressed in the use of Channel 280A at Pawhuska, the Commission alternatively proposes to delete Channel 285A at Pawhuska without replacement. In accordance with Section 1.420(g), the licenses of Stations KTHK(FM) and KRIG(FM) can be modified as proposed without affording interested persons an opportunity to submit competing expressions of interest or requiring the petitioners to demonstrate the availability of an additional equivalent higher class channel. DATES: Comments must be filed on or before Nov. 7, 1994, and reply comments on or before November 22, 1994. ADDRESSES: Federal Communications Commission, Washington D.C. 20554.
