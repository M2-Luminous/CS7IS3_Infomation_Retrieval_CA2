None of the existing OCS requirements were deleted.

Regulatory Flexibility Act_The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires each federal agency to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for all rules that are likely to have a ``significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' Small entities include small businesses, organizations, and governmental jurisdictions. As was stated in the final regulation, the OCS rule does not apply to any small entities, and the structure of the rule averts direct impacts and mitigates indirect impacts on small entities. This consistency update merely incorporates onshore requirements into the OCS rule to maintain consistency with onshore regulations as required by section 328 of the Act and does not alter the structure of the rule. The EPA certifies that this notice of proposed rulemaking will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. E. Paperwork Reduction Act_The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the information collection requirements contained in the final OCS rulemaking dated September 4, 1992 under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act , 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., and has assigned OMB control number 2060&hyph;0249. This consistency update does not add any further requirements.
