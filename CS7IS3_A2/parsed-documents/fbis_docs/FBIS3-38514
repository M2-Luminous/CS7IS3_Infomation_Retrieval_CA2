The operation, codenamed Golden Market, was based on testimony from leading Mafia turncoats including the recently arrested "super-killer" Giovanni Drago, accused of taking part in 36 homicides between 1986 and 1990. Many of those taken into custody are his alleged accomplices. Magistrates pointed to Drago's November 1989 slaying of three close female relatives of super-grass Francesco Marino Mannoia -- then beginning to collaborate with justice, in the utmost secrecy -- as evidence of the presence of Mafia moles within the most heavily guarded reaches of the investigative apparatus. Of the 76 warrants, 34 were served on persons already in jail for Mafia offences, including all the incarcerated components of the Mafia's supreme coordinating body, the Cupola (Dome): boss of bosses Salvatore Riina, Francesco Madonia, Bernardo Brusco and Giuseppe Calo'. 18 persons had gone underground, including the doctor Goiacchino Pennino, and clan heads Pietro Aglieri, Giovanni Brusca, and Mariano Tullio Troia. Two of the three lawyers, Carmelo Cordaro and Marco Clementi, were taken into custody while the third, Gaetano Zarcone, has been on the run for two years, but sent magistrates a letter two months ago claiming he was the victim of defamation. According to informants including super-grasses Gaspare Mutolo and Baldassare Di Maggio -- the same witnesses who alleged Mafia links on the part of former premier Giulio Andreotti -- Cordaro swore allegiance as "man of honour" for one of the main Palermo crime families, the Porta Nuova clan. Clementi is accused by the informants of acting as a go-between for jailed bosses -- in particular, his clients in the Madonia clan -- and their operatives on the outside. Among the allegations against Zircone is that of introducing into Palermo's Ucciardone prison the poison that killed boss Gerlando Alberti 10 years ago. The doctors named in the warrants, two of them military medical officers, stand accused of issuing false medical certificates to allow jailed Mafiosi out of prison. In particular, one of the military doctors, Antonino Mattina, is accused of accepting a 50 million lire bribe to have boss Pietro Vernengo transferred to a hospital from which he escaped in 1991. The exact charges against the two officials of the Sicilcassa savings bank are not known, but a statement from investigators spoke of a "distorted exercise of their activities" on the part of all 9 local professionals, who had been "either corrupted or intimidated" by the mob. This first involvement of criminal lawyers in an anti-Mafia operation follows repeated assertions by leading informants that they were used to exert influence on judges. One turncoat, Antonino Calderone, recently told investigators that the Mafia "asks a lawyer what a judge is like, and the lawyer will tell you who knows the judge and can get close to him." In recent testimony to the parliamentary anti-Mafia commission, Mutolo spoke of "controlling" lawyers, many of them "men of honour", who exert behind-the-scenes influence to swing trials, as well as "corridor" lawyers who give tips on how Mafiosi should handle their defence. He added that the Mafia deliberately chose lawyers of the same political persuasion as judges, usually achieving "more favourable" treatment. [passage omitted] The chairman of the Palermo criminal lawyers' association, Giovanni Natoli, expressed "appreciation" for the colleagues involved in the probe and confidence that they would be able to defend themselves from the "groundless" accusations of Mafia turncoats whom he described as "wholly untrustworthy persons". He added that while no comment was possible on the accusations they faced, the lawyers' association would take on the formal defence of its members.
