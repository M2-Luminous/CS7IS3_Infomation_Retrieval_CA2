Koken Nosaka, who heads the Diet Administration Committee of the second-largest opposition party, told a press conference that the party will compile an alliance proposal by next Wednesday to present to the ruling coalition and the largest opposition party. "We want to play a leading role in creating a stable government," Nosaka said. Nosaka was skeptical about the possibility of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata heading the new coalition government after he resigns, as required by SDP's prerequisite for alliance talks. "It is unthinkable" that the premier who resigns will immediately assume the same post again, he said. Meanwhile, SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama made a renewed call for Hata, who heads the first minority government in four decades, to step down to set the stage for coalition talks with the SDP. At a meeting with SDP-supporting labor unions, Murayama also said the SDP will submit a motion of no-confidence against the Hata cabinet if he takes a stance that it cannot agree with. The SDP withdrew from the coalition in late April after the abrupt formation of a parliamentary group excluding the party. LDP President Yohei Kono made clear the party still plans to seek a no-confidence vote against Hata. Kono said at a meeting of party executives that the Hata administration has not obtained a sufficient mandate from the people and that it has also lost international credibility over the failure in the Japan-U.S. trade talks. Kono also pointed to Hata's lukewarm posture toward the lingering corruption charges against former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa as a reason to seek a no-confidence vote. Management and Coordination Agency Director General Koshiro Ishada, who heads Komeito, a major coalition component, said the SDP's move Thursday to join forces with the LDP at the House of Representatives Budget Committee to decide to summon Hosokawa to testify before the Diet over the financial dealings is bound to have some impact on the political situation. But Health and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi, former head of the Democratic Socialist Party, another coalition member, said so far the SDP's alliance with the LDP is limited to the Hosokawa issue, and said it is not yet clear whether or not the SDP will fully cooperate with the LDP in seeking a no-confidence vote.
