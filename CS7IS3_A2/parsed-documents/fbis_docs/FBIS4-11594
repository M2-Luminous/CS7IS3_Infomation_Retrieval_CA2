The strikers are demanding salary increases. Some observers say the tense situation has submerged the nation in a kind of semi state of siege. This forced President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada's government to deploy some 30,000 troops, who were ordered to act decisively to maintain peace. First official reports indicate that the worst conflicts occurred in Santa Cruz Department, in the east. Peasant union demonstrators tried to block the railroads leading to Argentina and Brazil, and the highways that join that tropical city with Angostura and Chapare. A police source said there is still no official word on arrests or other incidents. The source said security forces cleared the expressways of rocks and logs the strikers placed across them to pressure the government into accepting their demands. Another roadblock was removed from the highway that connects La Paz with the mountain regions of Oruro. The authorities reported that the flow of traffic in and out of La Paz and the rest of the country is normal, according to a responsible source, who said the troops maintain control at points where strikers were trying to erect roadblocks. In La Paz, police patrolling was doubled in view of the threat by 10,000 peasants to stage a march on the city to protest the government's refusal to grant their wage demands, which have been capitalized on by the Bolivian Labor Federation with a 24-day strike. The conflict worsened last Friday after one of the street protests degenerated into disturbances with rock throwing and looting of businesses and vehicles, resulting in tens of persons injured and 27 arrested. Also, on Sunday and Monday the police forced a dozen hunger strikers to suspend their 20-day strike and admitted them to clinics for medical attention. Although the chief of state had warned a few days ago that if the situation worsened the government might be forced to impose a state of siege, some analysts believe that the labor and opposition pressure appears to want to force Sanchez de Lozada into adopting that extreme measure. The Catholic Church, whose mediation was requested by COB leaders, voiced "its exasperation" in view of the "deafness" of the labor leaders and government to find a solution to the conflict. "If there are two deaf people, who want to speak, the church cannot be in the middle screaming," Apostolic Nuncio Giovanni Tonucci remarked, saying that there was no room for dialogue. "If there is deafness on both sides, it seems to be that it is futile and ridiculous to ask the church to mediate," he said.
