[Corado] I came here to cast my vote and try to assess the Salvadoran people's participation in this run-off election, where I think there will be a clear winner. [Reporter] What about the number of people participating? [Corado] The number of voters is considerable. There are some differences between this and the 20 March election. There are fewer voting stations here at the Fair, but their distribution is better. The election is taking place more quickly, which will result in the process concluding sooner. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Corado] No irregularities have been reported to us so far, either at the voting sites or the electoral process in general. [Reporter] Did you cast your vote already? [Corado] I am going to so at this very moment. [words indistinct]
