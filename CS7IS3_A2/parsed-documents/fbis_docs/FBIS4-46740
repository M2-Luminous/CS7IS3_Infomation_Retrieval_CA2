Dust was raised for two days on the winding road that leads to a small two-story structure in the valley of the Kamenka River, a structure that from its looks is barely noticeable and does not in any way reveal anything particular about its functional significance to the vital activity of the life of the city. In the words of the workers of the pumping station, the television reporters and the newspapermen were getting tiresome. Although neither the steady drone of the pumps in the KNS [sewage pumping station] nor the homey appetizing aroma from the domestic area--it was getting close to lunchtime--gave any sign indicating an emergency at the station. A.N. Kolesov, the station foreman, clarified the emergency in question, since the station had not stopped and was operating according to the usual regime. However, it was not without reason that the alarm was raised in the city regarding the next ecological disaster. This time thunder struck in the Maritime region, where the wall of an intake reservoir of one of the KNS collapsed. Learning a lesson from the mistakes of others, the Gorvodokanal [city water channel administration] decided to investigate the condition of the pumps in the city. However, it was not possible to execute this plan at KNS 14, where the sluice gates, "stop logs," did not function, and it was not possible to stop the flow from the input collectors. The attempt to establish a temporary gate also ended without result. Does every cloud have a silver lining? Alas, no! The defect of the sluice gate, according to the statement of the station workers, which lies on the conscience of the builders from the day the station is put into operation, only postponed the prediction of an inevitable massive pollution of the Ob. An inspection of the KNS and preventive repair, in any event, cannot be avoided. Not only at this station but at all the others, and there are about two dozen of them on the city's right bank alone. But the total daily volume of city sewage is almost 1 million cubic meters. And all this sooner or later empties into the river. It is fortunate that the contamination from the KNS did not pass on closer to summer. Otherwise, farewell to the swimming season. And not only for Novosibirsk residents but for the "lower neighbors" as well.
