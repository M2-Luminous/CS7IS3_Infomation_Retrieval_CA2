In Phnom Penh, Robaina will meet with the president of the National Assembly and the prime minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia. This is the first official visit to Cambodia by a high-level official of the Cuban Government following the return to peace and stability in that nation. In an exclusive interview with Radio Rebelde, Robaina spoke about the first phase of his Asian trip. [Begin Robaina recording] Nowadays, we cannot speak of a worldwide diplomatic offensive that excludes such important regions. When we speak of important regions, we cannot forget this region, which is immensely wealthy, but which, in addition to that, has experienced a significant economic boom in recent years. I believe that Cuba is in need today of many points of view. Cuba has many needs and these needs are possibilities for investment for many people. Undoubtedly, many of our needs represent opportunities for investment by countries in this region. There is an undisputed economic boom in these countries that we need to analyze. We need to do this to see what works, what is truly adaptable to our circumstances. This is why I think we need to talk about this region. I believe that knocking on such doors as those of Indonesia, Malaysia, and India are venues, alternatives, and possibilities for work and exchanges under new game rules -- we are talking mutual exchange. I do not want anyone to think that Cuba is going around asking for a handout. Cuba has many needs, but also many things it can offer the world and this region. I have found here great interest in possibilities, great willingness to open exchange possibilities in areas such as health, medicine, biotechnology, and sports -- as odd as it sounds. There are many things that have resulted from our social investments that are of interest here, but have not been successful here. [end recording] After Cambodia, Robaina will visit India, Malaysia, and Vietnam -- the last leg of his seven-country Asian tour.
