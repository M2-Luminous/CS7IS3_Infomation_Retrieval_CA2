Market declarations, issued by the government, and antimarket measures, undertaken by it, have led to unbridled inflation and a catastrophic drop in GDP. (In February of this year, GDP dropped by 36 percent in comparison with the same period in 1993). The drop in production is continuing. "It is necessary to tell people the truth, to dispel the myth that, in comparison with other states, the Belarusian people live better," believes the former speaker of the legislature. "Having realized our current situation, it is necessary to undertake steps aimed at pulling the state out of the crisis." S. Shushkevich bases his steps on the program -- drafted by the Belarusian Social Democratic Assembly and the United Democratic Party of Belarus -- which foresees the quicker implementation of reforms. As for the political situation in the Republic, S. Shushkevich paid attention to the constitutional crisis caused by the signing of the monetary merger agreement with Russia. Having sharply denounced the steps taken by the government, he called them "a conscientious gambling on public opinion," explaining his viewpoint by the fact that the government cannot but understand that even if the agreement comes into force in its current form, Belarusian workers in Soligorsk will receive their wages no quicker than workers in Vorkuta [Russia], who have not been paid in several months. S. Shushkevich cited the example of the Supreme Soviet commission, headed by A. Lukashenka, as the manifestation of the exacerbation of the constitutional crisis. "Though the commission's activity has made a lot of noise," argues S. Shushkevich, "no `mafia' members were punished. At the same time, the dismissal of the commission was illegal. The fact that some deputies withdrew from this commission could not be the reason for its shut down. The commission was enacted by the Supreme Soviet, so it was up to the Supreme Soviet to dismiss it." Answering questions from the audience, which chiefly concerned the "unused Supreme Soviet chairman's power" and admonishments for being indecisive, S. Shushkevich said: "I am more determined than you think. However, my determination has never exceeded and will never exceed the limits of the law. As for the allegedly unused opportunities of the chairman's position, you are overestimating them. My power differed considerably from that of a president. I was only authorized to sign international treaties and agreements, and nobody will accuse me of giving Belarus a poor image on the international scene. As for other things, I fulfilled the Supreme Soviet's will. Please, recall my negative position on the collective security treaty. However, I was forced to sign it because this was the Supreme Soviet's decision." Rejecting the reproaches for being unable to set up a team of like-minded people when he occupied the position of Supreme Soviet chairman, S. Shushkevich said that such a team exists and, considering the recent mistakes -- one of his key mistakes being that "he trusted unworthy advisers" -- he will draw corresponding conclusions. It seems that the saying "forewarned is forearmed" characterizes fairly well Shushkevich's trump card on which his team counts.
