Ministers salute the historic achievement represented by the conclusion of the round, which they believe will strengthen the world economy and lead to more trade, investment, employment and income growth throughout the world. In particular, they welcome -- The stronger and clearer legal framework they have adopted for the conduct of international trade, including a more effective and reliable dispute settlement mechanism, -- The global reduction by 40 percent of tariffs and wider market-opening agreements on goods, and the increased predictability and security represented by a major expansion in the scope of tariff commitments, and -- The establishment of a multilateral framework of disciplines for trade in services and for the protection of trade-related intellectual property rights, as well as the reinforced multilateral trade provisions in agriculture and in textiles and clothing. 2. Ministers affirm that the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) ushers in a new era of global economic cooperation, reflecting the widespread desire to operate in a fairer and more open multilateral trading system for the benefit and welfare of their peoples. Ministers believe that the trade liberalization and strengthened rules achieved in the Uruguay Round will lead to a progressively open world trading environment, and express their determination to resist protectionist pressures of all kinds. Ministers undertake, with immediate effect and until the entry into force of the wto, not to take any trade measures that would undermine or adversely affect the results of the Uruguay Round negotiations or their implementation. 3. Ministers confirm their resolution to strive for greater global coherence of policies in the fields of trade, money and finance, including cooperation between the WTO, the IMF and the World Bank for that purpose. 4. Ministers welcome the fact that participation in the Uruguay Round was considerably wider than in any previous multilateral trade negotiation and, in particular, that developing countries played a notably active role in it. This has marked a historic step toward a more balanced and integrated global trade partnership. Ministers note that during the period these negotiations were underway significant measures of economic reform and autonomous trade liberalization were implemented in many developing countries and formerly centrally planned economies. 5. Ministers recall that the results of the negotiations embody provisions conferring differential and more favorable treatment for developing economies, including special attention to the particular situation of least-developed countries. Ministers underscore the importance of these provisions for the least-developed countries, and declare their intention to continue to assist and facilitate the expansion of their trade and investment opportunities. They agree to keep under regular review by the ministerial conference and the appropriate organs of the WTO the impact of the results of the round on the least-developed countries as well as on the net-food- importing developing countries, with a view to fostering positive measures to enable them to achieve their development objectives. Ministers recognize the need for strengthening the capability of GATT and the WTO to provide increased technical assistance in their areas of competence, and in particular to substantially expand its provision to the least-developed countries. 6. Ministers declare that their signature of the "Final Act Embodying the Results of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations" and their adoption of associated ministerial decisions initiates the transition from GATT to the WTO. They have in particular established a preparatory committee to lay the ground for the entry into force of the WTO agreement and commit themselves to seek to complete all steps necessary to ratify the WTO agreement so that it can enter into force by 1 January 1995 or as early as possible thereafter. Ministers have furthermore adopted a decision on trade and environment. 7. Ministers express their sincere gratitude to His Majesty King Hassan II for his personal contribution to the success of this ministerial meeting, and to his government and the people of Morocco for their warm hospitality and excellent organization they have provided. The fact that this final ministerial meeting of the Uruguay Round has been held at Marrakech is an additional manifestation of Morocco's commitment to an open world trading system and to its fullest integration to the global economy. 8. With the adoption and signature of the final act and the opening for acceptance of the WTO agreement, ministers declare the work of the trade negotiations committee to be complete and the Uruguay Round formally concluded.
