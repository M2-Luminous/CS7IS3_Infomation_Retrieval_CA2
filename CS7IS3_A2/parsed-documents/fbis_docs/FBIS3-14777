The group of observers, of which nine are Romanian parliamentarians, met with Igor Smirnov, president of the self-proclaimed Dniester Republic. To begin with, Smirnov presented a brief report on the socioeconomic conditions in the area, after which he answered questions asked by the observers. Among the issues discussed were Dniester citizenship, which, I would like to point out, the separatist authorities attempt to force on the residents on the left bank of the Dniester River, and the use of the Romanian language as a state language; in this connection, I have to remind you of the pressure to which the three Romanian schools in Dniester are subjected -- in the past weeks they have been obliged to return to the Cyrillic alphabet. And, of course, the main thing, the Ilascu case. From the international observers we learned that Igor Smirnov said that Ilascu is, quote, a bandit, unquote, a terrorist about whom our state's laws have made a decision and no one may interfere or disregard the people's will. He also affirmed that due to contradictions between the legislation of the Republic of Moldova and that of the so-called Dniester Republic, Ilie Ilascu's possible election to the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova will not be respected. According to the same sources, Igor Smirnov's attitude toward the observers representing the CSCE and the Council of Europe was one of detachment and indifference. Also today, the same group of observers visited polling station No. 1 in Varnita, which is located on the right side of the Dniester River, where from 21 February to this afternoon at 1600 more than 2,000 residents from the other bank, the left bank of the Dniester River, had cast their vote.
