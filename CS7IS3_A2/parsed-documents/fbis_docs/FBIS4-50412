Li Ruihuan said: China and Sweden are far away from each other and have no conflict of basic interests. On the contrary, there are broad prospects for economic cooperation because the economies of the two countries are mutually complementary. China is carrying out large-scale economic development, and there is much in Sweden's advanced technology and management experience that we can make use of. During my visit to your country, I have personally witnessed Swedish entrepreneurs' desire to strengthen cooperation with China. Our two countries should exert joint efforts to push bilateral cooperation to a new stage, which corresponds with the common interests and aspirations of the two peoples. The Swedish prime minister said that bilateral relations between China and Sweden have developed rapidly in recent years, and he expressed his hope that they will develop further. He also expressed Sweden's support for China's reentry into the GATT.

Speaker Troedsson said that experience has shown that Swedish- Chinese cooperation and exchanges are in accordance with the fundamental interest of the Swedish and Chinese peoples.
