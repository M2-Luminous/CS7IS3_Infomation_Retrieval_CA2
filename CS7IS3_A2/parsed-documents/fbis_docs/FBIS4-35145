"For several days, we have noticed the reinforcing of the military enclave with military personnel and equipment," said Division General Ramon Espinosa, Army chief in the eastern part of the country. In a statement made to PRENSA LATINA after visiting several military units in the region, Gen. Espinosa said those movements could be part of a possible U.S. military intervention in Haiti. "Such an action would increase tensions in the Caribbean area," Gen. Espinosa said, adding that the Cuban Armed Forces should be alert and prepared for any eventuality. "The Cuban Army in the eastern region is at full combat readiness to quickly and effectively repel any military action from the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base," Gen. Espinosa stressed.
