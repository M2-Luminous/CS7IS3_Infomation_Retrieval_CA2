Really, what does an "average" Armenian know about Georgia? That during the times of Tigran the Great part of the territory of modern Georgia was subject to the "king of kings"? That the ancient Georgian alphabet was invented by a disciple of Mesrop Mashtone, and Tbilisi was built by Armenians? That Georgians are noble, gay, careless, and vainglorious people but to this day have not learned how to really make shish kebab? And what can the "average" Georgian say about his Armenian neighbors? That under Queen Tamara Armenia was part of Georgia; that Armenians constantly lay claim on the great Shota Rustaveli as their own; that they are calculating, stingy, and cunning people, and generally, why do they not go back to Armenia? In reality, however, how rich and interesting are the interconnections between the two peoples! How many glorious pages of joint struggle against foreign invaders has their history registered! How is it that, surrounded by a hostile Muslim environment, Orthodox Georgia and Apostolic Armenia have managed to preserve their language, culture, spiritual values, and faith? This is the amazing historic phenomenon to which our researchers should turn their attention first and foremost. We should look for the roots of the strength of the brotherhood of two peoples, which has not been weakened over time, in ancient manuscripts and wonderful samples of miniature painting. It is not surprising that the news of the collapse of Armenian statehood was perceived by Georgia with alarm and pain. The country was losing its ally, protection at the approaches to its borders. Its hard for many to understand today why Georgian people extended so much warm and heartfelt hospitality to Armenians fleeing the devastating invasion of Seljuk Turks. They settled in one of the plentiful regions in Georgia--Kakhetia, with its capital of Telavi. And to this day thousands of descendants of those remote resettlers live and prosper in this land famous for its wines. In Tbilisi, which by then was already the main city in the Transcaucasus, Armenians were greeted with expansive hospitality. Most of them were merchants, gunsmiths, jewelers, stone masons, and other craftsmen, which in many respects contributed to economic progress in Georgia and expansion of its ties with Asia Minor and then with Russia and West European countries. According to the testimony of A.S. Pushkin, who visited the Russian-Turkish front in 1829, "in Tiflis [Tbilisi] most of the population is comprised of Armenians: they accounted for up to 2,500 families in 1825. During the current fighting the numbers have grown. It is estimated that there are up to 1,500 Georgian families (See "Journey to Erzurum"). Naturally, Armenians made a serious contribution to the development of the Georgian capital and its cultural life. Suffice it to mention the Ovnatanyan dynasty of artists, whose creative life in Tbilisi spanned over 200 years beginning in 1661, when Czar Vakhtang the Sixth invited Nagash Ovnatanyan to his court. Nagash's grandson Ovtnatan was Irakliy the Second's court painter. Many people do not know that artist Mikirtum Ovnatanyan did the murals of the famous Sioni cathedral. The peasant reform of 1864 sped up the development of capitalism in the Transcaucasus. Gradually a considerable part of industry, including oil production, as well as trade became concentrated in the hands of the Armenian bourgeoisie. This is when strains appeared in Armenian-Georgian relations. This is when rivalry developed between the Armenian bourgeoisie and Georgian nobility, which had a negative impact on interethnic relations. This period in the life of Georgia has been aptly portrayed in Tsigareli's comedy "Khanuma." At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century Tbilisi developed rapidly, becoming one of the most beautiful cities in the Russian empire. An enormous contribution in city planning and development was made by major industrialists and benefactors Mantashev, Aramyants, Melik-Kazaryan, Bozardzhyan, and others. Dozens of newspapers, magazines, and books were published in Armenian; a theological seminary opened. The national party Dashnaktsutyun was also founded in Tbilisi at the junction of the two centuries. At the same time, the changes in social and public life and the advent of capitalist relations that were basically alien to the patriarchal way of life could not fail to create fertile soil for stronger Armenian-Georgian rivalry, which sometimes assumed acute forms. The behavior of certain strata of the Armenian population inevitably caused disapproval among the Georgian public. Some Armenian scholars sometimes committed missteps by clearly exaggerating the role and place of Armenians in the history of the Georgian nation. Neither were some Georgian thinkers particularly noted for their objectivity. In the most concentrated form this anti-Armenian mood was expressed by Georgian literary classic Ilya Chavchavadze. The great poet came out with the book "Armenian Scholars or Crying Stones," in which he accused Armenian historians and writers of all mortal sins and insulted the entire Armenian nation. His sense of proportion unfortunately failed the great patriot, and his emotions overrode objective and impartial evaluation. I. Chavchavadze's book went beyond the bounds of scholarly debate, for which it was justly criticized by an outstanding scholar, Academician Nikolay Marr, who was, by the way, a Georgian by his maternal line. Armenian-Georgian friendship was put to a severe test in 1918-1920. At the time of Turkish invasion of Transcaucasus in 1918, the Menshevik government of Georgia occupied Loriyskiy District. Over the period of 1,000 years of neighborly coexistence between Armenia and Georgia there were no wars--a unique fact in human history. The Georgian-Armenian war (13-31 December 1918) was provoked from outside, by dark political forces. In the 1930's there were quite a few Armenians in top-level positions in Georgia. Gradually they were replaced by Georgian national cadres. Unfortunately, ethnic policy in Georgia became biased with the advent to power of L. Beria, who never hid his anti-Armenian views. Nevertheless, we can say that the friendship between the Georgian and Armenian people withstood the test of time. This is supported by numerous examples of extending mutual help and special relations of trust. Armenia will never forget that during the tragic Spitak earthquake the first help to arrive in the disaster zone was from Georgia. Probably the only people to show moral support to Georgia after the bloody events on Rustaveli Prospect, when Tbilisi residents died of the hand of brutal soldiers, were Armenians. They embodied their solidarity in a monument erected in the courtyard of the Armenian church in Avlabar. Georgia today is the only route for food and fuel to reach blockaded Armenia. Some political circles in the region and outside it are artificially inflaming interethnic strife, using the complex political situation in the Transcaucasus. And political instability in Georgia immediately impacts in a most unfavorable way on Armenia. Therefore, any misunderstandings that arise must be removed quickly. This is, by the way, one of the most important and auspicious tasks of the recently created "Armenia-Georgia" society.
