Vice-Minister of Finance Jin Renqing said this will help ensure the quality and efficiency of new State-invested projects. Evaluations have been conducted for several years in China, but it is time to make the process more scientific and authoritative. We should establish a standardized system," said Jiang Weixin, vice-director of the Major Construction Department of the State Planning Commission (SPC). Hao Jun, managing director of China International Engineering Consulting Corporation, which is China's leading group conducting the evaluations, said such projects have been partially checked for years but no comprehensive monitoring was done until the mid-1980's. During the previous 45 years trillions of yuan was invested in capital improvements by the government. But without an effective evaluation system in place to examine the wisdom of the investments, the system was susceptible to abuse. Under the leadership of the State Planning Commission, China International Engineering started examining major projects involving government outlays in 1988. In 1990, regulations for conducting the evaluations were stipulated by the State Council for trial implementation, according to vice-director Jiang. So far, 33 projects involving 45.6 billion yuan ($5.3 billion) of investments have been examined by the consulting corporation. These include 24 major construction projects and nine that involve foreign investments. Most of the projects involve raw materials, energy, power, and transportation; other projects are in agriculture, broadcasting, and education. Loans have been extended by the World Bank and foreign governments to help complete these assessments. Usually, the assessment follows an interim period after the project has been started; sometimes its done after construction is completed. The assessments cover such things as: --Whether a project has been correctly decided. --Whether the design, construction and production of the projects emulated past successes and avoided past failures. --Whether the efficiency of the project was enhanced by using figures to evaluate if the project would be of use and how long it would take to recoup the investment. -Whether the project has been useful to the nation. For example, has it protected the environment or raised employment? To do the assessments, data received from the projects are compared with data from previously designed projects. Through the comparison, the success or failure of a project can be evaluated. A work unit of professionals is assigned to check the accuracy of data supplied by a construction firm. About 95 per cent of the projects surveyed by the consulting corporation have proved to be efficient and have achieved planned levels of productivity, according to Xia Tongqing, chief engineer of the corporation. Only one project, said Xia, was found to be seriously flawed and causing irretrievable loses. Problems such as exceeding the budget during construction, inability to predict fluctuation of interest and foreign exchange rates, and lack of co-ordination among related projects have been revealed through the evaluations. The appraisals are sent to those who had endorsed and constructed the projects so they can examine whether their decisions were correct. They then can make adjustments on the remainder of the project. In 1994 assessments will be conducted on more than 10 additional projects designated by the SPC and the State Economy and Trade Commission. Besides the SPC, other organizations such as the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Communications, the People's Construction Bank of China and provinces such as Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Gansu, and Yunnan have also conducted assessments of their own projects. The State Auditing Administration also assesses projects each year. But such assessments usually cover only a few aspects. "A unified and standardized system is needed to make the evaluations more comprehensive and scientific," said Hao. As the government reforms the investment system to adjust to a market economy, it has focused its attention on improving the effectiveness of the government's investments. "Advanced practices of project assessment in the world, which have developed since the middle 1970s, can be used as references,!' said Xia. Developed countries and international organizations such as Britain, Australia, and the World Bank, have aided China in its research. The World Bank has just announced that it will donate $400,000 as the first step in helping China establish the assessment systems. According to the World Bank, an efficient system needs close ties with government plans, publicity, and serviceability. For the Chinese system, specific organizations should be established nationwide firstly. Then a series of methods will be developed in accordance with the real situation of China and a number of specific staff workers will be trained. An outline for the system is to be decided by the State Council and measures suited to the Chinese situation are still to be developed. But the result will surely be the creation of a unified, independent organization to survey projects, according to Vice Minister Jin.
