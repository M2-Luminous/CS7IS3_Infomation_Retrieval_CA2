Gromov, deputy minister of defense of Russia, by V. Starkov; place and date not given: "`Our Army Has Its de Gaulles'"] [Text] Colonel General Boris Gromov, Hero of the Soviet Union, needs no special introduction. Former commander of the 40th Army, he became renowned not only for having fought successfully in Afghanistan but also for having pulled the army out of there in militarily competent fashion, practically without losses. General Gromov is now deputy minister of defense of Russia. [Starkov] You have a very handsome name. It resonates with something legendary. Do you know its historical roots? [Gromov] I grew up in a family in which my ancestors, starting with my great grandfather, taught foreign languages. My father died at the front in 1943, two months before I was born. [Starkov] Do you know any foreign language? [Gromov] The curriculum at the Suvorov School in Saratov, where I was a student, allotted nine hours a week for the study of foreign languages. In addition, for one whole day from reveille to taps everyone was required to communicate only in English or French. I once spoke English well. But to speak a language fluently you need constant practice, which I have not had for a long time. Taking part in negotiations, though, I still understand my partner. `The Putschists Did Not Confide in Me' [Starkov] Following your return from Afghanistan, yours has been a complex fate. There have been ups and downs. There have continually been attempts to pin some labels on you and to involve you in something or other. You, on the other hand, remain one of the most outstanding and influential, but at the same time enigmatic political figures. [Gromov] I have never shied from side to side or changed my position in deference to the current situation and have not bowed down before anyone. [Starkov] On the eve of the August events you calmly went on leave. Does this mean that the putschists did not confide in the first deputy minister of internal affairs? [Gromov] I was lucky, they truly did not confide in me. Because had they done so, they would have let me into some of their plans. And then I was simply called back from leave and told: Come on, call off the troops. That is, attempts were made to make me, at my age and in my position and rank, a pawn. Do you know what the internal troops are? They are units specially trained for street fighting. And then, based on my actual experience, I realized what was brewing and to what this could lead. And when I saw that these people, Yanayev, Pavlov, and the others, had made it their aim to seize the White House, which no one needed, I understood conclusively that this was all just an adventure. [Starkov] You did not support the Emergency Committee. In other words, you felt that the time of Gorbachev, Yazov, and Kryuchkov was up? [Gromov] Perestroyka, which was pursued without any plan whatever, could not have produced positive results. A true politician should not resemble a soccer player, who runs faster than he thinks. [Starkov] For a long time you were the personal representative of Marshal S. Akhromeyev in Afghanistan and, evidently, knew this person well. Are you not tormented by the mystery of his death? [Gromov] Marshal Akhromeyev was, in my view, the conscience of the armed forces. A soldier of the front, he had devoted his whole life to strengthening the country's defense capability. He did a great deal for the army, particularly as chief of the General Staff. He was a very intelligent and most punctilious and decent person, who knew his business. The collapse of the system was a real drama for people of the older generation, and for Marshal Akhromeyev, a tragedy. I do not believe he was afraid of being put on trial. He simply could not reconcile himself to the fact that everything he had lived for and had sacredly believed in would be demolished. Afghanistan [Starkov] Why did you go there a second time? [Gromov] Marshal Akhromeyev had proposed that I head the group of representatives of the General Staff in Afghanistan. He needed unembellished reports on the actual situation in the country. In other words, use was made of the experience of the Great Patriotic War, when representatives of the General Headquarters endowed with special powers operated at the fronts. [Starkov] What do you think, why was such a big country as the Soviet Union with a most powerful army not the winner in Afghanistan? Could we, generally, have won the Afghan war -- there was already the experience of the Americans in Vietnam, after all. [Gromov] Defeating a people by way of arms is impossible. In addition, this was not the mission given the limited contingent of Soviet troops. The 40th Army was to have supported the revolutionary regime in Kabul, neutralized the armed opposition detachments on the country's territory, and prevented their penetration of Afghanistan from abroad. [Starkov] It would be sinful not to ask you about Rutskoy. Did you know him from Afghanistan? [Gromov] Of course. And, as army commander, I participated most actively in his release from captivity, when he had been shot down for the second time. We had no news of him at all for several weeks. Thinking that Rutskoy, deputy commander of the army air force, had died, I signed a recommendation for the posthumous conferment on him of the title of hero. Shortly afterward, military intelligence agents managed for a very large amount of money to learn that he had been taken prisoner, ascertained where he was, and immediately began to negotiate for his release. [Starkov] So Rutskoy was ransomed? For how much? [Gromov] It was a large ransom--several million dollars. But when it is a question of a human life, no money is begrudged. Besides, Rutskoy was an excellent pilot. But pilot and politician are different things. Last October [Starkov] So, blood is the symbol of the 1970's, 1980's, and 1990's. The military tried to avoid bloodshed both in Afghanistan and in August 1991. Could you not clarify the situation--what happened in October 1993? [Gromov] I can say nothing in this connection because I was not a participant in the October events either. Nor was I present at the well-known nighttime session of the Ministry of Defense Collegium. [Starkov] You were not invited? [Gromov] I was simply not there, I could not get there. Operational-strategic exercises codenamed Zapad began in the armed forces on 21 September, when the edict of the president was promulgated. Practically all forces stationed in the west of the country were taking part. These exercises had been planned back at the start of 1993. I first heard about the edict in Kaliningrad, having hardly disembarked from the airplane, from correspondents, who just about knocked me off my feet. They were demanding comment, and I did not understand what they were talking about. [Starkov] You evidently weighed up the scenario in the October situation, for all that. Let us suppose that the army did not intervene. What would have happened next? There they are in the White House, we are here, the president is in the Kremlin.... [Gromov] It is essential to use the internal troops in such a situation. First, this is required by the law. Second, MVD troops are stationed in Moscow and in the vicinity, there are practically no army units in the capital. They are stationed far beyond the city. The Dzerzhinskiy Internal Troops Division, in particular, is specially intended for operations in emergency situations on the territory of the capital. This is a crack formation. The servicemen--from the soldier through the commander of the division-- have excellent professional training. Special subunits of the Dzerzhinskiy Division can in their helicopters be at any point of Moscow within 10 minutes, provided there is somewhere to land. [Starkov] It is known that you and Yazov had a difficult relationship. How is it shaping up with the present defense minister? [Gromov] Normally; we were in Afghanistan twice, for that matter. At first I was a divisional commander, he, deputy regimental commander. Then I was appointed commander of the 40th Army, General Grachev, commander of an airborne division. [Starkov] Are there often attempts to set you at odds? [Gromov] Yes, it should not be forgotten that we live in Russia. Military Diplomacy [Starkov] Your name does not correspond all that well to your image. You are not in principle a "loud" person--you are never at the center of rows. What issues do you handle in the Ministry of Defense? [Gromov] I am responsible for all negotiating processes and relations with countries of the near abroad. [Starkov] Which CIS republic has given you the most difficulty? [Gromov] It is difficult everywhere. For a very long time we were unable to find a common language with the leadership of Ukraine. Problems of the use of strategic nuclear forces on the territory of Kazakhstan are proving hard to resolve. We are extremely concerned at the situation of the Russian-speaking population in the Baltic. The development of the situation in Tajikistan is causing particular concern. Events there are developing literally according to the Afghan script of 15 years back. Lest Russia become tied up there the same as in Afghanistan, it was decided to create in this region a coalition force with the participation of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and Tajikistan. [Starkov] You often travel overseas together with Kozyrev. Are there some subtleties in relations between you? Or do you attend the negotiations as representatives of two different departments and try not to notice one another? [Gromov] Good interaction has been worked out, in my view. It is easy working with him--he is a composed and thoughtful professional. [Starkov] Is the foreign minister a democratic individual? [Gromov] Yes, but fairly strict also, perhaps. [Starkov] You, more than other generals, are connected with policy, including foreign policy. Are you thinking of continuing your political career? [Gromov] No. [Starkov] It is precluded for you? [Gromov] I am a professional military man and wish to deal with my field. [Starkov] Do you know any promising people in the army? Are there such persons in the Ministry of Defense leadership? [Gromov] Marshal Ye. Shaposhnikov declared recently on the "Commanders" program that he does not see a single de Gaulle in the army. There has to be. Especially since the Russian and French armies have a great deal in common. [Starkov] Does this mean that a military dictator could emerge here, as in Chile? [Gromov] De Gaulle was not a dictator, Chile is not Russia. When I left Afghanistan, in 1989, then from 1989 through 1991, everyone was prophesying that I would be a dictator. But I was convinced even then that dictatorship in Russia was out of date. At least, there are none such in the military, I believe. It is simply that after all the recent events, a person who would venture to assume such colossal responsibility will not be found. [Starkov] How many are there in the Gromov family? [Gromov] My wife and I have four children: Maksim, Andrey, and the twin daughters Valechka and Zhenechka. The eldest, Maksim, already has his own twins--a boy and girl. So in this respect I am a wealthy man. P.S. General B. Gromov's book "Limited Contingent," chapters from which the paper intends to familiarize readers with in a coming issue, will be published by Progress Publishers at the start of next week.
