To reporters on Monday, Orban said the Central European trend, whereby the first freely elected government is unable to grapple with the economic inheritance of the past, is continuing. He said the Polish scenario happened in Hungary, and the strategy of the Young Democrats to prevent this was unsuccessful. He was confident that the voting public wanted radical change, and change in the political elite, which is why the parties that did not promise this fared more poorly than expected. According to Orban, liberal cooperation can be upheld in the second round of the elections, but will not have a marked impact, partly due to the poorer results of the Young Democrats. Orban said he would not resign, but the Fidesz's congress this summer will be able to implement personnel changes, although his mandate originally runs for two years, until 1995.
