The statement was made to INTERFAX-Ukraine by the spokesman for the president Nikolay Mikhalchenko. However, he refused to specify what concrete measures the president wants to take. IF Note: Kravchuk fulfilled the decision adopted by parliament on 1 June about the drafting of a list of measures which may be used by Ukraine's state organs if Crimean law-makers cancel the laws which run counter to the Ukrainian Constitution. It is a matter of the Crimean decision to reinstate the Constitution adopted in 6 May 1992, which provides for dual citizenship for the inhabitants of the peninsula and the relationships between the Crimea and Ukraine based on agreements. Following the results of the talks in Simferopol of 2-3 June the delegations of the Ukrainian and Crimean parliaments signed a communique where they fixed the mutual "understanding" of the fact that the Crimean Constitution of 6 May 1992 has provisions, which run counter to the Ukrainian legislation. It was decided to create a joint working group to improve Ukrainian legislation concerning the division of powers between the bodies of state power of Ukraine and the Crimea. The group started activities in Simferopol on Thursday [9 June]. In an interview with INTERFAX, the Ukrainian co-leader of the group, Vladimir Stretovich said that political problems will not be included in the discussion. We will use legal ways to find acceptable reservations which will reinstate the Crimean status-quo, he said. Stretovich said that the group consists of lawyers who will study the Crimean and Ukrainian legislations from the professions point of view. The use of force in the conflict is inadmissible unless all negotiating method are used. This is the position of the Ukrainian parliament, said the deputy. Meanwhile, the head of the delegation of the Crimean parliament Sergey Nikulin in an interview with INTERFAX said that Simferopol will try to use legal means to solve the current situation in such a way so that the relations between Ukraine and the Crimea be based on principles of agreements as it was said in the Crimean Constitution of 6 May 1992. We do not pose the question of the Crimea's secession from Ukraine. We want to have Russia to be as open to us as Ukraine is, said the Crimean deputy.
