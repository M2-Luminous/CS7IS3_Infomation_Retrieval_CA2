The meeting participants praised the message of Boris Yeltsin to the Serbs on the need for joint actions of the United States, the European Union and other partners in order to boost the Bosnian settlement. A meeting of senior officials from the Russian Federation, the United States, Germany, France and Great Britain, as well as the European Council's "three" will be held next week to discuss a dialogue with the Security Council, the United Nations and the co-chairmen of the London conference on former Yugoslavia. According to diplomatic circles, the meeting will be held in Bonn. There may also be a meeting of foreign ministers on the same issue. The process was initiated by German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and Andrey Kozyrev, said Sidorova. After meetings with U.S. state secretary and foreign ministers of France and Great Britain, everyone supported the need for joint initiatives. The Athens consultations also discussed the soonest signing of a treaty on cooperation and partnership by the European Union and Russia. The political declaration was signed by Boris Yeltsin in 1993, and the treaty will outline specific areas of cooperation and interaction. There are some disputable questions, including exports of nuclear cycle materials and banking. Some voice the need for quotas on these goods, and the Russian side is against this. Russia is against any quotas on these goods. Sidorova said Greece is ready to help the soonest conclusion of the treaty. The consultations analyzed European security, the situation in conflict zones on territory of the former Soviet Union, including Transcaucasia and Nagorno-Karabakh, and relations with Ukraine. They noted general understanding on sanctions against former Yugoslavia. The question of sanctions will be raised as soon as settlement progresses, and this coincides with the Russian stand on the issue. Describing the situation in Transcaucasia, Kozyrev stressed the interest in the involvement of CSCE and U.N. peace-makers, said Sidorova.
