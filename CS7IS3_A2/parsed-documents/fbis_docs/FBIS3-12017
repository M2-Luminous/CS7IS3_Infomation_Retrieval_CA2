[Station announcer] This is probably in response to newspaper reports on the disorganization and lack of security surrounding the PRI candidate. [Ahuactzin] That is correct. According to the PRI-CEN, this explanation is aimed at clarifying events. They expressed their willingness to provide more information if it is requested by judicial authorities. We will now proceed to read the six clarification points: 1. The rally with residents was held in accordance with the program. The aim was to have the best possibilities for contact between the candidate and citizens. 2. Luis Donaldo Colosio addressed residents from a stand on a pickup truck so the participants could have better visibility. 3. Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, general coordinator of Colosio's campaign, did not attend the Baja California rally because his participation in state visits was not deemed necessary. 4. Candidate Colosio was transferred immediately to the Tijuana General Hospital, which is close to the area of the attack. 5. Colosio was initially transferred to a blazer truck because it was close to the place where the tragedy took place. 6. From this truck, he was transferred to the assisting ambulance which was part of the rally's organization. These are the six clarifications made by the PRI-CEN. Obviously, the PRI-CEN expressed its willingness to provide whatever information is necessary in order to clarify these tragic events.
