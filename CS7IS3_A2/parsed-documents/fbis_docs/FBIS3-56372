In Addition to This, the Yeltsin-Clinton Meeting Also Has Some Other Results"] [Text] The just concluded meeting between the Russian and U.S. Presidents has not brought anything new in the relations between these two countries. Bill Clinton's expressions of support for Boris Yeltsin and his course toward economic reforms have been heard from across the ocean ever since the moment when Yeltsin himself started talking about them. The presidents did not report anything sensational at their final press conference, like what they agreed on in Vancouver or at the Tokyo G-7 meeting. The Moscow summit with respect to Russian-U.S. relations can be described as working, regular, and transient rather than historic. Were it not for the issue of the Ukrainian nuclear weapons and yesterday's signing of the Russian-Ukrainian-U.S. agreement on their abolition, Clinton's visit to Moscow would not have justified the usual expectations of a meeting between the presidents of great powers. An exception here might be a $12 billion contract signed yesterday in Moscow on the sale of Russian weapons-grade uranium to the United States over a period of 20 years which will be processed into nuclear power plant fuel with U.S. assistance. But this question too could have been dealt with during the visit to Russia by Vice President Albert Gore, which was precisely of an economic character. Yet the latest meeting of the presidents has its own results which are perhaps worth elaboration. The most outstanding among them may be the accord on lifting most of the discriminatory economic restrictions on Russian goods entering the U.S. market. This is far more important for the prestige of the Russian Federation than the reception of economic aid packages some of which -- for instance, the Tokyo one last July -- are allocated only in word. Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin at the final press conference with his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton stressed that Russia needs full-fledged collaboration with the West, not "humanitarian aid." Therefore, by renouncing the status of a state being dragged out of the mire of economic crisis by others, Russia is putting itself in the same rank with the developed countries. This is also evident from Yeltsin's words, which showed that he sees the prospect of G-7 soon turning into G-8. Possibly this will happen in July at the G-7 Naples summit to which the Russian president has been invited. He told journalists that relations between Russia and the United States "have been developing in a stable and partner-like manner," but they need adjustment, especially in the social sphere. Russia is not expecting direct social assistance from the United States because, according to Yeltsin, "such support is needed by the United States itself": It is impossible to help Russia overcome unemployment without having overcome its own unemployment in the first place. Touching on this social issue, Boris Yeltsin thus apparently sought to hedge against possible attacks on the part of a number of opposition forces in parliament who are accusing him of lacking a social security policy. Furthermore, the president uttered a seemingly flattering phrase with respect to the parliamentarians: "I do not think that we have a bad parliament. It is more intelligent and more intellectual, and with great experience. The upper chamber will follow the president's line and the State Duma will come around to that." Although it was spoken in linkage to the issue of ratification of international treaties, Boris Yeltsin apparently also had the domestic aspect in mind. The implication behind this phrase is approximately as follows: "I am commending you and you should learn to listen to me. If you do, I shall praise you again." The joint statement by the Russian and U.S. Presidents on securing human and ethnic minority rights, which primarily applies to the Baltic countries, was fairly important but unfortunately little more than a mere declaration. Boris Yeltsin described this statement as "having teeth." After its concessions to Moscow on the issue of NATO expansion the United States has once again shown who is more important for it. And here, judging by how feebly Clinton agreed with Yeltsin's statements at the press conference, presumably there was some pressure involved there. In the situation of misunderstanding that has developed between Russia and the Baltic republics, the White House has in the end taken the Kremlin's side. As for NATO, by inviting the East European countries into the Partnership for Peace, the North Atlantic alliance, according to Clinton, is giving a chance to all of them to become full-fledged members of this structure. Today the Partnership for Peace will be conducive to preventing a division of Europe and Russia's separation from it. Both Clinton and Yeltsin noted that there have been disagreements in the course of the talks. But at the press conference only one such issue cropped up on which the presidents hold different points of view -- the conflict in Bosnia and the possibility of bombing it with NATO forces. On this problem the heads of the two states did not come to agreement but, in Clinton's words, a frank conversation on this subject created the foundation for future discussions. Apparently fearing "embarrassing" questions, especially after the words about disagreements between the two friends, Vyacheslav Kostikov, the Russian Federation president's press secretary, gave no opportunity to representatives of Russian newspapers to ask any questions. Journalists from third countries were also denied this possibility. So, it can be stated that the main result of Bill Clinton's visit to Moscow has been the signing of the trilateral agreement on the destruction of Kiev's nuclear weapons. Importantly, on Yeltsin's initiative. As for Russian-U.S. bilateral relations, there have been no particularly outstanding moves. But then, where is one supposed to move as long as things in this respect are as good as they can possibly be: President Boris Yeltsin is friendly with Bill Clinton and the people of the Russian Federation with the people of the United States.
