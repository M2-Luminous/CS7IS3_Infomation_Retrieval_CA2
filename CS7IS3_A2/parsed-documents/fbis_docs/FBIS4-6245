This headquarters involves the human rights committee of the Council of Christian Churches, human rights committees of Roman Catholic and Buddhist organisations, the bar association for a Democratic Society, the Council of Family Movement for Realising Democracy and other civilian human rights organisations, and human rights committees and dissident organisations in Taejon and Kwangju. After its inauguration, it sent appeals to the South Korean "minister of the Unification Board" and presidents of the International Red Cross and of the South Korean Red Cross, strongly demanding the repatriation of the two unconverted long-term prisoners to the northern half of Korea. A statement of the headquarters carried in the magazine HUMAN RIGHTS said old Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan must have been repatriated at the time of exchange of POWs according to the Geneva Conventions because they were taken prisoners during the war, but they had been submitted for trial by the "court-martial" and made to suffer in prison for scores of years. It strongly urged the South Korean authorities to return the two old men to the North as soon as possible.
