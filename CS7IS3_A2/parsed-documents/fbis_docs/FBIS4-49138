It then proposed that the Hong Kong Government set up a "human rights commission" and a "human rights supervisory institution" and "guarantee that Hong Kong will continue to enjoy basic human rights after the transfer of sovereignty." The Foreign Affairs Committee chairman even advocated exerting international pressure on China on the question of human rights and asked the British Government and the UN Human Rights Commission to "jointly supervise progress in Hong Kong's human rights status after 1997." It seems that Britain wishes to act as a "human rights guard" for Hong Kong! Honestly speaking, the fact that Britain talks about human rights and claims to be a "human rights guard" before China and before the Hong Kong people will only add one more little joke to the world. Racism and colonialism are the opponents of human rights. When a place is ruled by racism and colonialism, its human rights are trampled on. This has been proved by numerous facts around the world. Britain has exercised colonial rule in so many countries and regions! It has deprived so many people of their rights and civil liberties! Britain used gunboats to seize Hong Kong from China 150 years ago. Even today, it still rules this place with colonialist practices and infringes upon the rights of the Hong Kong people. In the 1880's and during the early part of this century, Britain carried out two armed invasions of China's Tibet, inflicting a very great loss on the Tibetan people. Moreover, it instigated the reactionary elements of Tibet's upper level to rebel and massacred the patriotic people. This is Britain's human rights record. What a sordid tale! Back home in Britain, different races have not achieved equality either, as some Hong Kong people have pointed out, and not all of the International Labor Agreements are observed. On this basis alone, there is no way that we can say that Britain has a good human rights record. Isn't it ridiculous that Britain today has gone so far as to vilify China -- which does not have a single soldier in another country and which is making remarkable achievements in the protection and improvement of human rights at home! Hong Kong needs human rights. Its human rights can only be really guaranteed after Britain pulls out, after colonial rule ends, and when the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region -- which will be ruled by the Hong Kong people and which will have a high degree of autonomy -- is established. The Basic Law has detailed provisions regarding the rights and freedoms to be enjoyed by the Hong Kong people after Hong Kong has reverted to the motherland. In the Chapter on the Fundamental Rights and Duties of the Residents alone, there are 11 articles which deal with freedoms. The scope of rights is so wide and the degree of freedom is so large that they are rarely seen in the world. Taking advantage of the Wei Jingsheng and Xi Yang incidents, which judicial organs have already dealt with in accordance with the law, however, Britain has invented the lie that "Hong Kong's human rights status will probably deteriorate after 1997" and has invented Hong Kong people's "worries" over the future. If Britain uses this as a basis for setting up a "human rights commission" and a "human rights supervisory institute" before 1997, then people have reason to believe that the motive behind Britain's advocacy for establishing such institutions is to protect those people -- like those already sentenced by China -- who pry into and steal state military information and economic secrets and endanger national security and national interests and to build a shelter for a small number of anglophile and anti-Chinese elements who are hostile to China and who are creating confusion in Hong Kong. Therefore, as the "proposal" was advanced, leaders of the United Democrats -- Christine Loh Kung-wai, and the like -- were immediately overjoyed. They claimed it "conforms to the overall interests of the community" and "will enable Hong Kong people to have more confidence in the future." They then urged the government to set up human rights institutions as soon as possible and "compile a report for the United Nations." They and some others advocated drawing up an information freedom regulations bill and a human rights and equal opportunity commission regulations bill and urged the Hong Kong Government to step up its revision of such laws and regulations as the Press Freedom Regulations, the Official Secrets Act, and the Public Security Regulations so that their restrictions can be relaxed, thus offering legal protection to some who go against China and create confusion and make trouble in Hong Kong. Some people from the Hong Kong community pointed out: Britain has never done anything to improve Hong Kong's human rights status during its colonial rule for the past one and a half centuries. Now Britain is playing "human rights politics" when Hong Kong is about to revert to the motherland. They argued that Britain is not doing this out of good intentions but in order to set up new obstacles for Hong Kong's smooth transition. Therefore, the Hong Kong people should be on guard against this ploy and must never be taken in. Everything that happens after 30 June 1997 will be China's internal affairs, and no country can intervene. All major issues involving and straddling 1997 should be negotiated between China and Britain and must not be unilaterally decided on by the British side. This is a question of principle. The question of whether there is the need to formulate laws and set up institutions for the protection of Hong Kong's post-1997 human rights in accordance with the Basic Law is the affair of the future Hong Kong SAR, and the British side has no right to intervene. If the British Hong Kong authorities want to "act independently" again by setting up the so-called "human rights commission" or "human rights supervisory institution," the Chinese side will surely not acknowledge them as it does not acknowledge the political system framework. As for international pressure, China does not fear it, and no other country is expected to follow Britain at its instigation.
