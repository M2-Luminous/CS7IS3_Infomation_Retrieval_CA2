Udaltsov said that the talks covered the foreign property of Lithuania and Russia following the disintegration of the USSR and issues in the functioning of the Russian embassy in Vilnius and the Lithuanian embassy in Moscow. He emphasized that it was the first time the two sides had discused "this delicate matter. ...One could not expect to have all the property issues settled in one day. What is important is that we have come to an understanding of the way these issues should be discussed." The diplomat expressed the hope that in further talks, to be held in Vilnius shortly, the two sides will agree on the Lithuanian embassy buildings in Rome and Paris that had been taken over by the USSR in 1940. The Lithuanians want them back. Another senior Russian Foreign Ministry official, who also handles Baltic issues, thinks that the outlook for solution of the "property issue" is "dim." He told Interfax that there was no solution in sight for the problem of the Russian embassy in Vilnius. "We would like to purchase good premises using the cash Lithuania owes for supplies of natural gas but the Lithuanian authorities remain ambiguous on that," he said. The diplomat also said that the Lithuanian ownership rights of numerous buildings in Moscow "are in serious doubt." In his words, Lithuanian diplomats have no documents confirming their rights to use premises they now hold. He said that Russia owned the former Lithuanian embassy building in Rome "quite legally" while the situation in Paris was "more complicated and should become the subject of bilateral talks, especially because French authorities refused to act as arbiters."
