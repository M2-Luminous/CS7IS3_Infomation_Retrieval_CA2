The decree envisages, in particular, punishment for those guilty of delays in the payment of wages and salaries. "Failure to pay wages, like rust, erodes the entire economic mechanism. It has ceased to be risky and has become an economically lucrative thing not to foot bills". ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI comments on a draft memorandum on civil peace and accord. Preparation of such a memo was the subject of the Russian president's meeting with representatives from parties and public movements, the parliament and government in the Kremlin recently. "However, can a document, even such a substantial and representative as this one, keep the country from slipping down into chaos?" the newspaper asks and provides the answer: "It is unlikely. All depends on whether the leading political and public forces of the country that have influence among the masses really intend to make every effort to maintain civil peace or this is just a tactical manoeuvre for someone". KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) runs a column of replies, under the general headline "The State has a Future if the Rising Generation Chooses Patriotism", by participants in a recent roundtable meeting here about the education of young people in the spirit of patriotism. "Our country has got a kind of 'black hole' in this respect, with cruelty, cynicism, all-crushing nihilism, and the lack of spirituality drifting in from it". RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA on the problems of children's homes, orphanages and special schools. "Ninety per cent less attention is now given to children in boarding schools than during the stagnation period". KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with outstanding chess player Anatoliy Karpov who said, in view of his triumph in Linares: "To me, the triumph in the tournament is both an honour and self- affirmation as world champion and an evidence of unabated strength". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA maintains that the Russian Federation's accession to NATO's Partnership-for-Peace programme "would enhance russia's isolation and sharply limit its freedom for foreign-policy manoeuvring". KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, touching upon the forthcoming 8th international aerospace show, the Fidae-94, to be held in the capital of Chile on March 20-27, quotes Axel Cabrera, Chilean consul in the Russian Federation, as saying that the success of the Fidae-94 "is predetermined by Russia's participation". TRUD analyses the causes of the failure of the Georgian-Abkhazian talks on a political settlement of the conflict. The newspaper sees a real way out of the crisis in Abkhazia's signing a confederative treaty with Georgia, a treaty under which each side would be declared sovereign and a subject of international law. PRAVDA runs an interview with Tajikistan Parliament Chief Emomali Rakhmonov who believes that his country should have armed forces of its own. SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA carries an interview with writer Yuriy Bondarev on the eve of his 70th birthday. The newspaper singles out the writer's words "that Russia has its own path in world history, a unique one achieved through suffering".
