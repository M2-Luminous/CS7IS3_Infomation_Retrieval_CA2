Security forces will escort pilgrims and hold their passports when they enter Egypt from Libya at Sallum until they leave the country at al-Nuwaybi' in the Sinai, officials said. "These measures are aimed at preventing Algerian militants infiltrating into Egypt," a security official at the Libyan-Egyptian border said. The security services had obtained information about attempts at cooperation between Egyptian and Algerian extremists. "The Algerian militants could take advantage of the pilgrimage season to infiltrate into Egypt and renew contacts with Egyptian activists," he said. Some 30,000 pilgrims from Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Mauritania are to start travelling to Saudi Arabia via the Egyptian border post at Sallum. The pilgrimage, or hajj, is planned for the end of May. Only Libyan pilgrims will be exempt from the measures. The governments of Egypt and Algeria are both locked in a bloody confrontation with Islamic militants bent on their overthrow.
