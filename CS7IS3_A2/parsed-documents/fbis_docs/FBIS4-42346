In a written statement, Karayalcin drew attention to the fact that the report was issued when the TRNC informed the United Nations of its positive views, some of which involved certain sacrifices. Stressing that the accusations leveled at the Turkish Cypriot side regarding its lack of political will, despite its constructive and positive approach, cannot be received with understanding, Karayalcin added: No doubt peaceful results cannot be achieved in Cyprus through an approach that supports the views of one side and pressures the other to accept the same views. The UN secretary general should not expect this approach to be tolerated. Karayalcin added that it should be known that one can reach a realistic and viable solution in Cyprus only through the free will of the two sides and through negotiations.
