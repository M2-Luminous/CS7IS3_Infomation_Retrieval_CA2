This was the first time its export volume had exceeded that of Shanghai and it ranked first among the large cities in the country. Last year, Shenzhen's foreign trade enterprises were troubled by undesirable factors such as shortages of funds, drastic fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, and difficulties in tax reimbursement. Shenzhen City government judged the hour, sized up the situation, did solid work for enterprises, pooled funds through various channels, made use of foreign trade and export regulation funds, and speeded up the checking of tax reimbursements. Thanks to the effective measures, Shenzhen's foreign trade enterprises were able to avoid a big slide in exports under an extremely difficult situation. While consolidating its markets in Hong Kong and Macao, Shenzhen has made great efforts to develop its markets in the Asia-Pacific region and to open up market in the CIS, Eastern Europe, South America, and Africa. These are the main features of Shenzhen's foreign trade and exports last year. According to reports, Shenzhen's export volume to Africa last year was over 10 times that of the previous year and its exports to South America, and to the CIS and Eastern Europe were respectively 891.72 and 429.39 percent that of the previous year. The implementation of a pluralistic strategy in developing foreign trade markets has laid a firm foundation for Shenzhen City to increase its foreign trade and exports. There were also reports on Shenzhen's success in earning foreign exchange with agricultural products and fresh and live products earned as much as HK$1 billion [Hong Kong dollars] in foreign exchange last year.
