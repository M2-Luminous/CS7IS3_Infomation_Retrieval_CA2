An economic and trade official has pointed out in Hong Kong: Foreign firms are encouraged to invest in large and medium state-owned enterprises to conduct technological transformation, but, as the conditions are not yet ripe, foreign investment cannot be made in the form of share purchases. Meng Xiangang, director of the Department of Foreign Economic Cooperation and Trade of the State Economic and Trade Commission, said here yesterday that the mainland government is studying and formulating relevant policies, and foreign firms are encouraged to invest in large and medium enterprises for technological transformation. The mainland government will follow the key orientation of unequivocally encouraging foreign investment in technological transformation in light of state industrial policies, while drawing up corresponding measures of encouragement in several areas, such as credit, taxation, use of foreign exchange, and import and export administration. Citing the example of over 5,000 new large and medium enterprises in the 12 provinces in the northeast and the north, Meng Xiangang said that one-third of them urgently need to undergo technological transformation. However, he stressed that improving the state-owned enterprises' technological standards and helping their products more easily respond to market needs by integrating with foreign investment was a form of transforming the mechanism of state-owned enterprises, which is different from allowing foreign firms to buy up state-owned enterprises.
