This year, the second-phase overall agricultural development project of the province should pass through the state acceptance test, and the third-phase project will comprehensively start. Therefore, this year is a key year serving as a link between past and future. At present, we should emphatically grasp the work in the following few aspects. First, we should attend to the winding-up work of the second-phase project and make preparations for the third-phase project. Second, according to the guidelines of the national overall agricultural development work conference, we should ceaselessly strengthen and improve new methods for management of agricultural development. Third, we should ensure the supply of funds for development. From now on, we should try every possible to arrange, in a coordinate manner, the development of the overall agricultural development items, the items involving the loans granted by the World Bank, and the items involving the capital provided by the international agricultural development fund so as to solve the difficulties in providing necessary funds for these items. Simultaneously, we should make a unified plan to arrange the special agricultural loans, increase the [words indistinct] efficiency of loans, and reduce the losses from loans. Fourth, we should strengthen organizational leadership. The overall agricultural development is a task with various departments involved, large amounts of work load, and strict demands. So, the governments at various levels should strengthen the leadership over this work and support this work so as to accomplish this task with high standards, high quality, and high efficiency and to create a new overall agricultural development situation.
