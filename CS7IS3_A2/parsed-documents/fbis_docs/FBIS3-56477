"I do not feel triumphant," he told Interfax Friday morning [14 January]. "The justices acted as professionals." He said that the court members reinstated him in a nine to four vote by secret ballot. Luchin went on a hunger strike Tuesday demanding a vote on his membership which was suspended on December 1 because of his alleged political activities. A CC source told Interfax that in a seven to six vote by show of hands the court had put off consideration of reinstating Valery Zorkin. The source believes that by reinstating Luchin the CC justices "disavowed the presidential decree advising that the seats occupied by Luchin and Zorkin should be regarded vacant."
