Among several types of fuel cells being developed, phosphoric acid fuel cells (PAFC) offer the highest promise of practical application in the near future as an advanced power generation plant, and thus R&D on PAFC systems has been promoted vigorously. Japan's original R&D activity for PAFC power plants was initiated in 1981 as part of the government's Moonlight Project. Following the development of fundamental technology and elemental components, two types of 1MW PAFC pilot plants for utility application and two types of 200kW cogeneration pilot plants for on-site and remote island application were developed. The demonstration tests of these plants were conducted successfully in 1987-88 and 1989-91, respectively. In the private sector, Japanese major electric and gas utility companies started their R&D on PAFC in the 1970s, and demonstration tests of a 4.5MW PAFC power plant and 40kW on-site fuel cells were carried out in the middle of '80s at a power station and customer sites. Research and development work on elemental components, such as fuel cell stack, reformer and inverter, and on system technology has been pursued under these projects, resulting in substantial development progress of fundamental technologies for PAFC power plants. PAFC development for practical application has been continued into the 1990s. The efforts included the demonstration test of an 11MW power plant for utility use and field tests of 50 to 200kW on-site fuel cells. Considering these developments, MITI started in 1991 and 1992 two projects aiming at early market entry of PAFC. One is the field test of small-size, on-site fuel cells at various customer sites. In this project, private field test programs are subsidized by NEDO. The other is the development of two large-scale PAFC power plants -- a 5MW PAFC power plant for urban energy center application and a 1MW on-site PAFC cogeneration plant. A PAFC technology research association established in 1991 by fourteen electric and gas utility companies is promoting development and demonstration tests of these power plants. Demonstration, Evaluation and Field Tests of Small-Size On-Site Fuel Cells In 1993, over 50 on-site PAFC power generation units, ranging in capacity from 50kW to 500kW, are being operated at various customer buildings and utility testing facilities in Japan for demonstration and evaluation. Some of these efforts are subsidized by MITI, with NEDO funding one third of the installation cost. Efficiency, compactness and environmental features have been almost achieved to meet the requirements of the market. Reliability and durability have also been improved. One of these on-site PAFC power plants has already attained a total operating time of over 15,000 hours -- the longest ever. It also has achieved the longest continuous operation time of over 5,000 hours. Most recent plants show availability of around 80%. Development and Demonstration of 5000kW and 1000kW PAFC Power Plants A 6-year development and demonstration project, involving a 5000kW class PAFC power plant for urban energy center application and a 1000kW class PAFC power plant for large-scale cogeneration, was started in 1991 as an NEDO and PAFC-TRA collaboration. This project aims to establish technologies for utilizing PAFCs in electric utility application and commercializing large-scale PAFC cogeneration systems, from the aspects of reliability and cost reduction.

Future Prospects Development of PAFC power plant technology has now reached the stage where small-size, on-site fuel cells are on the threshold of practical application. Major problems yet to be overcome for commercialization are reliability and cost. Vigorous efforts toward commercial application of PAFC plants are in progress in both the public and private sectors through day-to-day technological development and testing, with particular emphasis placed on reliability improvement meeting the user's requirements in a few years. Manufacturers are also stepping up their efforts to advance PAFC technology, including mass production systems, that could lead to substantial cost reduction. Policy and marketing strategy for practical application of PAFCs are being addressed on a nationwide scale. The market penetration of PAFC power plants is expected to begin in the middle of the 1990s.
