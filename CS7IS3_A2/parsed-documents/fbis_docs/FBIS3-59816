It is different from other such instances in our contemporary history. This awareness, sincerely and enthusiastically eager to know past patriots and to learn from their heritage, values, and influence, is the inevitable result of scientific understanding and a total grasp of the movement of history and its philosophy. One of the most dangerous pests to which our combatant nation has been exposed is the attempt of enemies, in their different languages and varieties, of their diverse sects and beliefs, to create a state of anarchy and confusion among the people of a single community, and to feed the spirit of dissension and hostility among its individuals. It has tried to perpetuate dissension and religious strife among their ranks and distort the historical realities of Arab Islamic culture. All this was in order to halt the renaissance and reawakening that had reached its peak in this decisive juncture in the history of our nation, and there must be a response. Among them are the orientalists who devoted themselves to studying the Crusades, with many points of view, both praising and blaming, among them both men fair and those who avoid the truth. Researchers studying orientalism and the Crusades are unable to find the many sources of this movement, so it is not easy for them except the trivial part of it which might conceal these two subjects. This presents researchers with real difficulties, so they add their own touches to make a clear picture of orientalists and the Crusades. To demonstrate this, the fair-minded German orientalist Sigrid Hunke [?] gave an example of what we are saying when she said, "I have found nothing in the articles but trivialization, which does not satisfy a researcher's thirst." We will make an effort to point up the truth of what these fair-minded ones believed, to show the refinement and role of the Arabs in human civilization. We will also touch on orientalism and make its concept and aims clear. We will examine the orientalists' ideas and learn their views on thhe Crusades, and make an effort to respond to the orientalists with the meager sources available to us. We will, of course, focus on sources containing the points of the orientalists who treated the Arabs and their culture fairly first of all. Then we will turn to the unfair orientalists who were prejudiced against the Arabs and Islam, under the influence of many motives and factors, lacking the spirit of objectivity and fairness. Research depends upon the book of German orientalist, Dr. Sigrid Hunke [?] in her valuable book The Arab Sun Shines on the West and the book of orientalist Anthony West The Crusades, in addition to the books of Gustave Lebon, of researcher Subhi 'Abd-al-Hamid (The Arabs' Decisive Battles) and Montgomery Watt (The Influence of Islam on Europe), and Dr. Salih Muhammad al-'Abid's article "The Crusades: Causes and Motives" in AL-MAWRID magazine. The Concept of Orientalism and Its Goals Orientalism, as a term, is a science devoted to studying the languages, heritage, culture, past, and present of the Orient. Linguistically, orientalism is the east, the place where the sun rises. The studies that involve the oriental world have been labeled "orientalism," and the Westerners who undertake these studies are termed "orientalists." Orientalism grew and thrived side by side with the imperialism that Europe experienced in the era of industrial, military, and cultural development; every country sought to compete with its neighbors for the greatest possible number of colonies, to exploit them for political and economic ends. Among these was the Vatican, in which orientalism grew and developed, making the Vatican a small-scale religious state with an army of priests. It led Europe politically, militarily, and religously, from the Crusades down to the present day. One example of its interest in orientalism was the founding of the Maronite College in 1754, which was dedicated to graduating orientalists, and still graduates students interested in orientalism in the present day. And the orientalists, they are those who are involved in the affairs of the Islamic east, who have eagerly devoted themselves to studying it and following its cultural, historical, religious, and social topics. One might remark that it has no specific beginning point. Some researchers pinpoint its having begin in the first century AD; others say it began with the Crusades, while we find that the Christian west dates the beginning of official orientalism with the publication of the clerical decision of the Vienna Conclave, in 1312, to endow numerous professorial chairs in the Arabic, Hebrew, and Syriac languages at European universities such as Paris and Oxford. It is likeliest, however, that the real establishment of orientalism was in the 18th century, when the west colonized the Muslim world and gained control over its properties, usurping manuscripts and taking them for their own libraries. In the last quarter of the nineteenth century, the first orientalist conference was held in Paris in 1873. And orientalist conferences have continued to be held. Motives and Goals of Orientalism The principal motive of orientalism is rooted in the struggle between the Islamic and Christian worlds in Muslim Spain and Sicily. The Crusades, in particular, got the Europeans interested in learning about Islam and its practices. Orientalism has many aims, perhaps most of all the prevention of the spread of Islam in Europe, and the attempt to estrange Muslims from their faith and spread dissension in their ranks. The orientalist establishment also seeks to appropriate religious ideas from Islam in order to base the principles of the church on rational religious ideas, since Europeans shunned clerical logic that flew in the face of science. The orientalist movement turned its attention to serving colonialism by revealing the mentalities, moods, and weak points of the orientals preparatory to missionary and imperialist campaigns. Among the aims of orientalism is the destruction of the intellectual unity of the Islamic community by spreading doctrinal disputes to divide and sectarianize, for a fragmentation throughout the community. It also fragmented the linguistic unity of the Islamic community and weakened the Islamic personality, creating a spirit of disunion and feelings of inferiority in the souls of the orientals. It spread doubt about the values, principles, and ideals they cherished. The orientalists also sought to make orientalist studies a source for educating Muslims about Islam. Phases of Orientalism A. The first phase began when the clergy moved the theology and philosophy of Greece from the Arabs to Rome, as the church in the west was backward and intellectually wanting. B. The second phase was when orientalism became manifest in the 17th century, forming a distorted idea of Islam in Europe. It was largely based on the writings of the orientalists of the first phase, after the Crusades. This phase was notable for obscuring the eastern Arab world of Muslim Arabs with a motive of hidden hatred, contrary to what it tried to claim about being impartial and scientifically objective.
