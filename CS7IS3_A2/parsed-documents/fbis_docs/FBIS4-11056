Exports grew by only 2.9 percent in 1993, but imports grew at an accelerated rate. The government believes this is normal in view of the ongoing process to eliminate tariffs. It trusts exports will perform well beginning in 1995. The National Customs and Tax Directorate has reported Colombians imported $9.8 billion in 1993, compared to $6.5 billion in 1992; that is, 51.1 percent more. There was an increase from $958.3 million in 1992 to $1.7 billion in 1993; that is, an 82.27-percent increase. The highest increase was in raw materials; the highest increase was registered in durable consumer goods, including private automobiles, weapons, military equipment, and home appliances; there was a 126-percent increase in this area. The highest increase was in raw materials, intermediate products, and fuels, with a total of $4.2 billion. The purchase of capital goods also registered a considerable increase, with a total of $3.8 billion; that is, a 75.73-percent increase in 1993 compared with 1992. The United States was again Colombia's main purveyor. Colombia imported $3.4 billion from this country in 1993; that is, 42 percent more than in 1992. Venezuela was the second purveyor, with $968.1 million in 1993 compared to $424 million in 1992. Concerning exports, they increased by only 2.9 percent, for a total of $7.1 billion. Nontraditional exports increased by 11.95 percent; that is, $3.9 billion; this was caused by an expansion of bananas and emerald sales abroad. Banana sales totaled $393.8 million and emerald sales totaled $308.6 million, exports of which increased by 77.2 percent in 1993 compared to 1992. Traditional exports dropped due to lower sales of coffee, ferronickel, and petroleum. Coffee exports dropped 9.45 percent, ferronickel exports by 18.58 percent, and petroleum sales by 6.3 percent in 1993 compared to 1992.

That nearly 1-percent increase is equivalent to 46,000 more unemployed. The growth in unemployment was due to a slight decrease in economic growth. Dane reported the largest departmental capitals registered considerable increases in unemployment, but three smaller capitals, Bucaramanga, manizales, and Pasto, registered decreases. Medellin fared the worst, with 13.3 percent. Santa Fe de Bogota registered the lowest rate, with 8.2 percent. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 13 April 94 pp 1b, 3b)
