With the proviso of ratification, Federal Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt signed the Final Act for Germany, the treaty on establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the agreement on the public procurement system; Sir Leon Brittan signed for the European Union [EU]. The results achieved are a very essential contribution to the further liberalization of world trade. At the same time, this conclusion also lastingly strengthens the credibility of an open, predictable and dependable multilateral trade system as well as confidence--so very important in the present economic situation--in the growth and job creation effectiveness of international trade. The spread of the final results, as well as the spectrum of prospective tasks after the Marrakech conference, cover a very wide range and require differentiated consideration. Above all, it now concerns rapidly implemented ratification procedures in the national parliaments of the member states. This step is necessary since the Final Act of the Uruguay Round, comprising over 20,000 pages, touches not only upon Community [EU], but also upon national jurisdictions of the Federal Government and the laender. Only subsequently, forseeably by 1 January 1995, can the important general conditions for a dynamic economic development and for global growth impulses be further improved by the agreed-upon regulations, such as - an average 30-percent lowering of tariffs on market access for industrial goods, - the agreement on protection of intellectual property, - the new subsidy and antidumping clauses, - reduction of nontariff trade obstacles, and - founding a World Trade Organization as the new institutional and legal framework of multilateral trade relations. On all other issues, not yet--or not yet completely--resolved through agreements, such as audiovisual and financing services, basic telecommunications, ocean traffic, steel, and civilian aviation, subsequent negotiations will have to be conducted within the framework of the new WTO. In addition, there is the large sector of entirely new and ever more complex tasks, due to the growing integration of the economies of the member states in world trade, for the time after Marrakech. They must be resolved within the framework of the WTO as the future permanent forum for multilateral trade negotiations, as the place for implementation of integrated arbitration proceedings, and as the institution for cooperation with international organizations (IMF, World Bank). Even during the Uruguay Round negotiations, which lasted for a period of seven years, several sides demanded inclusion of additional issues, such as the problem of interfacing trade and environment. Both areas are linked to each other in many ways since, for example, the production and transport of goods, and their global export and import often are not environmentally neutral. Vice versa, environmental protection policies, often with direct intervention, have a restrictive effect on international trade. Environmental standards in international agreements, which could bring relief, to this day are very little in harmony. That is why it is now urgently necessary to deepen the analysis of this problem to develop generally accepted substantial guidelines, which will also take into consideration the special sensitivities of developing countries. The WTO, in the wide-ranging framework of its functions and in the preamble of the agreement, which expressly embodies the goal of protecting the environment, possesses a solid foundation for this work. Precisely for this purpose, a permanent WTO commission was established in Marrakech, whose members are recruited from experts of the trade and environment sectors. Now Come Social Clauses Without a doubt, the question of linkage between trade and social standards, primarily discussed in U.N. agencies, will soon also be on the agenda of trade policy bodies. This already became clear in Marrakech, above all because of the insistence of the United States for incorporation of a social clause in GATT or WTO, respectively. The Federal Government recognized the urgency of defusing this tense situation, but warned at the minister conference in Marrakech against rash steps. The discussion of social standards will not be easy to conduct. Fundamental economic interests of the developing countries are affected. Demands for social standards are met with suspicion, especially by developing countries. They suspect that the often demanded import measures and obligation to mark the origin of goods in reality are protectionist aims of industrial countries to the detriment of their advantages of location. Such shortsighted, misunderstood protective interests would rob developing countries of the gains in prosperity and growth resulting--especially for them--from increased global trade, and which are the important, even decisive, basis and prerequisite for better working conditions and higher social standards in those countries. Introduction of social standards cannot be forced on developing countries by threatening import measures, which, with regard to the groups affected (children, prisoners, etc.), probably would have little effect. Thus it is better to link the purposeful liberalization of global trade with an open--and mutually understanding--political discussion with the developing countries on improved work and social standards in order to move these countries to constructive cooperation. In principle, the WTO is open to dealing with this problem. However, with a view to a fruitful discussion, one should avoid the mistake of completely excluding the bodies originally in charge of dealing with these issues, just because a new organization has been created. The work of the WTO can only build meaningfully on the expertise and clarity developed by U.N. agencies and the ILO [International Labor Organization]. Also, the overall work of the WTO must not be dominated or especially not paralyzed by this subject. Past GATT practice, and also the negotiations in the Uruguay Round, have shown that not all trade-related problems can be covered by existing trade policy regulations. With the increasing internationalization of entrepreneurial activity and the globalization of the markets, the overlapping of policies on trade and competition on the international scene has grown. Competition-distorting practices such as managed trade, export cartels, laser beaming and structural barriers, either by enterprises or governments, or by the interplay of both, also have trade-restrictive effects which considerably limit access to markets. Vice versa, the application of "legal" trade policy tools such as antidumping or countervailing subsidy measures also can have a distorting and trade-restrictive impact if used in a manner impairing competition. Political pressure, such as reacting with trade policy measures to such distortions in competition, can easily arise in such a situation and lead to making GATT agreements and concessions worthless. To avoid this, an international organization on competition as a regulative framework for global activities seems the most sensible solution for this problem. An agreement should be achieved as soon as possible on the "whether and how" of a possible integration in the WTO. The integrating goals of the Uruguay Round, and hence the direction of multilateral trade relations, are confronted with every kind of protectionism. A comprehensive liberalization of world markets, particularly also with regard to the newly adopted areas of services and intellectual property, has a real chance only in open markets. Integration of the countries of East Europe also will succeed only with open markets. Naturally, under the pretext of the job argument, it would be easier at the moment to close the markets to cheap Eastern imports, whether in the EU or in Germany. It must be remembered that all countries in the Community have assumed political responsibility for the economic recovery in the East. Open Up the Markets In this context, monetary transfers are indispensable and justified in the short term. In the longer term, however, they contradict the logic of the market economy, and they are not bearable in view of the resulting burdens on the economies, especially that of Germany, which additionally has to cope with the economic restructuring of the new laender. They affect the economy and consumers in the form of higher taxes and levies, in their final impact endangering jobs from the other side. Hence opening markets for products is the only adequate possibility to promote economic stability in the reform countries, to meaningfully support the structural adjustment process and integration into the multilateral trade system, based on division of labor. But opening the markets also means including regional federations such as ASEAN, NAFTA, APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation], and EU, already liberalized as free trade zones. GATT, or the WTO as the active organ of multilateral negotiations, can build on these successful regional integration processes when it is a matter of implementing further integration efforts. At the same time, one must not ignore the dangers resulting from these agreements with regard to bloc formation, sealing off regional markets, etc. Thus the WTO, in interaction with these federations, will also face the task of finding ways for their further integration into the multilateral trade system.
