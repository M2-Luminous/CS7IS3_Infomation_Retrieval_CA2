Vitruk told the president that at the Council of Europe's request prompted by Russia's intention to apply for a full membership in this organization, he was going to deliver on February 25 a report on the new Russian Constitution to experts of the European Commission. This commission, to which Vitruk is Russia's permanent representative, had carried out an examination of the draft Russian basic law. When speaking to the president, Vitruk commented, specifically, on the proposed report's provisions illustrating the role played by the Constitutional Court in implementing the principles of constitutionalism, separation of powers, federalism, protection of human rights and liberties. The president and the Constitutional Court acting chief also dwelt upon a draft law "On the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation" worked out by constitutional judges and submitted to the State Duma as a legislative initiative. Vitruk informed Yeltsin about preliminary consultations on the draft law with Russia's Supreme Court, the Supreme Arbitration Court, the prosecutor general, judges of various constitutional courts, Russian and foreign scholars and lawyers. He stressed that at the moment, the Constitutional Court was thoroughly examining responses to the bill provided by the presidential staff's state and legal directorate and by the Duma committee for legislation and court reform. The scientific and consultative council under the Constitutional Court is to gather in an enlarged meeting to discuss the draft law "On the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation". In his turn, Yeltsin assured Vitruk that the Russian Constitutional Court and other federal courts would be guarded properly. He pledged the presidential decree of October 7, 1993, on the Constitutional Court in the part of setting up a department for security of supreme judicial bodies would be fulfilled in full. The security service will be supervised by the federal counterintelligence service, a Constitutional Court spokesman told TASS.
