The ceremony is scheduled for April 28. Gennadiy Zyuganov, the leader of the Russian Communist Party representing the moderate branch of the movement, said on Wednesday that the final decision on whether to sign the memorandum will be taken at a party national conference on April 23-24. However, speaking at a news conference today, Zyuganov expressed doubts that any true accord could be reached if signing to a document is limited by one fixed day. "If we take (civil) truce and accord seriously, I stand for a gradual approach towards such a variant which, instead of ideology, would rather focus on the national and state interests and take into account Russia's traditions, contain a mechanism of stabilizing the situation", the communist leader said. Zyuganov reiterated his support of the idea that "a government of national confidence should come to power by democratic means" in Russia.
