FR940630-0-00068 FR940630-0-00026 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [NC&hyph;056&hyph;6068a; FRL&hyph;4999&hyph;4] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans North Carolina: Approval of Revisions to North Carolina Regulations for Oxygenated Gasoline Program AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is approving revisions to the North Carolina State Implementation Plan (SIP). On November 20, 1992, the State of North Carolina through the North Carolina Department of Environmental Management (NCDEM) submitted revisions to its SIP. These revisions will add regulations to implement an oxygenated gasoline program in the Raleigh/Durham and the Winston-Salem/Greensboro/High Point metropolitan statistical areas (MSA). This plan was submitted to satisfy the requirements of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990. The intended effect of this action is to approve the oxygenated gasoline program. DATES: This final rule will be effective August 29, 1994, unless EPA receives adverse or critical comments by August 1, 1994. If the effective date is delayed, timely notice will be published in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to Benjamin Franco at the EPA Region IV address. Copies of the material submitted by the State of North Carolina and incorporated by reference may be examined during normal business hours at the following locations: Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center (Air Docket 6102), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Benjamin Franco of the EPA Region IV Air Programs Branch at (404) 347&hyph;2864 and at the address indicated in the Addresses section. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Motor vehicles are significant sources of CO emissions. An important measure toward reducing these emissions is the use of cleaner-burning oxygenated gasoline. Extra oxygen enhances fuel combustion and helps to offset fuel-rich operating conditions, particularly during vehicle starting, which are more prevalent in the winter. Section 211(m) of the Act requires that various states submit revisions to their SIPs, and implement oxygenated gasoline programs by no later than November 1, 1992. This requirement applies to all states with carbon monoxide nonattainment areas with design values of 9.5 parts per million or more based generally on 1988 and 1989 air quality data. Each state's oxygenated gasoline program must require gasoline for the specified control area(s) to contain not less than 2.7 percent oxygen by weight during that portion of the year in which the areas are prone to high ambient concentrations of CO. The oxygenated gasoline requirements are to generally cover all gasoline sold or dispensed in the larger of the Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA) or the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) in which the nonattainment area is located. The length of the control period, established by section 211(m) of the Act, is from November 1 through February 29. Also, guidelines on the establishment of control periods were published in the Federal Register on October 20, 1992. The State of North Carolina implemented the program during November 1992 through February 1993 and November 1993 through February 1994. The counties of Durham and Wake (Raleigh/Durham) and Forsyth (Winston-Salem) in the State of North Carolina are designated nonattainment for CO and classified as moderate with a design value of 10.9 and 9.7 parts per million, respectively, based on 1988 and 1989 air quality data. Under section 211(m) of the Act, North Carolina was required to submit a revised SIP under section 110 and part D of title I of the Act which includes an oxygenated gasoline program for Raleigh/Durham MSA and the Winston-Salem/Greensboro/High Point MSA by November 15, 1992. On November 20, 1992, the NCDEM submitted to EPA a revised SIP including the oxygenated gasoline program that was adopted by the state on July 9, 1992 and June 26, 1992. EPA summarizes its analysis of the state submittal below. The North Carolina oxygenated gasoline regulations require oxygenated gasoline, containing a minimum of 2.7 percent oxygen content by weight, be sold in the MSA in which each nonattainment area is located, consistent with the requirements of section 211(m)(2) of the Act. North Carolina has included requirements in their rules related to documentation that must accompany the fuel while it is being transferred through the distribution chain. These transfer document requirements will enhance the enforcement of the oxygenated gasoline regulation, by providing a paper trail for each gasoline sample taken by state enforcement personnel.
