He added that the pope only represents the Catholic Church and that all other churches remain outside its policy. He said: As far as we are concerned, we have well-known disagreements with the Jews. These remarks were made in an interview in AL-MUSAWWAR magazine that will be published Friday, 7 January. The pope was commenting on the establishment of diplomatic ties between the Vatican and Israel. Pope Shanudah said that the establishment of ties between the Vatican and Israel does not constitute a reconciliation between the Jews and Christians. If the Jews want to be absolved of the blood of Christ, they have to believe in him, Shanudah said. We will not go to Jerusalem unless we all go together, he said, adding that reports about visits by Coptic tourists to Jerusalem are untrue and merely [word indistinct]. We are still preventing Copts from visiting Jerusalem, he affirmed. Asked about his opinion of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, Shanudah said that it is the first step and could be followed by many other steps leading to the realization of the Palestinian dream of building a homeland. What is happening now are merely steps toward a solution. The pope said that the principle of the balance of powers does not work when Israel has nuclear weapons and the other states in the region do not. We do not fear the establishment of a Middle Eastern market because the Arab world and Egypt have many capabilities and do not suffer from lack of manpower, intelligence, or technology. Shanudah added: We do not fear extremist thought, but we are against violence as a way of spreading ideas and forcing them on the people.
