[Begin Buthelezi recording] We were very much saddened by the news that we have received, that when some people passed near Shell House, which is the ANC [African National Congress] headquarters, some people in Shell House shot at these people and one person died and others were injured. Then when they proceeded to the meeting it appears that more people were killed. Mr. Themba Khoza phoned me to inform me that they had heard information yesterday that some of the MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] cadres intended mixing with the people in order to start a riot and in fact as soon as they had got to the venue of the meeting, I'm then informed that they were shooting from some of the -- ANC people, as they had described them here -- from the top of buildings, surrounding buildings, the result of which 16 people have been killed. So I wish to say that it is quite clear that there are people who really intend having some kind of mayhem in this country, and I am saddened by the fact that the Zulu subjects of the king, who intended doing no more than just demonstrate their stand with their king, you know, in the matters that he has raised, have been attacked in this way. It seems to me that the issue of reconciliation in this country is something that is going to be with us for a long time because it will not be accomplished, because the bitterness caused by these kind of attacks on innocent people, who meant no harm to anyone except to take a stand with their king and to demonstrate their loyalty to their king, should be attacked in this way. And I really wish to condemn this attack on the Zulu people on their way to the march and also at the march in the strongest possible terms, and I do really hope that the attention of the state president and the president of the ANC will be drawn to this kind of merciless killing of our people.
