After the Banco Latino intervention and the banks began to receive aid, the chief of state and all others under him said that there would be no bank interventions. The [word indistinct] said this. We should be able to trust the word of the chief of state, of his finance minister, and of other high-ranking officials. Look at what is happening now. What do you have to say about this? [Aguirre] Good evening, Mr. Pena. Thank you very much for inviting me to this program. I would add the name of Fogade [Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund] President Norys Aguirre to the list you mentioned, because I said the same thing; that there would be no other interventions. I think, however, that after the program to aid banks was instituted on 25 January, the authorities had the best intention and the firm determination of not ordering other interventions, because of the dramatic and traumatic effects that they have on depositors, especially on the creditors of the institution involved. We tried to rehabilitate these institutions, we tried to cover their losses through the guarantees fund, and we tried to keep them open. We started an analysis of the situation to study alternatives due to the magnitude of the losses [perdidas de balance] that we detected and based on the inspections and subsequent reports filed by the Bank Superintendency, due to the operational losses accumulated by these institutions in the past six months, and due to the deterioration caused by deposit withdrawals--which did not stop despite all our statements and the efforts we made in the past two weeks. We discussed what to do with the institutions to avoid an intervention. An intervention process is not something done gradually. [sentence as heard] It must be evaluated, thought over. We did that for two weeks. Although we said that there would be no more interventions, we had to make this decision along with the commissioner [not further identified]--who was invited to all these working meetings--in which we worked as a team, as Venezuelans who seek to solve this problem. We had to make this decision. [Pena] You have just reminded us that you said this very same thing when you were appointed to Fogade. You repeated those same words a few days ago, and they are recorded in Fogade's minutes. The media also reported on what you said. You said that meetings were held to discuss the recapitalization of the banks and to make changes in the boards of directors. You said that if the former owners do not have the money to recapitalize the banks, that you would recapitalize them but never (?save them). What does this mean? [Aguirre] The meetings were scheduled by the General Bank Superintendency--they began on 2 March--and were suspended when I was appointed. At that time we had a problem; we did not know exactly how much the losses amounted to and the deadline for the meetings were not met. This being the case, those meetings could be contested or be subject to lawsuits. Therefore, it was not necessary to do this. The General Bank Superintendency ordered the meetings. Except for the Maracaibo meeting, which was held on 2 June, the meetings were held between 23 and 25 May. However, by late May, the directorate began to review the reports presented by the appointed boards--and who did an excellent job in only one week--we realized the situation was so bad that we asked the General Bank Superintendency for an urgent working meeting with the superior council to study the assets situation. In addition to the legal problems this could entail, Fogade had decided not to cover the losses in light of the huge amounts this represented. [Pena] You decided not to cover the losses because [words indistinct]? [Aguirre] No. We attended the meetings and made offers without having in-depth knowledge of the situation. [Pena] How could you offer to recapitalize those institutions without having in-depth knowledge of the situation? [Aguirre] Because there was a legal requirement we had to meet in light of some contracts signed in January. [Pena] According to statements made by the president of the Superior Court for the Protection of Public Property, the court is going to investigate public officials who participated in that process. Those officials are: the president of the Central Bank, the president of Fogade, and the superintendent of banks. I believe the Superior Court for the Protection of Public Property is doing the right thing because to allegedly protect the depositors, you have released more than 500 billion bolivares. These 500 billion bolivares belong to those who are working on this program with us and to those who are listening to us. The Comptroller Law is very clear in this regard. All those who handle state money must account for it. This means that the court can investigate you. Someone has to account for that huge amount of money that has caused inflation and hunger among the people. [Aguirre] That is right. All those who handle money must account for it. Not only state money; this also applies to the private sector. We have a comptroller and we have officials that we must account to for all that we do. I agree that an investigation should be conducted. When I was appointed in early May, late April, I asked the Office of the Comptroller to help me. I want the Office of the Comptroller to guide me through this. I do not know all the laws and requirements, therefore I need the help of the special organizations. I do believe that all of us who have had something to do with this process, since 25 January when we began providing financial aid to the Bank of Maracaibo, will have to account for what we have done. You said that 504 billion bolivars were disbursed and that this money belongs to you and all those who are here. I agree with you completely. It belongs to all the Venezuelan people and that is why I have always said that the financial aid program, as implemented, had to end. This is why Fogade, and Norys Aguirre in particular, felt this program had to end as soon as possible. [Pena] On the other hand, it has been said in the Venezuelan legislature and courts that funds have been diverted. We are talking about money that was supposedly meant for depositors but which had a different destination, funds that were transferred to be exchanged for dollars, or funds that were improperly used. If that is the case, who is responsible for the use of funds that belonged to Venezuelans, or for the operations carried out by the quote, bank owners, unquote, or for any other money transfer? Who had control over them, or did they not have to answer to anyone? [Aguirre] As soon as subsidies [auxilios] are distributed, a document must be issued under oath. Each time the required funds [requerimientos] were delivered, a document was issued under oath explaining the origin and use of the funds, the amounts requested, how it would be used, and who received the money. We are currently investigating the cases when this was not done or when someone gave false information. There is a court supported by experts from the Superintendency of Banks, the Central Bank, and the Judicial Technical Police [PTJ]. The Superintendency of Banks is wholly responsible for the supervision process. I believe it is important to understand the role played by each of the parties involved. Fogade was created to protect depositors, to protect and guarantee the stability of the financial system, and to act as a liquidator in cases approved by the Superintendent of Banks. The Superintendency of Banks is in charge of overseeing, controlling, and supervising all activities of the financial system. Fogade delivered and implemented the program of financial assistance. The Superintendency of Banks subsequently evaluated and supervised all activities. That is why there is a judge now, and we must let the judge do his job. The judge has announced certain measures. If another judge is appointed, as I have read in the press, he will also do his job. They are the ones who must determine who is responsible. [Pena] Today's edition of EL UNIVERSAL contained an article by Gustavo Gomez Lopez in which he states that the intervention of his institution was conducted without any type of financial assistance, that they were barely given a chance to breathe, that criminal charges were filed against them, and that 83 arrest warrants were issued against the bank. He said that the same thing will happen with these eight banks. That is what Gomez Lopez said today in EL UNIVERSAL. What are your comments? [Aguirre] It is difficult for me to give my opinion. First, I have not read the article completely, and second, I was not involved in the intervention of Banco Latino. I do not know how the intervention process was conducted. I can say that as a result of the Banco Latino crisis, and to protect and guarantee the stability of the financial system, when depositors began withdrawing their funds from the banks in Maracaibo and in Barinas, which were the first two affected, there could not be interventions or closures at other banks because it would have been harmful and created instability. That is why the financial assistance plan was implemented. The problem with this plan was its duration. The financial assistance plan--as it was created--was supposed to last one or two weeks at the most. Unfortunately, and as we are all aware, due to the many external and internal factors affecting each of the parties involved in this problem, the final solution was postponed. [Pena] The government seems to have lost ground in the most important area: credibility. President Caldera, as you well know, promised to stabilize the bolivar. In the first three months of his administration, however, the bolivar has been devalued 60 percent. He also promised to eliminate the zero coupon. The zero coupon today has reached 60 billion bolivares. If the average interest rate is 60 percent, the Central Bank will have to pay those banks more than 300 billion bolivares in interest. We do not know where it will come from. Although he promised to curb inflation, inflation this year could surpass 100 percent if things remain the way they are. Right? In addition, with these subsidies and with the law that will be implemented now for 400 billion bolivares, we will have a deficit in the GNP of 17 percent. In any country on earth, that is called hyperinflation. A few days ago we were told that interest rates would go down, but interest rates are again at almost 80 percent. How can we believe government representatives who say one thing but do another? [Aguirre] I believe the president is the person who, with his authority and credibility, informed us of the country's situation. On 2 February he announced his government's plan. People understood there was not going to be a change of control because the situation stabilized. I think the way in which conditions evolved made us take other measures. The government has worked hard to stabilize fiscal accounts. The objective of this public credit law is to meet depositors' needs and end financial subsidies once and for all, subsidies that were taking us back to that [word indistinct] path you mentioned. I think the Bank Superintendency Superior Council members made their decision taking into account the country and the fact that we could not continue with the subsidy program. We would have reached rates in excess of the 80 percent you mentioned, even three-digit inflation rates. [Pena] Do you think that what has been happening here is typical of Venezuela and perhaps of the Third World? People hear rumors in the streets, but the government says they are lies. Take the banks as an example. People started withdrawing money and dealt a heavy blow to the more than $3 billion in reserves. The allegedly financially sound banks took the other funds. Since they allegedly did not have a place to deposit those funds, they were resold to the Central Bank of Venezuela at higher prices. That is what the commissioner called the perverse cycle, which is still alive and well. These banks went so far as to attempt to penalize pubic officials who, by taking precautionary measures, wanted to withdraw these funds from the banks to avoid what happened yesterday at the Metropolitan Bank and other banks, where people were about to rob them because their payrolls [nominas] could not be paid. These officials who were withdrawing the funds from the banks wanted to protect their workers. The economic team and the team that supervises the financial market made public statements saying that public officials would not be allowed to withdraw money from these banks. [Aguirre] Fifty percent of the money deposited in these banks belong to 90 percent of the depositors. When those people start being paid next week--and I know this is a big effort--they will get some respite, because we will begin implementing our payment program. That is why the Bank Superintendency, Fogade, and the Finance Ministry are hurriedly working to keep the schedule of payments announced by the Finance Ministry and Fogade. We must pay them because they are not responsible for this crisis. Let me go back to the beginning of your question when you said there is a perverse cycle, as the commissioner mentioned. You are exactly right. That is what we are trying to end, and it ended on 13 June. The cycle no longer exists because it already ended. [Pena] It just ended? [Aguirre] Yes, it just ended. [Pena] In ended after the Venezuelan economy bled for three months due to this perverse cycle. [Aguirre] We want these deposits to remain in the institutions. Deposits must remain there because if there are any problems with the financial system or liquidity, it is one of the state's functions to help the institution, to adopt pertinent measures, to replace administrators, and to impose sanctions. The government must do all this the first day. It should not have to wait five months. I cannot argue this issue with you. I am totally convinced that this situation should have ended within the first week or the first 15 days. [Pena] As for the guarantees, you have insisted that they fail to back loans. It has even been said that in addition to Venezuelans' wearing a tax necklace, we will be lucky if we recover 30 or 40 percent of those 500,000 or 800,000 [not further specified]. We do not know what it will amount to. We do not know if there are inflated assets, and we do not know if we were given bad portfolios. We were paid with securities and portfolios which could be bad. It seems the only thing that could be useful are T-bills and other state securities. The truth, Dr. Aguirre, is that we do not know what the rest of these securities are. [Aguirre] The state has received about 405 billion [currency not specified] worth of physical inventories taken by Fogade. Of that 405 billion, some 8 or 10 billion were received in securities and stock from some companies, stock that was estimated at its par value, I should say. We have yet to determine if these companies are profitable, viable companies. We do not know if within the group of financial institutions involved in the intervention--some 59 companies--there are institutions that can be immediately turned around to ensure continued production. We have received about 800 billion bolivares worth of properties. Someone said the other day in a local newspaper that a property received by Fogade at its book value of 120 million bolivares must be worth much more than that. We all know it is worth much more. [Pena] It is worth less. The thing is, inflation is gobbling us up. [Aguirre] No. It is worth much less. [Pena] You get a building for 30 [number as heard, currency not specified], at real prices. It is not worth 30, but they offer it for 30. It is really worth 10 and they paid the price to hand it over to Fogade. Of course, in six months time, they will want to invoke the same argument they presented before [words indistinct]. That is: Everything I transferred is worth a fortune now. Of course, because the currency has devaluated, and what with the current devaluation rate things are terrible. The main issue, madam, is that you said and affirmed you are going to pay these people their money. [Aguirre] Up to 4 million bolivares. [Pena] Up to 4 million. I understand there was a meeting yesterday between Luis Alfaro Ucero and Treasury Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez. Alfaro Ucero told him: We can help you get the Public Credit Bill approved. We need to know, however, what you are going to do. Are you going to nationalize the banking system or what are you going to do? I ask you that same question. Alfaro Ucero was clear in warning: If you do not tell us what you plan to do, then we cannot support you and the Public Credit Bill will not be approved. Are you planning to nationalize the banks? Are you going to reorganize the system? What are you really going to do? No one really knows. [Aguirre] I think they do. That is the role.... [Pena, interrupting] Are you going to nationalize? [Aguirre] Heavens no. Excuse me, but I think it has already been said. I think there has been effective information. That is the General Bank Superintendency's job. It is not my place to comment on their responsibilities and what the Superintendency is doing. However, as a member of the High Commission and a participant in the discussions and the work sessions we have held, I can say the General Bank Superintendency is working with the rest of the financial system. As you may well know, all of the local banks must file an adjustment plan by 30 June. It is the 15th [date as heard] today, so there are still 15 days for the banks to present their plan. According to the new General Banking Law, these plans must be studied, discussed by the Superintendency and the banks, and put into effect on 1 July. [Pena] Why did you dance around? They closed the Banco Latino for 85 days. There were several suicides, demonstrations, and violence in the streets of Caracas and other cities around the country. Following the 85 days of torture and sadism against the savings accounts holders, you decide to reopen it. You put a 10 million ceiling. You imposed no limitations on the banks being bailed out. You said: We are going to protect the account holders. But anyone could withdraw however much he wanted. I understood that protecting the savings accounts meant up to 10 million. In the United States the ceiling is $100,000, as it is anywhere in the civilized world, except here. Here it was take as much as you can. Up to now we have given out 500 billion bolivares. You let these others pull out however much they wanted for three months. Meanwhile you discriminated against the Banco Latino account holders, who you forced to capitalize and limited to 10 million. Now, you seem to have thought over the matter and limited withdrawals to 4 million. Still, those who did not comply with Fogade's conditions were allowed to take everything they wanted. Is that fair, Ms. Aguirre? [Aguirre] [sighs] That is why, when Fogade holds its general assembly, it will study the possibility of increasing the guarantee limits to 10 million bolivares. There is one specific thing that cannot be hidden. The Banco Latino savings account holders were allowed up to 10 million bolivares, based on a special transitory law or a temporary provision of the emergency banking law. The account holders were paid every penny within five months. Now we have said the limit is 4 million bolivares. [Pena] Was it possible to do that from the beginning? [Aguirre] From the very first days of May, when I.... [Pena, interrupting] Why not limit the others as you did with the Banco Latino? [Aguirre] The limit is in effect. [Pena] Why was the limit not imposed on the other affected banks, as you did with Banco Latino, from the very first day? [Aguirre] That is what we did following our decision on 13 June. I cannot judge what was done as of 25 January. [Pena] Allow me one last question. President Caldera said he would not hesitate to sign currency exchange controls. Judging from the way things look now, I would say we are closer to that decision than when he said he would not hesitate. Inflation is higher and reserves are dwindling. I hope you give a lot of thought to what you plan to do about that. It is a decision the president must make and only he knows what he will decide. He has enough experience at this, and I hope we do not go back to the days of the Differential Exchange System, which was a monster I hope never returns. It was used to extort private enterprise, particularly the media. The politicians, led by President Lusinchi, got rich with it. There was a Chinese individual implicated in this, who was so glorified that they are going to make a movie about him. Everyone else came out smelling like roses, while Venezuela was left impoverished. Along with the banks, you are now the owners of media corporations, investment funds, resorts, hotels, and much more. Now we have a government that preaches that it is going to privatize things, while it is becoming the owner of an enormous piece of the economy. [Aguirre] The state has not become a proprietor of its own choosing. I believe the government's policy and philosophy is to privatize and be able to deal with its own responsibilities and the things the government team is trying to do. We have also established, and we have said this, that independent of who does the privatization--be it the Investment Fund, Fogade, or salvage companies--the important thing is that the state be able to sell all these assets in accordance with established sale plans without further harming the economy. You cannot sell.... [pauses] I cannot put 79 billion bolivares in property on sale today because I would drown the real estate market. This has to be planned. [Pena] But there have to be many international banks interested in purchasing those banks. [Aguirre] There are banks interested. But we also have other assets that were put up to guarantee the financial aid. [Pena] But I am talking about the banks. [Aguirre] There are eight banks and there are banks interested. [Pena] Local banks? [Aguirre] Foreign banks. But the foreign banks must study the banks before they buy. You just do not buy for the sake of buying; you have to know what it is you are buying. Venezuela, through Fogade, will have to issue a letter of intent. This is done in every country of the world. [Pena] When bankers are making a profit they do not remember us, but when they report losses, we are the ones who lose. [Aguirre] That is why the state is trying to establish who is responsible. [Pena] I hope so because I have seen nothing that the state is doing. I have not seen the state filing suits against those people. [Aguirre] Well you will.... [Pena interrupting] Excuse me, Dr. Aguirre. I have heard you say that the courts are responsible for determining the guilty party. However, it is the responsibility of the state to present charges. The state did not consult the Venezuelan people when it used our money. A referendum was not held before using 800 billion bolivares or before raising inflation to almost 100 percent. Since the state handled the matter as it did, then it should accuse the guilty parties in court. They should be in jail. [Aguirre] Fogade appointed its administrators at the meetings, people that we removed from where they were working and who sacrificed much to help the state. As soon as they gave us their report and as soon as we received the report from the General Bank Superintendency, Fogade and the government ordered the intervention. Fogade and the government are willing to determine who was responsible and become the accuser if necessary. If there was poor management and if there was fraud, we will become the accusers of all those administrators. [Pena] Thank you Fogade President Dr. Norys Aguirre.
