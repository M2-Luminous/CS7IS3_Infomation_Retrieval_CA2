This was announced today by the Press Office of the KNSB -- one of the two major trade union amalgamations in this country. The leadership of the KNSB insists that parliament urgently revises the issue of levying VAT on the press and advertisements in it, with the exception of erotic and pornographic publications. "The achievements of democracy in Bulgaria are not so great as to allow for a restriction of the right of the public to be informed by financial mechanisms," the KNSB press release reads. [passage omitted] A number of newspapers today did not cover the work of the Council of Ministers and the National Assembly. Some came out with blanks in protest against VAT on newspapers. The initiators of the protest have also approached the Bulgarian National Television and the Bulgarian National Radio with a appeal to support their demands. Their next step will be the stopping of newspapers and broadcasts on the private radio stations from March 28 through 31 inclusive. If by this date parliament does not exempt Bulgarian books, periodical press and advertisements in it, magazines and the electronic media from VAT, the group of 15 will discuss their next actions. The bill on amending the VAT Act has not been put on the agenda of the National Assembly yet. The Parliamentary Budget and Finance Committee discussed and adopted a stand today on the proposed changes in the VAT Act. Members of the committee have proposed a compromise solution, according to which the newspapers and the mass media will not register for paying VAT till the end of this year. Instead they will pay the old 10 percent turnover tax, including on advertisements. The bill amending the VAT Act is expected to enter the plenary chamber next week. Next Thursday -- March 31, Sofia cinemas will show only erotic films in protest against VAT, the "Sofia Film" Company told BTA. A press conference was held at the Ministry of Finance today on the forthcoming introduction of VAT. This afternoon 16 editors-in-chief of national dailies adopted a declaration demanding the resignation of Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov because of his stand on the VAT Act. "The government should comprise only of people respecting freedom of speech, the democratic institutions and the Constitution", the declaration reads. The editors-in-chief add that it is inadmissible for a person who rejects the most important democratic institution -- the free press, to be a member of this country's government.
