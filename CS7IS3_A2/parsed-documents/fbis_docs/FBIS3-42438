Kazakov] [Text] The general-purpose fortification equipment is design to erect various types of fortifications for protection of personnel at troop positions in short periods of time. The UKFS is used to erect the following: Light overhead trench covers for protection against shell fragments and recesses in emplacements for firing assault rifles, machineguns, grenade launchers, and antitank missile systems; shelters for protection against shell fragments in observation structures for the platoon (company) commander; covered slit trenches and dugout shelters. The set includes six main and five supplemental components. The components can be made from steel or duraluminum pipe 30 mm in diameter with a wall thickness of 3 mm in a regular machine shop without using any complicated production equipment. The grid base covered with sacking, canvas, ground sheet fabric, reinforced polyethylene film, and so forth is used as the cover. Structures from the UKFS are erected by the troops manually and do not require the use of means of mechanization. Compared to structures made of lumber, the labor-intensiveness of erecting them is 2-2.5 times less, and they can be erected on any category of soil.
