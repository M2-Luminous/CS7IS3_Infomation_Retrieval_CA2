FR941031-1-00023 FR941031-1-00004 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 91&hyph;CE&hyph;22&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; de Havilland DHC&hyph;6 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 81&hyph;10&hyph;11, which currently requires repetitively inspecting the elevator root ribs for cracks on de Havilland DHC&hyph;6 series airplanes, and replacing any cracked part. The Federal Aviation Administration's policy on aging commuter-class aircraft is to eliminate or, in certain instances, reduce the number of certain repetitive short-interval inspections when improved parts or modifications are available. The proposed action would require modifying the elevator root rib as terminating action for the repetitive inspections that are currently required by AD 81&hyph;10&hyph;11. The actions specified in the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the elevator root rib, which could result in loss of control of the airplane. DATES: Comments must be received on or before January 4, 1995. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 91&hyph;CE&hyph;22&hyph;AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106. Comments may be inspected at this location between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, holidays excepted. Service information that applies to the proposed AD may be obtained from de Havilland, Inc., 123 Garratt Boulevard, Downsview, Ontario, Canada, M3K 1Y5.
