FR940616-0-00047 FR940616-0-00009 60. We will dismiss any application, group of applications or other filings in the private radio services when a regulatee fails timely to submit any regulatory fee or associated penalty. 47 U.S.C. 159(c)(2). A fee payment will be considered to be late filed if a timely filed instrument of payment is uncollectible and the deficiency is not the result of bank error. 24 Thus, an application required to be submitted with a regulatory fee will be returned without action if the fee is not filed with the application. Moreover, if the returned application is mutually exclusive and must be filed by a date certain (or is required to be filed by a date certain for any other reason), the application will be dismissed as untimely if resubmitted subsequent to the filing deadline. 25 24 As noted in the NNPRM, we will not accept instruments of payment other than cashier's checks for payors who are notified that payment will not be accepted by other payment methods. Of course, while we discourage the use of cash for the payment of fees generally, payment by cash is permissible. See 31 U.S.C. 5193. We will not be responsible for cash lost or stolen in the process of delivery to our lockbox bank. 25 In any case in which a fee payor believes that a monetary or other penalty has been wrongfully imposed, the fee payor may file a petition requesting that the penalty be set aside. 3. Revocation 61. Section 9(c)(3) provides the Commission with authority to revoke an existing license or other authorization for nonpayment of a regulatory fee. 47 U.S.C. 159(c)(3). We proposed to reserve our revocation remedy for egregious cases of nonpayment. Section (9)(c)(3) does not require a finding of ``willful or repeated'' failure to make payment before a license or authorization may be revoked. Further, the section affords the right to a hearing only if a regulatee's response to our notice of revocation presents a ``substantial and material question of fact.'' 62. Consistent with the statutory framework for revocation, any revocation hearing will be resolved by written evidence only and the burden of proceeding and the burden of proof will be on the respondent. As proposed, we will provide a period of 60 days for a regulatee to respond to our notice of revocation in order to assure that the subject regulatee will have a full opportunity to obtain the funds needed to make payment and to prepare its case. Further, we will assess the regulatee for the costs for the conduct of any revocation proceeding unless the regulatee ``substantially'' prevails at the hearing. 47 U.S.C. 159(c)(3). Finally, pursuant to section 9(c)(3), an order of revocation will not become final until the respondent regulatee has had an opportunity to exhaust its rights to judicial review under section 402(b)(5) of the Act. 47 U.S.C. 402(b)(5). 63. MCI recognizes that we should use our authority to revoke licenses and assess penalties as tools to enforce payment of fees. However, MCI urges that we restrict their use to cases where a licensee ``willfully'' has acted in bad faith in not paying the required fee. MCI states that this is particularly important for licensees with large and complex operations in services where licensing information currently is not included in our records since licensees with numerous authorizations may have no other way to confirm existing licenses. In these instances, according to MCI, we should attempt to resolve nonpayment issues informally since most fee payment disputes should be quickly and easily resolved. 64. We agree with MCI that our revocation powers should not be lightly invoked. We stated in the NPRM that we would reserve the right to revoke licenses held by a delinquent regulatee, but that we did not foresee the need for revocation, except in egregious circumstances. We will not consider a failed payment to be egregious as long as the regulatee demonstrates that its deficiency was not due to gross neglect in maintaining its records or in preparing to meet its obligation to make the fee payments. However, we intend to automatically assess delinquent payors a 25 percent penalty for late or missing payments, and such assessments will be strictly enforced. 4. Debt Collection Act Remedies 65. In addition to those specific remedies for nonpayment or untimely payment of regulatory fees provided in section 9, we will invoke our powers under the Debt Collection Act against any regulatee failing to pay a regulatory fee. See 31 U.S.C. 3711 et seq. We will afford a regulatee a 30-day period to respond to our notice of delinquency before invoking the procedures provided in the Debt Collection Act. Moreover, when necessary, we will refer outstanding debts of delinquent regulatees to the Internal Revenue Service for offset. See 31 U.S.C. 3720A. Included in the recovery of any delinquent fee will be an assessment of interest on the debt due, a penalty for nonpayment, and the allowable cost incurred due to the federal government in the collection process. See 31 U.S.C. 3717. IV. Regulatory Fee Categories 66. In our NPRM, we provided an explanation of the regulatory fee categories subject to the payment of a fee under the schedule established by Congress. 47 U.S.C. 159(g). Where a regulatory fee category required additional interpretation or clarification, we relied on the legislative history of section 9 and our experience in establishing and regulating the various services. The categories and amounts set out in the schedule may, by the next fiscal year and in subsequent fiscal years, be amended, adjusted, or modified to reflect changes in our appropriations, costs and changes in the nature of our regulated services. See 447 U.S.C. 159(b) (2), (3).
