FBIS4-31988 "dreeu117__a94009" FBIS-EEU-94-117-A Daily Report 13 Jun 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria Shumeyko, Russian Parliament Delegation Visit Shumeyko, Russian Parliament Delegation Visit AU1306191594 Sofia BTA in English 1709 GMT 13 Jun 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1306191594 Sofia BTA English BFN [Report by Kiril Vulchev] [Text] Sofia, June 13 (of BTA) -- The Russian parliamentary delegation, which arrived late last night led by Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Upper Chamber of the Russian Parliament, met with President Zhelyu Zhelev, National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov, Prime Minister Lyuben Berov, and Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov. The Russian delegation includes the chairman of the Committee of Constitutional Legislation and Judicial and Legal Affairs, Elena Mizulina, and the members of the Upper Chamber's Committee Regulating Budget, Financial, Exchange, Lending, Currency Issue, Taxation and Customs Affairs, Mikhail Baskhmelnitsyn and Vladimir Chub. "This visit to Bulgaria is not only a parliamentary one, it is also a state visit. It is necessary to establish closer political relations between Bulgaria and Russia, which will have an effect on their economic relations as well," Mr. Shumeyko said after his talk with the chairman of the Bulgarian Parliament. According to the chairman of the Russian Upper Chamber, it is impossible to treat all-European problems without the participation of Bulgaria and Russia. At their meeting Mr. Yordanov and Mr. Shumeyko stressed the importance of the exchange of information between the Bulgarian and the Russian Parliament; Mr. Shumeyko proposed to conclude an agreement on interaction in the field of information and exchange of experience in the sphere of legislation. "It is very important that the Bulgarian parliamentary committees have access to everything that is happening in Russia now," Mr. Yordanov told reporters later. He believes that part of the problems between Bulgaria and Russia can be resolved by considering them first at the level of parliamentary committees. The chairman of the Bulgarian Parliament said there were no differences between Bulgaria and Russia about European integration, NATO's defence structures and the Partnership for Peace plan. "However, it should be taken into account that Bulgaria and Russia are approaching the European structures from different positions: Bulgaria is a typically European state, a fact which has predetermined its Eurocentric foreign policy in the last years, while things are much more complicated for Russia because it is a vast state extending to Asia," Mr. Yordanov said. In his view, Russia can itself become an exponent of the integration idea in the contemporary world and this is the path it has embarked on. Asked if he fears that the intense interest Russian politicians have been showing in Bulgaria of late could affect the process of Bulgaria's integration with Europe and NATO, Mr. Yordanov replied in the negative. Mr. Shumeyko said that he and Mr. Yordanov did not discuss the war in ex-Yugoslavia. "We paid little attention to the Balkan crisis, because everything is clear -- what Bulgaria and Russia seek is the earliest possible solution to the conflict in Bosnia- Herzegovina," Mr. Yordanov said in turn. "Bulgaria has been, and still is, suffering the heaviest losses of all as a result of the embargo on ex-Yugoslavia and the crisis there," Mr. Yordanov recalled. After his meeting with Prime Minister Berov, Mr. Shumeyko said he hopes that during the visit by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to Bulgaria, scheduled for this autumn, the two countries would conclude a number of efficient agreements which their parliaments would ratified quickly thanks to the present parliamentary talks. "Bilateral relations are never an obstacle to the promotion of multilateral ones," Mr. Shumeyko stated. "It is Mr. Berov and Mr. Shumeyko's shared opinion that Bulgarian-Russian economic relations have made little progress although a lot of governmental agreements were signed," Government Spokesman Raycho Raykov told the media. He said that Mr. Berov and Mr. Shumeyko had considered the problem of mutual indebtedness and the Bulgarian army's urgent need of spares for nearly 100 percent of its facilities supplied by the ex-Soviet Union. The talks of Russian Upper Chamber Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko and Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov focussed on economic cooperation. Mr. Daskalov told the media that the Russian delegation wanted to know about any developments concerning the consideration of Russia's bid for the Council of Europe (on May 11, 1994 Bulgaria took over the presidency of the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers for a term of six months). "Russia is welcome as a full member of the Council of Europe but will be admitted to it when it meets the criteria for membership in the Council," Mr. Daskalov said. In his opinion, Russia's bid for membership in the Council of Europe will be considered during Bulgaria's presidency, but it will be impossible to finalize the admission procedure within its term. The Bulgarian foreign minister denied the allegations in some Bulgarian papers that Russia had offered Bulgaria to form a Belgrade-Sofia-Moscow axis. "I have met a lot of presidents of late, but there are only few you can talk with about any problem as frankly as with the Bulgarian President," Mr. Shumeyko said after his meeting with President Zhelev, the last on his formal meetings during the visit. According to Mr. Shumeyko, most of the positions he and Mr. Zhelev expressed are similar, but there were moments when they had to explain things to each other -- the difference in Russia's and Bulgaria's approach to the Partnership for Peace initiative, for example. "Mr. Shumeyko conveyed greetings from Russian President Boris Yeltsin to President Zhelev; the Bulgarian President sent his best wishes to Mr. Yeltsin," Kamen Velichkov, foreign policy advisor to the Bulgarian President, told the media after the meeting.
