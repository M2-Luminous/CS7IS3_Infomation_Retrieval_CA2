He admitted that differences of opinion might arise over the nonapplication of the VAT [value-added tax] and the increase in gasoline prices, which, he reiterated, might take place at the beginning of 1995 following a study on subsidies for mass transportation. Sosa Rodriguez said that if the IMF concludes that the international reserves have been handled correctly, it would have a very positive psychological effect on the country's economy. [Begin Sosa recording] Our reserves are at quite a satisfactory level. It is true that operational reserves have dropped this year, but they are at a satisfactory level for any country. Now then, because we have a type of psychosis coupled with a destabilization process involving rumors, telephone calls, and so forth, there is speculation in the market. Obviously, if we had the IMF backing us, those speculators or rumormongers would have a more difficult time. [end recording] [Briceno] The minister also said the slight upsurge in petroleum prices, which will bring approximately 100 billion bolivares in revenue, will have a favorable effect next year and in 1996 to balance the fiscal deficit. The finance minister also said the World Bank has recommended that some of its experts advise FOGADE [Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund] and the Banking Superintendency in resolving the management problems of the banks that are being assisted and that are now owned by the state.
