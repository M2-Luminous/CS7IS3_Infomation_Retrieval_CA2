FBIS4-9717 "drlat063_h_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-063 Daily Report 30 Mar 1994 Honduras Government Announces Increases in Fuel Prices Government Announces Increases in Fuel Prices PA0104044894 Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1712 GMT 30 Mar 94 PA0104044894 Mexico City NOTIMEX Spanish BFN [Text] Tegucigalpa, 30 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- President Carlos Roberto Reina's government, which came to power last January, has announced new gasoline, diesel, and kerosene prices will go into effect beginning today. Super gasoline, which cost 8.66 lempiras per gallon ($1.10), increased to 10.10 lempiras (a $.20 increase), and regular gasoline went from 7.44 lempiras ($.98) per gallon to 9.49 lempiras, a $.35 increase. Diesel prices rose $.70. Kerosene, used by the poor, 70 percent of the Honduran people, increased from 2.97 lempiras ($.40) to 5.28 lempiras ($.75). Prices for cooking gas also increased. According to the Economy Ministry's official communique, the new price structure "does not seek to adversely affect the low-income sector." The communique stated it is "impossible" for the government to continue subsidizing fuel prices because in February it represented losses of 20 million lempiras, some $2.5 million. Adolfo Facusse, president of the Honduran Council for Private Enterprise, said if fuel prices decrease internationally, a fuel price increase in the entire country cannot be justified. "This will lead to an increase in the inflation rate we are experiencing, which is regrettable," Facusse has said. Luis Salgado, vice president of the National Transportation Council, has said the fuel price increase announced today will also lead to an increase in bus fares.
