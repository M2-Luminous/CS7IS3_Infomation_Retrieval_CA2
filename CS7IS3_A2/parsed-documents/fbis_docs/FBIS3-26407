NAFTA countries have a population of 360 million, GNP of $650 million, and an annual export volume of around $600 billion. In terms of economic strength and market scale, NAFTA exceeds the EC and ranks first in the world. Hence, it is bound to affect the economy of other parts of the world, including Asia. The reaction of Asia, particularly East Asian nations and regions, to establishment of NAFTA is relatively complicated. On the one hand, as trade volume between the United States and East Asia accounts for one-third of each side's exports and the United States is one of the main investors in East Asia, the economic benefits brought by the free trade area to North America will also benefit Asia. On the other hand, the establishment of NAFTA will have an adverse influence on Asia's economy in the near future. According to the provisions of the NAFTA agreement, tariffs for most of the commodities of the three North American countries will be abolished within 5 to 10 years while that of a small number of sensitive commodities will be abolished within 15 years. However, countries outside NAFTA have no right to enjoy such preferential treatment. This objectively produces a discriminative effect. The agreement also stipulates that over 65 percent of the component parts of the commodities enjoying preferential treatment must be produced within NAFTA countries. Such a provision concerning place of origin will restrict exports by other countries to the U.S. market. The development stage of Mexico's economy is similar to that of many East Asian countries. As it is adjacent to the United States and also enjoys favored tariffs for place of origin, it will be in a better position in competing with Asian products. Moreover, the United States will inevitably reduce its quotas to Asian countries in order to give more consideration to NAFTA. This will produce a great impact on Asian countries and regions, particularly the four "small Asian dragons" and ASEAN, which depend on the United States for their export trade. Their textiles, garments, toys, electronics, and other labor-intensive products will face a stern challenge in the North American market. As there are bright prospects for profits made in NAFTA, and Mexico has cheap labor and enjoys preferential treatment within the area, it will naturally attract some of the capital from the United States and even Europe and Japan. A number of traditional investors in Asia have transferred their investment from Asia to North America. In the face of the new situation and challenge, Asian countries have also adopted relevant measures. To bypass trade barriers, Japan and the newly rising industrial countries and regions in Asia are making use of preferential NAFTA policies to expand direct investment in the three North American countries, master scientific and technological information, and assimilate advanced U.S. scientific and technological achievements through enterprises there. While the NAFTA agreement was still under deliberation, Japan had already started making investment and running factories in the southern part of the United States. The Republic of Korea and other countries are also considering investment in Mexico so they may also have a foothold in the North American market. Apart from continuing their investment in the United States, East Asian countries will also increase their investment in Canada and Mexico. The establishment of NAFTA will stimulate the readjustment of the industrial structure which is under progress in Asia, and impel Asian nations to offer more cheaper and better quality competitive products to take part in competition in the North American market. Japan will focus more attention on developing high-tech industries and industries that meet domestic needs. The "four small dragons" will mainly develop information and technology-intensive industries, making preparations for a new leap in their economies. Taking the opportunity of the production transfer in Japan and the "four small dragons," ASEAN nations will vigorously import capital and technology from these countries to develop intensive processing of primary products and other manufactures, and further realize industrialization. A number of Asian nations and regions will promote pluralism of their economic ties and open up new channels of foreign capital and trade. With a drastic cut in U.S. investment, the Philippines will try to attract investment from Japan and other countries. East Asian nations will also adopt measures to gradually expand lateral exchanges within the region. The establishment of NAFTA will also stimulate economic cooperation within the Asian region. The six ASEAN nations have decided to complete establishment of a free trade zone within 15 years, the first free trade zone in Asia, which will reduce tariffs among the members to below 5 percent before the end of the century. The ASEAN has also decided to organize an "East Asian Economic Forum" as early as possible, which will exchange and explore a wider range of economic cooperation. Because of the diversity and varying development level of the Asian countries, the conditions for carrying out cooperation in a wide range and at a high level and for attaining economic integration are not yet ripe. Therefore, maintaining an open, flexible, and practical Asian economic consultation mechanism is obviously better than establishing a closed type economic group. The establishment of NAFTA will further promote pluralism of the world economy and bring new opportunities and challenges for Asia's economy. Thanks to the advantages of its domestic market and cheap labor, China's economy will not be affected in the short run. From a long- term point of view, however, the challenges must not be ignored. Meanwhile, East Asia, which includes China, is the region with the most dynamic economy in the world today. Hence, the establishment of NAFTA cannot change the focus of the world on East Asia.
