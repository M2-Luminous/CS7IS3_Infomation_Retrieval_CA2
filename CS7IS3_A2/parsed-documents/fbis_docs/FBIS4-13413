FBIS4-13413 "drnes076_l_94010" FBIS-NES-94-076 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 ISRAEL Opposition Details Alternatives to Peace Process Opposition Details Alternatives to Peace Process TA1604144494 TA1604144494 BFN [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0705 GMT on 16 April carries a 17-minute recorded report compiled by Hayim Hecht on the opposition's alternative to the government's peace process in response to Minister Yosi Sarid's charges in the Knesset earlier this week that the opposition intimidates the people but offers no alternatives. A series of questions was posed to Binyamin Netanyahu, Zvulun Hammer, Refa'el Eytan, Rehav'am Ze'evi, and Gonen Segev -- respectively the leaders of Likud, the NRP (National Religious Party), Tzomet, Moledet, and YI'UD (Independent and Democratic Israel). Asked whether they would pursue the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip if they came to power at this point in time, Netanyahu says: "It is too early to tell. Obviously, agreements cannot be honored by one side only, while the other side violates them. The PLO has actually violated all the commitments it undertook. Therefore, I will only be able to answer this question when I assume the job of prime minister." Hammer's reply: "It is not easy for a government to violate agreements signed by previous governments, but it can halt future moves." Eytan's answer: "I would not pull out of the Gaza Strip and I would not evacuate settlements. What I would do is give municipal autonomy to the Palestinians where they live. I would define the urban jurisdiction of Gaza, Rafah, Khan Yunus, and other large cities and give them absolute autonomy there; namely, to be in charge of internal security in the municipal area." Ze'evi notes that "the withdrawal from Gaza will lead to a return to Gaza. Gaza cannot be sidestepped, because there is no solution for Gaza other than to be annexed to Israel." He goes on to say that "the only solution for Gaza, as well as for all other parts of western Eretz Yisra'el, is to become parts of the State of Israel without annexing its population." In Segev's opinion, "the IDF's withdrawal must be completed at this point, if only for one reason: that the Gaza Strip is one of the few places on which there is enough consensus that it must be evacuated. The settlement of Netzarim, however, is a strategic point because the road leading to it separates Gaza from the southern part of the Gaza Strip and it is very important that we retain this area so as to keep this separation." To the question whether the agreement with the PLO would be null and void, the Likud leader says: "I said a long time ago that this agreement became null and void the moment the PLO started to invalidate it; not because I do not like it -- which I do not -- but because an agreement that is not binding on the PLO is definitely not binding on us." Asked whether he thinks the United States would put up with his reneging on the agreement with the PLO and on the fact that the PLO would no longer be a partner to the dialogue, the Likud leader says: "I would not be withdrawing from any agreement. I am simply not prepared to honor any agreement unilaterally." Eytan replies: "I cannot abolish an international agreement signed by the Israeli Government, but I can definitely reopen it." Asked whether 'Arafat and PLO-Tunis would continue to be their partners in a dialogue, Netanyahu says: "Our partners would be elected in real and democratic elections held under meticulous supervision to make sure that people are elected legally and rivals are not eliminated. Our partners would be people elected from among the local Palestinian population, not people imposed by Tunis." Hammer says: "The dialogue with PLO-Tunis is the root of all evil. The dialogue with the PLO is a mistake and, consequently, the PLO would not be a partner." He goes on to say that "although it would not be simple to renege on an international agreement, Israel must definitely insist on its demands from the other side." Eytan replies: "No, there is nothing to talk about with the PLO because the PLO is not a state." Ze'evi retorts: "No way! They are not partners to peace because they are not headed toward peace." Segev says: "Being coy does not work any more. Those who say that this process can be surgically terminated are either being dishonest or are trying to make cheap marginal profits. In fact, my plan provides for the application of Israeli sovereignty on several areas in Judaea and Samaria. First of all, Israeli sovereignty should have been applied at once on all the Jewish settlements and the sparsely populated Arab areas abutting the Green Line because there is no reason not to." To the question whether IDF (Israel Defense Forces) troops would remain in Jabalyah, Netanyahu says: "I have never objected to changing the IDF's deployment in Gaza, you never heard me say such a thing. I believe we can change our deployment and, in the case of Gaza, we can withdraw our troops to some other place. However, we cannot have a situation whereby our troops are not allowed to enter Gaza, as the government agreed to." Eytan says: "In my opinion, the IDF should keep out of the refugee camps. If the local population wants to riot, let them riot. However, if we get accurate intelligence about a terrorist nest inside Jabalyah, we should stage an operation to strike at this particular nest. The autonomy would run its own affairs in Rafah, for example. It would need us for matters outside the municipal boundary, such as transportation, jobs, and water." Eytan goes on to say that he would discuss the establishment of such a municipal autonomy with "the man or council elected in Rafah," even if it is made up of Hamas (Islamic Resistance Movement) members. "They may run Rafah Hamas-style, but we would not allow terror to get out." Asked how they envision the permanent agreement in Judaea and Samaria, Netanyahu says: "The alternative in this case is simple. We propose Arab autonomy -- of the Palestinian Arabs in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza -- under Israel's sovereignty. What is the difference between the autonomy we propose and the government's so-called autonomy? The IDF, and the IDF only -- not any army of terrorists -- would guard the borders. The IDF would be exclusively responsible for security from the Jordan River westward." Hammer replies: "The Jewish settlements could remain where they are, and the autonomy would be such that the Arabs would rule themselves and we would not rule over another people. I think this idea is feasible. Consequently, I think we should create a layout of noncontiguous Arab autonomy and contiguous blocs of Israeli settlements in whole districts so that they may live safely and defend themselves." Asked whether he would impose Israeli sovereignty over those blocs, the NRP leader says: "I think the arrangement should be such that areas under Israeli sovereignty would really be Israeli areas for all intents and purposes, whereas the autonomy areas would be autonomous areas." Asked how Hebron would fit in such an arrangement, he says: "There must be a special arrangement in places where Jews live so that they may live fully under Israeli sovereignty." Eytan notes that he would "definitely" consider applying Israeli sovereignty over Hebron and other areas in Judaea and Samaria "because such vagueness calls for international intervention." Ze'evi states: "In my opinion, the 1.5 million Palestinians living in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza should go to the 21 Arab countries whose general territory is 500 times that of Greater Israel." Asked how he would go about establishing the strong police force stipulated in the Camp David accords, the Likud leader says: "According to the Camp David accords, the strong police force would not be equipped with machine guns, armored cars, and helicopters -- incidentally, most police forces in the world do not own such equipment, certainly not in such numbers -- and would deal with civilian crimes and infractions. The accords say nothing about making such a police force subordinate to some kind of Palestinian government or creating what is for all intents and purposes a terrorist army." Netanyahu goes on to say that the police force he envisions, "would carry guns -- the weapons ordinarily carried by policemen -- and would be subordinate to Israel. What we are talking about is sovereign Israeli rule up to the Jordan River, the IDF being exclusively responsible for the area west of the Jordan River, and autonomy for the inhabitants of Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza; namely, a framework in which they run most areas of their lives through their elected representatives, but not areas over which the sovereign ruler would be in charge." Asked at which point Israeli sovereignty would be enforced on Judaea and Samaria, Netanyahu replies: "That is open to negotiation in the permanent arrangement period, which we probably would not get around to discussing in this term in office." Who would you negotiate with, Hecht asks him, and Netanyahu answers: "I would negotiate with the aforementioned elected Palestinians, as well as with other elements. I believe my proposal would enjoy much larger support in the Arab world than is apparent. I think that Jordan would favor the solution I am offering -- autonomy rather than a state -- and that Syria would also follow suit." Do you not think such a turnabout would lead to a prolonged standstill, Hecht asks him, and the Likud leader replies: "People say to me: Say the Syrians and the Jordanians accepted your proposal -- I would like to add that the Saudis would also favor autonomy over a Palestinian state, which would be emerging in the heart of the Middle East and would also threaten them -- but would the Palestinians? I say that the Arabs would accept the autonomy arrangement if they realize Israel will not agree to give the Palestinians an independent state." Turning to the negotiations with Syria, Hecht asks whether these would be based on the premise of a possible Israeli withdrawal on the Golan Heights. Netanyahu replies: "I think such a question is not at all on the agenda, because the current promontory line is the line upon which Yitzhaq Rabin insisted in the 1974 disengagement agreements, and for a good reason: it provides us with a defensive wall." Asked what he would discuss with the Syrians, he says: "I would tell Hafiz al-Asad the following: There are issues we can agree and talk about, other than the strategic buffer that keeps the peace for me and prevents you from going to war with me. For example, I can discuss with you Syria's foremost problem, that of water, which is going to become a vital issue. I can talk to him about arms control, stopping the arms race, and the security arrangements we could make. I can talk to Syria about what it wants most: to be struck off the list of terror-supporting countries." Hammer says: "The situation calls for a courageous decision. The question that everybody must put on the table is: Are you prepared to step down from the Golan Heights in exchange for an arrangement with the Syrians? I am not." Eytan says he "would ask the Syrians: What would you give us in exchange for peace? What price would you pay for the peace we would be giving you?" He goes on to note that he would "under no circumstances whatsoever discuss a withdrawal on the Golan. If the Syrians want peace, let them give us another bit of the Golan Heights or of the area under their control." Asked whether he is aware of the fact that his positions actually mean he would have nothing to discuss with the Syrians, Eytan says: "Is our purpose to talk or is it to achieve something? Talking is a means to achieve a purpose. The national purpose, as I perceive it, is a Greater Israel with the Golan as an inseparable part of it in order to safeguard our security." Ze'evi sarcastically replies: "I do not want to demand from the Syrians that they withdraw even more." Segev's position: "As far as I am concerned, the Golan Heights are taboo. However, seeing that the right wing agreed to go to a referendum or to elections over this subject, it will be up to the people to decide." Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1000 GMT on 16 April adds that "opposition leaders have been discussing the establishment of a shadow government. Hammer and Eytan say that it is imperative that Rabin and his government be confronted by a shadow government, whose ministers would comment on current affairs and present an alternative policy to the public to illustrate the option offered by the right-wing camp. Netanyahu noted that the problem with establishing such a shadow government is the surplus of good candidates for the job of ministers, but he believes the proper formula will be found."
