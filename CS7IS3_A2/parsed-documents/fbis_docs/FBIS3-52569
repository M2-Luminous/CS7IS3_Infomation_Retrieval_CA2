The Council examined the economic situation in the country, including price hikes, the sharp deterioration in the exchange rate of the Yemeni currency, as well as the difficulties and increased suffering this has caused to citizens in terms of overburdening their living conditions. The Presidential Council regretted the negative and far-reaching repercussions of the continuing political crisis on the overall situation in our country, particularly on the economic and development levels, not to mention the climate of psychological and social instability it has created. The Presidential Council affirmed the need for the government to shoulder its responsibilities by taking necessary and rapid measures to remedy the economic situation and bring the cost of living as well as the monetary and financial situation under control. It also affirmed the need for the public, private, and mixed sector organizations to play their roles and shoulder their responsibilities by ensuring the availability of basic commodities, achieving price stability, and easing the citizens' burdens. The Presidential Council instructed the government to take firm measures against those who tamper with prices, hoard commodities, and speculate on the national currency, and to rapidly refer them to the Public Prosecution so it may take the proper legal measures against them.
