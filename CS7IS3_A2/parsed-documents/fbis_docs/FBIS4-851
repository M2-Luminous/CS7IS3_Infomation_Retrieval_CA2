The talks were held at the Union Buildings between President F. W. de Klerk, Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Cyril Ramaphosa, secretary general of the ANC. Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer said after the meeting the talks would be continued later on Monday or on Tuesday. Mr Meyer, who refused to be drawn on whether he was optimistic, said the discussions concerned the country's future. All parties had expressed their concern about the situation in South Africa and all were looking for solutions, Mr Meyer added. He said the talks were at a sensitive stage. Emerging from the Union Buildings, Mr Ramaphosa said: "We are dealing with a very sensitive matter as you all know and we're trying to see...What is possible." Mr Ramaphosa was accompanied by SA [South African] Communist Party National Chairman Joe Solo. It is believed the talks were broken off in the afternoon to allow Mr de Klerk to attend a pre- arranged meeting with Pan-Africanist Congress President Clarence Makwetu.
