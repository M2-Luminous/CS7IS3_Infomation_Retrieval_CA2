Good evening. [Silajdzic] Good evening. [Studio announcer] Mr. Silajdzic, at the beginning of the newscast we announced that we had received news that the NATO (?ambassadors) had reached a decision on a new ultimatum to the Serbian aggressor. We also said that we could not confirm this information. Can you confirm it? [Silajdzic] Yes. The ultimatum to the Serbian forces calls for their withdrawal by midnight tomorrow [23 April] to a distance of three kilometers from the center of Gorazde. If they fail to comply, every target within a 20 km radius will be bombed. That is the ultimatum. [Studio announcer] Could you comment on what will happen? Will the aggressor comply with the ultimatum? [Silajdzic] That remains to be seen. If they do not comply, (?punishment) will follow. [Studio announcer] Has this decision come too late? [Silajdzic] Whether it is too late or not -- these are academic questions. It is too late for the dead, but it is not too late for the living. It is not too late for those who are defending themselves. Therefore, we hail this decision, and we hope it will be implemented. Thank you. [Studio announcer] Thank you.
