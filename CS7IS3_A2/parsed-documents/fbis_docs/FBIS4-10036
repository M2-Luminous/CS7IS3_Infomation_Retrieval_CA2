The request will be submitted to the U.S. President during the summit of the Americas' heads of state, which has been called by Clinton himself in Miami at the end of this year. This resolution by Latin American governments was adopted during the meeting of Rio Group foreign ministers, which ended here in Brasilia on 22 March. The agreements reached at this meeting were publicized on 22 March by the three foreign ministers who make up the troika of the Rio Group, namely, Brazil, Chile, and Ecuador. Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, in his capacity as pro tempore secretary, highlighted that the Rio Group resolved to start a process of consultations and coordination in order to present a united front at the Miami summit. Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa stated that one of the agreements included the aforementioned need for closer political relations between the United States and Latin America, which will be raised for Clinton's consideration. He said that within this framework, subjects of common interest like the strengthening of democracy, governability, hemispheric security, drug trafficking, and terrorism could be tackled in a more appropriate way. The foreign ministers also agreed to call Clinton's attention to the social development issue, Latin American countries' efforts to combat poverty, the need to introduce changes in Latin American countries' education systems, and to have greater access to technology. The Brazilian foreign minister noted that some of these questions were briefly touched upon during U.S. Vice President Al Gore's visit to Brazil on 22 March, which only lasted for a couple of hours. With regard to Latin American governments' expectations of the Americas' summit, Figueroa said the meeting's objectives are not very clear since the letter Clinton sent to his Latin American counterparts does not state what the United States expects from this summit meeting and only mentions his interest in drafting a common agenda.
