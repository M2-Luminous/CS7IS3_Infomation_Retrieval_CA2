FBIS ANALYSIS-04Apr94-Ukraine Media Developments: Special Issue on Ukrainian News Agencies Media Developments: Special Issue on Ukrainian News Agencies INTRODUCTION While two government news agencies--Moscow-base- TASS and APN- -had an official monopoly on news under the communist regime, new independent news agencies have arisen in Ukraine since the end of communist rule and may overshadow the government's present news agency. By mid-1993 the Ukrainian Government's Ukrinform, successor to the Ukrainian TASS, came up against stiff competition from three independent agencies--UNIAN, UNIAR, and Post-Postup--and from an agency affiliated with the nationalist political movement Rukh, Rukh-Pres. The latter three had their roots in dissident organizations begun under the communist regime. Of the new agencies, UNIAN seems the most important, distributing numerous news items and important analytical pieces. Rukh-Pres is both a news agency and a propaganda organ for Rukh and sometimes stirs controversy by publishing reports and articles with partisan overtones. Some papers have become very dependent on the new agencies for news reporting. For example, the Kiev paper Khreshchatyk carries whole pages of UNIAN and UNIAR items. FBIS subscribes directly to Ukrinform, UNIAN, UNIAR, and Post- Postup. END INTRODUCTION Ukrinform (Ukrainske Natsionalne Informatsiyne Ahentstvo) Ukrinform is the government information agency, successor to the Ukrainian TASS affiliate, RATAU (Radio-Telegraph Agency of Ukraine), which was the main supplier of news to the Ukrainian press until mid-1990. Benefiting from being the heir to RATAU, Ukrinform appears to have the biggest staff and best facilities of all Ukrainian news agencies. It has, for example, an analytical-information center, which gathers material from Ukrinform's local correspondents and also from the local press (Molod Ukrainy, 31 August 1993). RATAU was renamed Ukrinform in May 1990, because, as its director explained in a 22 May 1990 Radyanska Ukraina article, it no longer sent its items to local papers by telegraph or by dictation over the radio and therefore its name needed to be changed. It was further reorganized after Ukrainian independence, when a 27 November 1991 Cabinet of Ministers decree, "proceeding from the Act of Proclamation of Ukrainian Independence," changed the "Ukrainian Information Agency Ukrinform" into the "Ukrainian National Information Agency Ukrinform" (Uryadovyy Kuryer, No. 38-39, December 1991). It is now independent of Moscow's TASS, which was renamed ITAR-TASS and became a Russian news agency after the dissolution of the USSR. ITAR-TASS still disseminates items from Ukrinform, some of which are labeled "TASS-Ukrinform" in Moscow papers. UNIAN (Ukrainske Nezalezhne Informatsiyne Ahentstvo Novyn) UNIAN, which appears to be the strongest of the new agencies, is the successor in Ukraine to APN (Novosti Press Agency), the second main Soviet-era news agency. Although its name (Ukrainian Independent Information News Agency) labels it independent, it was formed by the government and works in APN's former government-owned facilities. At the end of August 1991 the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet Presidium created UNIAN "on the basis of the disbanded APN" and later gave it APN's building (Holos Ukrainy, 9 February 1993). The founders of UNIAN do not include any government agency, however: they are listed as the Journalists Union of Ukraine, the Prosvita (Enlightenment) Society, the Ukraina Society, the National Press Club, and the Union of Lawyers (Holos Ukrainy, 9 February 1993; Khreshchatyk, 16 February 1993). The former correspondent of the independent Moscow paper Moskovskiye Novosti, Volodymyr Ruban, is chief editor of the agency, and Supreme Soviet deputy Mykhaylo Batih is the general director of UNIAN (Holos Ukrainy, 9 February 1993). Batih was editor of the Lviv Oblast paper Leninska Molod and a communist party member (Radyanska Ukraina, 24 March 1990), but later became a member of Rukh (Narodna Hazeta, No. 38, October 1992). Despite inheriting APN's facilities, it took some time for UNIAN to start operating after its formation. According to the 16 February 1993 Khreshchatyk, "for a year and a half the former 'APN-ers' were not able to organize the work of the agency" and it started work only early in 1993. It had 10 journalists by early 1993 (Holos Ukrainy, 9 February 1993) drawn from the government papers Holos Ukrainy and Uryadovyy Kuryer, Ukrinform, UT-1 (Ukrainian TV channel one), and the weekly paper for foreigners Visti z Ukrainy (Khreshchatyk, 16 February 1993). In an August 1993 advertisement, UNIAN offered three services: -- An "Express-News" service on political, economic, social, and cultural developments, issued twice daily (1500-1600 and 2100- 2200 Kiev time) except Saturday and Sunday, in 8-10 pages in Ukrainian. -- A weekly "Visnyk UNIAN: (UNIAN Herald) Observations, Commentaries, Forecasts" including analytical pieces on political, economic, social and cultural subjects, in 25-30 pages, available in Ukrainian or Russian. -- A weekly Ukrainian-language "advertising-information bulletin" "Tyzhden" (Week) on the most important recent events. UNIAN's advertisement also announced plans to start a weekly " analytical-forecasting" bulletin of economic information "UNIAN- Biznes" in September 1993. UNIAN's television service has also been producing and distributing programs, films, and commercials, according to the 16 February 1993 Khreshchatyk. Examples of the analytical items UNIAN provides include the following: -- Staffers Aleksandr Kharchenko and Anatoliy Drobyazko wrote an article blaming massive credits for agriculture for the fall in the value of the karbovanets in mid-1993 ("Waterloo of the Ukrainian Karbovanets"). The article was carried in the 28 July Holos Ukrainy, 29 July Pravda Ukrainy, and 29 July Rada. -- Mykhaylo Pashkov and Leonid Tupchiyenko wrote an analysis of potential party coalitions that was carried in the 23 July 1993 Khreshchatyk and Nezavisimost. -- Vasiliy Zorya analyzed the August currency exchange crisis for Izvestiya (21 August 1993). The agency also commissions public opinion polls, which its staffers write up. Aleksandr Vishnyak wrote about a poll of Kievites that showed negative attitudes toward the soviets and political parties (Pravda Ukrainy, 30 July 1993). Vishnyak reported on a poll on attitudes toward an economic union with CIS (Nezavisimost, 22 September 1993). Volodymyr Hubenko reported on a poll on selling the Black Sea Fleet (Vecherniy Kiev, 15 September 1993). A wide range of papers have subscribed to UNIAN's services and are using its material. Both the main government paper Holos Ukrainy and the main anti-government paper Nezavisimost sometimes carry UNIAN items, as do Molod Ukrainy, Pravda Ukrainy, Ukraina Moloda, Kievskiye Novosti, Rada, and Kiev city papers Khreshchatyk, Kyivska Pravda, and Vecherniy Kiev--suggesting that UNIAN's material is objective enough to be used by all sides. Moscow's Izvestiya has also used UNIAN, for example, on 21 August carrying an article on the fall of the karbovanets on the Ukrainian currency exchange written "specially for Izvestiya" by UNIAN correspondent Vasiliy Zorya. UNIAR (Ukrainska Nezalezhna Informahentsiya "Respublika") UNIAR, a completely non-government agency, originated in the dissident movement under the communist regime. It was set up in 1988 in Kiev as an underground news operation linked to the dissident Ukrainian Helsinki Union led by present Rukh Chairman Vyacheslav Chornovil, and it initially focused on sending information on internal events to Radio Liberty in Munich, according to an interview by its chief editor Serhiy Naboka in the 3 October 1993 emigre newspaper Ukrainian Weekly. When the Ukrainian Helsinki Union became the Ukrainian Republican Party in early 1990, the news agency remained linked to the party, becoming the URP press service, according to Naboka. Later it became independent and changed its name to the "Respublika Information Agency." Respublika's items appeared in the Ukrainian Weekly and were used by Radio Liberty, and later, after the communist regime fell, its items began appearing in the Ukrainian press. Items labeled "Respublika" appeared in Molod Ukrainy in July 1992, and starting 31 July 1992 Molod Ukrainy began carrying items from UNIAR--the new name for Respublika. A newspaper named Respublika was set up in early 1992, but, according to information UNIAR provided to subscribers in October 1993, the "Respublika Information Agency" was not associated with the newspaper Respublika. According to Naboka, UNIAR now has 60 employees in Kiev and about 40 elsewhere and is organized into four branches: the press agency, video-TV productions, an analytical research department, and a press monitoring section. In describing its services to potential subscribers, UNIAR in October 1993 said it had 58 correspondents, publishes analyses, commentaries, and reviews by independent experts, as well as news, and also produces a daily television program "UNIAR News" on channel 37 (UTaR Television Company) and a weekly half-hour analytical program "Desyatka." UNIAR items are not carried by as many newspapers as UNIAN's but have appeared in the Kiev city paper Khreshchatyk (which carries whole pages of UNIAR material), the Ukrainian Republican Party's paper Samostiyna Ukraina, and the youth papers Molod Ukrainy and Ukraina Moloda. In addition to news reports, a few UNIAR analytical pieces have appeared in the press, such as an article on Ukraine's political situation published in the 19 May Samostiyna Ukraina. UNIAR lists among its subscribers Radio Liberty, Voice of America, Radio Australia, Polish Television, Moscow's Ekho Moskvy radio, the Moscow papers Segodnya, Izvestiya, and Argumenty i Fakty, the St. Petersburg paper Sankt- Peterburgskiye Vedomosti, and Ukrainian papers Respublika, Khreshchatyk, Molod Ukrainy, Narodna Armiya, Samostiyna Ukraina, and Post-Postup. Naboka said in his 3 October interview that UNIAR is the only Ukrainian news agency that is not financially supported by any governmental, party, business, or other organization. In another sign of UNIAR's independence of the government, Naboka was elected chief editor of the "Elections 94" press center set up for the March 1994 parliamentary election to collect and provide information independent of the government (Ukrainian Weekly, 20 February). Post-Postup The newest of the news agencies, Post-Postup was set up in September 1991, at the time the Lviv paper of the same name, Post-Postup, was officially registered, according to information provided by the Post-Postup news agency in October 1993. The statement explained that the paper Post-Postup is the successor to an earlier underground Lviv paper called Postup (Progress), which started publication in early 1989. After the August 1991 attempted coup and end of the communist regime, the paper was registered officially and renamed Post-Postup (i.e., "after Postup") and the news agency, which appears to use the same correspondents, was also established. The news agency sometimes refers to itself as "Post-Inform." Post-Postup is smaller than the other main news agencies and, unlike the others, is based in Lviv rather than Kiev. Post- Postup is still issuing items only twice a week instead of daily as other agencies do, and relatively few Post-Postup items have been showing up in the press. Vecherniy Kiev on 11 August carried an article from the paper Post-Postup describing a struggle for control of the mass-circulation Kiev weekly Kievskiye Vedomosti, and Kievskiye Novosti on 7 May 1993 carried a Post-Postup newspaper interview with reform economist Volodymyr Lanovyy. The agency also disseminates items over Ukrainian government radio, according to the 12 February 1993 Kyivska Pravda. It has 40 correspondents covering oblasts around the republic, according to Post-Postup's October 1993 statement, and the agency-paper is apparently growing. The paper Post-Postup announced on 15-21 June 1993 that "Post-Postup is expanding" and recruiting journalists and listed rates it will pay journalists for written material and photographs. Rukh-Pres The nationalist organization Rukh created its own organization that serves both as a press office to disseminate information from Rukh and as a news agency that gathers information. Chairman of Rukh's Secretariat Viktor Burlakov, in a report to the 1992 Rukh congress on the work of Rukh's Information Department which he supervises, mentioned that Rukh-Pres, which comes under his department, prepares daily "press-releases" about events in Rukh and in the republic in general, including comments by Rukh leaders and other leaders of the democratic bloc. Rukh- Pres, he said, sends its material by fax to radio, television, Radio Liberty, VOA, the papers Holos Ukrainy, Vechirniy Kyiv, and Za Vilnu Ukrainu, and also has published items in the paper Narodna Hazeta (at that time Rukh's paper) and the Kiev paper Rada. It also issues an English-language bulletin on Ukrainian events, Rukh-Faks, which it sends to the Toronto Star, Japan's Yomiuri Simbun, London's Daily Telegraph, France Press, and the American, German, Canadian, and Swedish embassies, he said (Narodna Hazeta, No. 9, March 1992). Other parties--the Ukrainian Republican Party, the Liberal Party, the Party of Greens, and the Congress of National Democratic Forces--have press services also, but these sources are not as active as Rukh- Pres and appear to publicize only information on their own parties. In contrast, Rukh-Pres also acts as a news agency and many Rukh- Pres items have appeared in the press--in the government papers Holos Ukrainy and Uryadovyy Kuryer, the anti-government paper Nezavisimost, the former Rukh paper Narodna Hazeta, the URP's paper Samostiyna Ukraina, Lviv's Vysokyy Zamok, Demokratychna Ukraina, Khreshchatyk, and Ukraina Moloda--and have been picked up on the radio and in the rival news agency UNIAR. Rukh-Pres also turns out analyses and even openly polemical stories aimed at foes of Rukh or of Rukh Chairman Chornovil. Opponents have accused it of spreading false information about Chornovil's political rivals and foes: -- From local sources Rukh-Pres picked up controversial remarks by Kravchuk adviser and former First Deputy Premier Valentyn Symonenko attacking Premier Leonid Kuchma at a 20 March 1993 Odessa conference and sent this material to various papers. Carried by Kiev city papers Khreshchatyk, Vecherniy Kiev, and Kyivskyy Visnyk, Lviv's Vysokyy Zamok, and the URP paper Samostiyna Ukraina, the reports embarrassed Symonenko. Later Rukh-Pres reported from circles close to Kravchuk that the president had rebuked Symonenko for making these remarks and ordered him to retract them or resign as his adviser. Symonenko attacked Rukh-Pres's reports (Vecherniy Kiev, 1 April 1993), threatened a law suit, and claimed that Rukh-Pres was spreading these reports because of Chornovil's hostility to him (Demokratychna Ukraina, 30 March 1993). Symonenko had been bypassed for premier in favor of Kuchma in late 1992 partly because of the opposition of Rukh and other reformers. -- Rukh-Pres spread reports that Levko Lukyanenko (a bitter personal rival of Chornovil) was misusing his post as ambassador to Canada. Narodna Hazeta (No. 17, May 1993), however, disputed the Rukh-Pres report and carried a Congress of National Democratic Forces item attributing Rukh-Pres's action to Chornovil's longtime dislike for Lukyanenko (who like Chornovil was a candidate in Ukraine's December 1991 presidential election and whom Chornovil has often accused of undermining his chances by splitting Rukh's vote). -- A Rukh-Pres item carried in the 8 May 1993 Nezavisimost (the most anti-establishment national paper) accused former Rukh leader Dmytro Pavlychko (a bitter rival of Chornovil) of misusing his power as chairman of the Supreme Soviet's International Affairs Commission during a visit to South Africa. Perhaps because of its polemical slant, Rukh-Pres is apparently viewed with hostility by the Kravchuk administration. Rukh-Pres on 29 September assailed President Kravchuk's press service for consistently refusing contacts with Rukh-Pres, treating it as non-existent, and insisting it "register as an information agency." Rukh-Pres insisted that as the "information department of Rukh's Secretariat" it is a press service, not an information agency (Rada, 30 September 1993). Joint Agencies/Newspapers Some newspapers--in addition to Post-Postup--also act as news agencies, disseminating to other media information gathered by their own correspondents, which may be more than the paper can publish. The shortage of newsprint and the high cost of newsprint and mail delivery have forced many papers to change from dailies to publishing two-three times a week or weekly, so they have less space to publish material. Selling material to other papers and organizations can also help financially. For example, the newspaper Nezavisimost created its own information agency "Nezavisimost" in January 1992 (Nezavisimost, 17 January 1992). The head of the new agency, Boris Zaporozhets, told an interviewer that the agency planned to sell items to all republic papers and to city, oblast, and rayon papers, to Moscow and St. Petersburg publications, foreign information agencies, and agencies of other CIS states (Nezavisimost, 17 January 1992). Other News Agencies Moscow's ITAR-TASS also has its own correspondents in Ukraine who file items to Moscow on Ukrainian events, and Russia's Interfax News Agency also operates in Ukraine and turns out many news items on Ukraine. A 27 September 1993 Interfax item even referred to "Interfax-Ukraine" as an entity. Other news agencies are occasionally mentioned in the press, but there is little information on them and they appear unimportant. A "UPresA" interview of economist Volodymyr Lanovyy was published in the 6 August 1993 Nezavisimost. Nezavisimost on 3 November 1993 carried an article on coming elections by a "Ukrainian Independent Center for Political Research" of UPresA. Items from Informahentsiya "Visnyk" appeared in Molod Ukrainy on 2 April, 1 May, and 30 June 1992, and items from the Informatsiyne Ahentstvo Yevro appeared in Molod Ukrainy on 21 May and 19 June 1992. Some may be more or less one-man operations. For example, Sergey Zarya, identifying himself as a representative from the "Zarya Information Agency," asked a question at a 6 September Kravchuk news conference (Kiev radio, 6 September 1993).
