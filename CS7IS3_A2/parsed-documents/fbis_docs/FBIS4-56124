The decision was made this morning at a regular cabinet meeting, said Government Spokesman Raycho Raykov. Unlike yesterday's decision to make the confidence motion contingent on a possible framework agreement between the government and the political forces, today's decision is only related to the government's programme for the highlights of its performance until early September. "There are contradictions between the positions of the different political forces, the trade unions and the workforces, opposing views clash on crucial matters: privatization, the possible closure of separate money-losing branches or state-owned enterprises, the reform of health care and agriculture, demands for compensations for the shock price rises in April, and the level of pay in the public sector," the government says in its reasoning which was read to reporters by Mr. Raykov. According to the cabinet, "these contradictions escalate social tensions and hold back progress, eliminating the possibility of achieving durable public concord on most disputes. The prevailing view in society is that these contradictions virtually block socio-political life and they can only be reconciled on the basis of early parliamentary elections as soon as possible," the reasoning reads. "A change of government at this point (...) may push the country into one degree or another of social and economic chaos," the cabinet believes. According to the government, one reasonable way out of the situation is transition to a targeted government, limited in its life and assignments, which should ensure social peace as a prerequisite for normal elections. This government, while preserving its non-partisan and expert character, undertakes to tackle, along with its current business, the country's urgent tasks, to provide reasonable compensation to the socially disadvantaged strata who have been affected by the price shock, to carry on the land reform and privatization, to counter further speculative price rises, and to complete the settlement of the country's foreign debt problem. The government guarantees that in the months remaining until the elections it will not give campaign advantages to any party or movement. The leadership of the parliamentary group of the Bulgarian Socialist Party alone came to a meeting to which Prime Minister Lyuben Berov invited the parliamentary forces supporting his government. The idea of the meeting was to consider the framework political agreement and the programme for the cabinet's performance highlights until the beginning of September. The meeting was attended, in an observer capacity, by Mr. Vedat Sakalu MP of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS), on whose mandate the incumbent cabinet was formed. Mr. Sakalu confirmed the position which the movement announced yesterday that it will join the agreement only if it is supported by at least four parliamentary groups, it emerged after the meeting. DPS leader Ahmed Dogan said on national radio today that there is no framework agreement. For the time being, the BSP alone remains firmly committed to its support for the cabinet. The Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) will vote against when the confidence motion is put to the vote. SDS leader Filip Dimitrov today said that for six days now the government has "usurped" power, after last week parliament voted down a set of structural and personnel cabinet changes proposed by the prime minister. It is not clear how the New Union for Democracy and the independents will vote, as their MP's are divided over the issue.
