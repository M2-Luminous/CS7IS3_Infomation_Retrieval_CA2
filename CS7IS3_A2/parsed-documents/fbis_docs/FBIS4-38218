UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Shaykh Hamdan [Bin-Zayid Al Nuhayyan] in a recent interview repeated the baseless claims over the three Iranian islands of Abu Musa, Greater and Lesser Tonbs. `JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI' in an article said that the statements had no reasonable basis otherwise the UAE officials would not have refrained from holding direct talks with Iran. The paper said that Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati visited the UAE at the invitation of his counterpart last year to know about the UAE stance. But the UAE officials did not utter a word about the islands during Velayati's lengthy talks there. After Velayati's return to Tehran and contrary to the articles of the joint communique, the UAE officials resumed their claims over the islands. Referring to the invitation extended to the UAE ruler Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan to visit Tehran, the article said that his refusal to pay a visit to Tehran was an indication to the fact that the UAE is not following a documented claim but rather a propaganda ballyhoo which not only is not in the interest of the region but makes it apt for the Zionist influence. Turning to Shaykh Hamdan's statement that the issue will be referred to international tribunals, the paper criticized that the UAE officials first called for direct talks but now have changed their view and stressed that they do not follow a steady policy. "If we review history and the time when colonialism had not found its way to the region, we will find out that at that time not only the islands belonged to Iran but also no country under the name of the UAE existed in the region," JOMHURI said. It is generous of Tehran that it is not following the policy of changing the present borders among regional countries in an attempt to preserve the security and stability of the region, it concluded. Another Persian daily, `ABRAR' said on the same topic that Shaykh Hamdan talked about the international court of arbitration where the very existence of the UAE could be questioned -- a sheikhdom a little older than two decades which is now raising territorial claims. The United Arab Emirates, comprising several sheikhdoms, was a British protectorate until 1971. Since then Britain brought to power one of the nomadic tribes and turned it to a sheikhdom. it covers not more than 830,000 sq. kms and its population including native Arabs and immigrants from Pakistan, India and other countries does not exceed 1,800,000. The interview of Shaykh Hamdan, son of Shaykh Zayid, was published by all the media financed by Saudi Arabia and extensive propaganda was made on this claim.
