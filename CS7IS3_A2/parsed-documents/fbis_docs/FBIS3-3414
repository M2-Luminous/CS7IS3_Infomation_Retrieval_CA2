The conferees of the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] and the Second Session of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] believe today it is more imperative for the government to change its functions during the accelerated shift from the old to the new economic structure. Government departments at all levels should do a good job in making the change with a greater sense of urgency. In fact, changing the government functions means readjusting the government's functional powers so the administrative authority plays a more effective role. Presently some localities are not putting their efforts on changing government functions. Instead, they are making superficial organizational changes. An NPC deputy from Hebei said: Over the last two years, some county-level organizations have become even more overstaffed after so-called streamlining. Instead of reducing the number of departments, they have set up additional ones, which means an increase of personnel. So all the additional financial burdens created by the additional departments are put on the shoulder of the people. Some deputies cited the procedures for examining and approving new projects submitted by enterprises as an example. It is a matter of course that an enterprise should assume full responsibility for its own projects, respective of whether they are feasible or profitable. However, our government departments are minding the business of enterprises, holding many meetings, and affixing many seals. Hainan deputy Ruan Chongwu likened the examining and approving procedures to theater entrance and ticket collectors. He said: Enterprises do not need to go repeatedly through many theater doors and one ticket collector after another. What they actually need is a better environment. The government's business is to improve its social management function and investment environment. Last year Hainan began the system of enterprise registration which has greatly simplified the formalities for establishing a new enterprise. Similar reforms have been successfully carried out in Liaoning's Anshan and Fujian's Shishi. In the words of deputy Zeng Haorong, a common characteristic of these reforms is that the government has become very small and no longer minds other people's business, while the non-governmental sector has become very large and whatever problem should be solved by the market is being solved by the market. Premier Li Peng has explained very clearly in his government work report: The government's main function is to do a good job in macroeconomic regulation and control, overall coordination, and social management. For instance, planning and industrial policies which embody the macroeconomic regulation and control function must be formulated by the government. The government's responsibilities also include key construction projects which have a bearing on the national economy and the people's livelihood; protection and exploitation of natural resources; cultivation of the market system; maintenance of market order; improvement of social security; development of education, national defense, and public security; and combating corruption and promoting ethical integrity. Deputy Huang Baozhang has worked in the Planning Department for many years. When asked whether he felt he had lost something after the change of government functions, he replied: I feel my job has become even more substantial because the Planning Department is taking on an even more important task--macroeconomic regulation and control. Now I can put more efforts on using industrial policies to readjust the economic structure and plan key construction projects; in the past, my job included examination and approval of trivial matters, such as the construction of a toilet. Deputy Chen Shiwei said: In exercising macroeconomic regulation and control, the government must follow the law of the market economy; it must not interfere with economic development according to its subjective wish as it did in the past under the system of a planned economy. Many NPC deputies and CPPCC members suggested the government should ensure social stability and development by means of administrative regulations, policies, planning, coordination, balancing, and sanctions. At the same time, the government's powers should be standardized. They earnestly hope government departments at all levels will make greater efforts to change their functions and improve their work efficiency, and will achieve greater success in this regard this year.
