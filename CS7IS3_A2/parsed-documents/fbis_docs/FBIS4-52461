Praman was moved to the ceremonial post of party president, as earlier agreed between his small group of supporters and Banhan's powerful faction. The post of president was created recently just for Praman. The elections, held during a party assembly at the Siam City Hotel, in Bangkok, also saw Sano Thianthong appointed Chat Thai secretary-general, replacing Banhan. New deputy party leaders, eight altogether, include Bun-ua Prasoetsuwan, Thawit Klinprathum, Watthana Atsawahem, and Praman's son Pongphon Adireksan. Prathuang Wichanpricha was made party spokesman. Banhan, a Suphan Buri MP, is the first non-member of the Ratchakhru clan to rise to the helm of Chat Thai which was formed 20 years ago. After learning the result of the election, Banhan told reporters he would adhere to the policies laid down by previous leaders. Chat Thai, which has no House seats in Bangkok, would try to penetrate the city political stronghold -- dominated by Phalang Tham and the Democrats -- during the next general election. "If Chat Thai wins some seats in Bangkok, it means that Bangkokians accept us as working for the country," Banhan said. Asked whether he had manoeuvred to seize control of Chat Thai as preparation for the prime ministership, he refused to comment, saying it was not the time to talk about it. However Sano cut Banhan short telling reporters that the new party leader was ready for the job of prime minister. "If he was not ready for the post of prime minister, he would not have dared to accept the Chat Thai leadership," Sano said. Praman said he was confident Banhan would take good care of the party. "I believe he will lead the party out of all kinds of trouble," Praman said.
