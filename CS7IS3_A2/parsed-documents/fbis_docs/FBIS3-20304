Against the backdrop of the split between Berlusconi, the media mogul who led his three-month old Forza Italia to victory in the just-concluded general election, and Northern League leader Umberto Bossi, Ciampi said, "The government hopes to be able, as soon as possible, to hand matters on to the new government which will be named by the president of the republic on the basis of the electoral results." The premier who took over in April last year, as the first non-politician and non-member of Parliament to hold this office, also spoke of hopes for "a climate of stability and correct civil co-existence, necessary conditions for facing the complex problems before the nation." He went on to voice "the satisfaction of the government with the orderly conduct of the campaign and voting operations which brought in the Parliament of the twelfth legislature. ``The government,'' he added, ``is beginning to conclude its duties of management and as institutional guarantor in a sensitive phase of transition with results which testify to the country's basic steadiness and capacity for renewal in the political, economic and social fields and in democratic security.'' In the wings, Berlusconi said all the alignments in his Forza Italia-led Freedom Front should be involved in the formation of a government, "just as indicated by the voters," and that the new executive should be "political" rather than a cabinet of "technocrats."
