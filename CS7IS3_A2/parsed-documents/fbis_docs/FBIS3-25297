The two leaders agreed to set up a joint committee that will, among other things, discuss the homeland's stand on a new dispensation in South Africa, as well as the normalization of relations. Relations between the ANC and Bophuthatswana deteriorated further recently following several incidents in which ANC political activities in Bophuthatswana were disrupted by the security forces.
