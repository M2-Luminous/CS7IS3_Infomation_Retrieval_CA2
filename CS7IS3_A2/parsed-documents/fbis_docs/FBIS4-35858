She said: We will cooperate with the Palestinian economy and always work for its growth and development, based on Jordan's historical commitment to the Palestine question. I do not think that any Jordanian citizen or official is doing anything other than this. In an exclusive statement to AL-RA'Y commenting on reports about a desire to establish economic integration between Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon to confront the results of the economic agreement between Israel and the PLO on the economies of the three countries, Dr. Khalaf said: We are aware that there are restrictions on the Palestinian economy, and we hope that these restrictions will be removed so that this economy can become close and attached to the economies of Arab countries, and disengage its links with the Israeli economy. Dr. Khalaf said Jordan's economic cooperation with all Arab countries is based on Jordan's historical pan-Arab concept, and this is not restricted to Syria and Lebanon but includes all Arab countries in order to realize Arab economic integration. Dr. Khalaf said Jordan is following a policy of entrenching economic cooperation with all Arab countries, including the Palestinian National Authority. She added that, according to Jordan's concept, this cooperation will surely be beneficial and will assist economic and social development in all Arab countries. Dr. Khalaf said Jordan wants to entrench economic cooperation with all Arab countries through joint committees, adding that the Jordanian-Syrian Joint Committee held a meeting in Amman, and will hold another meeting soon in Amman at the level of prime ministers. Before that, the Jordanian-Egyptian Joint Committee held meetings at the level of prime ministers. She added that Jordan coordinates in all fields with Arab brothers in a bid to build an Arab economy that is able to survive and face the economic blocs set up in the world.
