Citing Bosnian Serb military sources, the news agency of the Bosnian Serb Republic (RS)--SRNA, says that the German authorities are in this way getting rid of the Moslem refugees and, at the same time, enabling the Moslem side to take better military positions in the almost two-year civil war in Bosnia. It is clear, a Bosnian Serb military statement said, that the entire action was completely agreed by Bonn and the Moslem authorities in Sarajevo and is carried out in synchronization with Bonn's and Washington's efforts to re-establish the Moslem-Croat military and diplomatic coalition with unconcealed anti-Serb intentions. The Bosnian Croats and Moslems, former allies against the Bosnian Serbs, clashed a year ago over territories with a mixed population. Last week the two sides met in Washington, at the insistence of the United States, and signed a draft agreement on setting up a joint federation in Bosnia and a subsequent confederation with neighbouring Croatia. On Monday Germany announced it would begin expelling 100,000 people with Yugoslav passports who are illegally in Germany.
