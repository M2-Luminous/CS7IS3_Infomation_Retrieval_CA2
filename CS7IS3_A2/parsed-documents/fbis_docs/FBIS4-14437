"At the moment it is still too early to analyze the composition of the local-level representative organs; that is a task for the next few days. But one or two preliminary conclusions can be drawn: For instance, we were attracted by the election proceedings in Kemerovo Oblast. Of the 35 districts, elections were valid in 30. Nineteen supporters of Aman Tuleyev, the former oblast soviet chairman, headed by Tuleyev himself, were voted onto the representative organ, and 11 of the deputies elected are supporters of the head of the administration and his course. The future representative assembly will thus be determined by by-elections for five deputies. "Running for the Novosibirsk Oblast Soviet of Deputies (such is the name of the representative organ) was the former chairman of the local oblast soviet, a `star' of all antipresidential campaigns. He was elected along with a significant number of his supporters. "We forecast that the elections would prove invalid in Magadan Oblast: This region has a very difficult social situation, and sends many complaints to the president, and indeed, of the 17 districts, elections were valid only in 10. We hoped that the elections would take place more or less evenly in Samara Oblast, and that a good guberniya duma would be elected, but the results do not empower the representative organ to begin work. Elections to the organs of local self-government were valid here in only half the districts. "Ryazan Oblast is a special case -- voters elected 19 deputies, there was a fairly large turnout, but the people of Ryazan had raised the bar which they have to clear: In order for the elctions to be deemed valid, not less than 35 percent of voters had to take part in the vote here. This bar was cleared in only 12 districts, and the representative organ cannot begin work because it is one deputy short. "The conflict between Nizhniy Novgorod's governor and the head of the oblast center administration could not fail to affect the course of the elections. The collapse of the elections in the city suggest that the legislative assembly will be composed of people of a sufficiently conservative cast of mind."
