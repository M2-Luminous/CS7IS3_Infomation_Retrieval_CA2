Chairman Cheng Kejie's work report was divided into two parts, namely, "The 1993 Work Review" and "The 1994 Work Tasks." In reviewing the 1993 work, Cheng Kejie pointed out: In 1993, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress, people of all nationalities in Guangxi closely adhered to the party's basic line, further emancipated the mind, strengthened confidence, and seized each and every opportunity to quickened the pace of reform, opening up, and economic construction with the result that we witnessed a regionwide economic boom, maintained political stability, strengthened nationality solidarity, and successfully promoted social progress. Guangxi's total estimated gross national product for the year 1993 reached 77.3 billion yuan, up 18.7 percent over the previous year. Cheng Kejie stated: Last year, under the leadership of the regional CPC committee, we firmly adhered to economic construction as the center and made every possible endeavor to improve all types of work. First, we unfolded large-scale discussions on building a socialist market economy, further emancipated the mind, and successfully transformed ideological concepts. Second, we quickened the pace of reform and made substantial progress in many key fields. Third, we strengthened agriculture as the foundation and comprehensively pressed ahead with comprehensive rural economic growth with the result that the region's total estimated agricultural output value for the year 1993 reached 38.4 billion yuan, up 5.2 percent over the previous year, and total estimated township and town enterprises output value 60.1 billion yuan, up 1.15 percent over the previous year. Fourth, we vigorously readjusted product mix in light of market needs and brought about a high-rate industrial growth with the result that the region's total estimated industrial output value at and above township level for the year 1993 reached 69.6 billion yuan, up 22.6 percent over the previous year. Fifth, we further expanded opening up to the outside world and developed foreign economic and trade relations by a large margin with the result that the region's foreign trade witnessed a sustained growth with the total estimated import and export volume standing at $1.9 billion, up 15.9 percent over the previous year. Sixth, we made more fruitful investment in both infrastructure facilities and basic industries with the result that the region's total estimated social investment in fixed assets reached 23 billion yuan. Seventh, we stepped up and improved macroeconomic regulation and control with the result that the regional financial order was improved and revenue increased. Eighth, we energetically developed science, technology, and education and scored gratifying results in developing various undertakings. Ninth, we enlivened both urban and rural markets and improved people's livelihood. Tenth, we firmly and simultaneously grasped two key aspects of work with the result that we succeeded in consolidating and developing a regionwide political situation of stability and unity. Speaking of the 1994 work tasks, Cheng Kejie stated in his government work report: In 1994 we should follow such a principle in all endeavors as comprehensively implementing the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress as well as the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. We should quicken the pace of reforms aimed at building a socialist market economic structure, further expand opening up to the outside world, strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control, vigorously readjust the economic structure, maintain a sound regionwide development momentum, energetically push the region's economic growth onto a new stage on the basis of a sustained and rapid economic growth scored over the past few years, create conditions for quadrupling the region's total gross national product three years ahead of schedule or even sooner, and constantly promote socialist democracy and spiritual civilization building. Speaking of the 1994 work arrangements, Cheng Kejie spelled out the following three requirements: 1. To maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy regional national economic growth. To this end, Cheng Kejie added, it has been tentatively decided that the region's total gross national product shall be raised by 12 percent, total agricultural output value by 7 percent, total industrial output value at and above township level by 15 percent, and total grain output by 1 percent on the basis of last year's figures. Moreover, efforts shall be made to secure a continued development for all trades and professions in the region. To attain these goals, Cheng Kejie noted, it is necessary to firmly grasp the following 10 aspects of work: 1) To vigorously develop the rural economy and increase peasants' income; 2) To improve industrial and communications productions in a down-to-earth manner with a view to increasing economic efficiency; 3) To successfully build key projects and continually accelerate ports construction; 4) To seize each and every opportunity to develop an export- oriented economy; 5) To make redoubled efforts to build a market system and invigorate circulation; 6) To successfully build all help-the-poor projects and help various poverty-stricken areas eradicate poverty and achieve prosperity at a faster pace; 7) To increase revenue, cut down on expenditure, and improve financial as well as credit and loan work; 8) To curb excessive price hikes and improve people's livelihood; 9) To continually attach strategic priority to educational, scientific, and technological development with an eye on achieving economic rejuvenation and prosperity; 10) To strengthen and improve family planning work in a down-to-earth manner and step up both land management and environmental protection. 2. To quicken the pace of reforms aimed at building a socialist market economic structure. This year's reforms should be centered on the following six aspects: 1) To deepen the rural economic structural reform so as to infuse rural economic development with fresh vigor; 2) To shift the state-owned enterprises operative mechanism in a down-to-earth manner and create conditions for establishing a modern enterprise system; 3) To conscientiously organize activities of studying the state policies on financial, revenue, banking, foreign trade, and planning systems reforms; 4) To expedite circulation structural reform and vigorously build and develop an essential production means market; 5) To perfect a social security system and accelerate urban housing system reform; 6) To vigorously and steadily further institutional reform and practically transform government functions. 3. To press ahead with socialist democracy and spiritual civilization building. To conclude, Cheng Kejie called on people of all nationalities in the region to adhere to the party's basic line and seize each and every excellent opportunity to speed up development under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core and to strive to score new achievements and win new victories in 1994.
