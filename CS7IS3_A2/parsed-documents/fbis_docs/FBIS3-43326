President Moi observed that water levels in many rivers have been reduced as a result of land degradation and destruction of water catchment areas. The president noted that unless water was conserved all forms of life would perish, and added that it was a responsibility of everyone to conserve the natural resources. He noted that environmental protection should be uppermost in the development agenda, from the locational to the district level and urged forest officers to emphasize it. He also called on agricultural extension officers to teach farmers how to dig bench terraces where the land was steep. The president further noted the wealth of the community depended on natural resources and hence there was a need to protect it. President Moi was speaking at various places when he made an extensive tour of southern and central Baringo.
