According to the same source, the Serb side has been directly contributing to the implementation of the cease-fire agreement. However, the Muslim side has opened infantry fire on the Serb side over the last 24 hours from positions in Dobrinja II and Dobrinja III and has targeted Serb defense lines on Sanac hill and residential areas near the Grbavica stadium. Serb sources cited UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] representatives who had confirmed Muslim building of fortifications in the Zuc and Mojmilo areas yesterday. However, the Muslims have resumed reinforcing their positions in several areas in an attempt to approach Serb positions under UNPROFOR protection, Serb military sources warned reporting that positions were being reinforced in Dobrinja III, in the area between Mojmilo and Sucur Kuce and in the Jewish cemetery. Identical operations to reinforce positions have also been registered between Golo Brdo and Ugorsko and between Radovica Kuce and Dobrinja Potok, Nedjarici, and Aerodromsko Naselje. The Serb side has informed the UNPROFOR command about this and the UNPROFOR command's representatives already stated that the building of trenches represented a cease-fire violation.
