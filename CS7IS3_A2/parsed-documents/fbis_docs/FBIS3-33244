According to official spokesmen, the explosives were planted by Communist guerrillas, who over the past few days have intensified their attacks in an attempt to sabotage the congressional elections scheduled for 13 March. The attacks caused considerable damage at the Venezuelan Consulate, two of the ruling Liberal Party's offices, and two of the Conservative Party's offices in various areas of Colombia's second largest city. Yesterday the guerrillas abducted Deputy Tomas Devia in the southern department of Guaviare, and two policemen and one soldier were killed during an armed attack in the eastern town of Cucutilla. Last week subversives kidnapped Senator Hernando Torres and Deputy Victor Buitrago in the central department of Boyaca. Campaigning politicians are now demanding that the government increase its security measures.
