The Council could not agree on another resolution, which among other things asked for the minister's action to be condemned. Democratic Party negotiator said Mr Shill should be allowed to explain his position before such a resolution could be accepted. African National Congress [ANC] Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa said the housing scheme was still under discussion at a multiparty level within the housing forum. Mr Shill was summoned to appear before the TEC at its next sitting in Pretoria to answer questions from the Council and the National Housing Forum. The ANC, the ANC-aligned SA [South African] National Civic Organisation and the National Housing Forum have said the minister's announcement was unilateral and "blatant politicking". The announcement had damaged the process of achieving concensus on housing subsidy policy and thereby delayed the delivery of housing. By announcing an "incomplete" housing guarantee scheme, long and sensitive negotiations undertaken to bring the banks into the delivery of low income housing might also now be jeopardised, they claimed.
