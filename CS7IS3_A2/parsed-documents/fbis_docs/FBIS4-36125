The reason that prompted the ban in the first place is still there, the 1982 Israeli invasion of south Lebanon. The combination of air raids, strafing, piracy, abductions, combing of towns and villages and their devastation and depopulation is an invasion in another guise. By lifting the arms embargo on Israel, the United Kingdom is, in effect, rewarding the Israeli aggressors and furnishing them with the means to bolster their superiority and pursue their recklessness and acts of terror and aggression. Advancing an alibi for removing the embargo, the United Kingdom cited "encouraging developments in the peace process, specifically the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho", to quote British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. More surprisingly, London has made lifting the arms ban on the Arabs conditional on the bilateral talks moving forward. The party that must take the blame for the failure of these talks to advance is Israel itself. This is an example of the double standard in UK policies -- one standard for Israel, another against the Arabs. By ending the ban on arms sales to Israel and making its revocation regarding the Arabs conditional on the peace process making headway, the British Government has set a serious precedent in international relations. Britain has underscored its blind bias toward Israel, its aggressive and terrorist policies, and has stabbed the Arabs and their worthy causes. The British Government defended its decision by citing encouraging developments, sidestepping the facts and the substance of the peace process. Just what are these developments that prompted this decision? Do they include the substitution of Israeli withdrawal as stipulated by UN Security Council resolutions with the redeployment of forces provided for in the self-rule agreement? Is the continuing existence of Jewish settlements and consequently Israeli occupation an encouraging development? Does Israel's responsibility for security and political matters in the self-rule area or its control over roads, crossings, and bridges also rank as encouraging developments? Does the United Kingdom really rate these as truly encouraging developments, or is it knowingly and deliberately pursuing deceptive policies calculated to mislead world opinion and liquidate the Palestinian people's rights?! The United Kingdom is all too aware that the self-rule plan does not meet the Palestinian people's aspirations. The United Kingdom is equally aware that Israel continues to cling to occupation, and thus is not eligible for any reward. Nor should Israel's repressive machine be rewarded for its savagery and terror. It is not right that the Israeli military should be furnished with what it takes to pursue coercive and genocidal programs. It is worthwhile to make one thing abundantly clear: Britain's pro-Israel stance is bound to further complicate things in the region. It would have been more helpful if Britain had acted to deter Israel's aggression and brought pressure to bear in the interest of making it comply with UN resolutions. The lifting of the arms embargo will only exacerbate Israel's excesses and intransigence and its rejection of the bases on which the peace process was launched. Britain should have acted to end Israel's recklessness and arrogance, and should have helped the cause of an even-handed and universal peace settlement in the Middle East.
