"I admit that I am really afraid of the future. This stems from the fact that a great number of UN conventions have been in force for thirty years, but the drug-related crime has not decreased, rather the contrary. I am concerned by the statement of director-general of the Interpol that the struggle against illegal drug trafficking has failed and legalisation of drugs is a possible solution for the future," Ruml noted. He described his election as deputy chairman of the conference as an expression of the Czech Republic's effort to contribute to the struggle against the drug danger, Ruml said. The conference was staged by the expert organisation for cooperation of the struggle against drug abuse and drug trafficking within the European Council which is known as the Pompidou Group.
