The Preussen-Elektra AG company in Hanover will take over the majority of five of the 15 regional supply companies. The five firms are: Oder-Spree Energieversorgung AG (Oseag) in Frankfurt/Oder, Maerkische Energieversorgung AG (Mevag) in Potsdam, Energieversorgung Magdeburg AG (EVM) in Magdeburg, Hanseatische Energieversorgung AG (Hevag) in Rostock, and Energieversorgung Mueritz-Oderhaff AG (EMO) in Neubrandenburg. The power supply enterprises Bayernwerk AG in Munich and the Rheinisch-Westfaelisches Elektrizitaetswerk AG (RWE) in Essen will take over 51 percent each of some regional east German power supply plants on the basis of the electricity agreement concluded in 1990. However, negotiations with the Trust Agency have not yet been concluded. The east German communes will receive the remaining 49 percent later. Talks on privatizing the Veag Vereinigte Energiewerke AG in Berlin are more difficult. The majority of the east German enterprise is to be sold to the three large west German electricity concerns Bayernwerk, Preussen-Elektra, and RWE. The Veag is planning for investments worth approximately 30 million German marks by the end of 2005 to modernize the east German power supply. In view of the economic crisis in the new laender, the Veag must expect a lower sale of electricity. Establishing public utilities also has a negative impact on the Veag's sale of power. Thus, the Trust Agency might be forced to reduce the price. According to the Trust Agency, the privatization of the Veag is to be concluded by the middle of 1994, and the sale of the second east German brown coal producer, Lausitzer Braunkohle AG (Laubag), in Senftenberg is to be completed by the same time, if possible.
