As we know, Ukraine's President, in response to the insistence of the oblast council officials and executive authorities of four oblasts, recently signed an edict granting regional self-government status to Dnepropetrovsk, Donetsk, Zaporozhye, and Lugansk oblasts. To put it more plainly, it is not yet a federative system. Politics abstracted, the new division of Ukraine into the "potato west" and the "iron east" is comparable to the story of the man who has a horse and puts a high fence around his farm so that his relative who doesn't have a horse won't be coming around to be jealous of his prosperity. There hasn't been much prosperity in the east yet, though, and some might be inclined to predict that the isolation of the technological and raw materials-rich region will make its life harder--in which, as during the era of intensive industrial exploitation of it to meet the needs of the former USSR (especially metal needs), priority will go to the interests of industry and its magnates rather than to the people. The recent Russian media report of rolled metal sent from Dnepropetrovsk to someone who doesn't need it in the Russian boondocks is just one episode of this kind of "management." Consuming the lion's share of costly energy imported from Russia, local plants are hoarding goods for export or for barter; and just as the ordinary local citizen got nothing from that little contribution to the state budget, now again he'll get the same from the contribution the regional authorities take from Kiev. Certain officials' assurances that "the metal will enable the region to supply itself with gasoline" are not making many people optimistic. The opulent life of owners of official cars running on fuel at state prices has long been a sore point. Meanwhile, it doesn't solve others' problems. This serves to confirm people's belief that the "economic self-government" is beneficial only to the numerous corps of local "party authorities," solving problems of ambition rather than real ones. And although the authorities, as usual, answer with annoyance that economic self-government has nothing to do with territorial problems, the speech of officials in the Dnieper region has been increasingly tinged with the accents of Donetsians, who haven't concealed their intention to bring all of eastern Ukraine into their sphere of influence. But as to who wants to bring Donetsk into it there is no doubt. A logical segment in this chain of events of Ukraine's new economic reality is the invitation of a group of Russian methodologists to Dnepropetrovsk to "formulate an optimal conception of regional "life support." It is reported that the group is headed by Yanovskyy, the eminent Russian economist and former counselor of Rutskyy; the consultants also include a number of champions from Yavlynskyy's team. It should be added that the day before, the local press was pushing the notion of the almost complete lack of economists in Ukraine itself--promoted in an interview, incidentally, by none other than former Prime Minister Kuchma. The latest collapse of inferiority, which was in fact fostered by Kuchma's Cabinet and "reforms," impelled the seekers of economic independence from Dnepropetrovsk to seek rescuers for their independence in Moscow this time, not Kiev. All for the best, of course--yet many are afraid the lesson will follow the old programs....
