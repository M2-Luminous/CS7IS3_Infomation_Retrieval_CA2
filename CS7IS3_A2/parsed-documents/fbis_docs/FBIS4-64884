Foreign and defense ministers from member countries of the WEU continued their meetings in Luxembourg on Monday. Cetin and Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan said they welcomed a new `developed partnership' status given with WEU's structure but Turkey's aim is to be a full member of the Union. Cetin in a briefing on the meeting said the most important improvement is the new partnership status that will be given to Central and East European countries and Baltic countries. He said the WEU will provide cooperation possibilities to those countries in operational fields. WEU's operational functions are preserving peace and administering humanitarian aid and power. Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Lithuania, Estonia and Lithuania who have previously signed a number of cooperation and partnership agreements with the WEU, will obtain a special status within the organization. Cetin said Turkey's status is specified as an `associate member' with the Union meaning that Turkey will be officially represented at the military secretariat which is the `planning cell' of the WEU, and will be able to contribute to the Union's operations. Turkey does not have the right to vote or to veto. The meetings will end this evening and Golhan will return to Turkey, while Cetin will fly to Strasbourg, France to attend the Council of Europe meetings.
