FR940719-1-00055 FR940719-1-00015 Additionally, the proposal would require that an examination be made as described in §75.360(b) through (e). Although complete withdrawal of miners is required, this examination could begin once ventilation has been restored and would be performed by certified persons designated by the operator to conduct the examination. The Agency is proposing this approach because of the safety concerns associated with extended interruptions in the ventilation system. It is recognized that under §75.360(a) a preshift examination can be made for an oncoming shift while miners are underground. However, the proposal would not allow miners to remain underground because of the lack of ventilation compared to the situation where ventilation is continuously maintained. Section 75.320␣Air Quality Detectors and Measurement Devices The informational meetings and later discussions on the rule indicated that simply requiring detectors for measuring methane and oxygen deficiency to be maintained in permissible condition does not completely satisfy the need for assuring proper maintenance. It was suggested that without a requirement for maintenance to be done by a trained person, similar to that which existed in the previous standard, a person with less than the necessary understanding of the instrument and the permissibility requirements might be assigned the task. The proposal would require that methane detectors and other devices be properly maintained at all times and, to assure the appropriate level of maintenance, the proposal in paragraph (e) would require this maintenance to be done by a trained person. This does not preclude the operator from sending instruments to the manufacturer or another repair facility for regular servicing. Additionally, the proposal would require the operator to assure that any instrument sent underground is in permissible condition so that the use of the instrument does not pose an explosion hazard. The level of care that must be exercised is of course a function of instrument usage but, at a minimum, the Agency would expect that the detector be visually examined to assure that it is properly assembled and that all necessary components such as screws, lenses, and indicator lamps are present. As with the requirement that maintenance be done by a trained person, this requirement was present in the previous standard and is being proposed to further assure that methane detectors do not pose a hazard and will perform properly during the shift. Section 75.321␣Air Quality This proposal would continue a basic air quality requirement that has been in place since 1970 that air in areas where persons work or travel contain at least 19.5 percent oxygen and not more than 0.5 percent carbon dioxide, and the volume and velocity of the air current in these areas be sufficient to dilute, render harmless, and carry away flammable, explosive, noxious, and harmful gases, dusts, smoke, and fumes. The proposal would not require this carbon dioxide level to be applied to bleeder entries and worked-out areas. MSHA has interpreted former §75.301 to require at least 19.5 percent oxygen and no greater than 0.5 percent carbon dioxide in bleeder systems where persons work or travel. Similarly, it was the intent of the Agency to enforce §75.321 to require compliance with these levels where persons would be exposed in bleeder entries and in worked-out areas. However, the application of this provision to bleeders has been stayed by the D.C. Circuit pending the outcome of litigation on the rule. The Agency continues to believe that providing satisfactory air quality is essential to protect the miners and examiners whenever they work or travel in bleeder entries and worked-out areas. Therefore, the proposal includes a new provision specifying that the air in bleeder entries and worked-out areas where persons work or travel contain at least 19.5 percent oxygen, and that carbon dioxide not exceed 0.5 percent TWA (Time Weighted Average) and 3.0 percent STEL (Short Term Exposure Limit). A TWA is the time-weighted average concentration for a normal 8-hour workday and a 40-hour workweek. A STEL is a 15-minute TWA exposure which can not be exceeded at any time during a workday even if the 8-hour TWA is within the specified TWA. Exposures above the TWA up to the STEL can not be longer than 15 minutes and can not occur more than four times per day. There must be at least 60 minutes between successive exposures in this range. These proposed levels are identical to the levels contained in MSHA's proposed air quality standards for coal and metal and nonmetal mines and the 1992 Threshold Limit Values (TLV) as specified by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists. In light of the ongoing air quality rulemaking, the Agency is not at this time proposing to modify existing air quality standards as applied to areas where persons work or travel, other than bleeder entries and worked-out areas. The Agency will consider the appropriate course of action on this issue as part of the air quality rulemaking.
