With the handover of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, cross-strait relations with Taiwan will become the main task of Xinhua's former united front department which was recently renamed the "co-ordination department". In Chinese communist parlance, "united front work" refers to liaison, penetration, and control of "friendly" or neutral organisations whose cooperation can advance party objectives. Zhou Zhekai, the newly appointed head of the coordination department, was formerly a deputy secretary of Beijing's body handling cross-strait affairs, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait. Zhou's appointment, revealed in the Beijing run TA KUNG PAO earlier this month, marks a break with past practice when the department head was appointed from the Communist Party's United Front Work Department (UFWD) . The UFWD, which competes with Taipei around the world for the minds and hearts of overseas Chinese has only been allowed to appoint a new deputy head to the department -- Tian Jin in the current round of middle-level reshuffles taking place at XINHUA's headquarters in Happy Valley. Until the end of 1992, Tian served as personal secretary to former UFWD head Ding Guangen, a politburo member and close associate of Deng Xiaoping who currently heads the party propaganda department. In the three years remaining before the handover of Hong Kong, Tian is expected to handle local tasks of the coordination department, including the appointment of Hong Kong advisers and members of the Preliminary Working Committee as well as local delegates to China's two quasi-parliaments. The eventual plan is for the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office (HKMAO) to take over all united front work in Hong Kong. This was signalled by the internal restructuring of the HKMAO last month, which saw the formation of a new social and cultural affairs department, ostensibly to breathe new life into grass-roots united front work in the territory, which XINHUA has neglected in recent years. This will leave Zhou free to devote more time to Taiwan affairs. Jousting between Beijing and Taipei is expected to intensify in Hong Kong itself as Taipei takes steps to strengthen its propaganda work in the territory. Zhou's brief could also involve working on more sensitive areas, including possible meetings between senior Beijing and Taiwan officials in Hong Kong. In his previous posting as head of the general affairs department at the Chinese Communist Party's Taiwan Affairs Office, Zhou handled cross-strait fishing disputes and illegal mainland immigration to Taiwan, the kind of "practical issues" which Taipei says could be discussed in Hong Kong. Zhou's work is also likely to involve prodding Taipei to allow senior Chinese officials and heads of large Chinese companies based in the territory to visit Taiwan. But it is unclear whether the coordination department's expanding role will conflict with XINHUA's low-profile Taiwan affairs department. Meanwhile, the shake-up of the coordination department under Zhou has left a bad feeling in the agency. This was because of the unceremonious removal of a former department head, Lin Keping, who has returned to the UFWD in Beijing. Lin is understood to have learned of his removal from the local press.
