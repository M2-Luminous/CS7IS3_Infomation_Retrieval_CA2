I personally held a discussion with Lt. Gen. Calitz, regional commissioner, Witwatersrand concerning the matter with the understanding that he would inform Mr Mandela of the warrant and attempt to obtain his cooperation in confiscating the weapons. Lt. Gen. Calitz informed me that Mr Mandela had given him an undertaking that the weapons would be handed over and therefore it was not necessary to continue with this search. The matter is being dealt with further by Lt. Gen. Calitz.
