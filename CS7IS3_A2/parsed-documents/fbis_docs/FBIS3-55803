He added that the constitution is inadequately expressed and needs a number of additional laws to guarantee the actual balance of power. Laar rejected the president's accusations of inopportune moment for the reshuffle. "I consider the change of ministers a significant factor guaranteeing Estonia's stability. Considering the hard times ahead, we should go on with a monolithic government which effectively cooperates with the parliament," he said. The prime minister admitted that the presidential speech contained a number of correct critical points, but added that Meri had not expressed his criticism so directly at the previous meetings. Laar also stressed that the government had been paying "constant attention" to the infiltration of the Russian capital into Estonia. "Fatherland" faction chairman Tiit Sinissaar described the accusations as surprising and questioned the arguments used by the president. Deputy faction chairman Kalle Jurgenson stressed that the "Fatherland" sees no reasons for the resignation of the prime minister. "Fatherland" MP [member of parliament] Mart Nutt and Moderate Vello Saatpalu stressed that Estonia is a parliamentary state and the president exceeded his authority. Centrist Andra Veidemann described the situation and the presidential expression of no confidence to the prime minister as "interesting and unprecedented". Coalition Party MP Ulo Vooglaid expressed his surprise and delight at the president's frank and honest analysis of the critical problems.
