"If the (presence of the) new parliamentary group hampers the maintenance of the coalition framework, we are ready to disband it," Ouchi said in a TV program. Ouchi on Monday proposed the creation of the new parliamentary bloc called Kaishin (Innovation) to support newly elected Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. After five parties and groups formed the bloc without the SDP, which was kept in the dark over the move, the SDP, the largest force in the coalition, decided to withdraw from the coalition. The SDP's decision plunged Japan's political world into confusion, with the possibility that Hata will be forced to form a minority government. "We will not place any conditions before accepting a possible return of the SDP into the coalition fold," Ouchi said.
