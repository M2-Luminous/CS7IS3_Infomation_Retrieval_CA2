The Fraunhofer Society (FhG) has recently announced that the system, which works automatically, is ideal for use in mobile units and large test batches and is cheaper and faster than conventional detection methods. The new process is based on the same test principle as previous methods, exploiting the antigen-antibody reaction. When a human being becomes infected with the HIV, which triggers the lethal immune-deficiency disease, AIDS, his or her immune system produces specific antibodies to proteins on the surface of the pathogen. These proteins are termed antigens. If a blood sample is exposed to artificially produced antigens, any AIDS antibodies present in the blood will fasten onto them. In the conventional enzyme immune test, which takes several hours, this bond triggers a change of color. The FhG reports that the new system detects the antigen-antibody reaction in only 10 minutes. An injection valve feeds the blood sample into a stream of liquid flowing through a measuring chamber with a sensitive piezoelectric oscillator. An electronic alternating field causes these thin, pure quartz platelets, of the type used, for instance, in watches and modern digital scales, to vibrate. If anything is deposited on the quartz, the oscillation frequency changes, the change being recorded by the oscillator and the frequency counter. The researchers used gold, to which proteins adhere well, to coat the quartz platelets with AIDS virus antigens. As soon as HIV antibodies fasten onto the sensor, its mass increases, as does its oscillation frequency. It is reported that test batches of a thousand samples each can be tested automatically with this process. If the AIDS antibody is discovered in one of the samples, the apparatus must be cleaned or the piezoelectric oscillator changed. The society's report states that all previous tests showed a marked difference in response to positive and antibody-free serum samples. As the new test is basically an offshoot of the conventional detection process, the researchers assume that it is equally accurate.
