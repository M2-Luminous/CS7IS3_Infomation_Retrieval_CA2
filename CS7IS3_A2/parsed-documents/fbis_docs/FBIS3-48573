Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas [Central Bank of the Philippines] reported yesterday that the wider deficit was due to the faster growth of imports compared with exports. The country, however, was importing more capital goods and raw materials for re-export. For the month of October 1993, total merchandise exports reached $1,002 million, up 16.5 percent over the year-ago level of $860 million. This brought aggregate exports from January to October 1993 to rise by 12.8 percent to $9,121 million compared to the level for the same period last year. The $1,034 million increase for the first 10 months can be traced primarily to the hike in shipments of manufactured goods, particularly electronics and electrical equipment and parts ($608 million); garments ($132 million); and, machinery and transport equipment ($72 million). Semi-conductor devices remained the country's leading export product with earnings amounting to $904 million. Other leading exports include finished electrical and electronic machinery and parts manufactured from materials imported on consignment; other electronic integrated circuits and micro assemblies; consigned women's wear; and, consigned children's and infants' wear. During the review month, total imports amounted to $1,647 million, 23.7 percent higher than the $1,331 million recorded a year earlier. Imports for the 10-month period amounted to $14,291 million, up by 19.7 percent from the year-ago level of $11,939 million. The upturn was attributed to the increase in arrivals of all major commodity groups except mineral fuels and lubricant. Imports of capital goods expanded by $1,108 million with power generating and specialized machines contributing the highest growth of $541 million, followed by telecommunication equipment and electrical machinery, aircraft, ships and boats, by $339 million and $183 million, respectively. Raw materials and intermediate goods imports rose by $952 million on account of increased arrivals of materials and accessories for the manufacture of electronic equipment ($347 million), metal products ($173 million), and iron and steel ($137 million). Likewise, arrivals of consumer goods rose by $260 million attributed to higher demand for passenger cars and motorized cycle, and miscellaneous manufactures. Petroleum crude maintained its position as the country's top leading import commodity notwithstanding the $183 million drop in its import value of $1,154 million. Other leading imports included dice on consignment basis [as published]; materials and accessories for the manufacture of other electrical machinery and equipment on consignment basis; parts of electronic integrated circuits and micro assemblies; and, fabrics for the manufacture of outer garments on consignment basis. The country's merchandise trade balance in October 1993 resulted in a deficit of $645 million, $174 million higher than the level a year ago. Based on the cumulative levels for the 10-month period, the gap widened to $5,170 million or by $1,318 million from the $3,852 million in the previous year.
