The authors assert that new businesses, which up to now had been jeered as "gap industries," have acquired citizenship as the pulling force of industry amidst the clear appearance of a shift in individual demand which has been an undercurrent for a long time. Strong Individual Consumption Debate over the structural conversion has risen like the contention of a hundred schools of thought, but those which do not fully grasp reality are found here and there. If you try to get hold of the industrial structure by numbers, a structural conversion is already proceeding steadily right before you. It is a somewhat paradoxical way of saying it, but the current industrial structure is again returning to a long-term trend. The changes in the period of the bubble economy were rather dissociated from the trends of Japanese industry. Viewing the margin of the dissociation from the average for industry overall in sales increase rates (over the previous year) in the various materials, machinery, and individual consumption-related sectors, the materials-related as a trend fell about 4 to 5 percent below increases in sales for industry as a whole with repeated fluctuations due to economic fluctuations (including price revolution due to the oil shocks and high yen). Even viewing the average for some past 10 years in the machinery-related, it has been on about the same level as the increase in the average for industry overall. On the other hand, growth in the individual consumption-related sector (food, retail sales, business services, and other services) greatly exceeds the others. For several years in the bubble economy period, this individual consumption-related sector fell below the materials and machinery sectors and was dissociated from the long-term trend, but later, in the three-year period from 1991 to the present, it has been found to be returning again to the trend. This change in the sales by industry is due to long-term structural adjustments in the so-called key industries. It is generated by most economic recession situations, and there have been great adjustments in business sectors in this recession also. However, these adjustments have been much more prolonged than before, and there is a strong possibility that sales in key industry will be stagnant over a long period. One of the reasons is that the profit level is very low. Considered from the rulings on ROE (rate of return on equity) and interest, an ROE on the level of 6 to 7 percent is necessary for stockholders. According to the calculations of our research institute, an ordinary profit corresponding to about 2.2 times fiscal 1993 (estimate only) in the listed manufacturing industry average must be secured in order to obtain this ROE. Even if sales in fiscal 1994 and thereafter take a steady pattern of growth at an annual rate of 3 percent, it will not achieve it until fiscal 1997, and the growth of business will decline greatly because of the need for reduced management. Deflation is another cause. There has been a price decrease in unit sales prices for capital and production goods for a long period, and a price revolution is proceeding. As a result, a great dissociation has occurred between sales in the materials and machinery sectors and the unit sales price in the individual consumption-related sector mentioned earlier, causing a disparity in sales. Of course, this does not represent substantial scale or value added, but it is steadily changing the sales of industry overall. Already, such structural change is clearly proceeding in the finance aspect as well. Table 1 is the loan growth rate by industrial category for banks nationwide. Bank loan growth has been largely dull for the past two or three years; however, unlike the bubble era, loans for the service industry and individuals have been firm in tone, and the growth in the loan balance for both amounts to over 70 percent of the whole. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

Since that is the case, regardless of a tight purse, demand related to consumption by individuals that are tops in the world in income level, will have to have a role in supporting economic growth in both market volume and growth stability. Actual numbers also suggest that. New Business Ground Already, the industry group that centers on fields related to individual consumption has formed a big market in the United States. In Japan, too, a considerable number of businesses which have scouted for new business chances under the recent recessionary situation exist and still are continuing growth. There are 54 companies among the listed companies that have achieved increased revenue and profits for four consecutive terms, including fiscal 1993 estimates. The majority of these businesses are businesses that have succeeded with a consumption service model closely adhered to life, requisites such as food or medicine, or unique knowhow or strategy. The products or services that they provide often are seen as those which add to the pursuit of "convenience" and contribute to "comfort." Particularly in the individual living field, food-related (retort foods, food supermarkets), fixed services accompanying changes in lifestyle (convenience stores, family game software, credit cards), business conditions pursuing low prices (suburban men's clothing stores), and medical product-related businesses stand out. Moreover, one characteristic is the growth of security and environment-related businesses. On the other hand, viewing the number of new open businesses since fiscal 1991, while service, distribution, and the transport-related have reached close to 50 percent of the whole, the manufacturing industry percentage is no more than a little over 30 percent. Particularly when comparing fiscal 1991 and 1992 and thereafter, the service industry, including finance, rapidly increased from 20.3 percent to 29.2 percent while the manufacturing industry share dropped from 38.1 percent to 31.0 percent. Among the newly opened businesses, businesses which have 1) new services for the individual, 2) low prices, 3) new ideas and 4) new technology as sales items especially are noted. They are discounters, low price dining-out chains (pubs, buckwheat noodles, gyoza [pot-stickers]), take-out chains (lunches, sushi), various types of information services, game software, and mobile communications-related businesses. These businesses are, so to speak, businesses which have broken previous established concepts and boldly made a challenge in new fields. It is believed that the impact of this "new business group" will increase year by year in the future also. In retrospect, among the industries that currently have built a stable position, for example, the volume sales stores that appeared as a price-breaking business situation in the 1970's and 1980's, or the dining-out industry where new soft service has succeeded, roadside shops, convenience stores, home delivery, and family game software, etc., were truly small new businesses when they appeared. In other words, the group of businesses which are growing in the current recessionary situation give a hint for finding the new growth fields of Japan in the future, and we are now in our infancy. Industries which have advanced into territories that cannot be covered by the major industries already established in Japan and fields where new consumer needs or ideas have been made into a business and there is no existing industry have come to be treated by the somewhat jeering expression of "niche industries" or "gap industries." However, the success of home deliveries, family game software, convenience stores, and take-out lunch chains exceeds a mere "gap." The new industry fields which are now suddenly rising to power should be valued positively as "tomorrow's industries group" that will actually shoulder the next-generation industries, and we have been rather slow in acknowledging their true worth. The largest bases which produce these new businesses are the "emphasis on individual life" and "changes of the social environment." If the basic framework which supported the development of Japanese industry has been for "the realization of material, affluent life" domestically and "export promotion" externally for acquisition of foreign currency, it is the social needs of "aging," "health orientation," "spiritual affluence," and "life emphasis" which will support the businesses of the future, and it would be no exaggeration to say that it depends on promoting a domestic demand type of business territory. Even in the United States, the fast growing businesses in recent years have been concentrated in fields such as medical care, information communications, and distribution, reflecting changes of the industrial structure. Like the United States, where while hollowing out of the manufacturing industry was proceeding, computer software and entertainment industries made inroads in the world market and established their position, it is clear that the replacement of growth fields due to industrial structural changes has been steadily proceeding in Japan also. The most important point would be how the businesses will "break groud" and "develop into business" out of territories where growth is anticipated. In other words, there is a strong possibility that the future will be clearly defined by differences in strategy by individual businesses rather than specific industrial fields like before. Industrial Groups of Tomorrow Bearing in mind the fields which have been producing new growth businesses and separating them into categories where a high possibility of growth is anticipated in the future, they can generally be divided into the following six: "living-related businesses," "information communications new product fields," aging and health businesses," "time consumption, comfort, and affluence businesses," "environment-related businesses," and "low price pursuit businesses." These new businesses are already forming large markets, in some fields. Just in fields where it is possible to grasp or estimate market scale, it has now reached a scale of 49 trillion yen. Furthermore, to estimate the future market based on the growth rate for the past several years and taking the possibility of future market expansion into consideration, the market is expected to expand to a total amount of roughly 89 trillion yen in 2000, including 35 trillion yen for living and individual service-related as well as 20 trillion yen for the time consumption and comfort field, and the percentage occupied in Japan's industrial sector will rise by leaps and bounds.

Businesses which take up the challenge of markets with latent growth and risk and introduce new growth fields should be praised as truly excellent companies.
