While Comrade Wan Li was happily shaking hands with them, Comrade Zhang Guangyou asked Comrade Wan Li: "Do you still remember him? This (pointing at Yan Hongchang) is Yan Hongchang, former deputy leader of the Xiaogang production team who took the lead in making comprehensive production contracts on a household basis in the past." [Wan] Be seated, be seated! [Yan] All the peasants in Xiaogang miss you. They have asked me to pay you a visit! You supported us in making production contracts on a household basis. At present, we all have enough to eat and are having a comfortable life. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts and we all long to see you again! (On the afternoon of a certain day in the first lunar month of 1979, 15 years ago, Yan Hongchang and others held a meeting with 18 peasant households of the Xiaogang production team and adopted three "rules" including making comprehensive production contracts on a household basis. The Xiaogang production team and Fengyang County, in which the production team was located, took the lead in rural reform in China. Comrade Wan Li was secretary of the Anhui Provincial CPC Committee in January 1980. On hearing what had happened, he was deeply moved by the peasants of Xiaogang. He immediately went to Xiaogang to carry out an inspection. He made enquiries from door to door and affirmed the practice of the Xiaogang production team. He said: "I agree with what you have done. The Prefectural CPC Committee has given approval for you to have production contracts for three years, and I will give approval for you to have production contracts for five years. As long as you can make greater contributions to the country, retain more funds for the collectives, and improve the living standard of the commune members, you will not be regarded as `turning the clock back' even if you continue with you contracts all your life.") [Zhang] When I went to Xiaogang the year before last, the peasants there asked me to take an old hen to you. I told them it was not necessary because you could easily get one. Besides, it was inconvenient to carry it. [Wan] How is the life of the people in Xiaogang? [Yan] Not bad. Much better than the days you visited them. They all have enough to eat. [Wan] Do they all eat flour and rice? [Yan] They can afford rice and flour now. [Wan] Can they afford meat? [Yan] They can buy it whenever they want to. [Wan] How about clothing? [Yan] They have enough to wear and are wearing better clothes. [Wan] How about their living conditions? Have they all moved into new houses? How many thatched cottages remain? [Yan] Eighty percent of the people are living in brick houses, but there are still a small number of thatched cottages. [Wan] What is the per-capita income? [Yan] The per-capita income was over 800 yuan last year. [Wan] That is still much too little! It would be okay to have 2,000 yuan. In addition to food and clothing, they should at least have a purchasing power of 1,000 yuan. Without such a purchasing power, it is impossible for the market to flourish. Foreigners say China is a vast market. China's population mainly consists of peasants. How can this market be vast if the peasants' purchasing power is poor? We cannot depend on cities alone. Therefore, I hope you all will become rich and hope all peasants of the country will become rich, live a comfortable life, and have much more income. Do they all have television sets now? [Yan] Yes, they do. [Wan] Color ones? [Yan] All except those of two households are black and white television sets. [Wan] Too few. What is the per capita amount of land for the team? [Yan] Over three mu. [Wan] That means that net income per mu is only 200 yuan strong. They cannot become rich by relying on farming alone. [Zhang] At present, the income from growing grain is too little. The cost of growing grain is high, but the price of grain is low. In some localities, the income from growing a mu of grain is not so much as the price of one jin of crabs. The price of one jin of crabs on the market is 150 yuan and that of a soft-shelled turtle is also 150 yuan. It is impossible to become rich by relying on farming alone ... . [Wan] Only if an able-body peasant can grow 50 mu of grain will it be possible for his income to exceed 10,000 yuan. It is impossible for an able-body person growing eight to ten mu of grain to become rich. How many illiterate people are there in the production team? [Yan] All children go to school. Quite a lot of grown-ups are illiterate, about 50 percent. Almost all people over 40 are illiterate. [Wan] You must pay attention to training qualified personnel. Only by properly grasping education can there be an outlet. The issue of qualified personnel is very important. You must attach importance to education and to the training of qualified personnel. In the final analysis, whether or not production can develop and whether or not the economy can grow are determined by the quality of the people. You can establish ties with Shanghai and other developed areas and send people to work there on contracts that last two to three years in an organized manner. In this way, you can earn money and learn technology at the same time and you can train qualified personnel. Have you set up some companies? What business do they do? [Song] We have just started. Our foundation is poor and we have little to start with. We can only undertake some small projects first. [Wan] You cannot earn much this way. Is the burden in your place heavy? [Yan] We use minibuses to transport passengers and can earn more than 20,000 yuan a year. This can offset the amount to be handed over to the state by all the people of the village. Therefore, we do not find our burden heavy. [Wan] What about that of the peasants in other villages? [Yan] The burden of those without income other than farming is heavy. [Wan] What is the annual output value of township and town enterprises of Fengyang County? Has it reached 500 million yuan? You may not know. [Zhang] No, we do not. Fengyang County had a poor foundation to start with and does not have many channels for developing industry. The county does not have products that sell extremely well. Nor does it have industries which can promote the development of other industries. [Wan] "Without agriculture, we cannot have stability and without industry, we cannot become rich!" We must develop industry and properly run township and town enterprises. Dingyuan, Fengyang, and Jiashan were all poor counties in the past. How are they at present? [Zhang] Dingyuan has a salt mine and Jiashan has a brewery. Both are large projects. Fengyang has rich quartz deposits. You mentioned it several times when I accompanied you there in the past, but nothing has yet been achieved. [Wan] Fengyang originally had a spectacles plant, isn't that so? How is it at present? I read from NONGMIN RIBAO that there is a county in Henan which has quickly become rich by breeding loaches. There are indeed many ways to become rich. Provide the peasants with more information. You must look for ways to become rich on your own initiative. I favor taking the proper way to develop the economy. You should carry out good projects. You can have a comfortable life once the economy is developed. [Yan] The people of Fengyang and Xiaogang miss you and hope you will visit Fengyang again. Come to have a look at Xiaogang. Great changes have taken place. [Wan] Well, well. I will go once you have properly fulfilled your tasks. [Yan] The county government has set up a small decorated archway at the entry to Xiaogang Village and hopes you will write an inscription for it. [Wan] No, I will not! I do not favor formalism. I will not support flourishes, building temples or tombs, or other similar things. You should earnestly do a good job in production. [Song] We understand. When we go back, we will properly carry out our work and we shall make reports to you again after we have made achievements. [Wan] No need to report to me. Seize the time and work earnestly. [Yan] Revered Wan, can we have a photo taken as a memento? [Wan] Well, all right. (Comrade Wan Li straightened out his clothes and had two photos taken together with three of them.) Finally, Comrade Wan Li shook hands with Yan Hongchang and the others and bid them farewell. He saw them off outside the door and waved to them.
