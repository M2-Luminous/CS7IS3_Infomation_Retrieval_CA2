The ruling parties basically agreed to accept the LDP's proposal that an upper limit for official subsides to political parties be included in the Law on Subsidies for Political Parties. However, the ruling parties opposed another LDP proposal that "corporate status be given to political parties" to clarify responsibilities of political parties which will receive subsidies. They failed to reach an agreement. They will discuss again this issue and also the issue on the upper limit of subsides on 24 February. Regarding the issue of setting a limit on public funding for political parties, both sides basically agreed on the LDP's proposal that the amount of subsidies for political parties should be limited to less than two-thirds the amount of income in the previous year, excluding subsidies received. Concerning the issue of giving corporate status to political parties, they failed to reach an accord because a number of participants from the ruling parties said: "Giving corporate status to political parties would invite intervention by the administration and restrain their activities. There is a possibility that 'the freedom of association' will be violated by restricting political parties' activities. This issue should be discussed cautiously."
