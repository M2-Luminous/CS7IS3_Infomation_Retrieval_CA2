President Kim could carry out a partial cabinet reshuffle in consultation with Yi Yong-tok, who replaces Yi Hoe-chang, within Thursday. [sentence as received] Parliamentary approval of the new prime minister has been stalled at the National Assembly over two other controversial issues. But it appeared possible that the Assembly would approve Yi Yong-tok's appointment during its plenary session which opens at 2 p.m. Thursday. President Kim will then immediately hand credentials to Yi at Chongwadade [presidential office] and begin consultations to select, among others, Yi's successor as deputy prime minister and NUB minister, a Chongwadae official said. If National Assembly approval comes later, a partial cabinet reshuffle will take place Friday morning, sources said. President Kim will hold a cabinet meeting Friday.
