The essay reads in part: The distinguished greatness and extraordinary leadership ability of our general as an illustrious leader taking responsibility for the destiny of the people and leading them lie in firmly defending socialism, their life and soul, from the imperialists and glorifying it. The intelligence of respected General Kim Chong-il is a clairvoyant one of clearly seeing through what the enemy intends to do at all times and unfolding operations in a far-sighted way. It is a flexible stratagem of striking at weak points of the enemy with his mysterious and marvelous strategy and tactics according to the situation and circumstances and bringing victory on his own initiative. His grit is a matchless grit of not wavering under whatever thunderstorm but countering any large Army, and an all-mighty strength of forging ahead in any storm and stress. His spirit is one of certain victory, his magnanimity is an unfathomable one like the ocean into which all the rivers, big and small, empty, and his human love is a fiery one pulling at the heartstrings of the masses. General Kim Chong-il and our people are an integrated whole sharing the same destiny, linked by one blood, one breath and one ideology. Ours has become a people with a great purpose, strong faith and inexhaustible strength as they repose unquestioned trust in respected general Kim Chong-il and follow him. Voices of the people vowing to become rifles and bombs and defend him with their lives constitute the acme of the immovable faith, the highest reach of the minds of the people who believe in and follow respected General Kim Chong-il, like a gem stone monument of the times erected high.
