FR940524-2-00013 FR940524-2-00012 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [Project No. 1417; Project No. 1835] Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District Nebraska Public Power District; Public Meetings and Extending Time to Comment on Revised Draft EIS May 18, 1994. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued a Revised Draft Environmental Impact Statement (RDEIS) for the Kingsley Dam, Project No. 1417, and the Keystone Dam, Project No. 1835, (Platte River Projects) on April 1, 1994. These two hydropower projects are located on the Platte River in Nebraska. In response to a motion filed by the U.S. Department of the Interior (USDI), and supported by other parties to the relicensing proceedings, FERC staff will host a two-day technical workshop on the hydrological model used in the RDEIS. Additionally, FERC staff will conduct two public meetings in conjunction with the staff's preparation of the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS). The workshop and meetings are scheduled from June 8 through June 10, 1994. FERC is also extending the comment period on the RDEIS until July 25, 1994, which is 45 days after the completion of the two-day technical workshop. This extension is also in response to the motion filed by the USDI, and supported by other parties to the proceedings. Public Meetings Commission staff will conduct two public meetings for the Platte River Projects. The purpose of the meetings is to solicit public comment on alternatives to be addressed in the FEIS. All interested individuals, organizations, and agencies are invited to attend the meetings. The first public meeting for the Platte River Projects will be conducted on Wednesday evening, June 8, 1994, from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. in the auditorium of the North Platte High School at 1000 West 2nd Street in North Platte. The second public meeting will be conducted on June 9, 1994, from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. in the auditorium of the Clifford Hardin Center for Continuing Education on the East Campus of the University of Nebraska at 33rd and Holdredge, in Lincoln. Technical Workshop Commission staff will also host a two-day technical workshop for the Platte River projects. The workshop will be held in the Scottsbluff/Menden Room in the Clifford Hardin Center for Continuing Education on the East Campus of the University of Nebraska at 33rd and Holdredge in Lincoln. Interested persons are welcome to attend, but participation will be restricted to parties to the relicensing proceedings. The first day of the workshop will be on Thursday June 9, 1994, from 9:30 a.m. until 4 p.m. The purpose of the first day of the workshop is to address technical questions on the hydrological modeling used in the RDEIS. Thursday's session will provide an opportunity for reviewers to fully understand the hydrology analysis but will not serve as a forum to debate the merits of the RDEIS. To enhance the productivity of the first day of the workshop, the Commission requests that any questions on the model the parties would like addressed be sent to our office via facsimile. The cover sheet of the facsimile should be addressed to Frankie Green at (202) 219&hyph;0125 or Mark Killgore at (206) 451&hyph;4980. Copies of all questions received will be made available at the workshop. If we complete discussion on the parties' questions on the hydrological model, we will begin discussing items scheduled for Friday. The meeting will still adjourn at 4 p.m. The second day of the workshop will be on Friday June 10, 1994, from 7:30 a.m. until 12:30 p.m. Friday's session will allow parties to clarify technical matters discussed in the RDEIS.
