Costing 5.238 billion Macao patacas (680 million U.S. dollars), the artificial island project was signed on January 18, 1992 and its construction started on March 18 the same year. The 1.5 square kilometer island was built by erecting closed dams in the sea and then filling them with sand and stones. The runway of the Macao Airport will be built on the artificial island, which was designed to be 3,500 meters long and 60 meters wide, and to accommodate B747-400 passenger planes. It was learned that the infrastructural construction in the runway area will be started in may this year and is expected to be completed in March next year. The surface project of the runway is also expected to be finished ahead of schedule to ensure the test flight in next June. The Macao International Airport is located at the sea area to the east of Macao's Taipa and Coloane Islands. With an investment of 7.3 billion Macao patacas (940 million U.S. dollars), the project was first started in December 1989. The airport covers 192 hectares in area.
