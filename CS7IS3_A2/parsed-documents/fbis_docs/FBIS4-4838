The troops captured the guerrillas' 450 Division base in the troubled Bavel district of Battambang province in the operation last Thursday after an hour-long fight in which three government soldiers were wounded, AKP said. A guerrilla ammunition store, a vehicle and 20 huts were burnt by the troops, who also took four prisoners and seized an unspecified quantity of weapons, it said. The capture of the division base near Prey Kpos in Bavel district came as another blow to Khmer Rouge, on the heels of the loss of the ultra-nationalists' headquarters at Pailin on March 19. Western defence attaches said a Khmer Rouge division can consist of anything from just 100 to several hundred men. The guerrillas in the Bavel area staged recent hit-and-run attacks which government officers described as diversionary strikes aimed at forcing the army to pull back men from Pailin.
