Anatoliy Krasikov, President Boris Yeltsin's deputy spokesman, said the Russian Government welcomed the "fact that Russia's particular features will be taken into account." NATO ambassadors agreed in principle on Wednesday [18 May] to offer Russia a special relationship, which would reflect its big power status. The relationship will be somewhat different from the "Partnership for Peace" program, a new form of military cooperation between the 16-nation NATO and former Warsaw Pact countries. Russia had refused to sign the Partnership for Peace after NATO air forces attacked Serbian positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina last month. Krasikov hailed NATO's decision Wednesday "a right step," arguing that Moscow has never refused to join Partnership for Peace. Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Grigoriy Karasin said, "The reports coming from Brussels show the proposal is of great importance, and its tone sounds generally positive to us." The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) wants to build an informal relationship of intense contacts with Russia on issues like Bosnia, peacekeeping and nuclear arms without giving Moscow the right to consultation on security questions. NATO's decision came one week before Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev is to visit NATO headquarters in Brussels next Tuesday to outline Russia's views on "Partnership for Peace." Eighteen countries have so far signed the "Partnership for Peace," a program regarded by most of former Warsaw Pact nations as the first step towards full NATO membership.
