FR940207-2-00060 FR940207-2-00028 Basis for Rate Development_P&hyph;DP Firm Power Rate The provisional firm power P&hyph;DP rate was designed to reflect the power/transmission split as derived in the Apportionment of Cost Study and continues to maintain a 50/50 split between revenue from energy and capacity rates based on a 60-percent load factor. Step one of the provisional P&hyph;DP rates consists of a 5.79 mills/kWh energy rate and $2.54/kW/month capacity rate effective February 1, 1994. The necessary composite rate is 11.58 mills/kWh, which is an increase of 28 percent over the existing composite rate of 9.03 mills/kWh. Step two of the provisional P&hyph;DP rates consists of a 6.01 mills/kWh energy rate and $2.63/kW/month capacity rate effective October 1, 1995. The necessary composite rate is 12.01 mills/kWh, which is an increase of 33 percent over the existing composite rate of 9.03 mills/kWh. Transmission Service Rates The provisional firm transmission service P&hyph;DP rate was designed to reflect the power/transmission split as derived in the Apportionment of Cost Study. Step one of the provisional P&hyph;DP rates for firm transmission service is $10.40/kW/year ($.87/kW/month) and nonfirm transmission service is 1.98 mills/kWh. The step-one rate for firm transmission service for SLCA/IP is $5.20/kW/season ($.87/kW/month). A season for the firm transmission service rate for SLCA/IP is 6 months. Step two of the provisional P&hyph;DP rates for firm transmission service is $12.55/kW/year ($1.05/kW/month) and nonfirm transmission service is 2.39 mills/kWh. The step two rate for firm transmission service for SLCA/IP is $6.27/kW/season ($1.05/kW/month). Comments During the 143-day comment period, Western received 31 written comments. In addition, nine speakers commented during the September 11, 1992, public comment forum. During the reopening of the comment forum of an additional 70 days, Western received 19 written comments.
