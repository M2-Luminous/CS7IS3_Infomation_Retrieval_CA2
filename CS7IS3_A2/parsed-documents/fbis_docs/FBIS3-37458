This was explained today by Sergey Zotov, the leader of the Russian delegation. Zotov said that Russia has offered to pay $2 million a year for the use of the Skrunda site. Latvia, for its part, is demanding an astronomical sum -- $400 million. In turn, Latvian delegation head Martins Virsis said that $400 million a year is the figure mentioned by Latvia at the start of the talks, just as Russia named its sum. Virsis expressed the view that the site by its nature is not one that can be bargained for, but there is a possibility that a compromise could be reached during the talks. On the question of the number of military personnel servicing the Skrunda radar, Zotov explained that Russia has accommodated Latvia's wishes, and has agreed to reduce their number from 817, which was initially requested, to 599. Virsis explained that Russia has not officially agreed to such a number of service personnel. Virsis noted that in the event the proposal is made officially, the number of personnel would be considerably reduced, and obviously the number would be necessary so that the station could function according to the technological process envisaged. However, no agreement has yet been reached during the talks on the social provision for retired Russian military pensioners. Zotov stressed that Russia's agreement of a social nature is a part of the general agreement on the withdrawal of the army and the agreement on the Skrunda radar. Thereby the agreement on the withdrawal of the army cannot be signed separately. The talks will continue on Thursday.
