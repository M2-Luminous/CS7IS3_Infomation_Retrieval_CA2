FR940203-1-00061 FR940203-1-00013 In addition to its response to the accidents by extending regulatory authority to include customer-owned service lines, the Missouri Public Service Commission also required the operator to replace some 265,000 bare steel gas lines running from the main to the building wall, of which some 175,000 were fully or partly owned by the customer. The Kansas City Corporation Commission required the operator to perform periodic leakage surveys of all customer-owned service lines and to repair or replace all lines round to be leaking. Statutory Mandate Section 115(a) of the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992 (the Act, Pub. L. 102&hyph;508, October 24, 1992) amended the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (49 U.S.C. App. 1685) to require the Secretary of Transportation to_ *␣*␣* Issue regulations requiring operators of natural gas distribution pipelines which do not maintain customer-owned service lines up to building walls to advise their customers of the requirements for maintenance of those lines, any resources known to the operator that could aid customers in doing such maintenance, any information that the operator has concerning the operation and maintenance of its lines that could aid customers, and the potential hazards of not maintaining service lines. Anecdotal data available to RSPA indicates that some of the petroleum gas systems covered under §192.11 include customer-owned service lines where the material, design, construction, corrosion control, testing and maintenance is left to the discretion of people who may not be familiar with part 192 requirements for service lines. RSPA invites public comment on (1) Whether customer-owned service lines occur in petroleum gas systems subject to §192.11 and (2) If so, whether the petroleum gas systems have been properly installed and periodically maintained. Commenters are requested to support their responses with leak and incident data that includes information on personal injuries, deaths, property and environmental damages. AGA Petition The American Gas Association (AGA) has petitioned RSPA to issue immediately a proposed rule to establish the notification regulations mandated in section 115 of the Act (P&hyph;50, September 1, 1993). In its petition, AGA expresses concern that, lacking federal guidance, state and local authorities may move forward and adopt notification requirements that could make compliance with federal regulations difficult. AGA has requested RSPA to incorporate the following language to satisfy the notification requirements for operations of customer-owned service lines: (a) Each operator meeting the applicability requirements of paragraph (c) (of this section) shall provide notification to customers covering the maintenance of customer-owned lines. At minimum, this notification shall advise those customers:
