SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Request for Comments on the Rule Although this action is a final rule, which involves establishing additional controlled airspace extending upwards from 700 feet above the surface of the earth, and was not preceded by notice and public procedure, comments are invited on the rule. This rule will become effective on the date specified in the ``DATES '' section. However, after the review of any comments and, if the FAA finds that further changes are appropriate, it will initiate rulemaking proceedings to extend the effective date or to amend the regulation. Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful in evaluating the effects of the rule, and in determining whether additional rulemaking is required. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects of the rule which might suggest the need to modify the rule. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) establishes additional controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface of the earth deemed necessary by the FAA to contain aircraft within controlled airspace while executing an existing published SIAP at the Kingston-Ulster Airport, Kingston, NY. Additionally, the geographic position for Sky Park Airport, contained in the legal description for Class E airspace at Red Hook, NY, is being updated to reflect the actual location of this airport. Class E airspace designations for airspace extending from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth are published in paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9B, dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.
