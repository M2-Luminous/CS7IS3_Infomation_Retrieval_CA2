It is the goal of RO to preserve the Ruthenian language and culture. This is why its Coordinating Committee demands the introduction of a Ruthenian version of the ethnic broadcasts of Slovak Radio in Presov and the establishment of a Ruthenian language and culture department at the Philosophy College of P.J. Safarik University in Presov. The committee also requests that [Slovak] media refer to the Ruthenians as a specific ethnic group and not confuse them with Ukrainians. As far as the Museum of Ruthenian-Ukrainian Culture in Svidnik is concerned, the RO Coordinating Committee in the Slovak Republic suggests renaming it the State Museum of Ruthenian and Ukrainian Culture and proposes that its director be selected by means of an open competition. In addition, it advises that the museum should, preferably, also include a research department devoted to the documentation of Ruthenian culture.
