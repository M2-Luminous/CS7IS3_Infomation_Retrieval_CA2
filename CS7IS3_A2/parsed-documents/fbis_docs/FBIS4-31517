Nedzad Leko has the report. [Leko] After the talks, the reporters were first addressed by Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien. [Chretien] "The prime minister and I discussed the extremely complex situation. Everybody wants peace, but peace is hard to achieve. The prime minister explained all the difficulties on the road to peace: the history, the geography, the geopolitical situation; so this has been a very useful visit for me. Not only did I have the opportunity to meet the Canadian troops on their peace mission, but I also visited Sarajevo." [Leko] Asked by reporters about Canada's stance on the lifting of the arms embargo against the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, Jean Chretien said: [Chretien] "In our view, the lifting of the embargo would not lead to peace." [Leko] The reporters were interested in whether Canada would be ready to send additional troops, especially if France decided to withdraw. [Chretien] "We made no commitments regarding either their deployment or withdrawal. Of course, if a peace deal is concluded, other countries -- Canada as well, perhaps -- will send additional troops." [Leko] Prime Minister Silajdzic then commented on the contents of his talks with the Canadian prime minister. [Silajdzic] ``The first and basic divergence of views concerns the embargo issue. The prime minister believes that the lifting of the arms embargo would heighten the risk of the outbreak of war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, while we believe that the embargo is illegal [words indistinct] -- if an illness is treated with a certain medicine for two years and the results are disastrous, as they are, then the medicine should be changed. ``On the other hand, [words indistinct] to achieve peace. If we manage to achieve peace, there will be no problem. We are asking what happens if we do not achieve peace. Of course, the aggressor does not want peace and he is showing this perfectly clearly. ``Our question to the prime minister is what to do if we do not achieve peace. Will we again disperse, as we did after the London conference, and say no deal or will we point our finger at the culprit and define the measures to be taken by the international community in the event that the aggressor rejects the peace plan. "We believe that the supervision of our border with Serbia and Montenegro has come two years too late; if the international community had taken these measures two years ago, things would not be what they are today. It is still not too late for the international community to take serious measures for controlling the border with Serbia and Montenegro with the aim of stopping the aggression against our country."
