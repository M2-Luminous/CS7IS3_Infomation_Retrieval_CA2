At land delegates' meetings in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Lower Saxony, and Berlin over the weekend [23-24 April] the "cozying up to the Social Democrats" was sometimes loudly condemned. The Greens in Stuttgart announced that they will make their own election statement, in which they will distance themselves in some issues from the decisions made by the Mannheim federal congress. There, prominent party representatives, such as Ludger Volmer and Joschka Fischer, had persuaded the party to make a clear coalition statement in favor of the SPD. The grass roots in Lower Saxony are rebelling most strongly. In protest against the pragmatic course, the delegates of the land party congress in Wilhelmshaven elected Gila Altmann, a representative of the left wing, to place one on the ticket for the next Bundestag election. She was one of the harshest domestic policy critics of the red-green coalition in Hannover. [passage omitted] Daniel Cohn-Bendit, an "ultraleftist" at the national level, has even threatened with a party split. The reason: The pragmatists are pushing the left wing out of the party. The main addressee of the criticism is the "secret party chairman," Hesse Environment Minister Fischer, who wants to maneuver the Greens to the political center. On the weekend he said for the first time that for him a coalition with SPD and Free Democratic Party of Germany would be conceivable. Fischer is propagating "a feasible reform policy, with which 51 percent of the voters" can be reached. [passage omitted]
