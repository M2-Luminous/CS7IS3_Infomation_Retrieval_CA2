Sun Tongchuan, CPC Chongqing City Committee secretary, speaking at a session of the city committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference today, said that Chongqing did great work in stabilizing prices last year, revising the catalogue of price control, restructuring prices, and insuring the basic market stability of grains, edible oil, and vegetables. Presently, because of a comparatively conspicuous contradiction between price-curbing, price readjustment, and the expansion in investment scope, Chongqing's retail price index rose by 20.8 and 28 percent in the first two months of the year respectively, and the situation was stern. Sun Tongchuan said to pursue the socialist market economy does not mean that the government rejects price control. The government should exercise control in such areas as studying and formulating policies, organizing and insuring the supply of important consumer goods, setting up a price regulating fund, and augmenting supervision and control over market prices. Chongqing has already decided to temporarily hold back the price adjustments scheduled for April, and at the same time, a great price check will be undertaken in order to resolutely halt arbitrary price rises and charges. The government will strictly encourage the practice of attaching explicit price tags to various consumer goods and making public service charges. In addition, Chongqing is to accelerate the completion and perfection of the market price mechanism, set up, complete, and perfect necessary regulating and monitoring systems to keep Chongqing's price rises to a minimum, and work hard to maintain Chongqing's economic and social stability.
