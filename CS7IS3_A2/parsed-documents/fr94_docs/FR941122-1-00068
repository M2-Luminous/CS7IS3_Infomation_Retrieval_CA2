FR941122-1-00068 FR941122-1-00016 On December 3, 1991, the Service received a petition from Briggs to list the Ross micro-blind harvestman ( Microcina sp.) as an endangered species. The letter, dated November 27, 1991, was clearly identified as a petition and contained the name, signature, institutional affiliation, and address of the petitioner. The petition reported the Ross micro-blind harvestman is known only from specimens collected in February 1991 on a portion of Bald Hill in Ross, Marin County, California. The petitioner, a blind harvestmen specialist, stated that this is a valid species based on morphological characters. This undescribed species was collected under sandstone rocks in a grassland-oak and bay woodland ecotone directly east of the summit of Bald Hill at an elevation of 880 feet. The petitioner cited a proposed residential development as the threat to the Ross micro-blind harvestman. A residential development had been proposed for this site and a final environmental impact report was certified by the Ross Planning Commission (Gary Broad, Ross Planning Department, pers. comm., 1993). However, the project was denied by the City Council and court challenges by the project proponent were unsuccessful. Projects may be proposed for this location in the future but none have been made to date. As a result, the Service considers such threats to the Ross micro-blind harvestman to be of low magnitude and non-imminent. Because the petition did not present information on whether the Ross micro-blind harvestman may be declining or located elsewhere, additional adequate surveys are needed to assess its distribution and population status. Beyond the information described above, the petitioner presented few data on the status of the animal. Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioner did not present substantial information that the requested action may be warranted. On December 11, 1992, the Service received a petition from Ubick to list Ubick's gnaphosid spider ( Talanites ubicki ) as a threatened or endangered species. The letter, dated November 29, 1992, was clearly identified as a petition and contained the name, signature, institutional affiliation, address, and telephone number of the petitioner. The petition stated that Ubick's gnaphosid spider is only known from a single locality on the southern slope of Burdell Mountain in Novato, Marin County, California (Platnick and Ovtsharenko 1991). The habitat at the site consists of serpentine grassland. Gnaphosids are small, hunting spiders that construct a tubular retreat under stones and in debris and hunt at night from this location (Borror et al. 1976; Jones 1983). The petitioner cited urban development as the threat to this species and stated that part of the locality inhabited by Ubick's gnaphosid spider has been destroyed by a road that was constructed a few years ago. The proposed project, the Buck Center for Research on Aging, includes the designation of a 300-acre conservation area and a 188-acre development area. Proposed activities include a research center, a residential area, parking lots, and roadways. The information provided by the petitioner indicates that the remaining portions of the serpentine rock outcrops inhabited by Ubick's gnaphosid spider are located within the conservation area. The petition from Ubick did not indicate if adequate surveys had been conducted at other similar habitats in the area. Beyond the information described above, the petitioner presented few data on the status of the animal. Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioner did not present substantial information that the requested action may be warranted. Ms. Katrin Snow of the Xerces Society in Portland, Oregon, petitioned the Service to list Opler's longhorn moth as an endangered species in a letter dated December 19, 1990, which was received on January 14, 1991. The letter, dated December 19, 1990, was clearly identified as a petition and contained the name, signature, institutional affiliation, address, and telephone number of the petitioner. Opler's longhorn moth was placed in category 2 on November 21, 1991 (56 FR 58804).
