Manfred Woerner, secretary-general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, said a single U.S. FA-18A jet fighter carried out the strike. "We have only first pilot reports, which say that three tanks seem to have been destroyed but that is not confirmed," he said in a statement. The attack occurred at 1224 GMT. On Sunday [10 April] two U.S. F-16 aircraft dropped five bombs on a Serb artillery position outside Gorazde, a Moslem enclave being besieged by Serb forces which is under United Nations protection as an officially-designated safe area. The operation was officially launched in support of UN personnel at Goradze. Bosnian Serbs fired more shells on the town on Monday, reportedly injuring 200 people at a refugee centre. Woerner said: "Serbs had resumed shelling from the south and UN personnel trapped in the area were in some danger." On Sunday, after the first strike, U.S. President Bill Clinton warned that U.S. warplanes would strike again in Bosnia if UN authorities asked for military support. Sunday's attack was the first by NATO warplanes on Serb ground positions since the civil war in Bosnia began two years ago.
