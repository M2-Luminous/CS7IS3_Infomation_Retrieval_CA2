Mr. Mugabe ordered the release of an official in the secret Central Intelligence Organization, (Elias Khenagoni), and the provincial youth leader of the ruling ZANU (PF) [Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front] party, (Khezito Tshibambu). The two were last year sentenced to seven years in prison for shooting (Patrick Khumbayi), who was contesting a parliamentary seat against the vice-president Simon Muzenda in the 1990 election. They were pardoned hours after their appeal against their conviction was thrown out by the country's supreme court.
