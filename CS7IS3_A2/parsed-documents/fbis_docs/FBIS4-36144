The preparations for convening this council would not have succeeded had its [draft] resolution highlighted both [Yemeni] unity and the need for all parties to commit themselves to it. National unity in any Arab country means stability, impregnability, dignity, and the possibility of construction. Moreover, pan-Arab unity means a radical solution to the political, economic, social, and even demographic impasse now experienced by the Arab countries. It has never been an objective of the UN Security Council to achieve such noble Arab goals. When addressing our national and pan-Arab issues, the UN Security Council used to stand alongside the parties opposed to the [Arab] nation and its future. Even when compelled to flatter us in some resolution, the Security Council used diplomatic language that meant nothing on the ground and was devoid of any applicable mechanisms. Successive Security Council resolutions on the Palestine question are the best examples of resolutions issued only to be entered in the archives. Meanwhile, resolutions serving the interests of the big powers are immediately implemented. AL-ASWAQ adds: The formula used in Security Council Resolution [No. 924 on Yemen] will achieve only one objective, namely, to deepen the secession and fragmentation, perpetuate the [Yemeni] war, and expand its scope from Aden to Sanaa. As we do not rule out the presence of the desire and interest by one or more international party to perpetuate and expand the Yemeni war, we will continue to find it strange that some Arab positions advertently or inadvertently foster the continuation of war and encourage the secession. The fire raging in Yemen is close to every Arab house, although some people may think it will not expand.
