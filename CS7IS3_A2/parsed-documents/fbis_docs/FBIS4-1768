Wang Qun, Wu Liji, Qian Fenyong, and Wuyunqimuge attended the tea party. On behalf of the regional party committee, the regional people's congress, and the regional government, Comrade Wang Qun first extended greetings and thanks to various democratic party and nonparty personages who contributed to the development of various undertakings in the region during the past year. Wang Qun said: During the past year, with the concerted efforts and hard work of all people, comprehensive progress was made in the region's social and economic development, the people's living standards improved, and the people of various nationalities lived a secure and happy life. All these helped to lay a foundation for a sustained, rapid, and sound future economic development in the region and to usher in a crucial year for expanding the reform strength and accelerating economic development. Wang Qun said: During the crucial year of reform and development, party and government departments at all levels and all trades and professions should make their work serve the overall situation of "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, expanding opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability." We should soberly and objectively understand the problems emerged in the process of development, advance despite of difficulties, work hard to make the region strong, accelerate the building of the socialist market economic structure, properly handle the relations of reform, development, and stability, expand the reform strength, carry out a package reform with breakthroughs in key areas, and promote a sustained, rapid, and sound economic development in the autonomous region. In referring to the major work tasks of the region during this year, Wang Qun pointed out: This year Inner Mongolia must break through "five barriers" in its reform and achieve breakthrough progress in five aspects. First, we must make a new breakthrough in deepening reform in the rural and pastoral areas and establish and improve the socialized comprehensive service system in the rural and pastoral areas. It is essential to orient the rural economy to the market economic structure, effect a transition from small-scale farming by many individual owners into large-scale farming and the market economy, and establish and develop various service systems that link with the peasant households, enterprises, and the market. Cadres at all levels should create conditions for peasants and herdsmen to march toward the market in line with market demands and actively guide and organize them enter the market. It is necessary to clearly define Inner Mongolia's advantages in developing agriculture and animal husbandry, and invigorate its economic development with local resources. We should take the market as our guide, regard economic efficiency as the central task and increase in the income of peasants and herdsmen as the objective, integrate foreign trade with industry and agriculture (animal husbandry) and crop cultivation with aquaculture and the processing industry, actively readjust the production set-up, develop "high-yield, fine-quality, and highly efficient" farming and animal husbandry, give play to the advantages of scale, and achieve a secure place in the market. It is necessary to actively develop township enterprises, develop things that are beneficial to economic development, and give priority to developing the "dragon-type" economy" with the processing of farm products and animal by-products as the mainstay. Second, we should achieve new breakthroughs in reforming the industrial, commercial, grain, and foreign trade enterprises. Inner Mongolia Region and various leagues and cities should attend to reform of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises and of major profit and tax delivering households and concentrate energy on helping small, poor, and deficit-incuring enterprises change their operational mechanism. It is necessary to accelerate the reform strength and reform progress of enterprises by sustaining the advanced and helping the backward so as to encourage the vast majority to move along. The key to helping state-owned, large and medium-sized enterprises change operational mechanisms lies in strengthening leadership. All levels of party and government leaders as well as enterprise leaders should further enhance spirit, advance in a pioneering spirit, never delay their work or adopt an attitude of relying on help from the higher level, and seek development in the course of development. Third, we should make new breakthroughs in reform of the financial and taxation system. We must enhance understanding, seek unity in action, and attend to reform in line with the financial and taxation reform plans issued by the state. Reform of the financial and taxation system is aimed at increasing income and solving financial problems. Financial and tax departments should exert efforts to strengthen financial and tax workers and raise their overall quality in line with the demand of developing the socialist market economy, change the old practice of collecting taxes in the office, and collect all taxes that should be collected. Tax departments, in addition to collecting more taxes, should also pay attention to actively supporting economic development and cultivating more sources of taxation. Fourth, we should make new breakthroughs in reform of the banking, investment, and price systems. To implement the socialist market economy, we must study the financial issue and give play to the role of banking departments as a lever in economic development. While actively introducing foreign capital, we should also exert efforts to invigorate our existing funds. It is necessary to manage prices to guarantee market stability and pay special attention to managing the prices of daily necessities that are closely related to people's living. Fifth, we should make new breakthroughs in organizational reform. We should accelerate organizational reform to meet the demands of economic reform as quickly as possible. We should pay simultaneous attention to streamlining the upper layer, changing their functions, and replenishing the forefront, select cadres and workers from party and government organs, institutions, and units who are young and have a good knowledge of management and operation to the forefront of production and construction to help in work or to hold a post in an effort to promote economic development in all localities and to put human resources to best use. Comrade Wu Liji also addressed the tea party. Persons from various democratic parties and the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and nonparty personages offered positive and constructive ideas and suggestions for Inner Mongolia's social and economic development at the tea party. Also attending the tea party were Cui Weilin, Zhang Zuocai, Wang Chongren, Chen Jie, Lan Qianfu, Chen Youzun, and Xu Bainian.
