The energy producers are inclined to consider the situation that has come about as catastrophic. VLADIVOSTOK reported that since 25 December the miners of Eastern Siberia and Southern Yakutia have stopped unloading coal at the Maritime Kray electric power station. The Maritime Kray energy industry is presently being supplied only by enterprises of the Primorskugol association, which are in no condition to eliminate the fuel shortage. The four large state regional electric power stations and thermal electric power facilities of Maritime Kray require 50,000 tonnes of coal daily, while local miners are delivering just 20,000 tonnes. Yesterday aggregate coal reserves on hand at the electric power stations amounted to 720,000 tonnes. This supply is diminishing daily by 30,000 tonnes. Thus, unless coal deliveries from outside Maritime Kray are resumed and measures taken to conserve fuel, all local electric power stations will shut down in 24 days. Yevgeniy Nazdratenko acknowledged in his decree that the situation regarding supply of electric power in the kray was critical. The reason for the situation that has unfolded lies in Dalenergo's lack of money to purchase coal outside Maritime Kray. This financial shortage, in turn, arose because local consumers are simply not paying for their use of thermal and electric energy. In order to surmount the fuel crisis, the Maritime Kray energy industry must pay 32 billion rubles [R] for coal and fuel oil--this is the approximate amount of Dalenergo's indebtedness. In order to discipline the debtors, who account for just about all the industry of the kray, and reduce the fuel shortage at the same time, beginning 8 January heat deliveries to the industrial enterprises have been curtailed 50 percent--once again, based on the governor's decree. Yevgeniy Nazdratenko has tasked Vladivostok head of administration Viktor Cherepkov with eliminating almost R3 billion of the indebtedness of the municipal enterprise for heating systems prior to 18 January. Today at the directive of the governor, Dalenergo specialists are drawing up an electric power shut-down timetable, indicating the substations, lines, and times of shut-down. Dalenergo chief engineer Vladimir Patsev stated, however, that it would not be in the very near future that residential lights will be turned off--not during the present freezing weather ("not in January or February"), but sooner or later it will be necessary to do so. And whereas in Vladivostok the hope still exists of getting through the cold period without damage, in Dalnegorsk, for example, according to Dalenergo information, several residential buildings have frozen through due to the shortage of fuel oil in the boiler facilities, and residents are being saved only with the help of electric heaters. The R32 billion financial problem of the energy industry--resulting in the emergency situation regarding fuel supply for Maritime Kray--can be resolved, in the view of Dalenergo specialists, only through the affording of grants to the production association, insofar as "Dalenergo is in no position to obtain credits--no one will extend them credit." Yesterday it was planned to hold a session of the Emergency Situations Commission in the kray administration building, chaired by Vice Governor Igor Lebedinets. Two questions were on the agenda: the state of the fuel and energy complex of the kray (Yuriy Basharov, general director of Dalenergo, delivering the report); and the life sustenance capability of the city of Vladivostok (report delivered by Viktor Cherepkov, head of the city administration). Please check tomorrow's newspaper to read about the measures adopted by the kray Emergency Situations Commission.
