This, essentially, was the burden of a communique Tuesday from the Ministry of Economic Affairs saying that arrival of the foreign potatoes would facilitate a reduction in current prices for this truck-garden product so popular with Algerians. Discussing the intolerable increase in the price of potatoes--in recent days it has stood at about 30 Algerian dinars per kilogram--the ministry communique noted that retail prices charged by fruit and vegetable merchants are "not subject to controls." According to the ministry communique, "only recourse to imports could influence the market situation in terms of normalizing prices." Self-Sufficiency? Well, if resorting to potato imports was the only solution to the above-noted overheating, why did they wait three months to do it? Especially since the decision was actually made on 1 August. Even back then, potatoes were selling for 20 dinars per kilogram, and the need to flood the market to influence prices was being felt. Looming behind all these questions linked to the delay in provisioning and normalizing markets is the problem of self-sufficiency: Is Algeria actually capable of implementing a program of potato cultivation that would meet demand? Officials have talked ceaselessly in the last two agricultural seasons of big projects designed to end importation of potatoes for consumption, above all imports of seed potatoes. Looking to external markets for food is costing our country millions of dollars. This is why the Ministry of Agriculture has made intensified cultivation of certain strategic crops (seed potatoes, industrial tomatoes, certain grains, etc.) a categorical priority. In potatoes, for example, the stated goal was a permanent end to imports. However, after awhile the ministry indicated that "the road was still long before we reach real agricultural take-off," despite the "incentives to production" approved for strategic crops. Eating Seed! Unlike last year, when Algeria did not resort to potato imports, we now find ourselves unable to do without them. The skyrocketing prices, caused in large part by speculation during the interval between successive crop seasons, could not have been tolerated any longer. Household budgets were being hit too hard. But the soaring prices for this tuber, which became a popular dish because people of modest means could always afford it, cannot hide the dangerous phenomenon that has become more pronounced during this period of tension. Seed potatoes, normally used to meet growers' needs for the current agricultural season, have been diverted to consumption. In the last three weeks, and in more than one case, the potatoes that ordinary citizens were buying in fruit and vegetable markets for 30 dinars a kilogram were actually seed potatoes, for which the officially decreed price is 10.5 dinars. `Scandalized' Reports from CASSAP [agricultural supply coopertive] in Cheraga, COPSEM in Staoueli, and COPASSAD [expansions not given] in Zeralda--three institutions responsible for provisioning farmers and especially for meeting seed requirements--show that demand for seed potatoes has been high for some time. The COPSEM official says that unlike last year, when his cooperative was left with 3,000 tons of unsold seed potatoes, this year--in the early vegetable program alone--his organization has already delivered 900 tons more than projected, without even meeting all the demand. Our interlocutors, while not pointing the finger of blame at anyone in particular, declared themselves scandalized by the idea of seed potatoes finding their way into the market stalls. We would remind readers that our country requires about 125,000 to 130,000 tons of seed potatoes per year. In the last two seasons, these needs were met by Algerian produce. This saved the country valuable foreign exchange. But if there is not enough seed to meet the needs of the agricultural season now under way because it has been marketed to households, potato production may decline as a result of market pressures over the next few months. The early vegetables program is already somewhat behind schedule.
