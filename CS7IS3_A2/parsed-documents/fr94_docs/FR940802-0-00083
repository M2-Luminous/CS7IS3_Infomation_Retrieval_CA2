FR940802-0-00083 FR940802-0-00017 50 CFR Part 675 [Docket No. 931100&hyph;4043; I.D. 072794C] Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is closing the directed fishery for Atka mackerel in the Central Aleutian District (CAD) of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the Atka mackerel total allowable catch (TAC) in the CAD. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), July 28, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, 907&hyph;586-7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. In accordance with ยง675.20(a)(7)(ii), the Atka mackerel TAC for the CAD was established by the final 1994 initial specifications of groundfish (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994) as 37,846 metric tons (mt). The directed fishery for Atka mackerel was closed on June 7, 1994 (59 FR 29964, June 10, 1994). That prohibition was rescinded on July 4, 1994 (59FR 33920, July 1, 1994), upon determination that the 1994 TAC for Atka mackerel in the CAD had not been reached. The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), has determined, in accordance with ยง675.20(a)(8), that the Atka mackerel TAC in the CAD soon will be reached. Therefore, the Regional Director has established a directed fishing allowance of 37,346 mt with consideration that 500 mt will be taken as incidental catch in directed fishing for other species in the CAD. The Regional Director has determined that the directed fishing allowance has been reached. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Atka mackerel in the CAD, effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., July 28, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at ยง675.20(h). Classification This action is taken under ยง675.20 and is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: July 27, 1994. Joe P. Clem, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
