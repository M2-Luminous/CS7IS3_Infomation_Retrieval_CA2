There is room for negotiations on whether or not Japan must take that step, Hata said. The agriculture, forestry and fisheries minister was addressing the Japan National Press Club. The draft farm trade accord proposed by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) allows Tokyo to resume discussion on the issue before it enters the seventh year, he said. In December, Tokyo accepted without modification the GATT accord, which calls for Japan to open 4 percent to 8 percent of its domestic rice market as the minimum access for imports in exchange for a six-year moratorium for replacing all import restrictions with tariffs. The proposal requires Japan to make additional concessions in order for the special treatment to be extended beyond the sixth year. Specific commitments or conditions for extending the moratorium beyond the sixth year are also negotiable later, Hata said. Hata said he will not resign as farm minister over Japan's accepting the opening of its rice market. He said he will devote himself for the time being to laying the groundwork for his successor to effectively handle possible problems after the rice market opening. "That's the way I will take the responsibility," he said. Hata forecast about one-third of the nation's three million rice farmers will leave farming in 10 years, affected by the opening of the rice market. Hata proposed using imported rice under the minimum access clause mainly for four areas -- stockpiling for emergency rice for shortages, using it in processed foods such as rice crackers, experiments for development of new rice products, and supplying it to foreign countries as part of economic assistance. He said it has yet to be decided whether or not imported rice will be used as staple food. Ha said imported rice, if consumed as staple food, would "hopefully" be blended with Japanese rice. The amount of domestically produced rice to be provided for four months from March, for example, is only 30 percent of total supply capacity due to the poor harvest last year, Hata said, adding that supplies of domestic rice would run short quickly unless it was blended with foreign rice.
