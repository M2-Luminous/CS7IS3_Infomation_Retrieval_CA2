Semenyuk, Ukraine's minister of power engineering and electrification, has stated that since January 1994 the industry has become unprofitable: The debit balance constitutes 2.3 trillion karbovantsi [K] and the overall debt about K6 trillion. Power engineers have no money to pay for the energy sources and for the electricity supplied by nuclear power stations. For that reason, incidentally, four power units, producing millions [of kilowatts] will be closed down. Every day, between 40 and 45 power units at thermal electric power stations are standing idle. The inability to pay has paralyzed the operation of about 2,000 enterprises in this sector. The minister appealed to heads of oblast state administrations and to heads of councils of people's deputies with a request to provide maximum assistance to local power engineering enterprises. The enterprises and organizations must both repay debts for the electricity consumed and strictly adhere to the rules of electricity consumption.
