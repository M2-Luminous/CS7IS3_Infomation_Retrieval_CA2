The controversial Greek move will be discussed by EC foreign ministers at their meeting Monday, the European Commission spokesman said. Experts at the executive EC Commission are to study the impact of the Greek decision, which could breach Community laws on free trade with a third state. Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes, attending a meeting of the EC "troika" of foreign ministers of past, present and future presidency incumbents in Athens, said the blockade was "naturally in contradiction" with the Maastricht Treaty on European Union. Greek European Affairs Minister Theodoros Pangalos swiftly rejected the move, saying his government's decision "conformed to European law." German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, also attending, earlier demanded that Greece immediately lift its trade embargo of its land-locked neighbour, and issued a sharp attack on Athens' "extraordinary" decision.
