The year 1994 is expected to be the most dismal year for Romanian agriculture which continues to suffer a real tragedy. The situation is alarming in the vegetable sector. According to statistical data, as of 21 March, 469,000 hectares still had to be plowed--remember, this is plowing for spring planting!. Only 415,000 hectares had been sown -- only 7 percent of the planned area. The situation of the sugarbeets is the most serious one: Only 16,000 hectares, 6 percent of the planned area, have been sown. Of course, some plowing and sowing has been done since 21 March so the present figure is 10 percent. But the situation in agriculture gets worse with each passing day. This is all the more serious since no one, neither the government nor the Ministry of Agriculture, wants to take this year's special weather conditions into consideration. We are referring, in particular, to the drought which has persisted for more than 100 days throughout the country, which has reduced the water reserves in the soil to zero. It is a very unusual situation which required immediate measures to ensure that the irrigation system would begin operating a month earlier than in previous years. According to our information, if it does not rain more regularly, in the plains, for at least two weeks, the grains, the wheat and the barley will be completely lost and will be dried up. Last year 2 million hectares of crops were lost because of lack of water. This year, if there is no intervention at the twelfth hour to provide irrigation, it will be even worse. Faced with this state of affairs, the ministers of agriculture plead lack of money but, as spokesmen of the government, they continue to promise that they will provide the necessary funds for irrigation. When? No one knows, as long as the 1994 budget has not been approved yet. At present, only 10 billion lei have been allocated of the 25 billion lei which are absolutely necessary for putting into operation the irrigation systems promised for the first quarter. In television broadcasts, the ministers of agriculture say that this year's drought took them by surprise. However, we do not know the official viewpoint of the government or its intentions. It would be normal, at least, for the government to openly admit: "We do not have any money for irrigation, we are hiring rainmakers." Meanwhile, it is highly likely that Romania will import not only wheat and sugar this year, like it has been doing up to now, but also the entire range of agricultural products, imports which will fatten up the ticks which are on the backs of the governing officials and ruin Romanian agriculture.
