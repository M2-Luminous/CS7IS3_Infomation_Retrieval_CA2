During the talks, Poland tried to find ways of increasing its exports, particularly capital goods, to Thailand to help reduce its trade deficit with Thailand. The Thai side informed Poland that Thailand needs capital goods to develop its infrastructure. However, Poland still lacks experience in penetrating the Thai market and does not have good access to market information on the private sector. The Thai side is willing to help Poland in this. The two sides agreed to increase their bilateral trade volume by setting up information centers. The two sides also discussed the possibility of bartering capital goods. The Thai side stressed that barter trade may be carried out for some products on a reciprocal basis. Both sides agreed to hold a meeting of the joint trade commission this year. The Thai side also explained to Poland about the reduction of its defense budget and its need for military hardware. In this regard, Poland might be able to sell its products to Thailand for military training and agricultural purposes. The two sides agreed to enter joint ventures to produce goods for export to third countries. In particular, there are possibilities for setting up an aircraft factory in Thailand for exports to Asian countries and for joint fishing and marine product processing ventures. In addition, Poland may participate in projects to build a communications network linking Indochinese countries, the quadrangle economic development project, and the south growth triangle project. Thailand is willing to support Poland's participation in economic and infrastructure development projects in the country because Thailand still needs more new roads and an airport.
