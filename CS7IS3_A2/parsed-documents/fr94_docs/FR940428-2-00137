FR940428-2-00137 FR940428-2-00064 The Security Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS will entitle the owner at maturity to receive an amount based upon the percentage change between the ``Original Portfolio Value'' and the ``Ending Average Portfolio Value,'' subject to a minimum repayment amount. The ``Original Portfolio Value'' is the value of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio on the date on which the issuer prices the Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS issue for the initial offering to the public. The ``Ending Average Portfolio Value'' is the average of the values of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio at the end of the five calendar quarters preceding the expiration of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS on December 31, 1999. 5 The Ending Average Portfolio Value will be used in calculating the amount owners will receive upon maturity. 6 5 Specifically, the Ending Average Portfolio Value will equal the average of the quarterly values of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio beginning in the calendar quarter ending December 31, 1998. The quarterly value for each of the first four of the final five calendar quarters shall be the Restructuring Companies Portfolio value on the last scheduled Exchange trading day on which there is no market disruption event. The quarterly value for the final calendar quarter shall be the Restructuring Companies Portfolio Value on the seventh scheduled Exchange trading day preceding maturity of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS unless there is a market disruption event in which case the sixth trading day preceding maturity shall be used. 6 The Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS will entitle a holder at maturity to receive for each $10 principal amount of MITTS an amount equal to the Ending Average Portfolio Value of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio divided by 10, but in any event no less than $9 per each $10 principal amount of Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS. If the market value of the portfolio has declined, the owner will receive not less than a specified percentage of the principal amount of the security. (For instance, if the market value of the portfolio used to calculate the amount payable at maturity has declined more than 10%, the owners of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS will receive 90% of the principal amount of the securities.) The payment at maturity is based on changes in the value of the portfolio, but does not reflect the payment of dividends on the securities that comprise the portfolio. As with other MITTS, Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS may not be redeemed prior to maturity and are not callable by the issuer. Owners may sell the security on the Exchange. The Exchange anticipates that the trading value of the security in the secondary market will depend in large part on the value of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio and also on other factors, including the level of interest rates, the volatility of the value of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio, the time remaining to maturity, dividend rates, and the creditworthiness of the issuer. The Exchange will only list for trading Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS issues that have at least one million outstanding securities, at least 400 owners, a minimum life of one year and at least a $4 million market value, and that otherwise comply with the Exchange's initial listing criteria. In addition, the Exchange will monitor each issue to verify that it complies with the Exchange's continued listing criteria. 7 7 See Section 703.19 of the Manual. Merrill Lynch will deposit registered securities representing Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS with its depository, the Depository Trust Company (``DTC''), so as to permit book-entry settlement of transactions by participants in DTC. The Portfolio The Restructuring Companies Portfolio consists of the common stock of 17 highly capitalized ``restructuring companies.'' Restructuring companies are companies that are generally perceived to have recently experienced declines in earnings as compared to historical levels and/or other adverse developments which have required some form of restructuring by such companies. Such restructuring may include reducing the company's work force, writing off obsolete or unused plant and equipment, retiring debt, and investing in more efficient means of production.
