FR940228-2-00014 FR940228-2-00002 Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of these administrative reviews, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) the cash deposit rates for the reviewed companies will be those rates established in the final results of these reviews; (2) for previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published for the most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, a prior review, or the original LTFV investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and (4) the cash deposit rate for all other manufacturers or exporters will continue to be the ``all others'' rate made effective by the final results of the most recent administrative reviews of the orders (see Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews and Revocation in Part of an Antidumping Duty Order, 58 FR 39729, July 26, 1993). As noted in those previous final results, these rates are the ``all others'' rates from the relevant LTFV investigations. These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative reviews. This notice also serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. These administrative reviews and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1) and 19 C.F.R. 353.22(c)(5)). Dated: February 18, 1994. Joseph A. Spetrini, Acting Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;4505 Filed 2&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P
