Aizpeolea and Anabel Diez report: "Government Will Take Aznar Into Account To Make New `Turnabout in Autonomy'"] [Text] Madrid -- The government intends to take the People's Party and its leader, Jose Maria Aznar, into account in order to carry through the turnabout in autonomy in the fast-track autonomous communities -- the Basque Country, Catalonia, Galicia, and Andalusia. The government believes that although the People's Party is in power in only one of those four communities -- Galicia -- an agreement with the leading opposition party is absolutely necessary because the new impetus to autonomy affects the state's territorial configuration. Specifically, the government is contemplating transferring exclusive state powers to the autonomous communities by the delegation procedure envisaged in Article 150, paragraph 2 of the Constitution. These would include the administration of social security and the National Employment Institute (INEM). In fact, the government has already taken the People's Party into account in all the steps which it has taken to configure Spain territorially since in February 1992 Felipe Gonzalez and Jose Maria Aznar signed the autonomy pacts in order to raise the slow-track autonomous communities' ceiling of powers. Recently, the two parties have also agreed on the setting up of a autonomous communities general committee in the Senate. Surprise Generalitat [Catalan autonomous community] premier Jordi Pujol's proposal of a pact with the throne is viewed with some surprise by the central government, but excessive importance is notattached to it. "It is one of so many drafts which Jordi Pujol could put forward. At the moment of truth, he will undertake a realistic negotiation of new powers, as has happened on other occasions," government sources state. To the same effect, the government's reaction is not to back down from its pledge to carry through the turnabout in autonomy, despite the proposal put forward by Pujol. "The government has an election pledge to give the fast-track autonomous communities new powers, and it will fulfill it," the sources consulted add. However, the same sources deem the negotiating process with the Basque government a good deal more complicated that that with the Catalan Generalitat. In their opinion, the Basque Nationalist Party is immersed in a preliminary election campaign for the autonomous community elections in the fall, and this will make it very difficult to conduct a rational negotiating process. However, the situation in Catalonia is very different. "Jordi Pujol wishes to wrap the turnabout in autonomy in a spectacular format," according to the sources consulted. Officially, the government maintains that it will give no official opinion on the Generalitat's document until it receives it, as Miguel Gil, the government spokesperson's secretary general, stated yesterday, adding that for the present there is no date for the next meeting between Gonzalez and Pujol.
