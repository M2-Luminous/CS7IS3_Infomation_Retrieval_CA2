Eurodrone, a joint subsidiary of Matra Defense (France) and Systemtechnik Nord (Germany), received an order from the French and German governments in the amount of Fr450 million for the second increment involved in the development of the new surveillance system using Brevel drones. Designed to meet the operational requirements of the French and German armed forces, Brevel has been in the works since October 1992 as part of a program spread out over six years based on an overall development contract of Fr1.4 billion (DM400 million). According to Eurodrone, the development program's first year made it possible to install all the facilities needed for program implementation through continuous cooperation fostered for many long years between the two countries in the armament field; here, Matra Defense is also cooperating with Deutsche Aerospace in building the new Apache cruise missile which, among other things, is earmarked for the Tornado aircraft of the German Air Force (cf., A&C, No. 1451). STN [Systemtechnik Nord] and Matra, for their part, already finished "several technically very ambitious subassemblies" (but not yet finalized) for the drone and they began testing these first elements of the Brevel. This, however, is but the beginning of the program which will thus basically run until 1998. As we recall, Brevel is an observation system based on small (pilotless) drones equipped with an infrared camera that permits both day-time and night-time observation of the overflight zone whose image can be transmitted in real time (via "data link") to the image receiving and processing station. This station furthermore controls small furtive drones that can fly for several hours at a speed of 150 km/hr and reach an operational altitude of about 2,000 m. Eurodrone also emphasized that "the current political situation in Europe calls for equipment to be used in crisis control, especially surveillance systems, in order to supply the civilian and military authorities with the kind of information that is indispensable for decision-making." The French-German firm thinks that "Brevel is best suited for accomplishing this mission by virtue of its discretion and its resistance to any form of jamming and due to the fact that it is remote-controlled." The usefulness of drones, as a matter of fact, has been constantly demonstrated these past years, both in combat and during times of crisis or civil war. Following the demonstrations made by the American drones during the Gulf War, the usefulness of these "pilotless aircraft" has been confirmed in Bosnia-Herzegovina, when the United Nations forces used the small Fox drones made by the French company CAC Systeme (cf., A&C, No. 1450).
