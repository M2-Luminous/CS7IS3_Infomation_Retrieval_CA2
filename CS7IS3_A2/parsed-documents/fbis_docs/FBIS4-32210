Do you accept the possibility that a faction could evolve sometime in the future? Would you perceive it as a threat to the party's integrity? [Klaus] To this day, I have really heard nothing about this; I have only read about it in LIDOVE NOVINY. Neither myself nor the ODS leadership have yet come across another member of this so-called faction. I also do not know how to interpret the word faction in this context. The fact that various people in the same political party have different views on the privatization of CKD [engineering plant], on the privatization of Homolka [Prague hospital], or on the size of the higher self-administration units is simply logical, and I think that it would be unnatural if this were not the case. Should the consequence of this be that a political party will become divided? It does not seem to me that this would lie ahead of us. Let us define the word faction. Is this, perhaps, a small group of people that is concerned more about restitution in agriculture than any other small group? The fact that this small group meets more often and has a more trenchant point of view on this issue than the rest of the ODS is absolutely logical. The word faction seems to me to be unnecessarily strong and has a certain cautionary tinge for me. If we are talking about groups of people with a different emphasis on different things, then this certainly is not a faction. We have always had strong agricultural and ecological groups and a group dealing with railroad transportation within the ODS. I would consider this to be natural and normal. [Martinkova] The statistics for the first four months of this year point to a slight decline in industrial output. The result should be rising unemployment. It, however, is falling. How do you explain these two contradictory trends? [Klaus] How can these two contradictory figures be made compatible by means of an explanation? This is just what I have been talking about in Nove Straseci at a meeting with 80 labor office managers. The explanation is very simple. There is a third quantity, a third angle, the data entered into the column headed labor force, that is, how many people there are at a productive age. The level of employment or unemployment is gauged on the labor force, not on the size of a country's population. If there is a voluntary decline in employment, then unemployment does not rise. To put it very simply -- if the wives of well paid businessmen leave work to take care of their families, this is projected into a decline in employment without an increase in unemployment. The participation level, which is the percentage of employed per number of inhabitants, was 51.2 percent in 1989. It then fell from year to year. The preliminary figures for 1993 suggest 45.8 percent. That is, a decline by more than 5 percentage points. If you carry this over into quantitative figures, then this means that there are roughly 500,000 citizens who are not now employed, but do not regard themselves as unemployed. Otherwise, they would be looking for work, they would be applying for support, and unemployment would -- obviously -- be far higher, in fact three times higher. [Martinkova] Your wife has become a member of the CEZ [Czech Energy Enterprises] board of directors. Are you not concerned about accusations of a conflict of interest? [Klaus] I am concerned about accusations from all possible sides and about everything that I do and do not do. This is one of those accusations in which I am absolutely innocent and about which I have nothing to say. To this effect, I have to say that my wife is a capable, independent individual. She is an economist, she is an expert in finance, indeed, she has been dealing with these issues the whole of her professional life and I have nothing else to say about this. If the kind of articles that have now appeared continue to crop up, she will be the one who will feel discriminated against as a citizen of this country and she will ask whether she deserves to be discriminated against in her professional life because she is the prime minister's wife.
