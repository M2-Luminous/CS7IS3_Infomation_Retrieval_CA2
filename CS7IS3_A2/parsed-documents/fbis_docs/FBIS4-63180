In his characteristic manner the speaker of the upper chamber of parliament talked a lot, mainly in hints. From Shumeyko's replies to written questions submitted the previous day the journalists learned that Vladimir Shumeyko is a Cossack, although he has a Ukrainian surname, that he was most comfortable in the post of general director of a Krasnodar plant, where "there was real power," and that he, Shumeyko, has many pluses as a politician: communicability and loyalty to his political ideals regardless of the political situation. Vladimir Filippovich admitted that at first he had had a hard time in Moscow because of his provincial origins, but then life hardened him. Answering the journalists' meticulous questions about the cadre leapfrogging going on in the state, Shumeyko did not hide the fact that he was directly involved in forming the Cabinet of Ministers just once -- in December 1992 -- and even then on the president's direct orders. He made literally this assessment of the present premier's activity: "Russia is lucky that Chernomyrdin is the premier at this stage." Vladimir Filippovich spoke severely of Shakhray, who had resigned the previous day, declaring that this will have no effect whatever on the state of interregional problems, with the possible exception that "with Yegorov's accession the resolution of these problems will move from the theoretical phase to the phase of their practical resolution." Shumeyko was understanding about Nikolay Travkin's recent ministerial appointment, declaring that Russia needs people with practical experience. The speaker of the Federation Council did not deny that he has close ties to the president, but exactly as much as is necessary to engage in joint state activity. He complained: "I have been told repeatedly that I am Yeltsin's man, and he constantly transfers me now to parliament, now to the executive. But I have never been unfaithful to myself: I favor strong state power, and this is why I am in the president's team."
