It will mark the culmination of more than four years of negotiations, nearly a century of struggle waged by the African National Congress and the end of a tragic past. It will also signal the beginning of a new future as we embark on a course in pursuance of three imperatives -- reconciliation, reconstruction and development. Without these, we run the risk of failing in our historic duty to deliver the country from 46 years of institutionalised apartheid. We must move with all haste as we set off on this course and consolidate the victory that we have won at such great cost. There can be no time for complacency even on day-one of our liberation. Serious dangers lurk ahead and any procrastination in the execution of our historic responsibility could expose our fragile democracy to all sorts of threats from forces both outside and within the process. These threats must not be underestimated, despite the public commitment by almost everyone of apartheid's partners in the electoral process. For them, the elections symbolise their most traumatic moment -- it will decisively strip them of the privileges and power they have exercised with impunity and guarded jealously and ruthlessly for so long. We therefore must not underestimate the temptation among these forces to grab back that power -- both now and in the next five years. One of the surest ways of consolidating our victory is to gives it a material and tangible character which the democratic majority will feel committed to defending. But we cannot guarantee that the ANC will be able to move with the necessary haste in consolidating the victory unless it is sufficiently empowered in parliament to fend off opposition from its partners in the government of national unity, who simply have no history of commitment to democracy. Their claim that they have shed the repressive baggage accumulated over the past 46 years is unconvincing. If in fact the National Party [NP] jettisoned this baggage in 1990, when it unbanned the liberation movements, there is simply no evidence to bear this out. No new houses have been built and grossly uneven expenditure on education and health care for blacks and whites remains very much a feature of the country under NP rule since 1990. Violence continued to escalate each year since 1990 with no convincing action being taken by the NP to bring the bloodletting under control. To suggest that it will begin to deliver after the election when it could not in 46 years and more recently in the four years after it underwent its conversion, is simply unconvincing. But this is not the only argument that the NP is using to bolster its position in a democratic parliament. It has also asked voters to vote for it in order to curb the power of the ANC, which if left unchecked, will resort to communist rule, it claims. But the NP is less than sincere in making this claim because it has as recently as four years ago pronounced the death of communism when justifying its unbanning of the SACP [South African Communist Party]. To now project it as a threat is not only inconsistent but transparently dishonest. Either that, or the NP has stopped believing its own arguments. Whichever way we look at it, the NP must not be allowed the space to delay the liberation by blocking the ANC's reconstruction efforts. Nor must the Democratic Party and Inkatha, which co- managed suppression of democracy with the NP, be allowed to postpone the liberation. We can only block the initiatives of these parties by strengthening the hand of the ANC, which has behind it more than 80 years of commitment to non racialism, democracy, accountability and transparency. DEFEND YOUR LIBERATION AND VOTE FOR THE ANC.
