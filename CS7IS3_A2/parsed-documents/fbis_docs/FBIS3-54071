As a responsible member of the government, the follow-up committee, and Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], what are the actual prospects for implementing this agreement? [Al-Kuhali] It is difficult to be absolutely certain if this agreement will be implemented or not, but I earnestly hope that at least part of it will be implemented. However, even if this agreement is not implemented fully or partially, I believe that this agreement, which is actually a social contract, will remain a bright spot in Yemeni history. If we cannot implement this document now, I am perfectly convinced that future Yemeni generations will produce leaders capable of implementing it because this document has created and will continue to create a new awareness of the need to establish a nation on the level of advanced nations based on institutions. In short, I believe that this document is fit to be the national program of this generation. It is enough that our present generation is able to implement it or some of it at least. [Al-Qallab] The follow-up committee, which was formed to implement this agreement and of which you are a member, is supposed to have taken some measures over the past three days. What has happened so far? [Al-Kuhali] Yesterday we called for a meeting of the follow-up committee in Sanaa but I could not go because I was on a mission abroad. I found out that before attending such a meeting, I had to attend the YSP Central Committee and Political Bureau meetings, which will give the YSP views on this document. Here, I would like to say that the YSP, represented by its Central Committee, Political Bureau, and other leaders, is committed to the very letter of this agreement and to implementing it and that the party will launch a large-scale campaign to muster popular support for what has been agreed on in the document of understanding. [Al-Qallab] We heard two days ago that Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, the speaker of the House of Representatives, raised certain objections to this document. Is this true or are these mere rumors? [Al-Kuhali] I heard that Shaykh 'Abdallah raised certain objections to this agreement but I also heard that these objections have been withdrawn. I am happy to hear that. [Al-Qallab] We also heard that the president insists that 'Ali Salim al-Bid must return to Sanaa before the document is signed, that the agreement should be signed after al-Bid has resumed his normal official duties. Is this true? [Al-Kuhali] This is another issue that will be discussed by the follow-up committee entrusted with preparations for the meeting between the president and the vice president and the meeting of the secretary generals of the parties. [Al-Qallab] Obviously, you are attaching great importance to security matters in the agreement. Has there been any progress in this regard over the past few days? [Al-Kuhali] No, nothing has been achieved so far, but even before reaching the agreement, the Interior Ministry tried to deal with the issue of the terrorists who were responsible for the assassinations and explosions that claimed the lives of so many people. Nothing has been achieved in this regard because those in control did not cooperate with the ministry. We hope such cooperation will materialize after the recent agreement. [Al-Qallab] Yesterday, some of your newspapers said that a military plane from the south bombed military border positions in the north. How true is this report and why was it published? [Al-Kuhali] First of all this report is absolutely untrue. The YSP is aware of what war means, what it means to have a warplane bomb military positions. For a plane to mount combat missions means that war is actually going on. This is not a joke and therefore, the report is baseless and fabricated. As to why this lie was disseminated, I have no idea. You can ask those who published it. [Al-Qallab] It was decided to hold the reconciliation meeting between the president and his deputy in Hadramawt between 25 and 30 January. Do you think that this meeting will take place in Hadramawt and within this timeframe? [Al-Kuhali] As a member of the committee, I do not want to say anything in this regard before the committee meets and discusses this issue in detail and see what other options we have. [Al-Qallab] You have said that this document may be for the future generations, what are the threats facing that agreement and its basic elements? [Al-Kuhali] The document may not please certain parties and may pose a threat to the positions of certain centers of power. But I think the most important issues are the local government, removing military forces from cities, and arresting the "terrorists." In all cases, let us wait. I think that, in the short term, some of those who feel they are the stronger party will seek to abort this document. As for the longer term, I believe that the Yemeni people will be the stronger party and will impose their will on everybody and implement the document sooner or later. We have to start implementing what can be implemented now, and at the same time work on implementing this document in the future, because it concerns the interest of all people and because it is the document of all Yemeni political parties and forces, and not the document of the YSP or the General People's Congress. It does not mark the victory or the defeat of any party. It marks a triumph for the homeland and a genuine buttress for the state of unity. [Al-Qallab] As a member of the follow-up committee, a government minister, and a YSP leader, aren't you afraid that a major security or military emergency will obstruct that agreement? [Al-Kuhali] In fact such a concern exists, and I am not revealing any secrets by saying so. Yesterday I heard there was some military tension in Yarim area. I immediately called Brigadier General Mujahid Abu-Shawarib and told him that we must work together and in quiet to prevent any surprises. I also urged vigilance because there are many parties that would not like to see that agreement implemented. Frankly I share this concern, and I fear a major surprise in the security and military field. But in general, I think we should not worry so much about these concerns and work to implement this agreement and sign the document. I believe we are capable of confronting any emergency by combining resolve and self-restraint. [Al-Qallab] Are things quiet now on the former borders between the two parts? [Al-Kuhali] In fact troops are intermingled everywhere from 'Amran to Lawdar and there is no tension in the way described by certain media. I stress that anyone who wagers on the split of the country will lose. [Al-Qallab] Certain Arab parties, particularly Jordan, have exerted efforts to contain the Yemeni crisis. Has there been a decision to invite some Arab leaders to attend the celebrations marking the meeting between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and the vice president? [Al-Kuhali] We in the YSP welcome anyone who helped and supported us to attend these expected celebrations. Here I wish to underline the major role played by His Majesty King Husayn to protect the Yemeni unity and close the ranks. [Al-Qallab] The YSP and its leaders have been accused of submitting to neighboring regional influences. What do you say? [Al-Kuhali] One can understand that such things are said and used in political conflicts. These accusation are based on the fact that the other party has to defend itself against accusations of being out of touch with the age and rejecting the future. In all cases, these things have been said, but you know that such accusations exist in our Arab and Yemeni heritage. When we have a calamity we must attribute it to an enemy from outside or resolve it through a friend from outside. I say that if we want to address our problems, then we must not take them to the outside. If the outside means the Gulf states, then the YSP is calling, emphatically, for new relations with these states on the basis of frankness, clarity, and common interests. We call for an Arab Peninsula free from confrontations or trenches. We do not wish to export ideology or slogans. We have to accept each other and coexist on clear basis and without subservience or submission. [Al-Qallab] Is it true that the United States does not wish to see Yemen partitioned again? [Al-Kuhali] Yes. We appreciate all the efforts that have been exerted to help us contain the crisis from the Arabs, Europe, and the United States. We welcome such efforts and roles.
