Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Tuesday [29 March] trade among countries which had opted for the arrangement had shown remarkable progress in terms of the volume involved. Trade had grown from about RM [Malaysian ringgit] 1 billion (about US$370 million) in 1989 to RM4 billion (about US$1.48 billion) last year, he told Malaysian reporters covering the three- day summit which began Monday. He said heads of government attending the G-15 summit felt that the success proved that the BPA had become an effective mechanism to promote trade among countries of the South. Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed informed the other heads of government attending the summit that Malaysia would strive to get more countries to sign the BPA. So far 19 countries had signed the agreement. On the North-South dialogue, Abdullah said all G-25 leaders felt that it was an important agenda and they hoped that the dialogue would benefit developing countries. On Malaysia's proposal that academic excellence centres be set up in G-15 member countries, Abdullah said it was not discussed at the plenary session because the foreign ministers had already accepted the proposal at their meeting two days ago. He said efforts to identify suitable institutions for the purpose would be made as soon as possible in member countries even though several countries had still to state their views on the proposal. The centres would be set up in countries which had agreed to the proposal and which were ready to implement it, Abdullah said.
