SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA is approving revisions to the Florida SIP submitted by the State of Florida through the FDEP on October 8, 1992, and December 9, 1992. These revisions incorporate animal crematory and human crematory regulations into the Florida SIP. The following is a description of the revisions. The regulations are more fully discussed in the official SIP submittal that is available at the Region IV office listed under the ``ADDRESSES'' section of this document. 17&hyph;296.401&hyph;Specific Source Emission Limiting Standards Amendments to this section were made to incorporate specific standards for animal crematories. The amendments impact only those units with capacities equal to or less than 500 pounds per hour used exclusively to cremate dead animals. Included in the amendments is an emission standard for particulate matter of 0.080 grains per dry standard cubic foot of flue gas, corrected to 7% oxygen (O 2 ). Carbon monoxide (CO) emissions shall not exceed 100 parts per million by volume, dry basis, corrected to 7% O 2 . Also included are minimum secondary temperature requirements that are more stringent than the standards applied to biohazardous waste incinerators of the same size. Limits on the amount of chlorinated plastics that can be incinerated and operator training requirements are also established to insure that the units are operated properly. This section was previously numbered 17&hyph;2.600. 17&hyph;297.330&hyph;Stationary Point Source Emission Test Procedures Revisions were made in Table 297.330&hyph;1 to establish more specific parameters for substituting particulate and carbon monoxide emission data from identical sources. Due to the removal of human remains from the definition of biological waste, all references to human crematories were removed from the table. Also, EPA Method 26 was added as the test procedure for the hydrochloric acid standard. The numbering of the amendments has also been changed to correspond with the renumbering of Chapter 17&hyph;2, F.A.C. Rule section 17&hyph;297.330 was previously numbered 17&hyph;2.700 and the previous number for Table 297.330&hyph;1 was 700&hyph;1. 17&hyph;296.200&hyph;Definitions The definition of a ``human crematory'' was added to this section. A human crematory is any combustion apparatus used solely for the cremation of dead human bodies with appropriate containers as described in Rule 17&hyph;296.401(5)(e), F.A.C. This rule section was previously number 17&hyph;2.100. 17&hyph;296.401&hyph;Incinerators Amendments to this section have been made to incorporate specific standards for crematories. The amendments impact only those units used exclusively to cremate human remains in appropriate containers. No other material, including biological waste as defined in section 17&hyph;296.200, F.A.C., shall be incinerated. Included in the amendments is an emission standard for particulate matter and minimum secondary temperature requirements. Limits on the amount of chlorinated plastics that can be incinerated and operator training requirements are also established to ensure that the units are operated properly. This rule section was previously numbered 17&hyph;2.600. 17&hyph;297.330&hyph;Applicable Test Procedures Table 297.330&hyph;1 was amended to include test procedures for human crematories. Test methods for visible emissions, carbon monoxide, oxygen, and particulate matter have been included. New facilities are required to do emissions testing prior to obtaining and renewing operating permits. Existing facilities must show initial compliance and do emissions testing prior to renewing operating permits. Human crematories may demonstrate compliance with the particulate and carbon monoxide emission standards by submission of test data from an identical source. This rule section was previously numbered 17&hyph;2.700. 17&hyph;297.500&hyph;Continuous Emission Monitoring Requirements General requirements have been added for human crematories to install, operate, and maintain continuous monitors to record temperature at the point where 1.0 second gas residence time is obtained in the secondary chamber. A complete file must be maintained for at least two years following the recording of such measurements. This rule section was previously numbered 17&hyph;2.710. Final Action In this action, EPA is approving the aforementioned biological waste regulations submitted by the State of Florida through the FDEP on October 8, 1992, and December 9, 1992. The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this Federal Register publication, the EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action will be effective November 7, 1994 unless, by October 6, 1994, adverse or critical comments are received. If the EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent document that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective November 7, 1994. Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by November 7, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(2).) This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting, allowing, or establishing a precedent for any future request for a revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the state is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A. , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410 (a)(2).
