"We would draw the attention of the international community to these declarations, which probably mark the end of democracy in Russia," the statement by the Estonian parliament said, referring to New Year's eve comments by Yeltsin. "Russia is choosing to emphasize so-called discrimination against Russian-speakers. This risks a gradual hardening of relations between the two countries. We must remain vigilant," the statement, released to AFP by a spokesman of the parliament, said. Yeltsin addressed a part of his New Year's message to Russians living outside Russia, stressing that their rights would be protected. On Monday ITAR-TASS quoted Yeltsin's spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov as saying he wanted to protect "the rights of Russians and the Russian-speaking population within the framework of international law and based on the notion of pan-national solidarity." The comments were seen as a threat to the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, which have large Russian-speaking minorities. On Saturday the three states called on Yeltsin to ensure the complete withdrawal of Russian troops from their soil by the end of the year. All Russian forces have already left Lithuania, but a number of units are still stationed in the other two states. The three states voiced concern last month when ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy made an unexpectedly strong showing in legislative elections.
