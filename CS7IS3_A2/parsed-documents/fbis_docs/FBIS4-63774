FBIS4-63774 "drsov101_e_94008" FBIS-SOV-94-101 Daily Report 24 May 1994 UKRAINE International Affairs President's Press Service on Russian `Rowdy Campaign' President's Press Service on Russian `Rowdy Campaign' LD2405212394 Kiev UT-1 Television Network in Ukrainian 1800 GMT 24 May 94 LD2405212394 Kiev UT-1 Television Network Ukrainian BFN [Text] The press service of Ukraine's president and cabinet of ministers has issued a statement saying that high-ranking Russian officials have lately been ever more active in participating in a rowdy campaign of misinformation and innuendo being waged by the Russian mass media, aimed against Ukraine in connection with the situation in Crimea. These officials have thus imparted an official tone to this campaign. Indeed, political party leaders making purposeful statements are one thing and people whose official duty ought to be taking care of the preservation and development of Russian-Ukrainian good-neighborliness, which would absolutely exclude any attempts to interfere in Ukraine's internal affairs, and whose voices are sounding in the anti-Ukrainian information campaign, are quite another. Instead, we witness how these officials are taking on themselves the part of supreme judges and resorting to the rhetoric of dubious assertions, full of undisguised sympathy for the Crimean leadership's separatist aspirations. They are even resorting almost to overt threats to Ukraine, the leaders of which are acting fully in accordance with constitutional provisions and international norms and defending their state's territorial integrity. In participating in the anti-Ukrainian information campaign, senior Moscow bureaucrats are encouraging Crimean separatists to violate Ukraine's Constitution and the legislation in force. In (?ostentatiously) expressing their concern in connection with the exacerbation of the situation surrounding the Crimean problem, they cannot find a single word of censure with regard to anticonstitutional actions and decisions by those actually to blame for the crisis. What is more, some strange logic makes them put responsibility on Ukrainian politicians who in their relations with Crimea do not trespass upon the boundary of constitutionalism. The inappropriateness and tactlessness of certain Russian officials' statements are not conducive to friendly, good-neighborly relations between the two Slav states, which have common roots and whose problems of today are similar. This causes surprise and anxiety to the people of Ukraine. Ukraine has determined the strategy and priority of its policy towards Russia, which is a policy of friendship and partnership on a basis of equal rights, and consistently pursues this course and rejects diktat or condescension. We express regret that some in Russia cannot understand this and still look on Ukraine as a dependent state. We call at this difficult time in the history of our relations for consideration and foresight. This is said in the statement by the press service of Ukraine's president and cabinet of ministers.
