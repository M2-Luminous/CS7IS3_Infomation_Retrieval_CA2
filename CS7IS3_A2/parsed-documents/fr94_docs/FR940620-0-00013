Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing amendment 39&hyph;8408 (57 FR 53258, November 9, 1992), and by adding a new airworthiness directive (AD), amendment 39&hyph;8938, to read as follows: 94&hyph;12&hyph;10 Boeing: Amendment 39&hyph;8938. Docket 93&hyph;NM&hyph;142&hyph;AD. Supersedes AD 92&hyph;24&hyph;03, Amendment 39&hyph;8408. Applicability: Model 767 series airplanes equipped with Pratt & Whitney PW4000 series engines; certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. Note 1: Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this AD restate the requirements of AD 92&hyph;24&hyph;03, amendment 39&hyph;8408, paragraphs (a) and (b).

Note 2: Paragraph (c)(1) of this AD restates the requirement for an initial and repetitive inspections, tests, adjustments, and functional checks contained in paragraph (c)(1) of AD 92&hyph;24&hyph;03. Therefore, for operators who have previously accomplished at least the initial inspection in accordance with AD 92&hyph;24&hyph;03, paragraph (c)(1) of this AD requires that the next scheduled inspection be performed within 3,000 flight hours after the last inspection performed in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of AD 92&hyph;24&hyph;03. Note 3: Paragraph (c)(2) of this AD restates the requirement for an initial and repetitive checks of the grounding wire contained in paragraph (c)(2) of AD 92&hyph;24&hyph;03. Therefore, for operators who have previously accomplished at least the initial inspection in accordance with AD 92&hyph;24&hyph;03, paragraph (c)(2) of this AD requires that the next scheduled inspection be performed within 1,500 flight hours after the last inspection performed in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of AD 92&hyph;24&hyph;03. To ensure the integrity of the fail safe features of the thrust reverser system, accomplish the following: (a) Within 7 days after August 23, 1991 (the effective date of AD 91&hyph;18&hyph;51, amendment 39&hyph;8069), accomplish the following: (1) Deactivate both left and right thrust reversers in accordance with Section 78&hyph;31&hyph;1 of Boeing Document D630T002, ``Boeing 767 Dispatch Deviation Guide,'' Revision 9, dated May 1, 1991. (2) Add the following to the Limitations Section of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM). This may be accomplished by placing a copy of this AD in the AFM. ``Reduce by five percent the available accelerate-stop distance resulting from the Airplane Flight Manual takeoff performance analysis when the runway is wet or contaminated.'' (b) Within 60 days after November 8, 1991 (the effective date of AD 91&hyph;22&hyph;09, amendment 39&hyph;8069), modify the thrust reverser system in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;78&hyph;0051, dated October 9, 1991. Once this modification is accomplished, the thrust reverser system shall be re-activated and the AFM limitation required by paragraph (a)(2) of this AD may be removed. (c) Accomplish the actions specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this AD at the times specified in those paragraphs. (1) Prior to the accumulation of 3,000 flight hours since manufacture, or within 30 days after November 24, 1992 (the effective date of AD 92&hyph;24&hyph;03, amendment (39&hyph;8408), whichever occurs later, perform all inspections, tests, adjustments, and functional checks of the thrust reverser control and indication system and engine wiring specified in Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;78&hyph;0046, Revision 1, dated September 17, 1992, in accordance with the procedures described in that service bulletin. (i) Repeat those actions thereafter at intervals not to exceed 3,000 flight hours. (ii) Whenever maintenance action is taken that could disturb any portion of the thrust reverser control system, the functional test or tests relative to the system shall be performed in accordance with the Boeing 767 Maintenance Manual. After this test(s) is accomplished, the repetitive inspections, tests, adjustments and functional tests required by paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this AD shall continue.
