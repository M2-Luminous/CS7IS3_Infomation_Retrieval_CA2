FR940516-1-00127 FR940516-1-00007 40 CFR Part 180 [OPP&hyph;300343; FRL&hyph;4866&hyph;7] RIN No. 2070&hyph;AC18 Pesticide Tolerances for 1-[(6-Chloro-3-Pyridinyl)Methyl]-N-Nitro-2-Imidazolidinimine AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This document proposes to establish time-limited tolerances for residues of the insecticide 1-[(6-chloro-3-pyridinyl)methyl]- N -nitro-2-imidazolidinimine and its metabolites (proposed common name ``imidacloprid'') in or on dried hops at 3.0 parts per million (ppm), milk at 0.05 ppm, and meat, fat, and meat byproducts of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, and sheep at 0.2 ppm, with an expiration date of 1 year after the beginning of the effective date of a final rule based on this proposal. EPA is issuing this proposal on its own initiative. DATES: Comments, identified by the document control number, [OPP-300343], must be recieved on or before June 15, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On its own initiative and pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), EPA is proposing a time-limited tolerance for the residues of imidacloprid on dried hops at 3.0 parts per million (ppm). EPA recently reclassified dried hops as raw agricultural commodity (59 FR 9167; Feb. 25, 1994 and 59 FR 17487; April 13, 1994). EPA is proposing the tolerance because EPA has granted a petition for an emergency exemption under section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, 7 U.S.C. 136p, for the use of imidacloprid on hops in the States of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho; imidacloprid is used in other countries that export hops to the United States; and the database for imidacloprid is relatively complete. The most significant data gap for establishing a permanent tolerance for imidacloprid on dried hops is a third field-residue trial. Given the relatively low risks presented by imidacloprid, EPA does not believe that the missing data will significantly change EPA's risk assessment. Nevertheless, EPA is establishing a 1-year time limitation on this tolerance for a full residue data base to be available in making a decision on a permanent tolerance. All relevant materials have been evaluated. The toxicology data considered in support of the tolerance include: 1. A three-generation rat reproduction study with a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of 100 ppm (8 mg/kg/bwt); rat and rabbit teratology studies were negative at doses up to 30 mg/kg/bwt and 24 mg/kg/bwt, respectively. 2. A 2-year rat feeding/carcinogenicity study that was negative for carcinogenic effects under the conditions of the study and had a NOEL of 100 ppm (5.7 mg/kg/bwt in male and 7.6 mg/kg/bwt female) for noncarcinogenic effects that included decreased body weight gain in females at 300 ppm and increased thyroid lesions in males at 300 ppm and females at 900 ppm.. 3. A 1-year dog feeding study with a NOEL of 1,250 ppm (41/mg/kg/bwt). 4. A 2-year mouse carcinogenicity study that was negative for carcinogenic effects under the conditions of the study and that had a NOEL of 1,000 ppm (208 mg/kg/day). There is no cancer risk associated with exposure to this chemical. Imidacloprid has been classified as a ``Group E'' (no evidence of carcinogenicity for humans) carcinogen by the OPP Reference Dose (RfD) Committee. The reference dose (RfD), based on the 2-year rat feeding/carcinogenic study with a NOEL of 5.7 mg/kg/bwt and 100-fold uncertainity factor, is calculated to be 0.057 mg/kg/bwt. The theoretical maximum residue contribution (TMRC) from the proposed tolerances is 0.000984 mg/kg/bwt/day and utilizes 2 percent percent of the ADI. The nature of the residue in plants and livestock is adequately understood. Results of a bovine feeding study show that finite imidacloprid residues will actually occur in milk, meat, fat, and meat by-products of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, and sheep from feeding of imidacloprid-treated raw agricultural commodities or their processed commodities when the formulations are used as directed; therefore, tolerances are required. Spent hops are not considered a poultry feed item; therefore, secondary imidacloprid tolerances for poultry and eggs are not required. The analytical method is a common moiety method for imidacloprid and its metabolites containing the 6-chloropyridiyl moiety in plants using a permanganate oxidation, silyl derivatization, and capillary GC-MS selective ion monitoring. The magnitude of the residue crop field trial data for imidacloprid on hops indicate that residues of total imidacloprid will not exceed the proposed tolerance when the formulations are used as directed. The tolerance would be established for 1 year, with an expiration date of 1 year after the beginning of the effective date of a final rule based on this proposal. This pesticide is considered useful for the purposes for which the tolerances are sought. Based on the above information considered by the Agency, the tolerances established by amending 40 CFR part 180 would protect the public health. Therefore, it is proposed that the tolerances be established as set forth below. Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide, under FIFRA, as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein, may request within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with FFDCA section 408(e). Interested person are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear notation indicating the document control number, [OPP-300343]. All written comments filed in response to this document will be be available in the Public Docket and Freedom of Information Section, at the addressed given above from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m, Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement of this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 9181 (46 FR 24950).
