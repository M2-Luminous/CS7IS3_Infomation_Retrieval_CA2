The elections lacked emotion over the war in Bosnia, lacked correctness in a true debate on structural employment, and did not address the soul and contours of the current enlargement process. Commenting on the results, which leaders referred on Monday [14 June] to the Austrian decision to join the European Union (EU)? The Twelve now know they will become 13, and perhaps more on 1 January 1995. This event has not been stressed enough and has more importance in European history than a furtive and temporary snapshot of public opinion. The paradoxical result of this non-European vote, unworthy of Europe's democratic tradition, is that it does not fundamentally change the Strasbourg parliamentary balance any more than it endangers European construction. The Socialist group remains the leading political force in Europe, followed by the Christian Democrats. These two groups together hold the keys to all the pro-European votes in Strasbourg. Therefore European construction will not suffer from the emergence of anti-Maastricht votes like the Villiers list in France and the June Movement in Denmark. However, it would be wrong to not reflect upon what has happened in France and Denmark. The two countries saw a significant rise in participation rates. This is not by chance, because they were the only countries, along with a more unanimous Ireland, to organize referendums to approve the famous European treaty. Flattered that its views were asked, public opinion in these countries has become fired up, far more than elsewhere. Europe has been the subject of major debates, sometimes out of place but often legitimate. And it is these major debates which were so cruelly lacking in the other Europe, the one which voted so undecidedly, openly displaying its indifference when the vote was not obligatory.
