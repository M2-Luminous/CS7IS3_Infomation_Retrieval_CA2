This is how [Northern League lower house floor leader] Roberto Maroni put the matter: handing over the Viminale [Interior Ministry] to the Bandwagon [League nickname] was a question of trust. He then added: "I am the only candidate for the Interior Ministry. No other name was ever mentioned during the discussions. And there are no objections from the Quirinale [office of the president]" The League is therefore insisting on having the "qualified ministries." Maroni explained why: "If we had wanted to raise the price, we would have already concluded the negotiations, and we would have been given six or seven ministries." The League has really turned the Viminale into its Piave line [World War I defense line]: "Given that no other name has been mentioned, they must explain to us why they are refusing to give us this political presence. The League will convene its group tomorrow (today -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note) and will make a decision." The bandwagon's number two said that the allies had offered the League the Labor Ministry -- an offer which was apparently declined: "We would have been open to the objection that a representative of ours in this ministry might have furthered the North's interests, rather than those of the bridge over the [Messina] Straight." According to Maroni, apart from the Viminale, the Bandwagon is aiming for the Treasury, Industry, and Budget ministries. This, however, is not because it is power-thirsty: "We are not interested," Maroni further explained, "in so many ministries or in obtaining as much power as possible. We are interested in ensuring that the League's presence in the government is such as to enable us to fulfill an effective political role on the issues around which the League was created and for which the League has fought for the past 15 years." For his part, League Senate floor leader Francesco Speroni was sarcastic about the League's ally: "Seeing how Mandela treats De Klerk, I think it is easier to talk to Mandela than to Berlusconi." As regards the difficulties involved in the negotiations, it was Maroni who concluded: "A government will be formed in any case. As far as we are concerned, this parliament will result in a government. We are committed to this."
