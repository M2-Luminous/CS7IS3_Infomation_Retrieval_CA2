The government delegation says the memorandum is biased and does not reflect the truth. The delegation regrets Col. Segala's not so dignified attitude, in referring to the CSC matters that had not been finalized by the CCF. The government protest notes that under no circumstances can Col. Segala replace the sides, let alone the CCF. The protest adds that the peace accord does not provide for unilateral (?decisions) by the CCF chairman unless he has at least secured the consensus of the sides.
