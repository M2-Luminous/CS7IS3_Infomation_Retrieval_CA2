The final resolution rests with the Cabinet after it has received an official invitation from the alliance. The Baltic presidents in their Jan. 11 statement already voiced their wish to participate in the cooperation plan, which NATO offers to the East European countries and the Baltic states as an avenue to eventual NATO membership. Latvia has not decided yet how it will participate in the program. The establishment of the Baltic Peacekeeping Battalion is the first task now, said Pavlovskis.
