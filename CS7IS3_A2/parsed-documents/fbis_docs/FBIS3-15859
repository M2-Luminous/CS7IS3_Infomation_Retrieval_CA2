G. Aliyev stated this at a press conference in Beijing. The Chinese leaders listened politely to their guest and expressed sympathy but went no further than calling for a peaceful settlement of the conflict. China, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, prefers to maintain neutrality. Correspondents were interested to know whether China had promised to render economic aid to Azerbaijan. It follows from the president's reply that relations between the two countries will be built on a mutually advantageous basis and there was therefore no talk of China's economic aid.
