Delegates of the four parties will discuss and reconcile disputed issues regarding education, the economy, agricultural policy, and public safety on that day, according to a statement by Agrarian Alliance spokeswoman Klara Spilak at yesterday's news conference. The following are the members of the permanent conference committee: Balint Nagy represents the Agrarian Alliance, Tamas Fellegi represents Fidesz [Federation of Young Democrats], Csaba Csikos represents the Entrepreneurs' Party, and SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats] is represented by Tamas Bauer and Balint Magyar. The SZDSZ will be in charge of presenting public safety issues, Fidesz will deal with educational issues, the Entrepreneurs' Party will present economic policy issues, and the Agrarian Alliance will be in charge of agricultural policy issues, of course. The leaders of the four parties intend to publicize accomplishments in each field before the elections. Agrarian Alliance political campaign chief Gyorgy Fabri declared that the election struggle has not assumed a coarse tone of voice, but he objected to the fact that there was no opportunity to conduct real public debate, and he blamed primarily the public service media for that. Thereafter Fabri said that some positive changes have recently taken place in the TV-HIRADO and in various news programs. Regarding the dispute over the list of recipients of compensation, the campaign chief said that the release and use of these data was an unfortunate election trick, because the Agricultural Alliance believes that no thanks are due for compensation. Erzsebet Schmuck, cochairman of the Green Alternative, distanced herself and her party from the Hungarian Green Party, and reaffirmed their professional and political cooperation with the Agrarian Alliance, a member of the liberal bloc.
