The officer, Lt-Col Thatthiam Yiamnakhon, said that newspapers always described Gen Wimon, when he talked to reporters, as "talking too much". But whenever he did not talk, newspapers would say that he was angry. Lt-Col Thatthiam said military society, like others, had its own characteristics and way of life. Military society adhered to traditions passed on to soldiers for generations and was hard to change. Soldiers always thought systematically, had a clear line of practice and did as they were told by their commanders. Soldiers were taught to speak and express opinions according to their responsibilities. They did whatever was decided by their bosses, who usually took full responsibility should anything go wrong, he said. Relations between commanders and their subordinates were so close that the soldiers were ready to follow their bosses anywhere without complaining. "For the subordinates, their show of pain, dissatisfaction and sentiment on behalf of their bosses is normal," he said. Lt-Col Thatthiam said it was normal for soldiers to feel unhappy at newspapers which used "improper" words to describe their top boss. "Newspapers may think the army chief is a public figure who must be able to tolerate criticism, but soldiers who study only military matters throughout their life do not easily understand this," he said.
