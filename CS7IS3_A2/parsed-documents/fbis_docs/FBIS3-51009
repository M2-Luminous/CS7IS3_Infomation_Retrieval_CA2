We have learned that the Haitian Army will not participate in this conference since the invitation was addressed to a senior military officer, who is not recognized either by the international community or by Father Aristide's own government. This information was collected by the AFP from a well-informed source. Let us recall that this letter of invitation to this conference was addressed to General Jean-Claude Duperval, the Army second in command who President Aristide had appointed this past December as Army commander in chief, while dismissing General Cedras, the current commander in chief. Prime Minister Robert Malval and the members of his government had refused to hand over the letters of appointment and of dismissal to their addressees, asking President Aristide to reconsider his decision, which he did not do until now. The international community, on its part, is still asking for the application of the general framework of the Governors Island accord, signed in July 1993 by President Aristide and General Cedras, who it still recognizes as chief of the Haitian Army and a signatory, under that title, of this accord. It also should be recalled that the Miami conference, which at first was to deal with the problem of the Haitian refugees, has been extended to discuss the general topic of the return to democracy, following pressure from the United States, according to diplomatic sources. These same sources specify that Washington considered as an insult the inclusion of the question of the boat people. It is unknown if the other sectors in Haiti invited to the conference will attend.
