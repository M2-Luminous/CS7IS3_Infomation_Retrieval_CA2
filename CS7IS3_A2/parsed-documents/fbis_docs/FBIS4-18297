Hume, whose talks with Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, opened up the latest peace process, said that if the party was shown to be bluffing he would turn his back on it and ensure Sinn Fein's total isolation from democratic politics. The veteran nationalist leader said there were two possible consequences if the government agreed to Sinn Fein's demand. "One is a total cessation of violence with all its enormous positive consequences or, as some people believe but I don't, if Sinn Fein is bluffing then its bluff will have been called and it will be isolated in a way it has never been before." Hume said he was disappointed that the ceasefire, due to last from Tuesday to Thursday, was so short. "I wanted a complete cessation of violence," he said. An Irish government spokesman said Albert Reynolds, the taoiseach [prime minister], shared dismay at the failure of the IRA to deliver a permanent end to violence. "The feeling has been growing that if we or the British give them one more concession they will just demand more," he said. The spokesman emphasised that Reynolds was bringing no pressure on the British, either privately or publicly, to meet Sinn Fein. He said: "John Hume speaks for himself on this one. He must be deeply disappointed." Republican sources said yesterday that the IRA had originally intended to hold the ceasefire in June. It appears to have been rushed forward following pressure from Hume and prominent Irish Americans, many of whom were disappointed by the failure of Adams to announce concessions on his visit to the United States earlier this year. Bill Flynn, the New York businessman who invited Adams, has voiced growing impatience with Sinn Fein in recent weeks. This weekend Father Sean McManus, another key Irish-American activist, said he did not believe that a three-day suspension of hostilities was enough to satisfy the growing demand from Irish Americans for an end to the conflict. Yesterday, Adams appeared to soften Sinn Fein's position. He gave the party's clearest indication yet that a British declaration of intent to withdraw from Northern Ireland was not a pre-condition for a complete cessation of IRA violence. "At the end of the day, republicans want to see an end to British jurisdiction in Ireland. But we have to take on board that the Unionists have an opposite view," he said. However, an IRA source said the movement's leaders were claiming to be on the brink of victory. They have told internal meetings that the government last year gave assurances that it secretly wanted Irish unity. Martin McGuinness, the Sinn Fein leader involved in secret contacts with the government, is expected to allude to these alleged assurances at a republican rally in Dublin today. There are growing fears in security circles that if the government does not budge there will be an escalation of terrorism. IRA members have been told to prepare for a renewed terror campaign, while loyalist paramilitaries have ended their informal contacts with the Irish government and are threatening to start a bombing campaign throughout Ireland. The British and Irish governments appear to have accepted that there is unlikely to be an early end to violence. They have begun drawing up a joint document on the future government of the province and Anglo-lrish relations. An Irish government source said the document would be unveiled when events had "cooled down" after the European elections in june. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said: "The two governments are working on a joint structure scheme that will represent, in their view, the best means by which a satisfactory package could get broad support."
