Tapie's popularity was confirmed by the results of a SOFRES [French Opinion Polling Company] poll conducted on behalf of LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR from 26 to 28 April among 1,000 individuals over 18 who were personally interviewed. Respondents were asked the following questions: "Do you have the feeling that in the Euroelections Tapie would..." reinforce the Left by attracting voters who would not vote for it: 39 percent. Weaken the Left by lowering the score of the list of Socialist Party (PS) leader Michel Rocard facing the Rally for the Republic (RPR)-Union for French Democracy (UDF) list: 36 percent. No opinion: 25 percent. "In your opinion, is Tapie a demagogue who could easily be a danger to democracy, or a man who comes from the people and is able to speak for them?" A demagogue who could easily be as danger to democracy: 30 percent A man who comes from the people and is able to speak for them: 56 percent. No opinion: 14 percent. According to Jaffre, the poll also included some "surprises." The vote for Tapie cannot spring from the populist behavior of anti-Maastricht voters, given that out of 100 Tapie voters, 59 percent said they voted "yes," in the 1992 Maastricht referendum, with only 16 percent voting "no" and 25 percent abstaining or casting a blank ballot. Similarly, 62 percent did not think that European integration threatens French identity, 56 percent thought that the disappearance of the European Union (EU) would be serious for France, and only 17 percent wished that European integration were slower. A second "surprise" was that despite President Francois Mitterrand's perceived pro-Tapie stance--which has been widely discussed in the press--the Tapie electorate is much less "Mitterandist" than Michel Rocard's. Some 73 percent of Rocard supporters trust the president, compared with 54 percent of Tapie voters. Mitterrand's presidential action was judged positively by 77 percent of Rocard voters, compared with 61 percent of Tapie supporters. Similarly, the Tapie electorate is neither opposed to Prime Minister Edouard Balladur nor "frankly hostile" to the Right, Jaffre commented. Some 55 percent trust the prime minister, against 40 percent among Rocard voters, while 41 percent of Tapie voters trust Rally for the Republic (RPR) leader Jacques Chirac, compared with 26 percent of Rocard supporters. Finally, on SOFRES' traditional Left-Right axis, 57 percent of Tapie voters situated themselves in the center or even on the Right.
