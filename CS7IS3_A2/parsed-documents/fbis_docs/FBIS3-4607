The investments were in 64 projects and represent a 94.9 percent increase over last year's January. Since November 1988 when Korean industries began to invest in China, South Korean industries' investments in China totaled 999.6 million dollars in 1,104 cases as of the end of last January. It accounted for 13.7 percent of the total investments of 7,276.4 million dollars made by South Korean industries abroad during the same period. The sharply increased investment in China in the recent past was owing to the fact that many industries have moved away from ASEAN countries to China attracted by cheap wages and improved investment climate there following diplomatic normalization between Seoul and Beijing. In contrast, investment conditions in ASEAN countries have deteriorated lately due chiefly to sharp wage increase and cut-throat competition among Korean industries, a business source said.
