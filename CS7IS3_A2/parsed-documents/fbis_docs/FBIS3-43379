It is to be recalled that the procurator general of the central government recently instituted a criminal charge on various issues against Lencho Leta and Ibsa Gutema and that their cases had been under review at the central high court and were scheduled to be heard on 5 January. The accused, Mr. Lencho Leta and Mr. Ibsa Gutema, in their application to the Ministry of Justice of the Transitional Government of Ethiopia, submitted that in so far as we believe that differences created in the implementation of the tenets of the charter can only be resolved peacefully and not through war, and in so far as we are ready to make every effort to ensure that those concerned work to this end to carry out their activities along these lines, we ask for charges against both of us to be dropped. After the Ministry of Justice presented the application of the accused to the government and after an assessment carried out by the government, the government decided to enter a nolle prosequi and gave an order for the same to the Ministry of Justice through the procurator general on 4 January.
