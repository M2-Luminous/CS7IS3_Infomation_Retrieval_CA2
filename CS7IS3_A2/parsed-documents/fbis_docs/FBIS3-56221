Guests are always shown what is best, although this will not be an easy task given the fact that the Clintons' visit will last only a couple of hours. As is known, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton have plans of their own during the visit. The President's daughter will attend a demonstration at the State Choreography College, while his wife will visit the Opera and Ballet Theater. She will be accompanied by our Republic's first ladies -- Irina Shushkevich and Alena Kebich. They will exchange souvenirs at the opera, after which Hillary Clinton will meet with artists.
