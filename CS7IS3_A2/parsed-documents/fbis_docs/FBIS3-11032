The demonstration of community spirit shown by the peasants did not, however, have President Juan Carlos Wasmosy as a witness, who early this morning left for Brazil with Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada to attend the inauguration of a navigation sluice. That ceremony was not even attended by Brazilian President Itamar Franco. Wasmosy's activity was labeled inappropriate and irresponsible by peasant leaders. Since last night, the government had ordered strict control on all roads of all vehicles carrying people to Asuncion. The National Police and the Highway Patrol even halted trucks at the toll stations in Coronel Oviedo, Carapegua, Tacuara, and San Jose de los Arroyos. The Public Works and Communications Ministry also revived an old 1948 decree, which was never enforced, that prohibits carrying people in cargo trucks. The machinery of that ministry and companies under government contracts also obstructed the free movement of vehicles by the Yhaguy River near Itacurubi de la Cordillera. In this regard, the alleged participation of the Public Works and Communications Ministry in the assembly of "tire busters" (nails to flatten tires) made members of Congress intervene. The march, without precedent in our country's history, gathered thousands of peasants from different parts of the country in front of the Congress building. The largest group gathered at the Metropolitan Seminary's facilities on Kubitschek and 25 de Mayo Avenues, from where they left to gather in front of Congress. By this paper's publication deadline [ULTIMA HORA is an afternoon newspaper], no incidents of any kind had been reported in the country. Strong security was seen mainly in Asuncion and around Congress. The police forces were supported by Armed Forces members in combat uniforms who were located at strategic points. Helicopters also flew over the city. The demonstrators came to the city in different kinds of vehicles in the face of the obstacles created by bus owners. The peasants' mobilization was supported by high school and university students and labor unions. The political parties and movements only made an appeal to their followers to support the mobilization. At the same time the mobilization in the capital was taking place, agricultural organizations closed Highway 6 near kilometer 143 at the Santa Clara crossing, the highway to Hernandarias at kilometer 4 (with the support of student groups), and the road to Villeta. In Carapegua, the peasants who were forced to get out of trucks decided to block Route 1 for about two hours. The need to have their demands heard by the government made many peasants walk 25 km (this happened in the General Resquin area).
