We asked some politicians to assess the way he has been availing himself of this right. According to Jan Maria Rokita, it is a "veto by surprise," while Tomasz Nalecz describes Walesa's vetoes as "provocative and exacerbating," and Ludwik Dorn uses the term "destructive." The preannounced veto by the president regarding the electoral law to gmina [small administrative units] councils, would already be the 11th veto in Lech Walesa's term of office. The greatest emotions were stirred by two vetoes of an electoral law in 1991 (both of which were overruled), a veto regarding the law on radio and television in 1991 (not overruled), and one regarding a law on retirement pensions for uniformed officials in 1993 (not overruled). In recent weeks, the president has definitely reminded us of his veto prerogative more often. He vetoed a neo-popiwek [wage-controlling] statute by making the claim that it tries to interfere with the level of earnings in private companies, and that the statute violates the law by granting the government a parliamentary privilege to set taxes. For a long time, the president also suggested the possibility of not signing the Budget Law because of its failure to implement the breakthrough announced by the now governing coalition during the elections. But once he finally approved of the budget, the very same day he announced he will veto an electoral law for self-governmental elections. Many politicians of the governing coalition sharply criticized the moves by the president, saying that Walesa was driven by a hostility toward the coalition and his goal was to achieve political destabilization. But the governing coalition failed to gather the necessary two-thirds majority required to overrule the veto on neo-popiwek. Many papers in turn published articles in which efforts were made to establish whether the president is violating the legal order by his measures. According to Lech Falandysz -- deputy chief of the President's Office and the Belvedere's main legal expert -- the president is simply using his powers, while not violating the law at the same time. "Some politicians should first read the Small Constitution and only then start making judgments on the president's measures" -- Falandysz says. "Besides, the president will not allow anybody to tell him how to use his powers." In the view of Falandysz, to meet the demand that the president make his reservations known before a law is adopted by the Sejm and, in this way, try to influence the legislative process in parliament, would mean an elimination of veto power altogether. "The president would have to fight for his ideas on laws in parliamentary commissions and he would also be accused of interfering with parliament proceedings" -- Falandysz states. It Would Be Unacceptable in the United States Center Accord Deputy Chairman Ludwik Dorn: Aside from Russia, the only president with veto power is the U.S. President. If he has any reservations regarding a bill, he does not wait until it is passed by Congress. Representatives of the presidential administration simply suggest their protests -- without using the media as a go-between -- and then they examine the configuration of forces in Congress. Only after it turns out that the congressional majority does not want a compromise, the president makes a public statement that in case the bill is passed, he will use his veto power. But even in such cases, there is usually a meeting between the president and congressional leaders, and the dispute most often ends in a compromise. But if a veto is indeed used, then the whole thing is of dramatic dimensions. What is important in that practice, is the complete accountability of both sides, the awareness of what it is that the other side wants, and also the fact that neither side is eager to put the opponent against the wall. Simply put, nobody regards the dispute as a zero-sum game. What happened with the Budget Law in Poland would be unthinkable in the United States. In Walesa's case, I do not recall any occasion in the past where he would make an advanced warning that he may veto a law. He applies his veto power in a destructive manner. After all, the truth is that Walesa is not making use of his prerogatives, the men and the resources at his disposal, to influence the contents of laws. So it is very clear that he does not care about specific issues but only about strengthening his own position. Presidential `No' is Just Like the President Himself Jan Maria Rokita, deputy chairman of the Democratic Union Parliamentary Club: Situations arising in the United States show that over there, a "veto by surprise" -- which President Lech Walesa often applies -- is an unknown phenomenon. But Walesa has some arguments in his favor. First of all, in Poland there is no formula for the president's participation in parliament's legislative proceedings during which he could submit remarks on draft laws being prepared. The Belvedere's representatives take part in the commissions' proceedings only when presidential initiatives are debated. Second, it also happens that the legislative process itself is conducted "by surprise." Some laws are adopted all of a sudden and at an insane speed. The reforms of the state are going on and the legal system is undergoing constant changes, as well. But what speaks against Walesa, is the evaluation of the totality of the style in which he executes his office. It is clear to any observer of the political scene, that Walesa likes to play the card of uncertainty in his position -- hence the proverbial "I am in favor and even against." I am convinced that even if the president could actually participate in legislative proceedings, he would definitely not use his right, anyway. Simply put, the current situation is much more comfortable to him. The president likes to catch people by surprise and attack unexpectedly. Besides, presidential vetoes are becoming an instrument of Walesa's political confrontation with the Democratic Left Alliance, and recently also with the Polish Peasant Party. If Walesa had decided to veto the Budget Law, then one would have been able to accuse him of initiating brawls. But since he did not veto it after all, a question mark remains in that respect. So I would not make an accusation like that. It is probably true anyway, but it would be hard to find facts to support it. That is because when vetoing the neo-popiwek law and the new local electoral law, Walesa had genuine social support. In the case of neo-popiwek, he was supported by the opposition, and in the case of the electoral law -- by self-government groups. The Vetoes Are Provocative, Exacerbating Tomasz Nalecz, press spokesman of the Union of Labor's Deputies Club: I am very critical of the way Lech Walesa has been using his presidential veto. I think that when using certain instruments, one should observe rules effective for the entire machinery. Otherwise, you break the machinery. According to the Small Constitution, the day-to-day ruling of the country is in the hands of the government, with the parliament adopting laws, and the president serving as an umpire. This means that the president is supposed to get involved at a point when the machinery malfunctions. Under this concept, a presidential veto should happen once in a blue moon. But what Lech Walesa is doing, is turning the right of veto into an instrument of day-to-day governing of the country. The way he applies the right to veto leads to political cacophony. It amounts to playing two melodies at the same time. As is well known, being a Sejm deputy for the Union of Labor, I am not an enthusiast of the current coalition. But one cannot paralyze the functioning of the chief institutions of state power. But Walesa gets an itch every time he comes across an important law -- this applies not only to those laws which are supposed to determine something decades into the future, but also to those which pertain to quite immediate issues. That is why one can regard the presidential vetoes as provocative and exacerbating. President Walesa has made a decision to play his political game. That conflicts with my concept of the Presidency. This reminds me of a story: An elderly fellow is carrying a big sack and every once in a while he stops and stirs around in the sack with a stick. When asked what he is doing, he responds that he is carrying a sack full of rats and he stirs in the sack so the rats won't bite him on the back. "Then they bite one another" -- explains the man.
