The province actually used foreign investment totalling 220 million U.S. dollars in the first quarter of this year, an increase of about 70 percent over the same period last year. Last year saw the province approve the establishment of 4,400 foreign-funded enterprises, involving a contractual investment of 3.7 billion U.S. dollars. Actual use of the investment amounted to 1.2 billion U.S. dollars. A provincial official said that the growth was mainly fuelled by the better service of local government departments; the increase of direct foreign investment and construction of large infrastructure projects. Once a project is approved, the government will follow its construction closely and is always ready to offer a helping hand, he added. Of the contractual investment last year, about 300 million U.S. dollars came directly from enterprises solely funded by foreign investors. More and more overseas investors have shown interest in energy development and transport projects in the province, the official noted.
