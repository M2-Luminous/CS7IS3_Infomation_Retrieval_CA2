The WB will continue to support financially reforms in Moldova. The WB experts say that some progress has already been registered: stability of national currency and decrease in the inflation rates. President Snegur welcomed the WB's idea of opening a permanent mission in Moldova and expressed his hope that the latter, together with the IMF, will contribute to economic recovery. Snegur mentioned two aspects of major importance for a successful implementation of reforms -- political stability and rapid privatization of state property. It was specified that the Ministry of Privatization, which was recently created, was meant to serve as a catalyst for the process, to make it consistent and irreversible, says the press communique.
