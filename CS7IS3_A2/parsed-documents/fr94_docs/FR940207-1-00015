FR940207-1-00015 FR940207-1-00002 The Board believes consumers are not mislead by advertisements for ``free'' accounts, if certain electronic services, such as home banking services, are available for a fee. The Board believes that (unlike ATM access) consumers do not have a reasonable expectation that services such as home banking would be included as part of an account advertised as free. Of course, if optional features that impose fees are advertised with a free account, the advertisement must make clear that charges are assessed for the optional feature. The Board solicits comment on this approach, and requests comment on whether ATM services should be distinguished from other optional electronic services, and whether consumers would be mislead by an advertisement for an account that is described as ``free'' even though the institution may charge for ATM activity at ATMs owned by the institution. Comment 8(a)&hyph;4 specifies that the term ``fees waived'' is similar to the terms ``free'' or ``no cost'' for the purposes of this section. (b) Permissible Rates The Board has received many questions about advertising accounts for which institutions offer a number of versions (certificates of deposits, for example). Comment 8(b)&hyph;3 clarifies that institutions may state an annual percentage yield for each version of an account. Alternatively, the proposed comment would permit institutions to state a representative example as long as the advertisement makes clear that, for instance, the advertised yield is for a time account with a 30-day maturity and does not apply to all time accounts. Similarly, the comment illustrates that institutions could advertise selected versions of time accounts. The Board solicits comment on this approach, which the Board believes would effectively minimize compliance burdens for institutions while still providing meaningful information to consumers. (c) When Additional Disclosures are Required The regulation requires institutions to disclose additional information when the annual percentage yield is advertised. Comment 8(c)&hyph;1 provides examples of information that does and does not trigger the additional disclosures. In response to questions about the effect of advertising a ``bonus'' rate, the proposed comment illustrates that stating ``bonus rates are available'' does not trigger additional disclosures. However, stating a ``bonus rate of 1%'' over an institution's current interest rate for one-year certificates of deposit is equivalent to stating an interest rate. Paragraph (c)(2) Time Annual Percentage Yield Is Offered Comment 8(c)(2)&hyph;1 clarifies the regulation's disclosure requirements for advertisements that state an annual percentage yield as of a specified ``recent'' date. The proposed comment provides that when an advertisement is published, the specified ``recent date'' must be recent in relation to the publication frequency of the media used for the advertisement (taking into account established production deadlines for the media involved). For example, annual percentage yields as of the printing date of a brochure printed once for a deposit account promotion that will run for six months would be considered ``recent,'' even though rates may be expected to change during the six-month period. Annual percentage yields published in a daily newspaper or broadcast on television must be ``recent'' as of the daily publishing or broadcasting deadline date, even though the advertisements may appear less frequently (such as once a month). The Board solicits comment on this approach. Paragraph (c)(6) Features of Time Accounts Paragraph (c)(6)(i) Time Requirements Comment 8(c)(6)(i)&hyph;1 addresses questions regarding ``club'' accounts in which there is a fixed maturity date but the term of the account may vary, depending on when the account is opened. The proposed comment provides that institutions adequately disclose the term of the account by stating the established maturity date and the fact that the actual term may vary. Appendix A_Annual Percentage Yield Calculation Part I. Annual Percentage Yield for Account Disclosures and Advertising Purposes With one exception, the interpretation of Appendix A, Part 1 is deferred pending the Board's final action on proposed amendments to Regulation DD. Proposed comment app. A.I.&hyph;1 clarifies rounding rules which may be used in calculating interest and the annual percentage yield. The Board believes that rounding to five decimals results in a more precise figure and is in accordance with industry practices. The Board requests comment on whether further guidance on rounding principles would be appropriate.
