Former Finance Minister and DYP Deputy General Chairman Sumer Oral said that the situation is not such as to require application of Article 119. Sumer Oral pointed out that the president replied to the two businessmen that "there is no need for such a move." He said, "I do not see any need to invoke Article 19 of the Constitution under the present circumstances." Businessmen Sabanci and Koc presented a proposal to President Demirel that he exercise his constitutional authority to "chair the Council of Ministers in serious economic crises" on the rationale that Turkey is experiencing "a serious economic crisis." Demirel, however, noted that there is a coalition government in office and replied, "There is no need for this at present." The two businessmen's proposal to Demirel angered Finance Minister Ismet Attila. He pointed out that the president "does not act at just anyone's behest" and stressed that there is no question of any "economic straits" such as to invoke Article 119 of the Constitution by reason of "economic crisis." He said: "The situation the country is experiencing must not be exaggerated. At any rate, it is not grave enough to invoke certain consitutional provisions. There is a government, and it has taken all necessary measures. Moreover, the place for discussion and reaching consensus on topics like this is the government, not business. This is a separate matter, of course. Moreover, even if there were such a situation, the president cannot act on his own. These things do not take place just by someone's saying so. We took the necessary measures, all that need to be taken, during the first three months." Attila suggested that there are those who are trying to gain an advantage from this by creating an atmosphere of panic and said, "Those who have no love for the country or its people are the ones doing this; our political rivals are doing this. They are saying, `It will affect foreign exchange rates,' they are saying, `Withdraw our money.' But I repeat, all necessary measures have been taken. There is definitely no need for such an emergency or anything similar." DSP General Chairman Bulent Ecevit called a news conference yesterday at which he said the following: ``I am definitely opposed. I would hope that the report is not serious. I told the distinguished prime minister: What ought to be done is to convene the `economic and social council' that is a part of the government program but has not been implemented to date. ``With this council, on which workers, farmers, employers, and the government would be represented, an approach must be followed based on voluntary solidarity on overcoming the problem.'' Article 119 of the Constitution authorizes the president to proclaim martial law for six months "in periods of great crisis" in the country. Article 119 reads: "In conditions of natural disaster, dangerous infectious diseases, or serious economic crisis, the Council of Ministers meeting under the chairmanship of the president may proclaim a state of emergency, not to exceed a period of six months, in one or more areas of the country or nationwide."
