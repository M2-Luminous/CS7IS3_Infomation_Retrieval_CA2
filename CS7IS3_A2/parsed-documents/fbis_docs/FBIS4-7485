He brought about a conflict recently, as well, when he refused to sign the "new popiwek" [tax on excess wage increases] law and appointed Ryszard Bender to the post of chairman of the National Council of Radio and Television before the legal dispute ended over whether the president had the right to recall the previous chairman, Marek Markiewicz. Thus, the Belweder is taking advantage of accomplished facts and accepts only the president's own interpretation of laws. However, one could expect more from the president, who is the moderator of political life. It is very characteristic that, in recent days, the Belweder has multiplied conflicts. The "no" for Rosati, the budget blackmail, and, finally, the appointment of Mr. Bender and the veto of the "new popiwek" show clearly that Lech Walesa has decided to extend the area of his influence. All this actually happened, even though the coalition of the Polish Peasant Party and the Democratic Left Alliance often declared the will of constructive cooperation with the president. It also proved this by recognizing the president's right to fill the highest positions in three strategic ministries. Thus, there was a chance for cooperation and balance. However, Lech Walesa is balancing in his own way.
