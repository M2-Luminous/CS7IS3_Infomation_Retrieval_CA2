According to him, the Kosova status will be negotiated with no one, less so "with those residing in the foreign land," alluding to the ethnic Albanians of Kosova. Further on, he reveals that the Serb Unity Party has a wide and detailed program on Kosova, which predicts the fast establishment of national parity with the settling of 500 thousand Serbs in Kosova and the expulsion of 465 thousand Albanians to Albania. On the other hand, the leaders of Seselj's radicals in Kosova, Miodrag Jevric, declares in the newspaper BORBA that the participants of national minorities should not be provided with weapons during military service, whereas those who do not respond to the order for military service "can buy the military term" at 5,000 U.S. dollars.
