The chairman of the Somali Patriotic Movement Aden Abdullahi Nur told XINHUA late tonight that "Aidid and Ali Mahdi have reached a compromise and will sign a peace agreement tonight or tomorrow. Now they are preparing for the signing." Secretary General of the Somali Intellectuals Forum Zakaria Mohamud Haji Abdi disclosed that after the press release issued by the United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM), Aidid called on the acting special representative of U.N. Secretary-General Lansana Kouyate and proposed that he and Ali Mahdi could represent their separate alliance to sign the agreement. This afternoon, the acting special representative stated in the press release that as the faction leaders were not able to resolve the problem of representation of the Southern Somali National Movement (SSNM), he decided that the United Nations was no longer able to provide the faction leaders with good offices and facilities to continue their current consultations. In an interview with XINHUA late tonight, SSNM Secretary General Abdullahi Sheikh confirmed the compromise. "That (the compromise) has given a mandate to group of 12 spokesman Awad Ashareh Mohamed, and let us sign on behalf of SSNM, Aidid gets another mandate. Both of them will sign a document on behalf of the factions belonging to them", said Abdullahi. "This is what we have reached at this time. Maybe tomorrow we will have another development and we will sign a document along this line," he added. This afternoon, Awad Ashareh, spokeman for the group of 12 led by Ali Mahdi, noted that the Nairobi peace talks on the Somali issue have collapsed "because Aidid refused to sign the reconciliation agreement," adding that "we have accepted all conditions raised by him (Aidid) during the peace talks." The Somali peace talks sponsored by the United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) began here on March 17.
