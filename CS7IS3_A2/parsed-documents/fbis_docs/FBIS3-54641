He denounced the separatist ambitions of the leaders in Tiraspol and reaffirmed his determination to ensure the territorial integrity of the state. We will not tolerate blackmail, pressure, and interference from outside, President Snegur also said. Recalling the dependence on suppliers of material resources, especially energy resources, and the acute problem of markets for the sale of products, Mircea Snegur affirmed that these factors have raised, first and foremost, the need for adherence to the CIS economic union. He added, however: Our position is a single one, namely that Moldova will participate solely in the activity of the economic structures of the CIS. I have also reaffirmed this position at the recent meeting in Ashgabat. President Snegur also talked about the elimination of the consequences of totalitarianism, the democratization of the entire public activity, the promotion of political and economic reforms, and about the transition to a market economy.
