FR941019-1-00057 FR941019-1-00006 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [VA20&hyph;2&hyph;6407b; FRL&hyph;5083&hyph;1] Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Virginia: Definition of VOC and Emission Control Areas AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: EPA proposes to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Commonwealth of Virginia on November 4, 1992. The revision consists of amendments to Virginia's definition of the term volatile organic compound (VOC) and administrative changes to Virginia's lists of emission control areas for VOC and oxides of nitrogen (NO x ). Virginia's November 4, 1992, SIP revision submittal also contained an emission statement regulation. The portion of Virginia's November 4, 1992, submittal pertaining to emission statements is the subject of a separate rulemaking action. In the final rules section of this Federal Register , EPA is approving the Commonwealth's November 4, 1992, SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial SIP revision and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule and technical support document (TSD) prepared for that rulemaking action. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this rule. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. DATES: Comments must be received in writing by November 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments on this action should be addressed to Thomas J. Maslany, Director, Air, Radiation, and Toxics Division (3AT00), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region III, 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107. Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the Air, Radiation, and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region III, 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107; and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, 629 East Main Street, Richmond, Virginia, 23219.
