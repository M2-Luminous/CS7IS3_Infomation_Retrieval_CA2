The B-H Army militarily defeated the Croatian Defense Council [HVO], and brought it to the negotiating table. Given the mediation of the United States, those efforts have resulted in the federation of Bosniaks and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is what the Bosnian delegation proposed at the negotiations a year ago. In addition to these results and the enlargement of the free territory, the B-H Army has also been cleaning up its own ranks, has grown stronger in terms of organization, and has finally reached the stage when those who are familiar with the results are calling it a real army. That is a great compliment for us. We know best our weaknesses. There is a plenty of room for us to strengthen the organization and introduce even more order and discipline. We have a vision of how the B-H Army will look in the federation, and what it will be like in the future. Of course, all those plans are supposed to be financially, morally, and politically covered. We are continuing to work on self-filtration, because there are still those who use their uniforms to cover up some completely different goals, be it criminal activities, intelligence gathering for the enemy, or their ambitions for military careers. We have to understand that the war is still going on, that the B-H Army is here to protect the people and the state, so one ought to help it in every way for the army to become even more than it has been so far: a guarantee enabling our government to discuss the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina on equal terms, thereby making it possible to achieve a just peace and freedom for this country. The B-H Army is not an alien self-creation, it arose from and is still a part of our people, to whom I want to express my gratitude for everything it has done for the army. [Cerimagic] This is a response of General Rasim Delic to the question of what strategic goals our army has achieved in the past two years of the aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina by the Serbo-Montenegrin aggressor and the HVO. Although it was Army Day, the day of its foundation, that was the only question related to the achievements reached in the past two years. The severity with which Gorazde is being attacked, as well as the attacks on other territories, determined the content of the interview with the commander in chief of the B-H Army, which took place on 15 April 1994. [Cerimagic] The global strategic goal of the Serbian aggressor is the creation of a 30-km belt on the Bosnian side of the Drina River, while Gorazde, Zepa, and Srebrenica are three enclaves that stand in the way of the Serbs' accomplishment of their ancient dream. What induced the aggressor to take the risk of NATO intervention at such an unfavorable moment, and attack Gorazde, even though it was beleaguered and represented no serious military threat? [Delic] At this stage the creation of a 30-km belt on the Bosnian bank of the Drina is certainly not their global strategic goal. Because, by surrounding those three enclaves, the aggressor has created conditions to solve a long-term problem by pressuring citizens to leave the region. This is from the aggressor's point of view, of course. However, at this stage, the goal of the Serbs is to ease the pressure that is being exerted on them. They want to turn the existing occupation into a factual-legal state at the negotiating table. By carrying out attacks against the free, that is, safe zones of Gorazde and Bihac, which the Serbs know are very difficult to help in any concrete way, because they are surrounded, and that we will demand intervention by the international community, they are trying to legitimize their conquests. When we turn to the United Nations to demand protection and the return to the initial state on the ground, the Serbs then demand a lasting cease-fire, and the positioning of UNPROFOR troops between the warring factions, as they put it. Thereby the situation on the ground would be frozen, with Bosnia-Herzegovina in the same situation as Cyprus or Lebanon. The situation on the ground would turn into a lasting occupation, while in that way the aggressor would establish its para-state. That is a Serb goal, and for that reason, despite the strong international political pressure, and now even military, they have taken the risk of foreign intervention. [Cerimagic] There are opinions, to put it metaphorically, that the Serbs in pounding Gorazde are not destroying the town alone, but rather the Bosniak-Croatian federation. [Delic] Certainly, the Washington Agreement and the military steps that have been taken in the field have caused alarm among the Serb aggressors, and probably also fear. This is because in reality the federation means a deployment of large numbers of troops jointly by the B-H Army and the HVO. As for the HVO, there are no guarantees that they would be engaged in any further fighting, but the B-H Army, having saved forces that were deployed against the HVO until yesterday, has created the conditions for taking up offensives for the legitimate liberation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The remarks about the B-H Army being active on the front are absurd, because the only legitimate force is the B-H Army, and it is only the deployment of B-H Army troops that is legitimate in any part of Bosnia-Herzegovina. It has a right to take action on any part of the territory, to liberate it from the Serb-Montenegrin occupation. Therefore, the aggressor is doing everything to prevent the implementation of the Bosniak-Croatian federation. [Cerimagic] How do you comment on the statement by war criminal Ratko Mladic, that, in his opinion, there will be even more raids by Phantoms, so that any aircraft attacking Serb positions will be downed? [Delic] Well, he is probably frank in saying so, because, according to our intelligence, the Serbs are not giving up their goal, that is, to cleanse the right bank of the Drina, and perhaps even more than that. For that reason he is implying new raids by Phantoms.... Mladic's threat that they would fire on any object flying in the airspace over the Serbs' positions is an attempt to divert NATO from carrying out any further air strikes, and also an attempt to freeze the current situation on the Gorazde front. He would be satisfied if the current situation were frozen, since he is near Gorazde, and that the Serb paramilitaries may continue to torment Gorazde with their snipers. However, our attitude is explicit and consistent: We demand that the Serb aggressor pull back to the positions that it held prior to the latest offensive.... [Cerimagic] How do you assess the role of General Rose in the Gorazde case? [Delic] General Rose is certainly in a position where at the same time he must carry out his task as a member of the international forces, and implement the policy of his country. I can see everything that he, as a commander and a man, wants to accomplish. His job is certainly very difficult. However, he should himself explain why he has taken certain actions. I was sending him information on a daily basis about preparations for the offensive against Gorazde and its course, together with concrete data on the number of shells, the directions from which the enemy troops were coming, and from which their attacks were carried out. However, the information that was forwarded to the United Nations by UNPROFOR stated that there were only skirmishes, and that there were no attacks, right up until the moment when the situation in Gorazde became worse than critical. Therefore, his conduct is probably a part of the policy pursued either by the international community or by certain countries. Not only the interests of Europe and the United States, but also some particular interests of certain European countries, are breaking over Bosnia. After NATO's intervention and the air strikes, the absurd accusation was issued that the B-H Army was shelling Serb positions. That is really absurd. The international community has bound us hand and foot by imposing the arms embargo against us so that we cannot defend ourselves. It has done the same thing to Gorazde, while at the same time doing nothing to protect the town, despite our warnings. The Gorazde zone is not only the town of Gorazde, but also the free territory of Gorazde, and at the time when the United Nations was speaking about peace in Gorazde, before the latest offensive, and when the town itself was not being so heavily shelled, our positions toward Ustipraca, Foca, Mesici, and Rogatica were being shelled. Which means that the focus of attacks was moved from the town of Gorazde to its surroundings. UNPROFOR and everybody else ought to know that the safe zone of Gorazde is much broader than the town itself, and it is supposed to be defended just as the town is. It is absurd to claim that the B-H Army, or the forces of the Eastern Bosnian Operative Group, were disregarding a cease-fire that did not even exist before the aggression. Obviously, this is an attempt to spread the blame again, which has produced very negative effects so far. We demand from the UNHCR and the international community to implement fully what they proclaimed with their resolutions. If they are not capable of doing that, they should say so publicly, and allow us to defend ourselves. I think it is about time that they did so. [Cerimagic] Can it happen that a similar situation is repeated in Bihac, where the B-H Army controls some 30 km of the railroad from Knin to Banja Luka, which is of vital interest to the Serbs? [Delic] That is already happening. Even now forces from the Knin Krajina, Banija, Lika, and Kordun, the regions pacified by the agreement between the Krajina Serbs and Croatia, are being brought in. All the relevant international factors engaged in the problem of former Yugoslavia have already been informed in time about these activities by word of mouth, as well as through letters. For instance, on Tuesday I told General de Lepresle and Mr. Akashi that uncommitted forces from the UN Protection Areas in the Knin Krajina were being redeployed in the Bihac region. Hardware and manpower are being brought in, while attacks against Bihac are being carried out even from within the UN Protection Areas. Therefore, what I said about Gorazde also applies to Bihac. By using the UN Protection Areas, the aggressor wants to force the international community to intervene. Since the international community always looks for balance and culpability on both sides, it will try to reconcile the warring factions, as it puts it, thereby making the attacker equal to the victim, and to pacify the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina in such a way. One thing is for sure, however, that if the aggressor fails to capture Gorazde, that is, to freeze the situation on the ground, the same scenario will be played out in the case of Bihac. Tomorrow the same will be done in Srebrenica and Zepa. In that way they will force the Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina to accept the state of affairs on the ground, and start talks in which we would get the short end of the stick, that is, the conditions that we demand would not be fulfilled, and what we demand is the relinquishing of territories seized by force. [Cerimagic] One can say that the aggressor is suffering military defeats as well. Their propaganda presented their defeat on the Maglaj front as an agreed withdrawal. Can you give us a short description of the action by our army? [Delic] We had a very difficult situation in Maglaj, with which the international community was familiar. We demanded from the international community, and in the first place UNPROFOR, to help Maglaj, to have at least convoys with food reach the town. However, each time UNPROFOR was halted just before the town. In the end, we started an campaign to lift the blockade. We carried out operations inside as well as outside the ring. As part of the preparations for the final lifting of the blockade, the 201st Maglaj-Vitez Brigade liberated a considerable swathe of territory southwards, toward Ljesnica, and other regions, enabling us to come as close to our forces as possible. The same thing was done by other units in the territory controlled by the 7th South Operative Group. We also prepared a push from the direction of Doboj and Gracanica, while at the same time we were planning an operation for breaking the ring around the 7th South Operative Group. Operations on such a scale cannot be planned, prepared, and carried out in a short time. By deliberately stretching the aggressor's forces and conducting raids our units broke through to the section where the 7th South Operative Group was to be unblocked. We threw in units of our 2d and 3d Corps. That was a huge amount of military force. We even planned to overrun HVO units if they obstructed our action. However, the situation that was brought about by the Washington Agreement created the opportunity for the HVO, if nothing else, to be passive and to let our forces through. The Serbian paramilitary formations already had intelligence reports on that. We have recordings of Serbian commanders demanding that their troops urgently pull out, in order to avoid being totally surrounded. Because if we had cut them off on the right bank of Bosna River, from Zavidovici to Maglaj, and on the other side from Novi Seher, two Serbian brigades would have been fully encircled. Their commander knew that. He demanded their urgent withdrawal, because it was a question of hours, rather than days. He sought a location to escape to, and he succeeded in finding one. That this is not mere boasting is shown by the results that we achieved later in the region. By deploying part of the forces that had liberated Maglaj, we also liberated territory toward Teslic, Doboj, and additional territories around Maglaj. All this proves that it was an excellently prepared military action, and I think it is high time that our people understood that one cannot instantly respond to attacks, as in the case of Gorazde. We are a serious army now. We have to plan seriously, work out, and then carry out operations. Time will produce an answer to the situation in Gorazde as well. Many serious things are happening to the Serbian aggressor in and around Gorazde. That town cannot be physically helped, but there are ways of helping it indirectly. And we are doing this. [Box, p 17] [Cerimagic] The aggressor might not have dared to attack Gorazde again, if the Rogoj, Trnovo, and Grebak passage, thorough which the fighters and people of Gorazde were getting logistic support from the free territories, had not fallen last year. How could it happen that such a vitally strategic territory was so poorly defended, and eventually fell into the hands of the aggressor? [Delic] One should know that it is a vast and rather unpopulated area. For that reason it was not possible for us to amass and deploy enough troops from the local population. The B-H Army has never had organized logistic support. Our army does not have any established logistic institutions, as is the case with the Serbian para-army that inherited from the Yugoslav People's Army everything that it needs. Throughout the war we have been organized in such a way that it is mostly local populations that defend their territory, while on Mount Igman we could not provide the manpower to defend such a vast territory. In such cases, when citizens start leaving, then the army also leaves. Unfortunately, this was the case in Trnovo. In addition, the aggressor's propaganda had a great psychological impact. Of course, there were many individual mistakes up there on Igman. For a long time there was no fighting, so in such a situation a power struggle developed, while war profiteering and smuggling bloomed. In addition, at the time we had paramilitaries among our own army, various units that were outside the system. On Igman and the Grebak passage there were 10 or so units whose names were extremely flamboyant, but actually had rather few people, and were outside the single command and control network. We have even information that some of our people were working for the enemy. True, they controlled only smaller units, but when the investigation started, they fled over to the enemy side. Among them is Nijaz Zorbic, commander of the Silver Fox unit, who fled through chetnik-controlled territories, and is reportedly in Spain now. The investigation has shown that there are even more of such people, who arbitrarily withdrew their units from the front during the offensive.
