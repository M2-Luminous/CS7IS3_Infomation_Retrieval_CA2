He said the Greek Government wants good relations with Albania, adding that it respects Albania's territorial integrity. He stressed, however, that the cornerstone of good bilateral relations is respect for the human and minority rights. Referring to Albanian-EU relations, the Foreign Ministry spokesman said Greece is obliged to tell Albania that its relations with the EU depend on respect for human rights. Bikas recalled that 350,000 Albanians live and work in Greece, thus strengthening the Albanian economy with $300 million a year.
