FBIS4-54263 "dreas103_i_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-103 Daily Report 26 May 1994 Cambodia Diplomat Says Malaysia Supplying Munitions Diplomat Says Malaysia Supplying Munitions BK2605114594 Phnom Penh AKP in English 0939 GMT 26 May 94 BK2605114594 Phnom Penh AKP English BFN [Text] Phnom Penh AKP May 26 -- Malaysia is supplying munitions to Cambodia to enable government troops to launch a major offensive to finally crush the Khmer Rouge, THE NATION quoted an Asian diplomat as saying. He said he believes Malaysia has already "arranged large quantities" of munitions for Phnom Penh, in preparation for an all out attack on the Khmer Rouge next month. The diplomat said the arms build-up is proceeding despite the fact that Cambodian leaders and the Khmer Rouge are scheduled to meet for peace talks in Beijing [as received] later this week. He said that Malaysian weaponry is sophisticated and probably the best of all Asian countries. Last week a grenade was thrown into the compound of the Malaysian embassy in Phnom Penh. Nobody was injured and damage was limited. But the attack is being linked to a report that the United States, Australia and France, which are considering supplying weapons to Cambodia, are pressuring Malaysia to join them. The envoy noted that Cambodia's first and second prime ministers, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen, had proposed to King Norodom Sihanouk that a cease-fire be called for June 13. "It is possible that government troops, with military aid from Western countries and Malaysia, will launch a massive attack on the Khmer Rouge in an effort to eliminate them before the cease-fire," he said. The three Cambodian leaders, Prince Ranariddh, Hun Sen and Chea Sim, have agreed to meet the Khmer Rouge nominal leader Khieu Samphan in Beijing on Friday. The meeting has been called by King Norodom Sihanouk with the declared objective of securing a cease in hostilities between Phnom Penh and the guerrillas who still command large tracts of the war- torn country. Khieu Samphan, according to the diplomat, is scheduled to meet King Sihanouk Wednesday in Beijing to discuss the conflict before he meets the Cambodian premiers and National Assembly Chairman Chea Sim on Friday.
