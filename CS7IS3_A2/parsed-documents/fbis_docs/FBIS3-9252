The meeting was attended by PDSR Executive President Adrian Nastase, other members of the Central Executive Bureau of this political group, members of the governments, and PDSR senators and deputies. At a news conference after the meeting, Adrian Nastase said that the PDSR meeting is indicative of the party's concern with Transylvania and its problems. He emphasized that his party has its own position on the issue of national and interethnic relations. After enumerating certain conclusions he has reached during his discussions with the economic managers in the county and with the command of the 4th Army of Transylvania, Adrian Nastase referred to the meeting's main message, which is that the PDSR wants to enhance its positions throughout the country, including in Transylvania, thus rejecting regional approaches to solving problems and favoring the promotion of a policy in accordance with the norms of social- democracy and with the requirements of our country's geostrategic environment. Adrian Nastase said that Transylvania's problems should be tackled from an angle indicative of the fact that, generally speaking, it is up to the country's government to find solutions to these problems, while the political parties should not play a mediating role. Selective and biased historism should be replaced by European standards, while the governmental and state dimension should play a greater role in tackling Transylvania's problems. Adrian Nastase said that PDSR's image should be improved and its identity as a party clearly brought to the fore. In conclusion, he said that it is important to unequivocally define the relationship between the PDSR and the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania [UDMR], particularly since there are certain UDMR positions that are incompatible with the country's Constitution and we are faced with a certain ambiguity promoted by this party. After his speech, Adrian Nastase answered the questions of journalists for more than an hour. Among the issues raised, we would like to mention the following: the local relations between the PDSR and other parties, particularly the UDMR and the Romanian National Unity Party [PUNR]; the discussions conducted by the ruling party with the opposition parties and with the parties of the governmental arch; and the problems facing the young generation and ways and means for their resolution. Answering a question about early elections, Nastase said that PDSR considers them a mistake, since they would block the economic and political mechanisms, something which would have serious consequences at the domestic and foreign level, our correspondent Adriana Olteanu reports.
