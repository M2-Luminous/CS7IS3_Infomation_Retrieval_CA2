The statement issued by the Secretariat on May 28 says the international liaison committee will urge the South Korean authorities to immediately send Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan to the North and release An Hak-sop, who are old unconverted long-term prisoners, and conduct worldwide activities for its realization. The statement says: "Old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan in South Korea were subjected to prison life for more than 30 years, but are denied repatriation to the northern half of the country for the reason that they refuse `ideological conversion,'" the statement says, adding: "An Hak-sop has been kept in prison for over 40 years for his refusal of `ideological conversion' after he was taken prisoner as a soldier of the Korean People's Army in the Korean war. "This is an undeniable violation of the Geneva Convention and a challenge to the resolutions of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations General Assembly."
