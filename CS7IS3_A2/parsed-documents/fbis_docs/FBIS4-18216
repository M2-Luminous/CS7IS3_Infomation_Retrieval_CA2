Welcoming the IRA's three-day Easter ceasefire, he insisted Sinn Fein had a right to be treated in the same way as Northern Ireland's other political parties. At a news conference in Belfast, Mr Adams sat alongside leading Sinn Fein official Martin McGuinness and said the ceasefire was a move along the road towards a lasting peace. Mr Adams said he had faxed the Prime Minister at No. 10 asking him to "authorise direct talks with Sinn Fein." These should be in the context of "clarification -- not negotiation." But he said Mr. Major was under considerable political pressure, adding: "We know that he has problems within his own party but he should take time to reflect on how the situation can be moved forward. ``The IRA's initiative creates an opportunity to break this stalemate which has been created by London's refusal to provide clarification for Sinn Fein in the same way as it has been provided to all other parties. There was now an opportunity to move on and enter into the next phase of the peace process. ``Mr. Major should see this way to be flexible. To refuse to talk, to be exclusive, to try to marginalise any section of our people, may be safe but it will not bring lasting peace,'' Mr. Adams declared. He shrugged off criticism that the ceasefire was a cynical public relations gesture, claiming that reaction was "predictable." But he stressed the vast majority of people in Ireland and Britain wanted peace and welcomed all advances in the peace process.
