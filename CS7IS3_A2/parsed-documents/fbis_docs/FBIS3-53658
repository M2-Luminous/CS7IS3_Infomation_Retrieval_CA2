Among Labor voters, there is a majority for abandoning settlements in Judaea and Samaria in return for a peace agreement. These two facts emerge from a public opinion poll by the research institute of Hanokh and Rafi Smith conducted for Labor. The poll results show that 47 percent of the Israeli public support the establishment of a Palestinian state, while 40 percent oppose this and 13 percent abstain. Among Likud supporters, 38 percent favor of the idea, and 54 percent oppose it. Distribution of stands among Labor supporters is as follows: 67 percent are for the establishment of a Palestinian state; and 23 percent are against. After studying the data, the researchers conclude that Likud supporters will agree to the establishment of a Palestinian state, provided it has agreed-upon and clear borders. The poll reveals a surprising fact regarding the readiness to leave settlements under foreign sovereignty in Judaea and Samaria -- there is only a 6-percent gap between the stands: 40 percent accept this, while 46 percent oppose. In this case too, there is a different distribution of stands between Labor and Likud supporters: 65 percent of the Likud supporters oppose the idea, while 70 percent of the Labor voters are willing to accept it. The poll, conducted at the end of December among a representative sample of the Jewish population in Israel, also shows that only 30 percent want to end the talks with the PLO at once, while 51 percent want to see the process proceed, though cautiously. Some 33 percent have a positive view of and no reservations about the Oslo agreement, while 21 percent believe that although the agreement is good, it will not bring peace. Most of those polled, both Labor and Likud supporters, believe that the key is quiet borders. An autonomy agreement that would secure quiet borders is supported by 60 percent of the Likud voters and by 99 percent of Labor voters. At the same time, if terrorists continue murdering Jews after an agreement is signed, 70 percent will regard this a failure. There was no difference between Labor and Likud voters' stands on this issue. The agreement will also be perceived as a failure if, after the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] pull out of the Gaza Strip, the PLO fails to seize control. The authors of the poll state in conclusion: Some 60 percent of the public support a cautious promotion of the peace process; the public is very sensitive to murderous terror attacks, and will not regard a peace agreement while terror continues a success; the public is split in its stands regarding the establishment of a Palestinian state and the evacuation of settlements. The Labor public relations department closely examined the poll results, and plans the party's updated public relations campaign strategy in accordance with the findings. It is clear to Labor officials that the guideline should be the claim that peace will bring security. The Labor campaigners are also clear that the fact that military men are in charge of the negotiations should be stressed to the public, hence -- the IDF will be able to defend the peace agreement and the borders it entails.
