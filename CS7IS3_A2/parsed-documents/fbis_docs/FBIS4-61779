Sokolova, identified by caption] [Excerpt] The eternal flame at the obelisk in Plesetsk is a reminder of two terrible tragedies which took place at the missile and space flight test range. In June 1973 nine people died while testing rocket technology. And in March 1980, during preparations for a space launch, a powerful explosion of the already fueled space "submarine" [submarina] occured as a result of technical faults. Forty-eight young people died at their stations. According to eye-witness accounts many of them were engulfed by fire and burned alive instantaneously. Others, finding themselves in a hopeless situation, jumped from a great height, smashing on the concrete only to be also engulfed by the raging flames. [passage omitted]
