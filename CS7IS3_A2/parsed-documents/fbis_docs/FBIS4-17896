FBIS4-17896 "drsov082_a_94058" FBIS-SOV-94-082 Daily Report 27 Apr 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS DPRK Allowance of IAEA Inspection Praised DPRK Allowance of IAEA Inspection Praised SK2804055994 Moscow Radio Moscow in Korean 1200 GMT 27 Apr 94 SK2804055994 Moscow Radio Moscow Korean BFN [From the Today's World" program] [Summary from poor reception] The DPRK has decided to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] to inspect nuclear facilities in Yongbyon near Pyongyang. This has evoked a positive reaction among countries concerned. Pyongyang had not permitted the agency's special inspection of DPRK nuclear facilities in Yongbyon, and are thus suspected of developing nuclear weapons. As the dispute over the nuclear issue of the peninsula further deteriorated, the position of some neighboring countries became more hardline. First of all, Pyongyang, Seoul, and Washington respectively assumed hardline positions. Pyongyang complained about the IAEA's unfair attitude in dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue. This made the IAEA's inspection more difficult. On the other hand, the United States and the ROK were attempting to apply pressure on Pyongyang by talking about imposing economic saanctions or resuming the Team Spirity joint military exercise. U.S. Secretary of State Cristopher said that the change in Pyongyang's position toward the IAEA's inspections is a good, positive phenomenon. Son Song-pil, DPRK ambassador to Russia, said that the IAEA inspection team scheduled to arrive in Yongbyon will be provided with all the conditions necessary for its work. We can say that such a position of Pyongyang totally corresponds not only with the interests of the DPRK itself but also with the interests of other countries.
