Seguin seems to have found further support in the person of Jean-Pierre Chevenement, the chairman of the Citizens' Movement. As a guest of France-2 television's "Hour of Truth" talk show on Sunday 8 May, Chevenement subscribed to the idea, provided that "the question is properly worded." In his opinion, this was not the case in the proposals currently being advanced by Mr. Seguin. According to the former defense minister, the question the French should be asked is the following: "Do you agree with the plan to compel companies, within a three-year period, to hire 1.5 million unemployed, who will continue to be payed by the Assedic [Association for Employment in Industry and Commerce] and will benefit from a number of training schemes?" All other political leaders have rejected the idea of holding a referendum on employment. When asked for his opinion during the "Grand Jury RTL-LE MONDE" program, Budget Minister and Government Spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy flatly rejected the proposal: "We will not succeed in strengthening the intermediary organizations by acting over their heads." He also attacked those who wanted to reduce the "passive costs associated with unemployment," that is to say, the benefits payed to the unemployed. For his part, Industry Minister Gerard Longuet expressed his reservations in an interview with NOUVELLE REPUBLIQUE published on Monday, 9 May: "Let us not lead the French people to believe that genuine reforms can only be carried out via a referendum. I am still convinced...that a government and a parliamentary majority have all the necessary legitimacy to carry out far-reaching reforms, including reforms in such sensitive areas as education, employment, and health," Mr. Longuet said. Finally, former Socialist Employment Minister Martine Aubry made fun at Mr. Seguin's proposal. "I thought it was a joke. If the intention is to ask the French people whether unemployment is their number-one concern, it is rather worrying that a referendum should be needed for this," she remarked. On Friday, 6 May, Francis Wurtz, who is heading the Communist lists in the European elections, told FORUM RMC-L'EXPRESS that, although he "favored consulting the people," he believed that Mr. Seguin's proposal "is a trap," aimed at "making the French ratify an austerity policy which, as is well known, they do not want."
