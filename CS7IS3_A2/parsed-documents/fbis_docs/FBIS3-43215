FBIS3-43215 "cr00000004794001" 28 January 1994 Article Type:FBIS Document Type:FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-010--CHINA Symposium Discusses Goals for China's Foreign Economic Relations According to research papers presented at a symposium on China's economic and trade relations, China's priorities in foreign trade are upgrading its export mix and "internationalizing" production enterprises. Symposium participants tended to see prospects for trade relations with the United States and Western countries as only fair, with Asia viewed as likely to become the focus of China's external economic development. The November issue of XIANDAI GUOJI GUANXI, an international affairs journal affiliated with the well-respected China Institute of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR), a research think tank, is devoted to papers presented at an October symposium sponsored by that institution on "China's Economy Opening to the Outside World." The papers present current thinking on the full spectrum of China's economic and trade relations with the world by participants from government, press, academic, and commercial circles. (The appendix to this Foreign Media Note lists the reported articles, authors, and affiliations represented at the symposium.) All symposium articles dealing with further opening up China's economy to the world give top priority to upgrading China's export mix by shifting away from low-profit, labor-intensive products. Chinese Academy of Social Sciences researcher Zhang Shouyi argues that a low-cost, skilled labor pool gives China a comparative advantage in "knowledge-intensive, high-tech products." Other ideas for expanding high-profit exports by other authors include improving product quality, before and after sales service, and packaging. JINGJI RIBAO journalist He Ming stresses the importance of in- country marketing agents and products responsive to consumer demand when targeting markets in advanced countries. Others at this symposium call for implementation of international standards and foreign managers in China's export enterprises to expand exports. In reforming the foreign trade regime by "internationalizing" Chinese enterprises, state-run enterprises are in the best position to upgrade their exports, gain overseas market share, and become multinational corporations. According to Wang Zhile of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation International Economic Cooperation Research Center, "Of all the regions of the world, Asia, and especially East Asia, should be the key region, the target of first choice for internationalizing Chinese enterprises." The image of Asia as China's stepping stone to the world economy is a common theme in many of the articles, but there is some ambivalence in the respective arguments supporting that view: Asia is seen both as the region of greatest potential for China's outward-oriented economic growth and as its stiffest competitor. In many cases Chinese exports are in direct competition with exports from other developing Asian economies. Moreover, low-quality exports and lack of experience in international business dealings put Chinese companies at a disadvantage in this competition. China is also see as in direct competition with ASEAN countries and Indochina for foreign investment. Nonetheless, there appears to be general agreement that China must concentrate on Asia and Asian markets, both for their high growth potential in the 9O's and to counterbalance the increasing protectionism of Western countries. With Asia, as with the world, China's strategy for economic development is to begin with sub- regional and bilateral relations and then move to multilateral and regional fora. Huang Fanzhang of the State Planning Commission Economic Research Center explains this dynamic in terms of three triangles. Huang postulates a small triangle (Mainland China- Taiwan-Hong Kong), a medium triangle (China-South Korea-Singapore and other ASEAN countries), and a large triangle (China-Japan-United States). The larger triangles have the potential for economic competition and even conflict. Huang predicts the large triangle of the Asia-Pacific will be the "main battlefield" in the U.S.-Japanese struggle for economic leadership. Huang sees areas of concern in China's economic relations with both countries. Japan doesn't want to see China become a competitor, but rather wants China to always "fly in formation" following Japan's lead. According to Huang, the United States, on the other hand, is intent on imposing its political agenda on China. Criticism of the United States along these lines is a frequent theme in the articles. CICIR analyst Ke Juhan asserts that the United States is "politicizing" the economic relationship between the two countries. Ke says that conditionality on MFN, U.S. economic reprisals based on "unwarranted accusations" of China's violation of the MTCR, U.S. anti-dumping duties against Chinese exports, and U.S. unilateral reduction of China's textile quotas have all "harmed the bilateral relationship." Yan Xuetong, also of CICIR, agrees with Ke's contentions and further states, "Hereafter the United States will continue to use every pretext, including constant use of quota limitations and anti-dumping duties, to limit China's exports to the United States." Ke Juhan urges the United States to put the relationship on a more "practical" footing, stating that President Clinton's recent "intentions, statements, and actions" are beginning to improve the economic relationship with China and predicting that as more U.S. companies become involved with China economically, they will "play an active role" in improving the bilateral relationship. Among the articles on bilateral and regional economic relations, three on Russia and Europe by CICIR analysts stand out. Wang Lijiu asserts that now is the time for China to consolidate economic relations with Russia. However, according to Wang, both countries must work to formulate a unified and coordinated trade policy. Wang also proposes setting up a Sino-Russian joint venture bank to resolve outstanding trade payment issues and calls for increased technology trade between the two countries. In an article on economic relations with Eastern Europe, Qi Degang advocates using barter trade with cash-poor Eastern European countries to edge out Western competition for those markets. Finally, Guan Shufen characterizes prospects for economic relations with Western European countries as "cautiously optimistic." Sino-German economic relations will drive overall Sino-European economic development. On the down side, however, Guan sees increasing European trade protectionism, use of anti-dumping measures to protect domestic industries, and problems in Sino-French and Sino-British bilateral relations.
