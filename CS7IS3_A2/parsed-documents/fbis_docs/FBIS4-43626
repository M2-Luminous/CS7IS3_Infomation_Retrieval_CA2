According to the joint communique, France is establishing all the necessary diplomatic contacts. The French forces, together with those of African and Western countries, which will join them, will carry out their mission until the UNAMIR, the UN Mission in Rwanda, is in a position to carry out the mandate given by the Security Council. France has now decided to act with the help of its natural allies.
