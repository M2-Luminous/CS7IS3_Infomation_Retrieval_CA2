The province recorded a record of 2.6 billion Swiss francs-worth of border trade with Russia last year, up 30 percent from the previous year and almost eight times the figure for 1987, according to Cai Kaifu, chief of the provincial border trade administrative bureau. The province, sharing a 3,05-km border with Russia, enjoys a roaring trade with that country. Seizing the opportunities created by China's opening and reforms, the province has quickened its steps in promoting its border trade. It has hosted four annual provincial trade fairs since 1990, which have drawn business people from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macao, Eastern European countries, Russia and other members of the CIS. The province has so far opened 21 border cities. With its easy access to Russia and other neighboring countries, the province has attracted more than 6,000 enterprises from over 100 cities in China. They have set up trade offices and export products to Russia. The province now exports more than 4,000 varieties of goods to Russia, whereas only a dozen kinds of exports were available in 1987. Motor vehicles, airplanes and mechanical products take up 80 percent of the province's total imports. Meanwhile, exports of grain, edible oil and canned food in 1993 were twice the previous year's figures, but there was a slight drop in exports of garments and shoes. Economic co-operation with the CIS involved one billion Swiss francs last year, three times the previous year's figure. So far, more than 5,000 border trade companies of the province have co-operation partners all over the CIS.
