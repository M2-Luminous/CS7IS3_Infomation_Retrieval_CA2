He says it is an insult to the international community and makes a mockery of attempts to reestablish democracy in Haiti: [Begin Maraj recording] We certainly will not recognize the new president. We think it a mockery, a mockery, a political mockery, and certainly the only president of Haiti that we recognize is President Aristide. [end recording] The Haitian military and the promilitary parliament appointed the head of Haiti's Supreme Court as a provisional president. This is seen as an act of defiance of the U.N. Security Council ruling, the penalty for which could be military intervention. [Begin Maraj recording] If indeed the United Nations takes a certain course of action, Trinidad and Tobago will do whatever it can and give very serious consideration to making any kind of contribution within its means to support any U.N. initiative in the solution of this Haitian crisis. [end recording] Although the foreign minister says he would not like to see military intervention take place in Haiti, he says it is a last option and it may have to be considred, in the final analysis. [Begin Maraj recording] Democracy has been on the march. We have just witnessed a dismantling of apartheid and the establishment of the first step toward a democratic way of life in South Africa. We cannot allow Haiti to continue like this. We must develop a strong and positive approach and do what is necessary at the multilateral level to deal with the situation. [end recording]
