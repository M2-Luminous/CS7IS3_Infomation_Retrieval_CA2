He said as follows: The statement of our Foreign Ministry proposing negotiations to the U.S. side for the establishment of a new peace assurance system [pyonghwa pojang chegye] that will replace the present Korean armistice system has evoked great repercussions upon the world public. The South Korean authorities, however, are trying hard to decry [hwebang] it. The unification and foreign ministers of South Korea made a fuss, claiming that the establishment of a peace assurance system is a matter that must be discussed between the North and the South, not between us and the United States, and that the proposal is a negotiation card to get concessions at the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. Such remarks by the South Korean authorities are an obtrusive and imprudent act of those oblivious of their lot. The republic's government proposed this time to the United States that the two countries hold negotiations for the establishment of a new peace assurance system, taking into account the legal and practical conditions that the United States is a signatory to the armistice agreement and it is in actuality holding the military prerogative in South Korea. The South Korean authorities categorically opposed the signing of the Korean armistice agreement at the time of its conclusion and now have no complete military prerogative in South Korea, so they have no authority or qualification for participating in peace negotiations. The replacement of the Korean armistice agreement with a peace agreement and the establishment of a new peace assurance system that will replace the present armistice mechanism are urgent problems raised by the present situation on the Korean peninsula. Such complicated problems as the nuclear issue have cropped up on the Korean peninsula because the United States shipped nuclear and other weapons of mass-destruction into South Korea in violation of the armistice agreement and the tensions are now mounting because the United States is accelerating an arms buildup and increasing the military threat to us. This shows that the present Korean armistice agreement and armistice mechanism are incapable of preventing arms buildup and recurrence of war and preserving peace on the Korean peninsula. To terminate the state of truce that causes only political distrust and military confrontation and establish a new peace assurance system at an early date is the only way of easily solving the pending issues between the DPRK and the United States including the nuclear issue. A North-South agreement with nonaggression as its keynote has been adopted and a North-South joint military committee pursuant to it has been organized. So the establishment of a new peace assurance system would facilitate their effectuation and, further, the problem of preserving a durable peace on the Korean peninsula would be resolved completely. In mid-April the South Korean authorities revoked the exchange of presidential envoys between the North and the South as a precondition for the DPRK-U.S. talks, saying that if the DPRK-U.S. talks were promoted, replacement of the armistice agreement with a peace agreement would be put on the agenda and then the North-South dialogue will go well. But now they blindly oppose our practical proposal for replacing the armistice agreement with a peace agreement. This makes it plain that the South Korean authorities are fickle [pyondok suroun] and have no clear principle concerning the peace and reunification of the Korean peninsula and blow hot and cold. What they are advised to do is to refrain from following a big power and imprudently poking their nose into others affairs.
