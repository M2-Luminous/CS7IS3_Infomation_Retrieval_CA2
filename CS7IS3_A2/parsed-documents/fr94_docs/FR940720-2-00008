FR940720-2-00008 FR940720-2-00005 Seamless line pipes are intended for the conveyance of oil and natural gas or other fluids in pipe lines. Seamless line pipes are produced to the API 5L specification. Seamless pipes are commonly produced and certified to meet ASTM A&hyph;106, ASTM A&hyph;53 and API 5L specifications. Such triple certification of pipes is common because all pipes meeting the stringent A&hyph;106 specification necessarily meet the API 5L and ASTM A&hyph;53 specifications. Pipes meeting the API 5L specification necessarily meet the ASTM A&hyph;53 specification. However, pipes meeting the A&hyph;53 or API 5L specifications do not necessarily meet the A&hyph;106 specification. To avoid maintaining separate production runs and separate inventories, manufacturers triple certify the pipes. Since distributors sell the vast majority of this product, they can thereby maintain a single inventory to service all customers. The primary application of ASTM A&hyph;106 pressure pipes and triple certified pipes is in pressure piping systems by refineries, petrochemical plants and chemical plants. Other applications are in power generation plants (electrical-fossil fuel or nuclear), and in some oil field uses (on shore and off shore) such as for separator lines, gathering lines and metering runs. A minor application of this product is for use as oil and gas distribution lines for commercial applications. These applications constitute the majority of the market for the subject seamless pipes. However, A&hyph;106 pipes may be used in some boiler applications. The scope of these investigations includes all multiple-stenciled seamless pipe meeting the physical parameters described above and produced to one of the specifications listed above, whether or not also certified to a non-covered specification. Standard, line and pressure applications are defining characteristics of the scope of these investigations. Therefore, seamless pipes meeting the physical description above, but not produced to the A&hyph;106, A&hyph;53, or API 5L standards shall be covered if used in an A&hyph;106, A&hyph;335, A&hyph;53 or API 5L application. For example, there are certain other ASTM specifications of pipe which, because of overlapping characteristics, could potentially be used in A&hyph;106 applications. These specifications include A&hyph;162, A&hyph;192, A&hyph;210, A&hyph;333, and A&hyph;524. When such pipes are used in a standard, line or pressure pipe application, such products are covered by the scope of these investigations. Specifically excluded from these investigations are boiler tubing, mechanical tubing and oil country tubular goods except when used in a standard, line or pressure pipe application. Also excluded from these investigations are redraw hollows for cold-drawing when used in the production of cold-drawn pipe or tube. Although the HTS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of these investigations is dispositive. Request for Comments From Interested Parties The scope contained in the petitions, which has been slightly clarified in the above ``Scope of Investigations'' section, contains the clause that products used in standard, line or pressure pipe applications be included in the scope, regardless of whether they meet A&hyph;106, A&hyph;335, A&hyph;53 or API 5L standards. Implementing this clause would require some type of end-use certification. Given the burden on Customs and the difficulty involved in administering end-use certifications, the Department generally avoids end-use as a scope criterion. See Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Alloy and Carbon Hot-Rolled Bars, Rods, and Semifinished Products of Special Bar Quality Engineered Steel from Brazil, 58 FR 31496 (June 3, 1993). However, because petitioner has alleged that circumvention may occur if end-use is not part of any order resulting from these investigations, we are requesting comments regarding end-use as a criterion for the scope of these investigations. Petitioner has based its allegation on circumstances that occurred in the investigations of Preliminary Affirmative Determination of Scope Inquiry on Antidumping Duty Orders on Certain Circular Welded Non-Alloy Steel Pipe from Brazil, the Republic of Korea, and Mexico, 59 FR 1929 (January 13, 1994). Petitioner has identified specific possible substitution products for the scope merchandise. Petitioner has also indicated that, while it is not aware at this time of substitution occurring, it may occur in the future should antidumping duties be assessed on seamless standard, line and pressure pipe. Therefore, we are including end-use in the scope for purposes of initiation; however, we intend to consider its appropriateness further and we invite comments from interested parties regarding the scope information presented above under the ``Scope of Investigations'' section of this notice. Specifically, we will examine comments that address ``end-use'' as a scope criterion. Interested parties are invited to comment on the following: (1) Whether or not end-use is an appropriate criterion for the merchandise described in the ``Scope of Investigations'' section of this notice; (2) how the Department would be informed when substitution is occurring, i.e. , a trigger mechanism; (3) at what point the Department should implement suspension of liquidation and use of end-use certificates for products meeting the physical parameters described in the scope other than those stenciled A&hyph;106, A&hyph;335, A&hyph;53 and/or API 5L; (4) what specific characteristics or factors the Department should evaluate regarding end-use as a scope criterion; (5) what information should be provided on an end-use certificate; (6) precise details as to how the Department and Customs should administer any antidumping duty orders that result from these investigations given end-use as a scope criterion; and (7) the universe of products that could possibly be substituted for the subject merchandise. Finally, we invite comments from parties on whether the products within the scope of these investigations constitute more than one class or kind of merchandise. Parties should include an analysis using the following factors: (1) The physical characteristics of the merchandise; (2) the expectations of the ultimate purchaser; (3) the channels of trade; (4) the ultimate use of the product; and (5) the cost. Parties interested in commenting on the items mentioned above should submit their comments no later than close of business October 21, 1994. Rebuttal comments will be accepted no later than close of business October 31, 1994. United States Price and Foreign Market Value For purposes of these initiations, no adjustments were made to petitioner's calculations. If it becomes necessary at a later date to consider these petitions as a source of best information available (BIA), we may review all of the bases for the petitioner's estimated dumping margins in determining BIA. Argentina For Argentina, petitioner based United States price (USP) on U.S. price quotes to an end-user. Petitioner made adjustments for transportation and insurance charges, port and handling charges, and U.S. duties paid. Petitioner adjusted USP to account for the tax levied on seamless pipe in the home market. Petitioner also calculated the amount of the tax adjustment that was due solely to the inclusion of price deductions in the original tax base. Petitioner based foreign market value (FMV) on home market prices to end-users. Petitioner made adjustments for distributor mark-up, transportation, home market taxes, and a tax offset to account for the amount of tax that was due solely to the inclusion of price deductions in the original tax base.
