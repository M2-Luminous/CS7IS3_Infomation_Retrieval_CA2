The CSCE was asked to take a stance on the issue by the Russian Foreign Ministry. The law, which sets hard conditions for acquiring Latvian citizenship, is a thorn in the flesh of the strong Russian minority living in the country. CSCE spokesman told journalists that the Latvian delegate to the Prague session, Ivars Pundurs, did not rule out that his government would make certain changes in the law. CSCE commissioners accepted this stance with satisfaction, the spokesman said.
