Vasyl Kukurichka has more details. [Kukurichka] As is known, the Polish National Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk was on an official visit in Ukraine from 6-8 April. At a joint news conference for Ukrainian and foreign correspondents, Ukraine's Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy summed up the results of the visit by the high guest from the neighboring state. [Begin Radetskyy recording] Mr. Kolodziejczyk visited Ukraine for the first time ever in his capacity as leader of the military department of the Republic of Poland. But contacts between our defense ministries at such a level already have a certain history. This is the best proof of the fact that relations in the military sphere between Ukraine and Poland are developing dynamically and fruitfully. The two neighbors have much in common. They have a common history and struggle for independence. Today, they share a mutual understanding in approaches toward issues of security in Europe and the world in general. This is the aspiration to democracy, a balanced stand in relation to acceding to new European structures, participation in peacemaking forces, and so on. A significant number of Poles reside in Ukraine and Ukrainians in Poland, which, of course, is nearly the most important factor, among others, of the mutual interest in developing relations. We regard the Republic of Poland in the new Europe as our strategic partner. [word indistinct] that in Warsaw they have similar views of Ukraine. For example, President Lech Walesa declared that a free Poland is impossible without an independent Ukraine. I am pleased to point out that military contacts occupy one of the important places in the development of relations between our states. They were initiated as far back as last year, when the Ukrainian Defense Ministry and the Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of Poland signed an agreement on cooperation in the military sphere. I believe that the current visit to Ukraine by my counterpart was fruitful. Throughout the three days the minister had useful meetings: with Ukraine's President Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk, at the Cabinet of Ministers, at the Defense Ministry, at the Foreign Affairs Ministry, and at the Ministry of Machine-Building, Military-Industrial Complex, and Conversion. There were a number of conversations equally important for both our states. Also, the Polish defense minister familiarized himself with certain aspects of military construction and military personnel training during his visit to the Kiev Military Institute of Control and Communication. Having looked round the Antonov scientific and technical aviation center, my counterpart had an opportunity to familiarize himself with the scientific potential of our country. During the visit, we considered quite a few important issues, from broadening and deepening bilateral military contacts, to our states' participation in creating a European security system. The latter is important because our states are situated in the heart of Europe, therefore stability on the European continent and in general depend in full measure on stability in this region. Poland and Ukraine were among the first to join the Partnership for Peace program. This shows that we are striving for sincere goodneighborly relations with all countries participating in this project. And the program proposed by the U.S. President makes it possible to establish mutually advantageous relations between independent states. The minister and I exchanged opinions on the partnership program. And I want to emphasize that our views regarding their significance and prospects for implementing them on the whole coincide. This concerns such issues as joint participation in peacemaking operations, standardization of armaments, determining military measures and (?forces) with regard to participation in this program, tactics, and so on. In general, we are putting a considerably deeper content into the Partnership for Peace program and view it as a principle of European security (?at levels of) mutual relations between neighboring states, of regional security, for example in the central-eastern part of the continent, and of general security as a way of creating a new structure of European security. On the whole, the implementation of the Partnership for Peace program will, in our view, make it possible to create additional conditions to achieve full disarmament and strengthen peace on our planet. As far as the prospects for cooperation between the military departments of Ukraine and Poland are concerned, they encompasss a number of issues. The cooperation plan for this year envisages the exchange of delegations and of experience in developing armed forces and training of military specialists. Work in the field of military equipment is also envisaged. I think that during the Kiev meetings with the minister we have further deepened relations between our ministries and between our countries as a whole. So if military bridges are being made and strengthened, this testifies to the healthy and openhearted relations between the states. So, may I express my (?certainty) that friendly interest and mutual respect will dominate in future relations between Ukraine and the Poland. [end recording] [Kukurichka] In his turn, Polish Defense Minister Kolodziejczyk noted: [Begin Kolodziejczyk recording, in Polish with superimposed Ukrainian translation] I want to emphasize once again that the fundamental principle of Poland's foreign policy is to have the closest possible relations with neighboring states. Ukraine is a very important neighbor for us, if only because our joint border is over 500 kilometers long. Your state possesses huge intellectual potential, the Ukrainian land contains the inexhaustible wealth of useful minerals, and your industry has mastered the most complex technologies. [end recording] [Kukurichka] In the opinion of Poland's defense minister, relations between our states our good. He confirmed that cooperation with Ukraine in the field of modernizing military equipment, repairing fighting vehicles and providing them with spare parts is of special interest to Poland. Ukraine's and Poland's defense ministers replied to a number of questions from journalists. This is Vasyl Kukurichka, Radio Ukraine World Service.
