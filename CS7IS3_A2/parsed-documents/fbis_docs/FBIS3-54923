The decision who will be the occupant of the Russian White House appears finally to have been made: The prime minister's secretariat and other government offices have already started to move to the building of the former Russian Federation Supreme Soviet. At the same time, we learn, the economic services of the president's administration are preparing to move into the premises that are being vacated in Staraya Square. The plan that is taking shape, showing the locations of the country's supreme organs of authority, looks both familiar and symbolic. The government is increasing the distance between itself and the Kremlin, as if stressing thereby the trend toward autonomy. The familiar buildings in Staraya Square are being occupied by administrative structures whose official status is only very vaguely delineated in existing legislation but which, since the adoption of the Constitution, possess real power in the country, indeed the fullest power, including the potential to influence the government. Essentially, the relocation of the federal authorities symbolizes the end of the creation of the new system of state government in Russia, predetermined by the adopted Constitution. A system of strong apparatus authority, in which not only all the executive structures are under the control of the president's administration. Suffice it to recall that approximately a month ago an administration of affairs was formed in the administration, and it has the right to dispose of federal property, including the buildings that house the federal legislative, executive, and judicial authorities. Judging by the recently published presidential edict on state service, the president's administration also decides the fate of all federal officials, not only government, but parliamentary and judicial as well. Maybe this system will play a positive role at the present stage, in the situation connected with the results of the parliamentary elections. But there are too many fears that it could soon turn into a closed, self-sufficient system, intent only on remaining in power. In that event it is not particularly difficult to predict victory at future parliamentary and presidential elections for forces ideologically close to the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] or the Communists. As a voters' protest against the recreation of an essentially administrative edict model, which was supposed to have been eliminated once and for all following August 1991. But the chief paradox, it seems, is that such a victory would suit the system. Obviously, the delay in the long-awaited presidential edict on the reorganization of the Council of Ministers should be viewed in this light, in the light of the fact that the new program for the government's activities will be determined not by the election results but by the results of the referendum, not by the distribution of forces in parliament but by the distribution of forces in the President's Administration's apparatus. The objective need for a reshuffle in the government is brought about by the results of the parliamentary elections. But the final decision will presumably be made after the official cause of the defeat has been found. When it has been established that the elections were lost either because of a split in the government, or because of a badly organized election campaign, or because of the government's incorrect economic policy. Essentially, though, it can be said that there is a struggle between the leadership of the President's Administration and the head of the government for control over the Council of Ministers. But since the forces in this struggle can be regarded as approximately equal, consequently one should not really expect any major changes in personnel in the Cabinet of Ministers. You can be sure that that the number of vice premiers' posts will be significantly reduced. Probably to two or three. Of course, it is too early to talk about personalities, but there are grounds for believing that the distribution of forces that existed before the elections will be retained on the whole. So there is no reason to believe that after the reshuffle the government's activities will change significantly or, equally, that its economic policy will change significantly. As far as one can judge from available information, all cadre decisions relating to changes in the government are planned to be made before parliament starts work. Thus presenting the deputies with a fait accompli, as in the case of the federal budget for 1994. It is not difficult to imagine what parliament's reaction will be. Deprived of a building and deprived of the right of control over government and budget, parliament is already programed for the role of center of the opposition to the executive.
