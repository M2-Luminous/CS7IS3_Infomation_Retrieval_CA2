Vorontsov, candidate of military sciences, under rubric: "To Assist Those Entering the Academy"] [Text] The system of fire, structured in accordance with the commander's concept and with consideration of capabilities of all kinds of organic and attached weapons (see diagram), is one element in aligning the battalion defense. System of Fire of Motorized Rifle Battalion in the Defense (variant) It includes the following: artillery (including mortar) concentrated and defensive fire sectors on approaches, ahead of the FEBA [Forward Edge of the Battle Area], on flanks, in gaps between company strongpoints, and in the depth of the defense; zone of fire of antitank weapons and zone of continuous multilayered fire of all kinds of weapons ahead of the FEBA, in gaps, on flanks and in the depth of the defense for destroying first and foremost enemy tanks and other armored targets; and a prepared maneuver of fire to concentrate it on any threatened sector or axis in a short time. The system of fire is structured with consideration of fire capabilities of all kinds of battalion weapons, attached weapons, and fire strikes planned by the senior commander, and in combination with manmade obstacles and natural barriers. Its basis is the fire of tanks, BMP's, ATGM's, grenade launchers and antitank guns and the direct fire of artillery with consideration of employment of the regiment's antitank reserve and mobile obstacle detachment on a likely avenue of tank approach. The necessary density of tanks, antitank weapons and BMP's, established in advance and maintained in the course of battle, is of decisive importance in achieving the goals of a modern defense. It depends above all on the makeup of the attacking enemy grouping. A battalion defense area may be assaulted by one and one-half to two battalion task forces--mechanized or tank. The expected number of tanks and IFV's (APC's) and their density are shown in the table. Table Battalion Width of Number Densities per Kilometer Task Forces Zone of Advance (km) IFV's Tanks IFV's Tanks Total Mechanized 3 39 14 13 5 18 battalion task force (3 mechanized companies, 1 tank company) Tank 3 13 42 4 14 18 battalion task force (3 tank companies, 1 mechanized company) Total - 52 56 17 19 36 In connection with the fact that capabilities of one antitank weapon permit fighting 2-3 armored targets, then based on exercise experience the density of antitank weapons per kilometer of frontage should be 6-9 to repel tank and IFV (APC) assaults. Organic battalion weapons permit creating such densities (17:3; 19:2) on likely avenues of tank approach. The effectiveness of a system of fire also depends largely on selection of firing positions on the terrain for available weapons. Their disposition in the battalion defense area should be concealed and dispersed, support the creation of fire sacks, conduct of fire to maximum range and engagement of the enemy with high-density flanking fire, cross fire and surprise close-range concentrated fire, and there should be mutual contact. Their linear disposition is inadmissible. Alternate and temporary firing positions and routes of forward movement to them are prepared for weapons in addition to the primary positions. The battalion may assign roving guns, tanks and BMP's to mislead the enemy regarding the system of fire. All weapons must be ready for wide, swift maneuver and for conducting fire at night and under other conditions of limited visibility. Organizing the system of fire is a very important duty of the battalion commander. He performs this work based on the decision made in the course of ground reconnaissance and when assigning missions to subunits and organizing coordination. In conducting ground reconnaissance, the battalion commander clarifies company fire zones, fire concentration sectors, and primary and alternate (temporary) positions of organic and attached artillery. He personally points out on the terrain firing positions and sectors of fire for tanks, BMP's (BTR's), ATGM systems and grenade launchers on the most probable avenues of enemy approach. Here, too, he gives instructions for organizing subunit small arms fire; outlines for them sectors of concentrated and defensive fire intended for securing flanks and boundaries with adjacent subunits and gaps between companies; and clarifies places for arranging fire ambushes and the lines of firing positions for the tank company and BMP-equipped motorized rifle company located in the second echelon (reserve). In assigning combat missions for first and second echelon subunits, the battalion commander indicates zones of fire, secondary sectors of fire and fire concentration sectors, what forces and assets to use to secure flanks, boundaries and gaps and who is responsible for them. The procedure for engaging the enemy on his approaching the FEBA, deploying into battle formation, launching the assault and penetrating company strongpoints, and the procedure for engaging the enemy when supporting a counterattack by the second echelon is communicated to attached artillery subunits and the mortar battery. The battalion commander assigns the grenade launcher subunit primary and alternate positions, a zone of fire, secondary sector of fire, fire concentration sectors and defensive fire lines; he assigns the antitank subunit its place in the battle formation, deployment lines, and missions which it must be ready to execute. In organizing coordination, the commander determines lines for commencing fire against the enemy from tanks, BMP's, ATGM systems, grenade launchers and other antitank weapons, and also company fire concentration sectors on the most important axes, time of commencing fire and procedure for conducting it. When the enemy comes right up to the FEBA, subunit operations are coordinated in such a way that a zone of massed, multilayered fire forms here--each point on the terrain in a zone of up to 400 m should be under effective fire. Such a zone also is created in the most important sectors ahead of the third trench. Dead ground not covered by direct fire of guns and by small arms fire is engaged by artillery and mortar fire from indirect firing positions. Readiness of the system of fire is determined by the occupation of positions by weapons, the personnel's knowledge of their missions, preparation of firing data, and availability of ammunition. The content of the system of fire is reflected in greatest detail in the battalion defense area diagram. If a subunit shifts to a defense in direct contact with the enemy, the system of fire is organized during the assignment of missions to companies for consolidating a favorable or accessible line. It is developed subsequently in accordance with the decision made for defense. COPYRIGHT: VOYENNYY VESTNIK No 2 1994
