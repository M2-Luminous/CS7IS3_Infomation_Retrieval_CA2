['Urayqat] Good evening to you. [Correspondent] The government today decided to set up a state commission of inquiry on the tragic incident that took place in Hebron. A decision was also made ordering restrictions on the movement of Kakh activists and the release of around 1,000 detainees. How do you react? ['Urayqat] The decisions fall short of what the Israeli Government is required to do, especially given that it is aware of of the expectations of the Palestinian leadership. It must be made absolutely clear that negotiations cannot possibly continue for their own sake. Any negotiations in which the settlements do not figure as the first item on their agenda will be pointless. We had expected the Israeli Government to choose between peace and settlements. We had hoped the Israeli Government would order the complete disarming of the settlers, announce its acceptance of the idea of international protection for the Palestinians and a disbandment of the settlements in Gaza as a fist step. These resolutions are procedural and do not bear on the core of an issue that is closely bound up with the peace process. [Correspondent] This evening, the Palestinian leadership is engaged in consultations following the tragic incident, especially as it may affect the peace negotiations. How does the Palestinian leadership plan to proceed on that score? ['Urayqat] As I have said, the negotiations are not an end in themselves. Negotiations are to bring peace. The Israeli Government will have to choose between peace and settlements, since the two cannot go together; they are mutually exclusive. The issue is far more serious than the Israeli or U.S. Administrations seem to think. The United States has ignored the core issue and focused on procedures like moving the talks to another site. Our opinion has been communicated to the U.S. Administration and the Israeli Government. The failure of the Israeli Government to make meaningful decisions does not bode well for the future. [Correspondent] When do you think the PLO will decide its next move on the peace process? ['Urayqat] I cannot say when. All I can tell you is that at 2000 today the meetings will begin, with the participation of PLO Executive Committee members. All are now here, as are the heads of other negotiating teams. [Correspondent] Do you think the Palestinian-Israeli talks will stop? ['Urayqat] The talks are already at a standstill. As you know, the Washington talks were supposed to go on until next Wednesday. As I have said, negotiations are not held for their own sake. The next move is now up to Rabin and the Israeli Government. They will have to choose between peace and settlements. [Correspondent] Am I to take it, then, that the PLO wants to reopen the Oslo file? ['Urayqat] Call it what you will. We are talking about an issue that has a direct bearing on our efforts to achieve peace. We are negotiating for peace. We have said time and again that settlements are a time bomb that may go off at any minute. One exploded on Friday. We cannot tell what will happen tomorrow, or the day after, or next month. The Israeli Government and the international community have a major responsibility on their hands -- the settlements and international protection for the Palestinian people. Again, negotiations in which the settlements do not figure as the first item on their agenda will be meaningless.
