It is expected that a complex of problems relating to political settlement both in Tajikistan itself, and on its border with Afghanistan, will be discussed during the talks. [Shkirando] Anatoliy Leonidovich, what role is Tajikistan currently playing in Russia's life as a whole, apart from its foreign policy? [Adamishin] In Tajikistan, a whole range of very important issues have, as it were, become interwoven, each of which directly affects the interests of Russia. Russia has made a considerable effort to extinguish the flame of civil war and find a way toward national reconciliation. [Shkirando] Incidentally, the first round of Tajik-Tajik talks has just ended. To what extent has Moscow, and in particular the Foreign Ministry, succeeded in bringing the positions of the two sides closer together? [Adamishin] The two sides have sat down round the negotiating table. This is something that we have tried to achieve several times. They have at last agreed that only a political settlement can be a route toward resolving Tajikistan's problems. [Shkirando] One of the results of the first round of talks was the statement that both sides would stop hostilities in order to step up the process of talks. However, we know that explosions are still being heard on the border with Afghanistan. [Adamishin] Regrettably, the phrasing they had there was less binding. Agreements in concrete terms are still to be concluded and, of course, serious criticisms can be made with regard to the opposition's behavior on the border. I will say this: It is necessary to continue this process to which the first Moscow round of talks has given a powerful impetus. [Shkirando] What concrete results can be expected of Emomali Rakhmonov's visit to Moscow? [Adamishin] I think all these problems will be discussed -- the problems of domestic political reforms in Tajikistan, of finding a common language with the opposition, of economic cooperation between Tajikistan and Russia, the problem of strengthening the border which is the border of the entire CIS -- this is in fact our border because, as I sometimes say, we have no other border between there and the Arctic Ocean, which requires defending. But there such factors are in play as arms smuggling, drug trafficking, and so on and so forth. This should be constantly borne in mind in order to realize the entire complexity of the situation in Tajikistan. Finally, the problem of the Russian-speaking population: Its numbers are decreasing in Tajikistan but they are still not small enough to be negligible. In a word, the whole gamut of our cooperation and involvement of the peacemaking forces will be the subject of the talks between the two heads of state.
