Ma Liesun, who was vice-chairman of the Ningxia Regional Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and member of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee before being arrested, was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment and deprived of his political rights for four years for being guilty of intentional murder and unlawfully manufacturing and buying guns and ammunition in plotting gang fighting. Ma Fuli, who was associate professor at the Ningxia Education College before being arrested, was sentenced to life imprisonment and deprived of his political rights for life for being guilty of intentional murder and unlawfully manufacturing guns and ammunition in plotting, organizing and commanding gang fighting. Ma Jie, who was a lecturer at the Northwest No. 2 Nationalities Institute before being arrested, was found guilty of intentional murder and unlawfully manufacturing and buying guns and ammunition in plotting, organizing and commanding gang fighting and was sentenced to 20 years in jail with his political rights deprived for five years. And for the same crimes, Ma Rucheng, who was a farmer in Xiazhai Township in Xiji County before being arrested, was sentenced to life imprisonment with his political rights deprived for life. Meanwhile, 18 other criminals were sentenced to three to 14 years behind bars, and another one was released. The gang fighting case in Xiji County was examined in open trial earlier this month by the Guyuan Prefectural Intermediate People's Court, which issued verdicts on February 3 and 6. During the given period, the defendants did not appeal to the higher court and the procuratorial organs did not show disagreement with the court's judgments. Accordingly, by February 19, the verdicts became effective. It was learned that from May 1992, Ma Liesun, Ma Rucheng, Ma Fuli, Ma Jie and others time and again organized gang fighting and revenge despite warnings from the local government and Communist Party committee. As a result, 49 people died, two are still missing and another 30 were injured. To prepare for gang fighting, they were also found unlawfully manufacturing and buying guns and ammunition. In the end, the police confiscated 5,442 guns, of which two were for military use, 7,362 bullets, of which 310 were for military use, 21 self-made cannons and 118 self-made shells and bombs from the two sides involved in gang fighting. During the trial, the defendants were found violating the criminal law and they pleaded guilty in front of evidences.
