Jamaican Ambassador to Colombia Mattew Antoni Cox Beaubrun and Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin signed the document restating both governments' desire to jointly manage marine resources. According to the document, the common area excludes the maritime zone around the Serranilla and Bajo Nuevo Banks because, in accordance with international law, that area is considered to be part of Colombian territory. In this manner, Colombia and Jamaica will be able to exploit the reserves or hydrocarbon fields that might be found in the designated area, and which might intersect the maritime border. The treaty, ratified on 14 March, was signed in Kingston, Jamaica on 12 November 1993, after 19 years of negotiations between representatives from both nations. Known as the Sanin-Robertson Treaty, the agreement establishes a maritime delimitation line between Colombian territory, a common area located between the San Andres and Providence Archipelago, and Jamaican territory. President Cesar Gaviria called the agreement "historic," and noted: "It will not only mark our boundaries in the Caribbean sea, but it will make us true neighbors."
