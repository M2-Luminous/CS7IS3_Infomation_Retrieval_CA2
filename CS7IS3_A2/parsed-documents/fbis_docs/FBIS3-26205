When meeting with Premier Zhou, he said with deep feelings that during his visit he had found that China had traversed a long journey and had made great progress. Premier Zhou answered: We still have a long way to go. The Chinese are a modest people, and they normally do not brag about their own achievements to foreigners. Speaking realistically, China remains a developing country with a huge population, and still faces the extremely arduous task of modernization. Therefore, it has formulated a long-term development strategy with economic construction as its central task, and China is determined to improve its people's material and cultural lives through the unswerving efforts of several generations of people. Although time now has come to the nineties, as Premier Zhou said in the past, the Chinese people still have a long way to go. On the other hand, in retrospect, new China indeed has made substantial progress, which also should be appraised realistically and should not be denied. China has made great progress and has further efforts still to make. This is the actual condition of the country, and this is also the case in the field of human rights. Old China was bullied and humiliated by foreign powers, and the people did not have any independent political or other rights while living under colonial and semicolonial conditions. Innumerable people were killed in continuing disastrous wars, and human rights were just empty talk in such circumstances. Fundamental changes were brought about by the success of the Chinese revolution and the establishment of the People's Republic, and only after that could the people's lives and safety really be guaranteed and the nation move onto to the path of development. The liberation of China turned human rights into reality in the country. By comparison, in today's world, "genocide" is still occurring in some European countries, and human life is treated there as if it were not worth a straw; "social purification" occurred in South America, and a large number of street urchins were mistreated and killed. If they were to see this, all justice-upholding people might not underestimate the progress China has made in the aspect of human rights. China's reform and opening beginning in 1978 was another emancipation. In the last 15 years, with the high-speed economic growth, the people's living standards have been enhanced, the legal system gradually has been perfected, the market mechanism has been fostered, the scope of human and material movements has been broadened, and the people's freedom and rights have been improved in many aspects. No person who holds an objective and fair attitude will deny all these facts. China is making continuing efforts to improve human rights conditions, but this is, first of all, China's own affair. The Chinese people deeply believe that advancing along this course of maintaining stability and developing the economy, greater progress certainly will be made in the aspect of human rights. Different nations view human rights in different ways, and all nations have yet to improve their own human rights conditions in various aspects. They may conduct dialogue and exchanges on this issue, thus promoting each other's improvement of human rights conditions. For example, in the United States, the social status and human rights conditions of national minorities still need to be improved; there are an increasing number of single-parent families, and the rights of their members should be looked after. The United States, however, pursues double standards and often tries to interfere in China's internal affairs under the pretext of human rights. This will do absolutely nothing good for the improvement of China's human rights. If the issue of human rights is linked with trade and if Sino-U.S. bilateral trade is harmed for this reason, the situation will not be in the economic interests of the United States itself, and also will do no good for the improvement of its domestic conditions.
