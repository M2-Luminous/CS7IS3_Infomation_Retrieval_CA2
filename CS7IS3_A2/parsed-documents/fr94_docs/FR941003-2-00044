FR941003-2-00044 FR941003-2-00031 This notice with comment period implements a provision of section 1928 of the Act. Specifically, this notice with comment period announces interim regional maximum charges that providers may impose for administering pediatric vaccines to Federally vaccine-eligible children under the VFC Program. Section 1928 of the Act directs the Secretary to establish regional maximum fees. As discussed in section II. B of this notice, HCFA contracted with the American Academy of Pediatrics to conduct a survey to obtain national charge data for the administration of pediatric vaccines. HCFA used this data to develop a national charge amount and then adjusted this amount to take into account regional variations to establish a charge for each State. The GPCIs established for the Medicare physician fee schedule were used to make this adjustment. Universal Purchase States have the flexibility to accept the maximum charges developed by HCFA or to develop their own maximum charges. HCFA is also permitting State Medicaid agencies to develop a lower administration fee than the maximum charge if they can demonstrate equal access for children to the vaccines. The impact of implementing the provision of section 1928(c)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act is discussed further below. We do not believe that this provision will have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities. To the extent that a legislative provision being implemented by a notice such as this may have a significant effect on recipients or providers or may be viewed as controversial, we believe that we should address any potential concerns. In this instance, it is difficult to predict what the fiscal impact of this notice will be. There are several unknown factors. Among them are the number of program-eligible providers who will elect to administer the vaccines. In addition, State Medicaid agencies are not required to pay the maximum charges. State Medicaid agencies may establish and apply lower vaccine administration fees if they document that Medicaid children have access to immunizations to the same extent as the general population. Given the availability of free vaccines and the fact that State payments for all pediatric and obstetrical services, including, presumably, vaccine administration, have for some time been subject to access demonstration requirements under 42 CFR 447.204 and sections 1902(a)(30)(A) and 1926 of the Act, we believe that a large proportion of States will be able to demonstrate equal access for Medicaid-eligible children at rates lower than the maximum charges. In addition, should a State Medicaid agency not be able to demonstrate equal access at its current rates, the State Medicaid agency would only have to increase its rates to where there would be equal access. The publication of the maximum charge schedule will certainly create pressure in States with vaccine administration fees for Medicaid-eligible children lower than the maximums to raise those fees. However, to the extent that these States can provide the required assurances, they will not need to raise their fees. (Currently, it appears that most States pay for vaccine administration under Medicaid at rates well below the proposed maximum. This is allowable under the statute.) Hence, the magnitude of any increase in Medicaid outlays is difficult to ascertain. Because of the pre-existing equal access demonstration requirements, we find it hard to estimate how much of any increase in charges would be attributable to the specific guidelines of this notice and how much would occur without publication of the notice. We invite public comment on the impact of both the equal access assurances and anticipated fee increases. We are providing a voluntary regulatory flexibility analysis because of the large number of children and providers who may be affected. Normally, a regulatory flexibility analysis requires the agency to discuss various alternatives to the provisions in a notice. As discussed above, however, HCFA is implementing the provisions of section 1928(c)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act. The focus of this legislation is upon expanding the number of children who are eligible to receive free pediatric vaccines. We have provided State Medicaid agencies with an option of using a lower fee than the maximum charges set forth in this notice or using a charge established by a Universal Purchase State at their option if they can demonstrate equal access of children to the pediatric vaccines. Because indicated Congressional intent was to expand the coverage for vaccines, we believe that permitting State Medicaid agencies to use a lower fee where they can demonstrate equal access of children to the pediatric vaccines is consistent with the statute. In addition, we note that this option, if utilized by State Medicaid agencies, will cost Federal and State governments less money than if the State Medicaid agencies were using the maximum regional charges as set forth in this notice, while simultaneously achieving Congress' goal. A brief summary of the impact of the provisions of this notice with comment period upon various groups is provided below. 1. Providers Each program-registered provider who administers a qualified pediatric vaccine is entitled to receive the vaccine without charge either for the vaccine or its delivery to the provider. This notice specifically establishes maximum regional charges for providers to administer the vaccines. As a result of these maximum regional charges, we believe that the number of providers who may be willing to administer the vaccines would be maintained or increased. In addition to a potential increase in the number of providers who may be willing to administer these vaccines, there may be an increase in the number of patients that they treat since section 1928 of the Act expands the number of children who are eligible to receive the vaccine without charge. 2. Children The greatest benefit of this provision is that it expands the number of children who are eligible to receive pediatric vaccines without charge for the vaccines. We believe that there will be an increase in the number of children receiving pediatric vaccines. As the number of children who are vaccinated increases, we believe that savings will accrue as a result of a decline in the number of children who will require treatment for vaccine-preventable illnesses.
