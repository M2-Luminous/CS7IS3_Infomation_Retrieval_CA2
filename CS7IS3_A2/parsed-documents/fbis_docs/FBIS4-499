To be co-ordinated by the Independent Mediation Services of South Africa [IMSSA], the investigation will focus on further arms sales and the position of surplus arms in Eskom in relation to security, the possibility of some employees within Eskom supporting destabilisation, and political conflict within Eskom in relation to possible interruption of electricity supplies. Eskom said it and the three trade unions were drawing up terms of reference for submission to the IMSSA commission of inquiry. Last month, two Eskom employees were suspended after they apparently concluded a deal to sell scores of surplus weapons from the company to the kwaZulu Police.
