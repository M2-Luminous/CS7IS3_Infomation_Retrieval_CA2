An AP dispatch reported that according to UN officials the main topics to be discussed will be human rights and the end of hostilities. A UN statement said UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali set the dates for the next meeting after consulting with the Guatemalan government and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) guerrillas. On 14 February, a Guatemalan Government official said the negotiations between the government and the leftist guerrillas could produce a peace agreement by the end of the year. Three years of negotiations for peace in Guatemala have yielded limited results so far. Of an 11-point plan prepared in 1991, only partial results have been achieved on one subject: the country's democratization. The next round of talks will center on the human rights issue and the end of hostilities, according to the sources. The guerrilla war in Guatemala has already lasted 34 years and claimed 130,000 lives. The debate about the creation of a commission for investigating violations of human rights has been a serious obstacle in previous negotiation efforts.
