In the course of Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev's visit to the United States from February 13-17 "the parties did not even raise this issue," Zhukeyev reported in his interview with Interfax on Thursday. The adviser voiced this statement due to the assertions of the Iranian admiral Ali Shamakhin who declared in his interview with the Tehran newspaper Dzhumkhurne Islami early this week that Kazakhstan invites the Americans to ensure an American military presence on the Caspian Sea. Zhukeyev underlined that Kazakhstan does not plan to bring about the presence of American naval forces or involvement of Americans as military advisers on the Caspian Sea. At the same time he did not rule out the possibility that the republic's leadership would address the United States for consultation concerning creation of Kazakhstan's coast guard service on the Caspian Sea. "Americans have great experience in this sphere and currently Kazakhstan faces these problems with respect to the Caspian Sea," said Zhukeyev. The state adviser also reported that at present, the Kazakh and Russian governments are defining plans to jointly guard CIS sea border on the Caspian Sea.
