The Basic Procuratorial Work Situation in 1993 Under the leadership of the supreme procuratorate and the provincial party committee, under the supervision of the people's congress standing committees at various levels, and with the support of the governments, in 1993, the procuratorial organs at various levels conscientiously implemented the guidelines of the 14th party congress, the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee, the party Central Committee's instructions on waging the anticorruption struggle, and the resolutions on the work report of the provincial procuratorate as adopted at the first session of the eighth provincial people's congress; positively engaged themselves in the anticorruption struggle; dealt strict blows to the corrosive elements who were indulged in corruption and malpractice and serious criminal offenders; strengthened the self-construction of the procurator contingents; better fulfilled the anticorruption tasks; and made new progress in the procuratorial work in other aspects. A. Major Achievements in Procuratorial Work a. The procuratorial organs sternly punished the economic criminals, including those engaged in corruption and bribery; and forcefully promoted the deep progress of the anticorruption struggle. The procuratorial organs across the province accepted and handled 6,039 economic cases of various categories, put 3,777 cases on file, and investigated and concluded 3,478 cases or 82.2 percent. A total of 95.448 million yuan of economic losses were retrieved, an increase of 33,588,600 yuan over the previous year. We resolutely implemented the party Central Committee's unified arrangement for waging the anticorruption struggle; constantly focused our efforts on investigating and handling cases of corruption and bribery, the criminal cases of four major departments, and major and appalling cases; and made noticeable achievements. Of the economic criminal cases that were put on file for investigation, 1,877 were cases of corruption and bribery, accounting for 49.69 percent of the total. A total of 1,818 cases each involving 10,000 yuan or more were put on file for investigation, an increase of 46.97 percent. Of this, nine were extraordinarily serious cases each involving more than 1 million yuan (six were cases of diverting public funds for other use and three were cases of corruption.) Sixty-three cases involving the cadres at or above the county and section level were put on file for investigation (three were cases involving the cadres at or above the department level), an increase of 57.5 percent over the previous year. A total of 158 criminal cases involving the four key departments were put on file for investigation. We conscientiously implemented the central policy decision on strengthening the macroeconomic regulation and control and consolidating the financial order and dealt strict blows to the economic criminal offenders who disturbed and damaged the socialist market economic order. A total of 700 cases of tax evasion and tax resistance were put on file for investigation and 14,851,900 yuan of evaded taxes were withdrawn. Seventy-six cases of fake trademarks were placed on file for investigation, an increase of 22.58 percent over the previous year. A total of 1,058 cases of diverting public funds for other uses were placed on file for investigation, an increase of 15.13 percent over the previous year. Sixty-two economic criminal cases of corruption, bribery, and diverting public funds for other uses were exposed on the monetary front and were placed on file for investigation. Simultaneously, we also paid attention to exposing some new-typed economic criminal activities. Simultaneously, we investigated and handled a number of cases of manufacturing and marketing fake and low-quality commodities, gaining export drawback by cheating, using public funds to "engage in stock speculation," and gaining huge property of unknown origin. After the central authorities arranged the anticorruption struggle, the procuratorial organs at various levels across the province strengthened the dynamics of attacking the economic criminal activities of corruption and bribery and made contributions to opposing the corruption. The number of cases that had been handled increased rapidly. From September to December, 1,436 economic criminal cases of various categories were placed on file for investigation, equal to 61.34 percent of the total figures in the previous eight months. Of this, 724 were cases each involving over 10,000 yuan, equal to 66.18 percent of the total figures in the previous eight months. Thirty-three cases were cases involving the cadres at or above the county and section level, equal to 110 percent of the total figures in the previous eight months. The procuratorial organs timely brought suits against and punished a number of corrosive elements. From September to December, the procuratorial organs brought actions against 351 economic criminals, equal to 36.79 percent of the total figures in the previous eight months. b. The procuratorial organs dealt strict blows to serious criminal activities and continued to maintain the prestige and effect of "strict blows." The procuratorial organs across the province accepted the reports on arresting 22,424 criminals and approved the arrest of 19,333 persons through examinations. We accepted the reports on bringing and canceling suits against 28,030 persons and brought suits against 19,273 persons through examinations. We prominently dealt blows to serious activities; persistently got involved in advance; resolutely dealt blows to the violent criminal cases that seriously jeopardized social order and the lives and property of the people, habitual offenders, recidivist, and gangs of criminals with underworld nature. A total of 7,233 serious and extraordinarily serious criminals were arrested throughout the province and suits were brought against 4,380 persons. Cases relating to 6,703 persons were investigated before approvals for arrests and prosecution, accounting for 55.57 percent of the total serious and extraordinarily serious cases. We positively participated in such special struggles as "spring offensive," "100-day fortified battle," "antithefts," and encirclement and elimination of "train marauding and waylaying." The procuratorial organs conscientiously implemented various overall examination measures and brought into play their roles in safeguarding the stability of social order. We strengthened investigation, judgment, and supervision; timely set forth opinions on correcting such unlawful situations as not investigating the crimes and substituting fines for penalty; and protested, according to laws, the activities of leniently sentencing those who were guilty of serious crimes and pronouncing criminals not guilty. Decisions on not arresting 1,731 persons and not bringing actions against 197 criminals were made. Corrections were made on the decisions that 162 persons should have been arrested and suits should have been brought against 109 persons. The procuratorial organs protested 48 cases that had been judged wrongly. c. We further strengthened the examinations of the enforcement of laws and disciplines. The procuratorial organs across the province accepted 1,847 cases of violating laws and disciplines; and placed 978 cases on file for investigations, including 149 major and extraordinarily serious cases and showing an increase of 21.14 percent over the previous year. A total of 923 cases or 84.9 percent were concluded. With the focus on investigating and handling cases of "five categories" and by regarding the cases of engaging in malpractice to seek private gains as the most serious cases, last year, we made the best achievements in history. A total of 852 cases of engaging in malpractice to seek private gains, exacting confession by means of torture, unlawfully taking into custody, neglecting duties, and creating accidents due to negligence were placed on file for investigations, accounting for 87.12 percent of the total cases that had been placed on file and showing an increase of 6.54 percentage point over the previous year. Of this, 26 were cases of seeking private gains by ill means, an increase of 62.5 percent over the previous year. By eliminating interference and obstacles, we cracked a group of criminal cases relating to security and judicial personnel that the masses had strong complaints about. A total of 148 cases were placed on file, an increase of 64.44 percent over the previous year. d. The supervision over the work of jails was strengthened. Various jails were supervised according to laws. A total of 3,654 unlawful cases that took place in reformatories were corrected, and the correction rate reached 81.4 percent. Of this, we corrected 128 cases of illegally reducing penalty and unlawfully releasing on probation, 59 cases of relieving reform-through-education sentences and reducing set terms of sentences, 43 cases of seeking medical advice on bail, and more than 10 cases of wantonly collecting charges. We concentrated efforts to solve the problems that criminals were still detained after completion of their fixed terms of imprisonment; 1,639 of these kinds of cases were corrected. Thus, the number of the province's criminals that were detained after expiration of sentences was lower than the national average figure by 10.9 percentage point. Cases of 160 prisoners committing crimes again and 182 cases of prisoners and their families appealing to the higher levels and filing charges were handled. Twenty economic criminal and unlawful and undisciplined cases relating to cadres and policemen of supervisory centers and reformatories were investigated and handled. e. The accusation and report work was strengthened. The accusation and supervisory departments and the report centers brought into full play their roles as a "window" and a "bridge," accepted and handled 14,307 visitors and incoming letters from the amasses, handled 64 visiting groups, accepted and handled 1,509 accusation cases, reexamined 31 cases, and changed the original decisions on 52 cases. We accepted and handled 12,984 cases whose clues were reported by the masses, an increase of 50.89 percent over the previous year. Of this, clues for 9,055 cases of corruption and bribery were accepted, an increase of 53.71 percent; and clues for 622 cases involving personnel at or above the county and section level were accepted, an increase of 181 percent over the previous year. f. The inspection of the civil and administrative work was strengthened. This was a new task and greatly helped promote the handling of cases. We accepted and handled 404 accusation cases, placed 131 cases on file, lodged protests against 23 cases, respectively, increasing by 134 percent, 208 percent, and 667 percent over the previous year; and made 58 suggestions on further inspections and changes of judgment, 10.6 times over the previous year's figure. Our province made new achievements in the procuratorial work techniques and the procuratorial work in the agricultural, forestry, and railway aspects. Other overall departments also positively brought their roles into play in ensuring and promoting the progress of their professional work. B. Main Methods for Carrying Out the Procuratorial Work in 1993 a. The procuratorial organs persisted in the accurate political orientation and ceaselessly deepened the guiding ideology of making the procuratorial work serve the economic construction. Over the past year, we constantly stressed that the procuratorial organs at various levels must maintain an accurate political orientation, persisted in the basic line of "one center and two basic points," and served the central work of the party. After the 14th party congress, setting up and developing the socialist market economic system becomes the central task of the party. Under such a situation, according to the requirements of the supreme procuratorate, the provincial procuratorate persistently used Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building a socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm their brains; focused the service of economic construction on strictly enforcing laws, firmly handling cases, and intensifying the functions for legal supervision; and ceaselessly deepened and developed the guiding ideology of the procuratorial work in practice. The procuratorial organs at various levels paid attention to accurately handling relations between attacks and service, between the enforcement of laws and the implementation of policies, and between putting work priorities in a prominent position and making a unified arrangement; firmly attended to the link of handling cases; and better brought into play their functions. b. The procuratorial organs strictly enforced laws, firmly attended to the principle of handling cases, and intensified their functions for legal supervision. According to the Supreme Procuratorate's requirements and in line with the general ideologies of "strictly enforcing laws, firmly handling cases, and intensifying legal supervision," the procuratorial organs persistently regarded the handling of cases as the primary task and penetrated supervision into the entire process of the procuratorial work. Thus, there emerged a good situation where the procuratorial work was comprehensively developed. The procuratorial organs made the focal points stand out and firmly attended to handling cases. First, they grasped focal points. Second, they grasped the sources of the cases. Third, they attended to investigations. Fourth, they firmly attended to the system of responsibility for handling affairs. Fifth, they attended to giving guidance. Sixth, they grasped service and the guarantee for rear service. The procuratorial organs strictly enforced laws and intensified supervision. First, they strengthened the awareness of supervision. Second, they intensified the functions for conducting supervision according to laws. Third, they intensified the supervision over security and judicial personnel. Fourth, they intensified the setup of the supervisory system. Fifth, they intensified the internal restriction; and focused their efforts on grasping the links of placing cases on files, exempting from lawsuits, and withdrawing cases. So, the number of cases exempting from lawsuits was greatly reduced. A total of 510 criminals engaged in corruption and bribery exempted from lawsuits, accounting for 34.65 percent of the total people and showing a decrease of 11.48 percent from the previous year. c. The procuratorial organs persisted in the policy of taking a "two-hand" approach and strived to upgrade the quality of cadres and policemen. In regard to the work arrangements and the leadership forces, we constantly persisted in the ideology of taking a two-hand approach and attended to both professional work tasks and the construction of the workers contingents. On the one hand, we attended to investigating and handling major and appalling economic criminal cases of corruption and bribery; on the other hand, we opposed corruption and advocated administrative honesty. So, our worker contingents experienced new tests and made new improvements. In regard to the construction of the leading bodies, we mainly strengthened the ideological construction and further improved the theoretical understanding and application abilities of the leading bodies. In regard to the improvement of the work style of the leading bodies, we conducted self-investigation and self-correction in line with the 13 prohibitions as set forth by the central authorities and the provincial party committee, also conscientiously made rectification and correction, and played an exemplary vanguard role. We strengthened the organizational construction, resolutely readjusted the leading bodies that were not unified, ensured to make decisions on major issues through democratic discussions and collective study, and strengthened the unity and combat effectiveness of the leading bodies. In regard to the construction of the leading bodies, we attended to the following four tasks: First, we strengthened the ideological and political work. Second, we attended to the training of cadres. Third, we paid attention to the consolidation of discipline. We strictly investigated and handled the small number of cadres and policemen violating laws and disciplines and corrected and straightened out the problems of wantonly collecting charges, wantonly imposing fines, and wantonly collecting funds. Fourth, we positively launched the activities of striving to create new achievements. The organs under the provincial procuratorate launched the activities of striving for the best, creating first-grade achievements, making contributions and promoting the progress of the provincewide "double-emulation and double-comparison" activities and the spiritual civilization. A large group of advanced units and individuals emerged. Sixty-one institutions were commended as units advanced in spiritual civilization. d. Procuratorial organs strengthened investigation and study and upgraded the quality of policy decisions We regarded the investigation and study work as a basic work, went deep to reality to seek truth from facts, timely discovered and solved the new situation and new work problems, and made the policy decisions more scientific and democratic on the basis of investigation and study. Before making major work arrangement, the provincial procuratorate and the city procuratorial organs timely organized relevant departments to conduct investigation and study and make analysis and then worked out measures to arrange and guide the progress of the work. e. Procuratorial organs strengthened leadership and gained the initiative in work The procuratorial organs at various levels carried out the procuratorial work firmly under the leadership of the party, ceaselessly strengthened the sense of the party in waging the struggle against corruption, and conscientiously carried out the system of delivering work reports to the party committees at various levels and the system of reporting major cases. These organs persisted in the system of delivering work reports to the people's congresses and their standing committees, conscientiously made fiscal work reports and special work reports, timely reported on the major issues relating to the procuratorial work, resolutely implemented the resolutions of the people's congresses and their standing committees, conscientiously accepted supervision, prudently listened to the deputies' opinions on their inspection and assessment of the procuratorial work, and ceaselessly improved their work. In 1993, the provincial procuratorial work situation was generally good. The province made greater achievements in the procuratorial work. However, some problems that could not be ignored still existed. Some procuratorial workers did not have correct law enforcement ideas, did not have a strong sense of service, were afraid of difficulties, failed to emancipate the mind, and did not have the awareness of doing pioneering work and blazing new trails. Some weak links still existed. The quality of cadres and policemen did not suit the requirements of the situation. Some violated laws and disciplines and gained private gains when handling cases, thus producing extremely bad influence. The basic construction of the procuratorial work was comparatively weak. The communications and telecommunications facilities and the technological equipment were comparatively backward. All these restricted, to a certain extent, the progress of the procuratorial work. 2. General Arrangements for 1994 Procuratorial Work Fellow deputies: The implementation of the "decision" adopted at the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee will produce a profound impact on the political, economic, and social activities and create some new contradictions and problems. The procuratorial workers are confronted with an extremely grim situation and more arduous tasks in the new situation. The procuratorial organs must fully understand the heavy historical tasks that they are taking on, work closely in line with the central link of economic construction, regard the investigation and handling of cases as the most important means to directly serve economic construction, and strive to make new development and improvement on the basis of the procuratorial work achievements made in the previous year. According to the arrangements of the Supreme Procuratorate, we will focus our efforts to attend to the work in the following four aspects: A. We should deeply study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building a socialism with Chinese characteristics and arm the heads of the entire cadres and policemen with this theory. We should organize the broad masses of cadres and policemen to conscientiously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building a socialism with Chinese characteristics, put the study of the theory in an important position of the ideological construction and the political and theoretical education, regard it as a key link of the ideological and political work. We should emphatically study and grasp the policy of taking "a two-hand approach and being sure that both hands are tough," the ideology on democracy and legal system, and a series of expositions of opposing corruption; enable the broad masses of cadres and policemen to have a firm determination to oppose corruption and deeply promote the improvement of administrative honesty. In line with the study of the "decision" of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee, we should understand and grasp the essential special features, operational mechanisms, and policy measures of the socialist market economy; and make the procuratorial work better serve economic construction. B. We should strictly enforce laws, firmly attend to the principles of handling cases, and further intensify the functions for legal supervision We should concentrate energy to investigate and handle major and appalling cases and deeply and constantly wage the struggle against corruption. We should further upgrade the understanding about the importance of the anticorruption struggle and foster the idea of waging a long-term struggle. We should concentrate energy to investigate and handle major and appalling cases with the focus on the criminal cases relating to the working personnel of the party and political leading organs, judicial departments, administrative and law enforcement departments, and economic management departments. We should make a new breakthrough in investigating and handling major cases and resolutely investigate and handle, if discovered, the major cases involving the leading organs and the leading cadres at or above the county and section level. We should select typical cases and make key breakthroughs in dealing blows to the criminal activities of organs, organizations, enterprises, and institutions giving and accepting bribes and evading, resisting, and swindling taxes. We should continue to strengthen the dynamics of the propaganda on reporting criminal activities, timely achieve the report feedback work, and implement the encouragement policies. We should strengthen the coordinate command and coordination of the investigation work, strengthen the setup of information networks, and achieve the work of guarding against and pursuing and capturing those who commit crimes and abscond with public funds. We should strictly deal blows to serious criminal activities and safeguard the social stability. We should implement the principle of strictly and rapidly dealing blows to criminal activities, persist in the "two basic" principles, get involved in the serious and extraordinarily serious criminal cases ahead of time, and timely approve to arrest and bring actions against criminals so as to stop the rising tendency of serious and extraordinarily serious cases. Under the leadership of the party committees, we should positively participate in the special struggles and conscientiously implement various measures for comprehensively improving the procuratorial work. We should strengthen the supervision over the enforcement of laws and ensure the unified and accurate enforcement of laws. We should expand the investigation and supervision to the link of placing cases on file, strengthen the supervision over the activities of not listing cases or not appropriately listing cases, timely pursue to arrest and bring actions against criminal offenders, and realistically stop making mistakes or escaping unpunished. We should pay prominent attention to the work of lodging protests and ensure the quality of the protests to be lodged. We should regard the inspections of the enforcement of laws and disciplines as an important task for waging the anticorruption struggle and promoting the strict enforcement of laws and prominently investigate and handle the cases of judicial personnel and administrative and law enforcement personnel abusing power to engage in malpractice, seeking private gains, and perverting justice for bribes. We should conscientiously solve the problems involving criminals who are still detained after completion of their set terms of imprisonments, not enforcing laws and regulations, and substituting money for penalty. We should persist in the principle of correcting all the mistakes and conscientiously investigate and handle the cases of not being submitted to the courts' judgments and rulings and the procuratorial organs' decisions on canceling lawsuits. C. We should strengthen the construction of the leading body contingents and upgrade the overall quality of the contingents It is necessary to realistically strengthen the construction of the leading bodies. The provincial procuratorate and various city branches should support the local party committees to readjust and strengthen the leading bodies so as to install well-organized and professionally competent leading bodies at various levels. We should strengthen the study among the central group of the leading party groups of the procuratorates at various levels and ceaselessly upgrade the political and theoretical levels of the leading bodies. We should strengthen the construction of the reserve cadre contingents and upgrade the ability of the reserve cadres. We should make efforts to upgrade the procuratorial worker contingents' quality and their law enforcement levels. The procuratorial organs are units where the organizational reform is strengthened. When adding new personnel, the procuratorial organs should persist in principles to ensure the quality of newly added personnel. We should persistently regard the training of cadres as a long-term strategic task, pay attention to cultivating cadres and having them temper themselves in the course of practice, and cultivate a group of specialized talents in the course of handling cases. We should further upgrade the understanding about the importance of the anticorruption struggle, strengthen the awareness of cadres and policemen's administrative honesty and self-discipline, pay attention to sorting out and correcting such unhealthy trends within trades as "seeking private gains in handling cases" and "stressing personnel relationship in handling cases," strictly investigate and handle the unlawful and undisciplined phenomena that a small number of cadres and policemen violate laws and disciplines, and also investigate the wrongly handled cases by conscientiously implementing the system of being honest and diligent in performing official duties. It is necessary to vigorously advocate the spiritual civilization. By 1996, the procuratorial departments across the province should strive to stand among the province's advanced departments emerging from the construction of civilized units. We should positively launch the activities of creating quality achievements as well as the "double-advanced" and assessment and comparison activities; and vigorously cultivate and foster advanced examples. We should achieve the basic construction, positively improve the communications and telecommunications facilities and investigation technical equipment to suit the procuratorial organs' demands for investigating and handling cases, and strengthen the guarantee for the supply of materials and the reserve service work. D. We should realistically strengthen leadership to suit the demands for setting up the socialist market economic system We should positively and actively accept the leadership of the party committees and the people's congress. Under the leadership of the party committees, we should independently exercise the procuratorial rights according to laws, positively and actively gain the leadership of the local party committees, and rely on the party committees to eliminate various obstacles. We should further consciously accept the supervision by the people's congresses; set up, perfect, and also conscientiously implement the report system; positively accept the inspections on enforcement of laws by the people's congress standing committees; and conscientiously handle the affairs handed over by the people's congresses. We should strive to gain the support and cooperation of the governments and the departments concerned and positively and effectively carry out the procuratorial work. The procuratorial organs at higher levels should strengthen the leadership over the organs at lower levels, assume responsibility to help the lower-level procuratorial organs solve their professional work problems, particularly the difficulties that come across when handling cases; support the lower-level procuratorial organs to justly enforce laws, and ensure to conduct the legal supervision in a constant and step-by-step manner. Fellow deputies: In the new situation, the tasks we are taking on are heavy and arduous. We are determined to conscientiously implement the resolutions of this session, strive to suit the requirements in the new situation and the new tasks, go all out, keep forging ahead, and make new contributions to setting up and developing the socialist market economic system.
