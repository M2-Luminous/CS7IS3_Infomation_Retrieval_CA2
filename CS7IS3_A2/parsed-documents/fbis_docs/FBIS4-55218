The Vienna talks yesterday centered on the cantons, that is, on their territory and borders. No agreement was reached on the territory and borders of the cantons in Herzegovina and central Bosnia, but new ideas were introduced and these formed the basis for the expert teams to propose new solutions. The proposals in question propose a smaller number of cantons that would have more territory and would contain approximately the same number of Bosniaks and Croats. As for the Federal Government, it was agreed in principle that it would consist of all together 15 ministries, 11 regular ministries and four without portfolio. In addition to the prime minister and deputy prime minister, the government would consist of 17 members. Five ministries would be headed by Croatian ministers, while the rest would go to the Bosniaks, but every deputy minister would be from the ranks of the other nationality. It was concluded that it was necessary to reach an overall agreement, rather than a partial one.
