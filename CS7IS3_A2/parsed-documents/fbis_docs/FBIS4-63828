We are prepared to work out jointly such quotas and prices which would not infringe on the interests of any national companies," Professor Viktor Mikhaylov, minister of atomic energy of the Russian Federation, stated speaking at the 21st conference "World Market of Nuclear Fuel" which opened in St. Petersburg today. Taking part in this regular quorum of the international organization which is being held for the first time in Russia, are 200 experts from 20 countries representing power engineering companies, and enterprises producing uranium products and nuclear fuel. The Russian minister drew attention of participants of the conference to the generally recognized fact that the Russian industry possessed the sufficient potential for extraction of uranium raw materials and its dressing. According to Viktor Mikhaylov, capacities of these enterprises are even slightly bigger than those of the United States, and they are much superior to the possibilities of European plants. At the same time the Russian minister refuted an erroneous viewpoint that the agreement and the contract between Russia and the United States on the utilization of 500 tons of highly enriched uranium which within the framework of the disarmament program is extracted and processed by Russian specialists, and then delivered to Americans for selling under national contracts, are capable somehow of affecting the world market balance. The agreement stipulates specifically that the delivered volumes of uranium should be strictly compensated by the corresponding reduction of American diffusive enterprises' capacities and do not deform the market, the Russian minister of atomic power stressed. Participants of the St. Petersburg forum "World Market of Nuclear Fuel" which will work for two days, are discussing problems of reforming the nuclear power industry on a world scale with due consideration for the development of atomic power stations in countries of Europe and the south-east Asia, and Russia's appearance on world markets of uranium fuel.
