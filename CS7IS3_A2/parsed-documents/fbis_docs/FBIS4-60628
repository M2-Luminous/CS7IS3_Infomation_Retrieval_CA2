FBIS4-60628 "drnes103dd_94011" FBIS-NES-94-103 Daily Report 25 May 1994 Palestinian Affairs Talk Says Israel Aims To `Confuse' Authority Talk Says Israel Aims To `Confuse' Authority JN2605121494 Baghdad Voice of the PLO in Arabic 1600 GMT 25 May 94 JN2605121494 Baghdad Voice of the PLO Arabic BFN [Unattributed talk] [Text] As customary, Rabin's government has once again resorted to procrastination. It is trying to impose its concept [word indistinct] the Palestinian-Israeli agreement and its articles in a manner that serves only its interests, as if the agreement is just to throw dust in the eyes and a cover for Israeli [word indistinct] to continue controlling the situation on the ground and the Palestinian people, thus violating the articles of the agreement, its annexes, and the symbols of Palestinian sovereignty it contains, including the National Authority and its power to run the Palestinian affairs in accordance with the Palestinian interest. Undoubtedly, the aim of Rabin's government is to abort the agreement and render it empty and lifeless. This is a first step toward circumventing the Palestinian national achievements [word indistinct]. Commitment and pledge to implement the agreement -- any agreement -- is, according to sound logic, not for one party only, because the agreement is between two parties and is applied equally on both sides. The Israeli superior attitude which claims that the Palestinian self-rule authorities have a duty to protect the armed settlers and secure guarantees for their arrogance, not only shows disdain for logic, but also demonstrates a series of Israeli violations aimed to confuse the Palestinian Authority and undermine its credibility concerning the Palestinian people, their shrines, and rights in the homeland. The Palestinian Authority is the symbol of Palestinian sovereignty, and is --in all cases -- not concerned with the security of any symbols of occupation in the Palestinian self-rule areas. This authority cannot at all be responsible for the results of the Israeli violations, which cannot be far from the official Israeli policy. In light of this situation, Rabin's government before anyone else, is demanded to prove its credibility toward implementation of the agreement in letter and spirit. This cannot be realized as long as Israel continues to place obstacles, cause (?confusion) and ambiguity concerning the agreement's articles and [words indistinct]. Rabin's government should also be aware that the Palestinian laws are the only legitimate and logical alternative after the end of occupation. Issuing [word indistinct] laws is a legitimate Palestinian right and one of the symbols of the Palestinian sovereignty that Rabin's government or anyone else cannot eliminate or cancel according to a whim that is far from (?sound logic). The Palestinian people and their national leadership have been and will continue to be on the alert for Israeli traps, and will continue to maintain their decisionmaking until victory.
