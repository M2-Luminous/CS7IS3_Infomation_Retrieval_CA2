FBIS4-22301 "jpusr034___94006" FBIS-USR-94-034 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 16 March 1994 RUSSIA POLITICAL AFFAIRS Poll Results Show Muscovites' Party Preferences Poll Results Show Muscovites' Party Preferences 944F0491A Moscow MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS in Russian 16 Mar 94 p 3 944F0491A Moscow MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS Russian CSO [Untitled report on poll conducted by the Moscow Branch of VTsIOM, by Oleg Savelyev, VTsIOM sociologist] [Text] In the blitz poll of roughly 1,300 of the capital's inhabitants conducted in late February 1994 by the Moscow Branch of VTsIOM [All-Russian Central Institute of Opinion Polls] by order of MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS, an attempt was made to identify the number of potential supporters and probable members of political parties, both present and possible future members. Responses to the question "NAME THE 5-6 POLITICAL FIGURES OF RUSSIA WHOM YOU TRUST THE MOST" were distributed in percentages in the following way (data of similar polls by VTsIOM conducted on 5 August, 27 October, and 15 December 1993 are cited for comparison)--Figure 1 [figure omitted]. Responses to the question "IF POLITICAL LEADERS SUCH AS BABURIN, GAYDAR, ZHIRINOVSKIY, ZYUGANOV, POPOV, RUTSKOY, AND YAVLINSKIY HAD THEIR OWN POLITICAL PARTIES, WHICH ONE WOULD YOU VOTE FOR IN THE FORTHCOMING ELECTIONS IF THEY WERE HELD NEXT SUNDAY?" are illustrated in the numerator in the table for those polled overall, while the denominator shows only the responses for those respondents who answered affirmatively to the question "AND WOULD YOU JOIN SUCH A PARTY/MOVEMENT?" (overall 27 percent said yes to this question, 60 percent said no, and 13 percent found it difficult to answer). Fifty-one percent of the respondents stated that they would not take part in the voting or had difficulty answering. Figure No 2. Figure 2. The lower row in the same figure shows the number of party members they could, in principle, figure on, calculated by simply multiplying the answers received to both questions by the number of inhabitants of Moscow. This fairly primitive estimate is very approximate and basically just reflects the political sympathies of Muscovites at the time of the poll. We therefore caution you in advance that neither MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS nor VTsIOM will accept claims for reimbursement of expenditures for party card blanks that are not used. Obviously, the "parties" of Gaydar and Yeltsin must be joined for the final victory of democracy. Once again it is unlikely there is any hope for the proud Yavlinskiy.
