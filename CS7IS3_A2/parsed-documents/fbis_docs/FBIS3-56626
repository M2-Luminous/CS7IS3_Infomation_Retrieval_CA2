Russian capital Moscow is the most prominent place for this meeting. Azerbaijan's ambassador to Russia Ramiz Rizayev also did not excluded the possibility of the meeting. Meanwhile, Azerbaijan's Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov told the press in Baku recently, that "Armenian party's approach to this meeting is of a non-constructive character". To his mind, serious documents have to be prepared to be signed by the end of the meeting. Gasanov said that the Armenian side neither proposes such documents, nor accepts Azerbaijan's proposals. Touching upon the recent interview of Robert Kocharyan, the leader of Armenian community of Nagorno-Karabakh to the Russian TV, Gasanov said, that "this interview again proved that the Republic of Armenia arms Nagorno-Karabakh separatist fighters. It has become clear, that Armenian side tries to solve the conflict by all means forcibly". Such position, Mr. Gasanov considers, cannot be the basis for the negotiation process on regulation of the conflict.
