Geydar Aliyev noted that this meeting was important because it emphasized the need to resolve problems stemming from existing conditions that concern both countries. The Azerbaijani president expressed his satisfaction at the recently improving relations between Azerbaijan and Russia. He noted that such relations are in the interest of both countries. Geydar Aliyev drew the Russian ambassador's attention to the undeniable fact that representatives of various nationalities are fighting in the ranks of Armenia's occupationist army. This shows that the soldiers and officers from the 127th Army based in Armenia are participating in the aggression against Azerbaijan in the ranks of the occupationist troops. The Azerbaijani president reiterated that despite the extremely tense situation, our Republic favors the peaceful resolution of the problem. Whereas, Armenia not only always undermines peace efforts and fails to abide by the previous agreements, it broadens the scope of the aggression. The Azerbaijani president then referred to the National Assembly debate on the 20 January 1990 tragedy and said that the position of some opposition deputies, who blame the Russian Army and the Russians for this tragedy, can be justified. Those events were the result of the objectives being pursued by the former imperialism and communist regime. The Azerbaijani leadership at that time was guilty in this incident. Those who put the blame on outsiders want to absolve themselves from their own responsibility in the tragedy. In his turn, the Russian ambassador expressed his views on matters of mutual interest.
