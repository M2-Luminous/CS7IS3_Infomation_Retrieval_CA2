SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and Sakigake Chief Masayoshi Takemura met in the Diet building for nearly an hour to discuss what course of action their parties should take in launching a new government to replace that of outgoing prime minister Tsutomu Hata. The two men agreed their parties will consider the joint action, Koken Nosaka, chairman of the SDP's Diet Administration Committee, and Sakigake Secretary General Hiroyuki Sonoda told a joint news conference. Takemura told Murayama that his party will not participate in a new government if it is led by the new intraparliamentary group Kaishin and Soka Gakkai-backed Komeito [Clean Government Party]. Kaishin's members include Hata's Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's Japan New Party and the Democratic Socialist Party. Earlier Monday, the SDP, the second largest opposition party, and Sakigake agreed in principle on a blueprint for a fresh administration that calls for among other things respect for the Constitution. Nosaka said the SDP and Sakigake, both former members of the ruling coalition, should make further efforts to stabilize Japan's political situation, give a sense of security to the public and win the trust of other countries. Sonoda told reporters that Takemura briefed Murayama on his party's position of recommending the SDP chief as top candidate for the premiership. Murayama, however, demurred, Sonoda said. To form a "dovish" government, Nosaka said, the next prime minister should be served by people who are sincere, courageous and decisive. The dovish nature of the government should be represented by Japan's international contributions in nonmilitary fields, Sonoda said. Saying the SDP is awaiting Hata's reply to the SDP's call for a meeting between the premier and Murayama, Nosaka displayed his readiness to further urge Hata to meet the SDP boss and discuss the framework of the next administration. Hata and his two-month-old cabinet resigned Saturday in the face of a no-confidence motion. The socialists formed the largest contingent in the previous government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Takemura served as chief cabinet secretary. Meanwhile, the democrats, a faction within the SDP, agreed Monday to oppose an intraparty move to create a coalition government with the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the country's largest party now in opposition, faction officials said. The democrats, a policy study group, which comprises 23 SDP legislators of the House of Representatives, also urged the SDP leadership to resume talks with Hata's coalition to form yet another coalition government, the officials said. The decision was adopted at a plenary session of the democrats, they said. The democrats have long thrown their weight behind SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo, who is regarded as a chief proponent of an alliance with the coalition. Following the announcement Saturday of the premier's intention to disband his entire cabinet, SDP ranks have been divided over the wisdom of proposals to seek an alliance with the LDP or return to the fold of the ruling coalition.
