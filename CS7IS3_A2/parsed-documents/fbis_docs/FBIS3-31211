Both said at a press conference on Sunday [13 February] they would wait for Premier Vladimir Meciar, who is also leader of the ruling coalition partner HZDS, to ask the Slovak president to demand their resignation. Kovac and Moravcik headed the formation of the HZDS break-away group Alternative of Political Realism on Thursday [10 February]. The two also said Sunday they would remain in the HZDS unless asked to resign at the party's congress in March. Kovac and Moravcik also denied Meciar's accusations of cowardliness and disloyalty. Kovac justified the creation of the Alternative as an effort to solve the blocking of laws in parliament -- by the stalemate between government and opposition powers -- through the formation of a government which would include the opposition's participation, but lack personal enemies as leaders. One Alternative member, parliamentary Deputy Vladimir Bajan, would not comment on how the nine current deputies in the group would react to a vote of confidence in Premier Meciar, saying they would have to "consider that issue very soon." He did say that unconfirmed reports indicated that the parliamentary deputies who joined the Alternative of Political Realism were under much pressure. Parliament is to meet again on February 16. Government may link the expected vote on a privatization law amendment, which was responsible for the current deadlock, to the issue of confidence in parliamentary deputies also in cabinet. Alternative deputies -- who are officially still part of the HZDS -- could decide cabinet's fate. Members of the group have said they consider the most important outcome of their move to be obtaining the agreement of all parties, including HZDS, for the calling of premature elections. Moravcik predicted these would take place this year. Kovac said the period until any elections could be passed by a broad coalition government or even by the current cabinet under the condition it agree with the other parties on a date for elections and on their advance until then.
