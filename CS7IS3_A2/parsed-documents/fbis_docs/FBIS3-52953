At the meeting, several views and remarks were presented with the aim of enriching the subject to find a sound treatment that stands as the basic pillars for building the modern Yemeni state, the state of law and order, and in a manner that assists the judiciary in eliminating all adverse phenomena. The meeting approved the formation of a committee to study the paper presented by various parties on the principles for building the state in order to work out a paper on the subject and to present it to the PFDC at its forthcoming meeting. The PFDC continued discussing the ideas presented by the dialogue's parties, and through serious and responsible dialogue and through sincere interaction the committee made decisive decisions on the first point on its agenda, and approved a number of procedures. Concerning the media; television, radio, and newspapers; the committee decided that no statements relating to officials which speak about any political party or hint about a charge against a party, parties, or individuals should be broadcast or published. The media should refrain from becoming involved in issues that fuel the crisis. The committee called for expanding interviews and programs on the decisions on which the dialogue parties agree, and emphasizing the programs, interviews, and seminars that call for unity and integration of the national front, and which call for rapprochement between political groups in the country. It called for rejecting the statements, interviews, and speeches from any party that condemn any party or individual in the government with the aim of escalating the crisis and obstructing the dialogue. It calls for refraining from leaking news to foreign media on the crisis and for refraining from leaking anything that fuels the crisis, escalates differences, harms the national unity and thy unity of the internal front. The committee decided that the officials should not make any statements on the crisis in the country, and warned any Yemeni correspondent or reporter for foreign media against publishing false and fabricated news on the crisis and the dialogue. As for those accused of security violations, the PFDC emphasized that decisive measures should be taken to arrest fleeing suspects involved in assassinations, assassination attempts, highway robberies, and other cases of security violations, and to immediately begin trying those arrested in sabotage actions in legal and open trials. The committee says anyone who provides shelter to a suspect wanted by security organs, or anyone who hides a jail breaker will be considered a violator of the law, and legal actions will be taken against him. The PFDC stressed the need to expeditiously issue a law on bearing arms, implement it, and review the current law to make it more strict to limit bearing arms and to curb their use and trading in them. Investigations should continue to locate camps or areas used to train people to commit violent acts and to take the appropriate measures in this regard. Regarding the security and military aspect, the PFDC decided to remove all checkpoints inside and outside the cities regardless of whether they are affiliated with the Defense Ministry, the Interior Ministry, or both ministries. The PFDC called for holding general reconciliation to stop the bloodshed of the Yemenis. In accordance with this reconciliation, no revenge will be taken, and anyone who takes revenge will be considered an outlaw. The competent state organs will be responsible for taking tough legal measures against those outlaws. The PFDC decided to move the units from the outskirts of some areas in the governorates of Ta'izz, Lahj, Ibb, Abyan, Shabwah, al-Bayda', and Ma'rib and to redeploy them in areas agreed upon by an Armed Forces technical committee. The Defense Ministry will take measures to implement this and a decree to this effect will be issued within one week with implementation to begin immediately afterward. The PFDC decided that no military patrols should move in cities or on roads. Police will be responsible for patrols in accordance with security requirements. The PFDC decided to withdraw the Armed Forces from the cities and to redeploy them within a period that does not exceed two months in accordance with a central, scientific, and united plan that prepares for their merger, organization, and straightening out their affairs provided that their merger will not take more than four months following the withdrawal from cities. The military police's role will be confined to the security and discipline of the military units. The military police are not allowed to carry out activities or patrolling that conflict with the authority of the public security. The Armed Forces commanders and soldiers are also prevented from intervening in the affairs of the government authorities, the local issues of citizens, or the governorates affairs. They are also prevented from carrying out any activity in their working areas that conflict with the duties of the judicial, executive, or political authorities. There will be no recruitment, arming, or mobilization of any units, militias, border guards, popular guards, or any similar groups and the formation of any new groups shall be canceled.
