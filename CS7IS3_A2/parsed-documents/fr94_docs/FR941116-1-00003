FR941116-1-00003 FR941116-1-00001 Discussion The Direction Générale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Airbus Model A300 B4&hyph;2C, B4&hyph;103, and B4&hyph;203 series airplanes, and Model A300&hyph;600 B4&hyph;620, B4&hyph;622, B4&hyph;603, and B4&hyph;601 series airplanes. The DGAC advises that the results of a quality survey, conducted by Airbus Industrie, revealed that the electrical bonding of the fuel jettison system has insufficient protection from a lightning strike. Investigation revealed that the existing lightning protection could fail to adequately safeguard the fuel jettison pipe against a lightning strike at the fuel pipe exit. This condition, if not corrected, could result in electrical arcing and resultant fire in the event of a lightning strike. Airbus has issued Alert Service Bulletin A300&hyph;28A065, Revision 1, dated February 14, 1994 (for Model A300 series airplanes), and Alert Service Bulletin A300&hyph;28A6033, Revision 1, dated February 14, 1994 (for Model A300&hyph;600 series airplanes), which describe procedures for modification of the fuel tank jettison system. This modification involves removing the bonding strap that bridges the flexible hose and installing a new thicker bonding strap from the fuel jettison pipe to the No. 5 flap track beam, which will improve the electrical bonding at both ends. Accomplishment of this modification will improve the bonding method at the interface of the fuel jettison pipe and the adjacent fuel tank. The DGAC classified these service bulletins as mandatory and issued French Airworthiness Directive 93&hyph;074&hyph;144(B), dated May 12, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of §21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require modification of the fuel tank jettison system. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously. The FAA estimates that 34 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 21 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required parts would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to the operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $42,840, or $1,260 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
