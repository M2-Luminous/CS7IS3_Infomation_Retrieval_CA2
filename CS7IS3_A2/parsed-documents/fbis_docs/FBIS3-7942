The document entitled "The Security Policy and Defense Strategy of the Republic of Poland," adopted by the National Defense Committee on the same day, explains and expounds upon the principles adopted by the Polish president. The "Principles" clearly state that Poland sees no danger to it from any existing country. We are of the opinion that economic cooperation and joint activity in the security sphere, as well as in some military spheres, with our neighbors and other countries in the region helps eliminate potential dangers. Given that NATO remains the basic factor of political stability and peace in Europe, Poland highly appreciates the Euroatlantic nature of this alliance and supports the presence of American forces in Europe. Poland's strategic objective in the 1990's is membership of NATO and of the WEU as NATO's European arm and a major component of the European system of collective security. In accordance with the "Principles of Polish Security Policy," the Polish Armed Forces are deployed more or less uniformly all over Poland, thanks, among other things, to the formation of the Krakow Military District, which embraces the southern and eastern part of the country. The numerical status and equipment of our Armed Forces are regulated in the international commitments that Poland has signed. The army is governed by a civilian Ministry of National Defense, which is answerable to parliament, whereas supreme command over the Armed Forces is exercised by the president, who is also a civilian. As was very much expected, the NATO summit in Brussels in January confirmed the desire to preserve NATO, and reached essential decisions concerning an adaptation of NATO structures and tasks to modern requirements. Until now, NATO doctrine has been based on the assumption that a mass attack by Warsaw Pact forces might occur one day. Today, the Warsaw Pact no longer exists, and the danger of a world war has shrunk to a minimum. However, the international experience of recent years reveals to us that local wars and conflicts are occurring with increasing frequency. Even more dangerous are paramilitary terrorist organizations. These are the real dangers of the 1990's. NATO has expressed the will to meet the new challenges by preventing the formation of conflicts and undertaking energetic action to extinguish existing conflicts and combating the aforementioned terrorist organizations. Such a development of NATO coincides with our strategic objective. Poland wants to see the emergence of a single Euroatlantic security system by means of an eastward expansion of NATO and the gradual incorporation of all European countries therein. It is essential to establish such a system in order to guarantee political stability on our continent. We do not view today's NATO and the future security system based on it as a passive alliance meant to protect us from another lost war if Poland were ever to be attacked again. We imagine NATO as an organization guaranteeing all over Europe the status quo, the inviolability of borders, respect for human rights, and the preservation of modern UN and CSCE standards in the spheres of civic and economic freedoms, in keeping with European culture. We want to be an equal-ranking member of this organization, and make an appropriate political, military, and economic contribution to its joint defense potential. We are prepared to take part in joint political and military actions undertaken by NATO in order to fulfill its objectives. We have no intention of undermining the correctness of the Sejm remarks of Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski whereby in the medium and long term, there is no danger to Poland's territorial integrity and "no state, no significant political force, and no significant politician is staking any claims against us." But there is a fear, justified by our historical experience, that negative phenomena will develop faster than positive ones, and that a Euroatlantic system of security, with Poland a participant therein, will never materialize because someone will effectively prevent it from doing so. No doubt the biggest visible danger is Russia's return to the imperial policy first pursued by the Czars and then by the Soviet Union. The idea of so-called nearest foreign territory that we hear from the lips of leading Russian politicians, references to alleged "historic Russian spheres of influence" which include Poland; the loud objections to the possibility of Poland joining NATO, and remarks about an alleged duty to protect all Russian-speaking peoples in the countries of the former Soviet Union--all this we consider an expression of imperial policy, contrary to the standards of CSCE and hostile to Poland. Right now the greatest danger is that Russia might interpret an absence of reaction to such rhetoric as silent approval thereof, or even as an encouragement to proceed from words to deeds. Therefore someone has to say loudly that these are wrong things to say and do, so as to prevent the emergence of some irreversible situation. For every case of expansionism possesses its own dynamics. If it does not meet any resistance, it simply keeps on expanding. Therefore we believe that keeping Poland and the other Visegrad countries, as well as the Baltic countries and Ukraine, within the gray zone of uncertain security, in isolation and without any political screen, encourages the development of imperial trends in Russia. The young Russian democracy may and should be helped by preventing the rebirth of imperial expansion policy; a policy, I hasten to add, that also collides with the interests of the Russians themselves and those of the other peoples that form the Russian Federation. Is Poland's membership of NATO a threat to Russia? Many Russian politicians are fond of saying that it is. Here are a few examples of the arguments used to justify such an belief. 1. In the opinion of Andranik Migranian, adviser to President Yeltsin, NATO's expansion to the border of the former Soviet Union is to be viewed not as a desire to guarantee the security, sovereignty, and integrity of the borders of Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, or Slovakia, but as an attempt to isolate Russia even further. One hears the thesis about isolation or about the creation of a feeling of isolation quite frequently from the lips of Russian politicians. The first question raised by this argument is: Is it at all possible to isolate a country that is as big as a continent? Is this not merely a counterargument being employed by a power that is actually intent on keeping the abovementioned countries isolated from the West European security system? And the second question: Can one employ such an ambiguous and irrational argument as a feeling of danger? Is this not merely a development of the principle that the only right thing is what we ourselves want? 2. Mr. Yuriy Kashlev, Russian ambassador to Poland, says: "The efforts of some of our neighbors to join NATO already today and a shift of the NATO borders are grist to the mill of all the opponents of the reforms, conservative forces, and nationalists who are trying to block our reforms and our efforts to combat the crisis." Vyacheslav Kostikov, Russian presidential spokesman, says: "If the countries of Central and Eastern Europe join NATO, the reforms will collapse and the army will be angry. I think that in such a case, the army will exert strong pressure on the government and president to increase military spending and alter the present peaceful defense doctrine of Russia." These are very odd things to come from the lips of representatives of a country that considers itself democratic. It is very odd for such a country to threaten other countries with the dissatisfaction of its own army or that of some of its political groups. We, however, insist that a chance for a real democratization of Russia will occur only when the policy of Russian imperial expansion becomes unrealistic. As long as the countries of Central and Eastern Europe are isolated and constitute a potential target of Russian expansion, it is hard to expect Russian leaders of whatever political orientation to give up such a policy voluntarily. To justify this thesis one can cite the examples of postwar Japan and Germany, which became economic powers with an unquestionably democratic system because they were deprived of the possibility of pursuing an expansionist imperial policy. 3. Again Yuriy Kashlev, Russian ambassador to Poland: "NATO arose at a time when the Warsaw Pact existed, and at that time its objective was clear. Today the Warsaw Pact no longer exists, but the arrows on NATO war charts are still pointing in the same direction. NATO has failed to undergo an adequate transformation, its member countries are still looking about them and waiting. As a military alliance, NATO has to have an enemy and be directed against someone." But, I ask you, against whom? An acceptance of the principle that every military alliance must be directed against someone creates another question: Against whom is the CIS defense alliance directed? How are the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, especially the Baltics and Ukraine, to view this system? Perhaps the principle alone is faulty, perhaps it is still enshrined in the cold war reality? "Partnership for Peace" [PFP] is the path to NATO. Poland's decision to accept the NATO-proposed PFP was dictated by the conviction that it is possible to form a military alliance "for" something, and not just "against" someone or something. Poland has already signed an initial agreement, and is preparing specific plans of military cooperation with NATO countries and other PFP participants. We view PFP as our road to full NATO membership. As I said in the beginning, this is Poland's strategic choice. We consider PFP a good preparatory program that makes our gradual integration with NATO very much easier. The reservations expressed by the Polish authorities did not concern PFP itself, but the fact that the latest NATO summit failed to provide us with a political screen in the form of NATO associate membership or participation in the NATO political structures, a political screen that we need today in view of the growing political threat from the East. We will continue to ask for this political screen, not relinquishing for a single instant our active participation in PFP. To sum up, it must be emphasized that: 1. We consider NATO membership not just a chance to include Poland in the "good" part of Europe, as Ambassador Kashev puts it. We consider NATO membership as a brick in the building of a Euroatlantic security system in which every country interested in this security and willing to fulfill basic conditions should take part. 2. We do not think Poland's membership of NATO involves any threat to any of our neighbors. On the contrary, we believe it would provide them with extra security. 3. I hope that Poland's unequivocal and clear stance concerning our country's security and that of this region and of the whole of Europe will be understood by our partners and neighbors. Clara pacta faciunt amicos [Clear agreements make friends].
