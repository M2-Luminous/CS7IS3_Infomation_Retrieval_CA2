The Story of an Item in the State Budget is Coming to a Head''] [Text] For the first time in the almost 260-year history of the RAN (Russian Academy of Sciences) eight of its institutes in December announced their intention to cease work if they do not receive dependable state funding. It is true that for the time being it seems that this threat has not been carried out. At a conference of the RAN Presidium with the directors of the scientific institutions of the Moscow region, Yuriy Osipov, RAN president, reported that Viktor Chernomyrdin gave him the ``word of the prime minister'': in the very near future the Academy will be paid the 24 billion rubles which are due it. It is true that the Academy president shared with a SEGODNYA correspondent serious doubts that the money in actuality would be forthcoming. In the budget for the fourth quarter it was provided that the RAN be allocated the sum of 36 billion. But the scientists have received only 12 billion. And such a situation cannot be called chance because it has already been repeated several times. As is emphasized by presidium members, even if all the promised money is paid, it is nevertheless inadequate. That minimum of the sums which science will receive from the state budget goes exclusively for salaries of specialists and payment for communal services. Scientists are simply beginning to forget about the purchase of instruments, materials and reagents. Moreover, in the draft budget for 1994 there is no item for funding the RAN as an independent organization, as has been the recent practice. An individual line in the budget enabled scientists independently to distribute the scanty allocations in accordance with their own needs and considerations. The present-day draft ``means the virtual abolition of the RAN,'' assert its leaders. Not having received money for the fourth quarter, the leadership of the Academy lost patience. The RAN has now already long waged ``trench warfare'' with the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy, which implements state scientific policy and handles the ``science money'' passing through its hands. Indeed, one of the principles of the strategy of the Ministry of Science is the concentration of financial resources in the most priority fields and the organization of federal scientific centers, as follows from this, in which this money will be concentrated. Now the RAN Presidium has decided to speak out openly against the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy. ``The RAN Presidium regards the prevailing state of affairs not to be the result of the random course of circumstances but a manifestation of systematic work on abolition of the Russian Academy of Sciences,'' it states in its resolution. ``If the prevailing state of affairs is not rectified in the very immediate future the RAN presidium in the name of rescuing Russian science will be forced to take an extreme step -- publicly expressing its lack of confidence in the Minister of Science and Technical Policy and the Minister of Finance, whose actions in essence are directed to the destruction of the RAN and national science.'' Even now the leadership of the Academy has decided to ask the president and prime minister of Russia to establish a State Council for Science, Scientific-Technical Progress and Education under the president of the Russian Federation as a higher consultative agency for working out a strategy for a state scientific and scientific-technical policy. It is recommended that the council ``be made up from among outstanding scientists having the recognition of the international scientific community,'' evidently having in mind members of the Academy. Moreover, the RAN presidium considers it desirable ``to transform the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy into a State Committee for Science and Technology,'' substantially abridging its functions, and keeping under its oversight only ``matters relating to organization, structuring and oversight over implementation of state scientific-technical programs.'' It is difficult to say how the officially declared war of the two science families will end. Its outcome will depend to a great extent on the personal disposition of the higher leadership of the country. For the time being it resembles a ``pendulum,'' swinging first in one direction, and then in the other. Meanwhile, as strong worlds quarrel one with the other, a great many so- called academies are appearing, specializing in all possible branches, and ever-wider spreading their wings. Organized as independent structures, they now are more and more frequently having success in wrangling budgeted money from the state. Just what are these academies? As a example it is possible to cite an excerpt from the unusual publicity prospectus of the MIA (International Academy of Information Science), recently promoting a forum on information science: ``The enterprises, organizations, institutions and private individuals participating in conducting of the forum for a sponsor's fee in the amount of 300 thousand rubles are elected without competition to regular membership in the MAI and the director is elected as an honorary member of the Academy.''
