This means that, after the so-called inner city "hard core" had placed [former Chairman] Peter Tolgyessy in the center, it again wants to put a presentable, and even likable, person in the center who can be accepted by the country's public. Are you not afraid that you will also be pushed in the background like your party chairman predecessor was if you do not obey the "hard core"? [Kuncze] On the one hand, I do not believe in the existence of anything like an inner-city "hard core" and, on the other hand, if Tolgyessy was here, he would probably object strongly to having been placed into his position by a non-existent "hard core." Tolgyessy was elected party chairman by a large majority of the national meeting of delegates, while I was elected list leader and prime ministerial candidate on the basis of the recommendation of the executive body of the SZDSZ's National Council. I believe that my candidacy has the support of the whole SZDSZ membership. [Fekete] By rejecting the existence of the "hard core," you obviously do not wish to deny the existence of a sharp contrast between the line represented by [SZDSZ Chairman] Ivan Peto, Miklos Haraszti, and Balint Magyar, and the Tolgyessy wing? [Kuncze] The SZDSZ does have various trends and platforms but, to the best of my knowledge, Tolgyessy has not joined any of these. However, these platforms and views are not determined according to the dwelling places of the members, and the contrast between them is not as sharp as you suggest. The Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] is not divided according to where its members live, either.... [passage omitted] [Fekete] How can you now describe cooperation between the parties of the Liberal Bloc? I mainly ask this because a Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] deputy recently said that overtaking the SZDSZ, and to come out of the election campaign as the biggest Hungarian liberal party are the most important goals for the Fidesz. [Kuncze] I can confidently say that cooperation between the liberal parties is running smoothly, we have completed the coordination of our election programs and, although we have differences, these are not unbridgeable. As for the statements of the Fidesz politician, I certainly agree with him because we are running in the elections separately and we are rivals as well as allies. This is perfectly natural, just as the fact that differences exist between the two parties. I trust that liberals will be governing in Hungary after the 1994 elections. [passage omitted] [Fekete] [passage omitted] The SZDSZ has an advertisement that states that you would reduce government expenditure after you come to power. It is very attractive that you take the money out of your pocket in advance. What will happen to the tax burden of the citizens? [Kuncze] We are serious about our intention to reduce the government's expenditure because otherwise it is impossible to convince the citizens that the government is handling their tax forints responsibly, that it does not spend the money lightly while it is earned by the taxpayers with hard work. On the other hand, the SZDSZ's economic experts believe that a significant reduction of expenditure is indeed necessary to end the current terrible state of the economy. The SZDSZ's plans include tax reductions both in the economic organizations and the private sphere. [passage omitted] [Fekete] In your view, will we need a government of experts? [Kuncze] The next government will also be formed by politicians and the political positions will be occupied by politicians. At the same time, we need politicians who are familiar with the area they are to manage and control. In this sense, we need experts, but I emphasize that this does not mean that the ministerial positions will be occupied by experts who are independent of parties. [Fekete] [Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman] Gyula Horn recently promised that some dismissed radio workers will be placed back into their positions, although he did not actually promise a clean-up. Is it possible that the SZDSZ will also launch these kinds of measures, or are you more in favor of legal solutions? [Kuncze] I would like to see an end to fear in this country once and for all, and for this very reason I am not going to react to any threats, and I do not even like to listen to them. Under an SZDSZ government, no one needs to be afraid of any kind of political clean-up. It is a different matter that we need good professionals in the various positions of state administration; if someone is well-prepared and suitable for his job then we will not look at his party affiliation or who placed him into his job. However, if the person is unsuitable for his tasks then he must go, again, regardless of his party affiliation. Therefore, people who are good at what they are doing have nothing to be afraid of. [Fekete] Three weeks before the elections, how many parties have a chance to get into Parliament? [Kuncze] As far as I can judge, the same six parliamentary parties that the electors gave legislative tasks in 1990 have a chance to get into Parliament. I am now talking about reaching the 5-percent limit; it is quite possible that some representatives of other parties will also be elected to Parliament. [passage omitted] [Fekete] How many parliamentary mandates do you think the SZDSZ will get in May? [Kuncze] We have the chance to repeat our 1990 performance and gain 90 to 100 parliamentary seats. If we succeed in this then it will be certain that the liberal parties together will be unavoidable factors in the next governmental cycle.
