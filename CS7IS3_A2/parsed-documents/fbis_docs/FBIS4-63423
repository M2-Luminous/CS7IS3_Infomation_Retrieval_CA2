This decree was adopted right in the wake of the president's decree dated 18 November of last year, which established a state monopoly in Russia on military-technical cooperation; the state company "Rosvooruzheniye," formed several months ago, was entrusted with its implementation. The reestablishment of a monopoly was attributed to the fact that the liberalization of the arms trade which had been conducted over several years had led to substantial currency losses because of the commercial incompetence of enterprises, competition between establishments which had the right to enter foreign markets, and the emergence of a large number of parasitical intermediary firms. By and large, whereas in 1987 the USSR sold approximately $22 billion worth of arms, in 1993 Russia was only able to earn around 2 billion. Does the government decree repeal the presidential edict? The president's press service advised IZVESTIYA to think for itself. The Interdepartmental Commission for Military-Technical Cooperation Between the Russian State and Foreign Counties believes that there are no contradictions between the two documents. The draft decree was prepared over a period of 18 months, Nikolay Bogdanov, senior secretary of the commission, said. It was reexamined after about 20 general designers and directors of military-industrial complex enterprises sent the president an appeal demanding that the manufacturer be given back the right to sell his own output independently on foreign markets. The president instructed the commission to sort the matter out. The investigation resulted in a decision being adopted by the commission -- in whose work representatives of all institutions and firms interested in military-technical cooperation are participating -- to submit the draft decree for ratification by the government. Only the manufacturers will be able to trade in arms. Private trading companies and middlemen have been excluded from the lists of possible contenders, Nikolay Bogdanov said. Furthermore, every enterprise will have to undergo strict attestation and obtain a license. A decision will be adopted by members of the commission on the principle of consensus. The "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company fully retains the functions of price control. According to Marshal of Aviation Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov, the president's representative in the "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company, who has been entrusted with the functions of monitoring the observance of legality in the arms trade, it will be impossible to avoid the expansion of the number of participants in military-technical cooperation. Both manufacturers who offer the commodity and consumers exist throughout the world. Relations between them are regulated by tough laws and are put into practice under state supervision. The complexity of Russia's position is that it does not have a law on arms trade. Marshal Shaposhnikov believes that the government decree will be implemented gradually, which will make it possible to adopt a law, a draft of which has already been prepared. Every application for a license by an enterprise will be studied carefully.
