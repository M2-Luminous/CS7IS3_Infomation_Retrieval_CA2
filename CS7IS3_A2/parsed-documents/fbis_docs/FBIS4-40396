Chairman of Armenia's Supreme Council Babken Ararktsyan on Parliamentarians' Role in Settling the Crisis"] [Text] [Minasyan] Does the situation in the national parliaments affect the work of the Interparliamentary Assembly [IPA], from whose sitting you have come to Moscow? Is it going to be a sort of a supra-parliamentary organ or will it remain in its present capacity? [Ararktsyan] The IPA Council is indeed a "speakers' club" of sorts. But during plenary sessions it is not just the speakers' own points of view that clash, because the Armenian delegation and the other delegations represent all the political forces. Clashes are natural under these circumstances. Besides, inside the "speakers' club" itself there are very many different approaches, but since decisions are reached through consensus, proposals that cannot be accepted at once have to be given a "blander" form. I am going to speak about the question that was before the latest IPA Council in St. Petersburg. The Bishkek protocol recorded Shumeyko's and Sherimkulov's initiative that the parliaments of the CIS-member countries should approve the idea of creating CIS peacekeeping forces. The IPA Council was also asked to support this proposal, but Azerbaijan blocked it. [Minasyan] Was anyone else against? [Ararktsyan] Clearly not. Moldavia [Moldova] had some doubts, but had it come to voting, they would not have vetoed it, I think. Azerbaijan was against, and the decision was not made but will be taken up again in the autumn. [Minasyan] What caused Mr. Guliyev's doubts? [Ararktsyan] This is a very important question politically -- the presence on Azerbaijan's territory of peacekeeping forces of the CIS or Russia. They have either made no final decision or are against. [Ninasyan] Maybe the whole thing would boil down to giving the Russian forces the flag of the CIS coalition? [Ararktsyan] The peacekeeping forces are not only the subunits that are going to participate in peacekeeping operations. Many CIS countries are ready to give them material assistance, say, to supply technical equipment -- this is also participation. I know that some countries are ready to also provide military contingents. Thus, one should not identify CIS peacekeeping forces with Russian troops -- this of course causes anxiety in the political quarters of different countries. No one, Russia included, objects to the presence of international forces. But the CSCE has no peacekeeping subunits, only the United Nations does. The fears are that getting the mandate and finances may take time while the fragile truce that now holds in the conflict region may be broken at any time. Therefore the loss of momentum may amount to an escalation of the conflict. [Minasyan] As a regional organization, can the CIS give its mandate to these troops? [Ararktsyan] It can. International organizations, too, can give their own mandate -- no one objects to this. [Minasyan] What caused Shumeyko's appearance among the mediators? [Ararktsyan] Shumeyko was elected chairman of the IPA, the decision on the creation of a peacemaking group for Nagorno Karabakh was made back last year, and he was naturally supposed to join in this work. He also played a great role in the signing of the Bishkek protocol. [Minasyan] How can this problem be solved at the level of parliaments? [Ararktsyan] I, of course, realize very well that this is a job for the executive. Parliaments can only recommend these or other steps -- the Bishkek protocol also contained recommendations of this sort. But sooner or later, when agreements have been signed, they have to be ratified by the Supreme Council. And ratification will be made easier if parliament joins the effort at an early stage. [Minasyan] Did the quadripartite meeting on Karabakh take place in St. Petersburg after all? [Ararktsyan] There was a very exciting exchange of views between Shumeyko, Guliyev and myself, and Baburin. The very fact that this meeting was attended by the chairman of the Karabakh parliament shows that there is progress in the talks. Undoubtedly, that was an informal conversation that entails no obligations. [Minasyan] Can the implementation of the Russian peacekeeping plan meet with opposition in the Armenian parliament? [Ararktsyan] The plan suggested by Armenia's leaders for two years -- the establishment of a guaranteed peace with the bringing in of peacekeeping forces followed by talks on the political status of Nagorno-Karabakh -- is being backed in general forms by almost all political forces. The mechanism for carrying it through, of course, causes differences. Some radical forces have their own stance on the fundamental question -- they believe the status of Nagorno-Karabakh should be defined immediately. However, making haste on the question of status could deadlock the current preliminary round of talks. [Minasyan] Does the possible presence of Russian troops in Karabakh cause displeasure? [Ararktsyan] It does not. There are no important differences on this question.
