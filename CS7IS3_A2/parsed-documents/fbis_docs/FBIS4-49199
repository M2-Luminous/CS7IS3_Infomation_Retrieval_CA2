The achievements, however, failed to increase farmers' income correspondingly, nor did it boost their enthusiasm or investment in farming. Agriculture continued to roll out less profits than almost all other rural undertakings did, according to the economic Green Paper '94 published late last month. The book was a joint project of the Institute of Rural Development of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the Division of Rural Social Development of the State Statistics Bureau (SSB). One of the country's major agricultural accomplishments was that the output of cereals and oil-bearing crops struck an all-time high, according to the report. Localities reported 456.4 million tons of cereal output in 1993, 3.1 per cent more than 1992, despite a decline of 480,000 hectares in sowed acreage. The country reaped 17.6 million tons of oil crops, up 7.3 per cent, the book says. However, studies of the Ministry of Agriculture and SSB estimate the actual cereal output last year to be 2.1 percent lower than the report. Even so, the yield would still be the highest in history. Grain production in 15 provinces in northern China increased by a large margin whereas that in the South fell. Guangdong, Fujian and Zhejiang provinces continued to show red ink on reports of grain output. The drop is a major factor behind the hefty food price hikes that spread from south to north late last year. Cotton The output of other major farm products also increased except for cotton and sugar crops, which fell 16.6 and 13.5 percent respectively. The production of cotton had dipped 20.2 percent in 1992 compared to the previous year. The agricultural sector turned out 1,003 billion yuan ($115 billion) in output value, up 5 percent allowing for inflation. Farming went up 4.1 percent, better than the 3.2 percent growth in the previous year. The increase of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production and fisheries, however, was slower than the previous year. The government spent 7 percent more, or 43 billion yuan ($4.9 billion) on agriculture last year. However, its direct investment in rural capital construction dropped, after deducting for inflation. Less developed as it is compared with urban areas, the countryside still saw a net 81.5 billion yuan ($9.3 billion) flow to cities. Farming was carried out on a super-small scale. There were 350 million rural labourers in the countryside, each of whom was entitled to an average of a mere 0.34 hectares of land. Small-scale farming made it virtually impossible for farmers to earn the same as their urban workers, the book says. The growth of rural non-agricultural businesses set a new record. They turned out 2,721 billion yuan ($313 billion) in products and services last year, an increase of 67 percent on 1992. The amount made up 40 percent of the country's nonagricultural output, up by 32 percent over the previous year, and accounted for 73 percent of gross rural output. Manufacturing generated the bulk of the output value, seizing 77 percent of the total. The building industry constituted 10.2 percent, transportation 5.4 percent and the catering business 7.3 percent. Although the share of rural industry was still overwhelming, it was 2 percentage points down from the previous year. On a brighter note, the building industry, transport and services gained 2 percentage points. The book recognizes the change as a welcoming sign of an increasingly rationalized industrial structure. Gap The gap between the coast and hinterland, which had been widening since the mid-1980s, has started to close, another welcome sign, the book says. Rural non-agricultural businesses in Central and West China grew 70 per cent, faster than the national average. They turned out 33 per cent of the country's products and services, up 1 percentage point on the previous year. Rural enterprises invested heavily in updating equipment. They boasted 593 billion yuan ($68 billion) in fixed assets by year end, up 34 percent on 1992, the highest in history. "The increase is beneficial to sharpening rural businesses' competitive edge before China rejoins the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and before State-owned enterprises accomplish their market-oriented restructuring," the book says. State firms have also become a major investor in rural development. In 1993, they pumped 42 billion yuan ($4.8 billion) into assisting agriculture and rural infrastructure construction, almost the same as the government did, and 30 percent more than 1992. Rural firms created 6.24 million new jobs. They employed 109.5 million people, roughly the same as State-owned enterprises did, and 24.4 per cent of total rural labour. Private businesses became a major absorber of surplus rural labour. They hired more than 50 million people last year, and provided 62 percent of new non-agricultural jobs. Yet in proportion to their output increase, rural firms have been taking on fewer labourers. Instead, they have become more capital intensive. Last year, they recruited only half the people who would otherwise have been hired, considering the employment elasticity of the previous year. The Green Paper blames the decrease on the country's sluggish urbanization, which hindered the development of the largely labour-intensive tertiary industry. The increase in farmers' income significantly slowed last year. An average rural resident made 921 yuan ($106), an increase of 3.2 per cent allowing for inflation, down from 5.9 per cent for the previous year. Compared with their urban counterparts, rural folks, who made up 70 percent of the population, earned 60 percent less. The income ratio between the two stood at 1:2.5, even smaller than the level for 1978, when rural reforms were inaugurated. Meanwhile, the prices of agricultural materials, such as fertilizer diesel oil and farm machinery, jumped from 10 to 70 percent during the first three quarters. This led farmers to cut 10 percent of their investment in agriculture, and the sales volume of farm materials dropped 8 percent, allowing for inflation. The sluggish income growth was also to blame for the drop of rural market share from 52 percent in 1992 to 48 percent last year. The book estimates that 49.2 million farmers sought jobs outside their home villages, of whom 38.7 million people worked in cities or towns. Transient farmers worked 205 days a year outside their homes on the average. They made 3,649 yuan ($419) from work, significantly higher than the 2,280 yuan ($262) they would earn if working in rural enterprises. They sent or brought an average of 2,009 yuan ($231) back to their families.
