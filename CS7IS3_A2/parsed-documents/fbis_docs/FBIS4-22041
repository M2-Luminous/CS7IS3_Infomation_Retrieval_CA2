The report also called for the restriction of the practice of regional governorates and the village guard systems. The commission's chairman, Omur Lutfu Coskun, of the coalition member True Path Party (DYP), told a press conference today that, to prevent terror in the southeast, sensitivity is necessary so as not to regard all the region's people as potential criminals. `The region should not be a place of exile for civil servants and the administrators should be loving and understanding in their relations with the region's people,' Coskun said. Coskun cited other measures foreseen by their report as the formulation of urgent and lasting solutions to the problems of the region by local administrations, continuation of investments planned beforehand, encouragement of agriculture and animal breeding, opening new jobs. The report stressed that practices based on using force would not facilitate the resolving of the problem and the tolerant attitude of the state would facilitate a solution sooner.
