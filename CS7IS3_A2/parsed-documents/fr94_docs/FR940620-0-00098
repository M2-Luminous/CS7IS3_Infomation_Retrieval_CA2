FR940620-0-00098 FR940620-0-00029 4.1.3(22)␣Swimming Pools This provision requires at least one means of access into the water in swimming pools covered by title II of the ADA if such swimming pools are intended for recreational purposes and are not intended solely for diving or wading. Comment. The NPRM asked whether guidelines should require access into swimming pools subject to title II of the ADA. Also, the NPRM asked whether there is a single means of access into swimming pools that would be usable by a range of individuals with disabilities. If such a single means does not exist, the NPRM asked whether more than one means of access should be required. A majority of the commenters stated that ADAAG should require access into swimming pools subject to title II of the ADA. Local jurisdictions and several States (Oregon, California, New Jersey, and Massachusetts) indicated that they require access into swimming pools. Other commenters supporting such a provision noted that the technology for providing access into swimming pools is currently available and is being used by individuals with disabilities. Commenters varied greatly on what means of access into swimming pools should be required. Most maintained that there is no single means of access that meets the needs of a range of individuals with disabilities. Some commenters recommended that swimming pools have permanently-installed manual lifts, wide stairs, low risers, and handrails. Other commenters recommended pool ramps and pool lifts, stairs with raised transfer platforms, broad-stepped areas, zero-grade entry, moveable floors, and raised pool copings with grab bars. While some commenters favored requiring more than one means of access into a swimming pool, others favored a provision requiring a single means of access, but allowing for flexibility in determining the specific means. Commenters from State and local governments along with groups representing individuals with disabilities expressed the need to ensure ``independent'' access when requiring a means of access into the water. Response. The majority of commenters supported the need to require access into swimming pools. A provision has been added which requires that a means of access be provided for those swimming pools subject to title II of the ADA. This provision applies to pools which are intended for recreational purposes and not designed solely for diving or wading. This application is consistent with certain definitions contained in ANSI-NSPI-1 1991 (American National Standard for Public Swimming Pools) and therefore does not include diving and wading pools, spas, and therapy tanks. These and other types of facilities will be considered in future rulemaking. While commenters addressed the need to ensure ``independent'' access into the water, this has not been included in the provision since many of the currently available means of access cannot be used independently by all persons with disabilities. For example, some pool lifts must be operated by an attendant due to the location of controls or because the lift is not permanently installed. Specific technical provisions regarding the means of access are not included. This will allow covered entities flexibility to determine which means is most appropriate based on the specific design and use of the swimming pool. Additionally, the Board has established a Recreation Access Advisory Committee which will provide recommendations for the development of accessibility guidelines for swimming pools, other recreational facilities, and outdoor developed areas. The advisory committee is evaluating various means of access into the different types of swimming pools and aquatic facilities. The Board will consider the advisory committee's recommendations when it conducts a separate rulemaking in the future to address recreational facilities. These future guidelines will apply to entities covered by both titles II and III of the ADA and may specify a particular means of access for each application. At this time, ADAAG does not include a specific requirement for access into swimming pools for entities covered under title III of the ADA. Entities covered by title III, however, have an obligation to ensure ``equal opportunity'' for individuals with disabilities to participate in and benefit from the services offered by places of public accommodation such as places of recreation. With respect to newly constructed facilities, both the ADA and the Department of Justice title III regulation require that newly constructed facilities be ``readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.'' That phrase means that a facility or a portion of a facility must be constructed so that ``it can be approached, entered, and used by individuals with disabilities␣.␣.␣.␣easily and conveniently.'' When a particular type of facility is not specifically addressed by the guidelines, the preamble to Department of Justice title III regulation states that the language of section 36.401 (a) (i.e., ``readily accessible to and useable by individuals with disabilities'') ``is the safest guide.'' (56 FR 35576, July 26, 1991). The Department of Justice has taken the position that, in cases where ADAAG does not contain requirements for a particular type of facilities, ADAAG or other appropriate technical standards should be applied to the extent possible. 4.1.6␣Accessible Buildings: Alterations 4.1.6(1)(k)␣Elevator Exception This paragraph states that the exception to the requirement for an elevator in ADAAG 4.1.3(5) for newly constructed facilities also applies to altered facilities. The existing language has been clarified by adding a reference to ADAAG 4.1.3(5). 4.1.7␣Accessible Buildings: Historic Preservation 4.1.7(1)(a)␣Exception Comment. During the initial rulemaking for ADAAG, the Board received comments recommending that an exception be established in ADAAG 4.1.7(1)(a) where compliance with the alternative minimum requirements in ADAAG 4.1.7(3) would threaten or destroy the characteristics that qualify the building as a historic property. In response to these comments, the Board stated that it would consult with the National Park Service and Advisory Council on Historic Preservation on this issue and propose an exception in the next rulemaking. Consequently, ADAAG 4.1.7(1)(a) was reserved for an exception. See 56 FR 35430 (July 26, 1991). However, the Department of Justice issued its final regulations for titles II and III of the ADA which included sections in each of those regulations on alterations to historic properties. These regulations permitted alternative methods of access to be provided where compliance with the alternative minimum requirements in ADAAG 4.1.7(3) would threaten or destroy the historic significance of a building or facility. See 28 CFR 35.151(d)(2) and 28 CFR 36.405(b). In effect, the Department of Justice regulations have created exceptions. The NPRM proposed to incorporate these provisions as an exception in ADAAG 4.1.7(1)(a).
