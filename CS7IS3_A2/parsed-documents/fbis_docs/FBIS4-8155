And then the change came about: the fall of the Meciar government and the establishment of the new Moravcik government, which let it be felt from the first moment that it would like to implement different politics, in a European spirit. We asked Miklos Duray to analyze and assess the situation and the prospects for the region. We first asked him about the chances of the Balladur plan. [Duray] Hungarians, especially those living outside Hungary, have been particularly interested in the Balladur plan, which now, since the summer of 1993, has the name of European Stability Agreement in international politics. There are two major reasons for this. One is that this plan carries the possibility of a new peace treaty, which would actually mean making peace after the Cold War. The other possibility is that, through this, Hungarians living in their place of birth but being stuck outside Hungary could receive some kind of international settlement and guarantee. It is this second possibility that particularly interests us, mainly because we feel that, as a community, we were left out of the preparation of this document. To remedy this, we turned to the then Hungarian Prime Minister Jozsef Antall in the fall of 1993 and informed him about our reservations. We mainly turned to him because, at that time, both Romania and Slovakia completely rejected the plan. In fact, in Slovakia, there was no dialogue between the government and the Hungarians. Even then we thought that this plan should be changed in such a way that the national minorities would also be given an active role in it, or perhaps in such a way that, within the given country, an agreement should be arrived at between the government and the legitimate representatives of the Hungarian communities on how the situation of the Hungarians would be settled. However, another way could be that the legitimate representatives of the Hungarian communities participate in the bilateral talks between the neighboring countries and in the preparation of bilateral agreements. Antall's government promised that it would identify with these proposals and [Prime Minister] Peter Boross's government confirmed this. [Megyeri] Do the international political forces support your ideas? [Duray] At the end of March, I held talks in Paris with a number of French Government and Foreign Ministry experts, and with politicians of the biggest government party, the Rally for the Republic (RPR, Jacques Chirac's party). My impression is that the solution that contains the agreement between the government of the given party and the legitimate representatives of the Hungarian communities may receive support. I also held talks on this in Switzerland with the government in Bern. The same solution was found to be acceptable here. Therefore, if our suggestion is successful, huge possibilities will be opened for us in connection with the Balladur plan--significantly bigger possibilities than ever before in the past 75 years. [Megyeri] What if you do not achieve the change of the plan? [Duray] If our efforts are not successful, I openly admit that it would be better not to have this plan at all. In that case, a worse situation might be created than what emerged as a result of the agreement on the protection of national minorities, which was made in Saint Germain after World War I. [Megyeri] I feel that what you have said about your talks abroad gives grounds for cautious optimism. Can we also use the term "cautious optimism" in connection with the statements of the new Slovak Government? [Duray] It is a fact that the current government cannot be compared with the previous one, neither in a political sense nor in terms of its human quality. There seems to be a huge difference, and this is clearly in favor of the current government. They are willing to hold talks with us. However, it has to be known that they were not willing to include us in the government. At the same time, it is also true that we are having talks and we are invited members of the coalition council. Before the government was established, we had agreed with them on a set of demands laid down in eight points, as a condition for our support of the current government. It seems that, in many respects, the government is willing to implement these. Talks are under way on the implementation of these points. The government program will be submitted to parliament for discussion on 12 April, and we hope there will be no reason for us not to vote for it. [Megyeri] In your view, what are the possibilities and chances for the Moravcik government? [Duray] Their possibilities are limited from two points of view. One is the length of the government's mandate, and the other is that the government is politically divided. In addition to this, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, Meciar's party, which has fallen out of government, and its partner, the Slovak National Party, and the Matica Slovenska behind it, do everything they can to make any possible positive steps of this government in our direction very difficult.
