According to figures quoted by the ministry, 64 percent of the fixed assets of agricultural enterprises are in machines and equipment, but a considerable part of them have been mortgaged. The worst loss-makers in 1993 were freshwater fish-farming and pig-breeding, which account for more than 62 percent of the aggregate losses of agriculture. The flour-milling and animal-feed industries, seed production, and veterinary services were the only profitable operations. The total debt of agriculture is 14.6 billion leva; 8.6 billion of them are owed to banks, and the rest to suppliers. As little as 524 million leva of the loans were spent on investment. A shortage of current assets, impossibility to service bank loans and lack of investors' interest were once again the major problems of agriculture last year, Mrs. Petrova said. The Agricultural Ministry sees a way out of this situation in closing down the worst loss-makers and rehabilitating the rest. Privatization of the enterprises is another alternative, but the ministry is running into difficulties with that because of their dire financial straits. In spite of the large debts incurred, the banks have not filed for the bankruptcy of agricultural enterprises so far, as they still expect that the public purse will take over the nonperforming loans. In spite of all the requests made by the Agricultural Ministry, the government has not made a decision so far on a write-off of the non-performing loans in the sector, Mrs. Petrova recalled.
