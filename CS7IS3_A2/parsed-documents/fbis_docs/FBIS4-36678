Diplomatic sources told KUNA that Brahimi would hold talks with Saudi officials here to acquaint them with the latest developments in Yemen, particularly after 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's welcome of a Saudi role to settle the Yemeni crisis completely. [passage omitted] In contact with KUNA, Yemeni sources said that Haydar Abu Bakr al-'Attas, prime minister of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, which was recently proclaimed, and its foreign affairs minister, 'Abdallah al-Asnaj, would arrive in Jeddah at a later time to start talks with the UN envoy, which would be completed in Mukkala if a real cease-fire agreement was reached. It is worth mentioning that Saudi Arabia has so far not officially announced that it was hosting these talks. However, according to Yemeni sources, it is not unlikely that Saudi Arabia "would host these talks if al-'Attar and al-Asnaj arrived in the presence of a Gulf desire for immediate cease-fire."
