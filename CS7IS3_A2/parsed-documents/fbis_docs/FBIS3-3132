Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said it is necessary to be vigilant against those who, while making political troubles in Hong Kong, may create economic disorder there and hollow out Hong Kong's economy. When paying a visit to Hong Kong and Macao CPPCC members, Li, who is also one of the top seven leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, said that, in the past decade, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots have made important contributions to the mainland's reforms, open policy implementation and economic development. Social stability and economic development on the mainland have provided a reliable guarantee and powerful support for the prosperity of Hong Kong and Macao. The stability and prosperity of Hong Kong and Macao are linked closely with those on the mainland. The relationship has become more and more apparent with the approach of the date for sovereignty transfer, he said. Continuously maintaining the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong and Macao is not only an issue of political principle but also an issue of the economic interests of Hong Kong and Macao compatriots and of the mainland people. After China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao, the Chinese Government will adhere to the principle of "one country, two systems" and deal with various questions of Hong Kong and Macao with a positive and prudent attitude, he said. He said that the British side should be held entirely responsible for the breakdown of Sino-British talks on the arrangement of the 1994/95 elections in Hong Kong. He alerted Hong Kong people against robbery of Hong Kong money in a "modern way." People should pay attention to economic issues as well as political ones there, he said. He said that the Hong Kong British authorities, in violation of an understanding memorandum, have raised the costs of the new airport to such a high level as to be "rarely seen in the world." It will impose a huge financial burden on the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and its people after 1997, he said. Questions should be raised, he said, about who get contracts for the airport project and who will get all the money. Backed by an increasingly prosperous motherland, and through the concerted efforts of Hong Kong people, Li said, Hong Kong is certain to have a bright future.
