Judging from the proposals made at it, the ministry, unlike the government, supports the idea of liberalizing foreign trade activity and does not rule out the possibility of abolishing the institution of special exporters in 1995. Russia's balance-sheet foreign trade indicators for 1993 are impressive. It had a positive balance of $16 billion (which is somewhat less, it's true, that the government's September forecasts of $20 billion). However, the world market continues to see Russia only as a raw materials supplier (primarily oil and gas). The positive results were achieved in the traditional way, through increases in the physical volume of oil and gas exports, despite unfavorable price changes: At the end of last year, the price of one barrel of oil had fallen by $14 (changes in gas prices follow changes in oil prices). The proportion of machinery and equipment fell to 7 percent (9 percent in 1992). Although recent signs of an increase in world prices for raw materials do not in principle rule out the possibility of continued growth of oil and gas exports this year, positive shifts in their structure could be made possible by credit support or tax breaks for exporters, something that (like the creation of a state system to insure exports against unfavorable changes in world market prices) no one in either the MFER or the government is seriously thinking about yet. At the same time, against the backdrop of rather prolonged periods of exchange rates favorable to imports, a policy of limiting imports was pursued in 1993, and they fell by 27 percent. The value of grain imports dropped by 56 percent, which is in keeping with the policy of cutting subsidies for centralized imports. The sharp reduction (by 30 percent) in imports of machinery and equipment was less in keeping with targets. The collegium session confirmed that the government is not of one mind in its assessments of the outlook for changes in foreign economic regulation. For example, while the commission on operational issues (led by Oleg Soskovets), in returning commercial timber to the list of "strategic" raw material exports, essentially "emasculated" the liberalization of foreign economic activity carried out by Gaydar, the ministry continues to favor a reduction in the number of goods whose export is subject to quotas, proposing to leave only oil, oil products, and certain ferrous metals in the "strategic" category. The very likely introduction of quotas on aluminum and pig iron will be on the conscience of importers from the European Union, not the MFER. One may also conclude from the collegium session's outcome that the heyday for special exporters is coming to an end. Their functions of ensuring effective exports and state control over foreign exchange proceeds can readily be handled successfully by tenders based on state export quotas, on the one hand, and by the evolving system of foreign exchange control, on the other. In addition, the MFER's cherished uniform computerized control system could easily be reoriented from special exporters to tender winners. This change, which could in practice occur only next year, would signal a real turn from administrative to economic regulation.

He characterized the results as not bad: This applies to both the $16-billion positive trade balance and the maintenance of exports at the 1992 level. Among setbacks the minister cited $10 billion in delinquent payments in trade with the CIS countries and a 40-percent reduction in imports. Among promising areas of endeavor in 1994 Mr. Davydov cited efforts to fine-tune the uniform control system for exports of strategic raw materials and the solution of problems relating to the participation of regions in foreign economic activity. (Plans call for emphasizing the institution of regional authorized representatives.) Among other problems, the minister spoke at length on protectionism, at the KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent's request. The increase in import tariffs as of March 1, in his opinion, will result not in the abundance of goods promised by its supporters, but in shortages of goods. "We need to protect the consumer, not the producer," Mr. Davydov said. He added that even in the West, with its developed competition on domestic markets, higher tariffs usually result only in a brief respite (one to two years) for domestic producers and are not accompanied by an immediate jump in prices. But then prices rise all the same, and the competitiveness of domestic goods sharply falls. In Russia, however, with its high proportion of production monopolies and undeveloped competition, prices will jump on the very next day. A protectionist policy is also doomed for the reason that Russia is simply compelled to become integrated in the world economic system. And Mr. Davydov promised that the MFER "will do everything in its power to achieve that integration."
