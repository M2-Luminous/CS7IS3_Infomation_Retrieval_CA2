FBIS3-53412 "drnes010_h_94002" FBIS-NES-94-010 Document Type:Daily Report 14 Jan 1994 Tunisia Amnesty Allegations of Violations Refuted LD1201231494 Paris Radio France International in French 1830 GMT 12 Jan 94 LD1201231494 Paris Radio France International Language: French Article Type:BFN [Text] There is a strong reaction from Tunisia following the accusations made by Amnesty International: the humanitarian organisation claims in a report made public today that, despite the government's pledges in the field of human rights, torture and illegal arrests continue. Amnesty also specifies that the repression affects not just the Islamists, but also the government's detractors, notably members of the banned Communist Party. There has been an immediate reaction from the authorities refuting [these allegations] en bloc. Listen to Secretary of State for Information Fathi Houidi, speaking to Rida Boughezi: [Begin Houidi recording] This is in complete contradiction with the real situation experienced by Tunisians in an open, tolerant country, where respect for human rights derives from a free political choice which is reasoned and open to change. I want to point out, in any case, that Amnesty's choice of a date to publish this new report on Tunisia has not been made without ulterior motives. It comes at a time when the country is preparing for free elections, organised after an amendment of the electoral law, which guarantees political pluralism within the parliament, and at a time when an exceptional revision of the electoral lists -- hailed by observers and the opposition parties -- has just been made, and finally at a time when Tunisia's success is being cited here, there and everywhere as an example. It is this precise moment which Amnesty has chosen to bring out this report and this communique, in which, in my view, prejudice competes with an intention to wreak harm. We knew that Amnesty had reached a point where it was not very careful of the truth; we were not so aware that it had also become so extensively manipulated by the fundamentalists, because it is doing nothing other than embracing their ideas and adopting all their arguments, which are false.
