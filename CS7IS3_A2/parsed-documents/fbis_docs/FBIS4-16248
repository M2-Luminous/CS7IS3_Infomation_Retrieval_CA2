The discussion will begin with the consideration of a draft agreement on Ukraine's accession to the CIS economic union as an associated member". KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) believes that the efficiency of the regular CIS summit will be "quite modest" because up to now the CIS has not been able to turn either into a confederation or, still less, into a federation. The CIS has failed to form even a sensible economic or defence union". At the same time the newspaper admits that if there were no CIS at all, the gap between the ex-Soviet republics and their peoples "would have been immeasurably wider". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA (INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER) maintains that the CIS summit is unlikely to become "the embodiment of a re-integration success". It is not clear so far how serious is the refusal of Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev to attend the summit. The refusal can hardly be accounted for by the "non-diplomatic cold" alone. The newspaper's opinion is that President Boris Yeltsin of the Russian Federation "in Nazarbayev's absence and with a comlex relationship with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk is unlikely to feel confident presiding over the summit: The lack of support from strong partners will not be made up for by the loyalty of the other summiteers". PRAVDA briefly reports a CIS summit agenda, pointing out the possiblity that the summit will decide to create a permanently functioning body of the economic union -- an inter-state economic committee. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA singles out a report that a plane owned by one of U.S. private air companies crossed the Russian border in the area of Kamchatka on April 13. Anti-aircraft systems spotted the plane when it was only approaching the border. The plane was forced to land at one of Russian airports. After the circumstances of the incident were cleared up, the plane was allowed to refuel and leave Russian territory. Referring to U.S. news media, the newspaper points out that this is illustrative of a "radical change in relations between the two countries". KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an interview with merited test pilot Mark Gallai, Dr. of science (technology), who is chagrined by how the property of the former Soviet Union is being divided. He says this does not look like a "civilised divorce". "Soviet long-range aviation was deployed all over the country as was prompted by military considerations. If a large number of our strategic bombers turned out to be in Ukraine, this, to my mind, does not at all mean that citizens of Ukraine had a larger input of energies and resources in the developemnt of the aircraft than residents in the other ex-Soviet republics". KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on the recent bombing of Serbian positions in the area of Gorazde by NATO aircraft: The West apparently "is not afraid of waking the Russian bear". Otherwise, "NATO would have been careful not to bomb the hope for peace in Yugoslavia". SOVETSKAYA ROSSIA asserts that no "breaktrhough to peace", as was widely publicised by pro-Yeltsin media, was observed: As a matter of fact arms-twisting tactics were being applied to the Serbs with the mediation of Russian diplomacy..." PRAVDA runs an interwview with Yuriy Vlasov, a member of the State Duma, who comments on the forthcoming signing, scheduled for this month, of a deed of Russia's accession to the Partnership-for- Peace system. "Such partnership is not for Russia," Vlasov maintains. "NATO does not reduce its armaments but thoroughly modernises them, qualitatively increasing its combat might with our simultaneous weakening devoid of any logic. It is the weakening of Russia, an ultiimate weakening, that the United States presses for, not an equal disarmament."
