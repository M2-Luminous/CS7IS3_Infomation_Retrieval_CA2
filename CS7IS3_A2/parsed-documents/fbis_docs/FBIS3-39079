According to Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto, Finland will study the matter during the spring and will have talks both with NATO countries and neutral countries about the Partnership for Peace offer. Haavisto reported on the offer to the Diet's Foreign Affairs Committee today. Pertti Paasio, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, also thought that peacekeeping training was the only form of Finnish participation in the initial stage. According to Paasio, Sweden and Switzerland are very interested in the Partnership for Peace. Paasio thought it possible that at best the Partnership could be the beginning of a pan-European security system.
