The report, he stressed, had nothing in common with Kazakhstan's position, which was confirmed during the December visit to Almaty by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and by the forthcoming signing of an agreement with Russia on the strategic nuclear forces temporarily stationed on the territory of Kazakhstan. In response to a request from an ITAR-TASS correspondent to comment on the Iranian newspaper report, a high-ranking Russian diplomat said that, if it were true, it required "careful and urgent verification, primarily by Kazakhstan."
