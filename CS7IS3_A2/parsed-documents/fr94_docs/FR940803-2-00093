FR940803-2-00093 FR940803-2-00074 Wednesday August 3, 1994 Part III Department of Education Reporting of Cash Expenditures and Submission of Payment Requests for Federal Funds That Will Expire on September 30, 1994; Notice Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 148␣/␣Wednesday, August 3, 1994␣/␣Notices DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION Reporting of Cash Expenditures and Submission of Payment Requests for Federal Funds That Will Expire on September 30, 1994 AGENCY: Department of Education. ACTION: Notice of deadline. SUMMARY: The Secretary advises the public that the unexpended portions of contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements awarded by the Department of Education (ED) from appropriation funds that expired on September 30, 1989, will be deobligated and the unexpended funds canceled on September 30, 1994. This action is required by an amendment to title 31 of the United States Code that establishes procedures for closing appropriation accounts. This notice, to remind ED's recipients of the deadline and thereby minimize any financial difficulties they may encounter, is in addition to the notices sent directly to ED's recipients on a quarterly basis that emphasize the same information. DATES: The deadlines for submitting reports of cumulative cash expenditures or requesting payments appear elsewhere in this notice. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For information regarding the contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements affected by the September 30, 1994 deadline, contact Shirley Jackson, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW., Room 3083, FOB&hyph;6, Washington, DC 20202&hyph;4331. Telephone: (202) 401&hyph;1114. Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) at 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Department of Education makes most payments for contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements through either the Department of Education Payment Management System (EDPMS) or the National Finance Center (NFC). ED requires recipients paid through EDPMS to report total cumulative cash expenditures in the period (monthly or quarterly, depending on the recipient's reporting status) in which the expenditures were incurred. This report is prepared by ED and sent to each recipient for completion and return to ED by a specified date. Administrative payments by ED are made through the NFC. These include, but are not limited to, contracts, purchase orders, and travel payments. Requests for payment from the NFC must be submitted to the address indicated on the document that the recipient received from ED when it requested the services. For contract payments, the recipient must send a bill for services to the appropriate ED contracting officer. The requests must be made in a timely manner to receive payment. Until enactment of Pub. L. 101&hyph;510 on November 5, 1990, appropriated funds generally remained available indefinitely to make payments of valid obligations. Pub. L. 101&hyph;510 established limits on the time during which payments could be made from appropriations available for only a limited period of time. Appropriations for most of ED's programs and administrative activities are included in this category. As a result of Pub. L. 101&hyph;510, appropriations available for a limited period may be used for payments of valid obligations for only five years after the expiration of their period of availability for Federal obligation. After that time, the unexpended balance of those funds is canceled and returned to the Treasury Department and is unavailable for restoration for any purpose. The funds to be canceled on September 30, 1994, are those for appropriations that ceased to be available for Federal obligation on September 30, 1989. These include nearly all funds obligated by ED for contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements on or before that date. If recipients do not report, on a timely basis, that all funds obligated by ED from an appropriation expiring on September 30, 1989, have been fully expended, the unexpended balance of the award will be deobligated and the funds canceled and returned to the Treasury Department. To prevent the cancellation on September 30, 1994, of the unliquidated portions of obligations for which payments will be required, recipients of ED's contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements that were made from appropriations expiring on September 30, 1989, must submit cash expenditure reports or bills according to the following schedule: EDPMS: For those contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements for which total cumulative cash expenditures have not been reported and recorded in EDPMS or its predecessor payment systems, the recipient must report the total cumulative cash expenditures to ED by August 31, 1994. ED sends a quarterly letter providing information to recipients regarding the process for recording cash expenditures. NFC: For those recipients who receive payments through NFC, requests for payments must be received by ED for contracts, and by NFC for other types of payments, by August 15, 1994, so that payments can be made by September 30, 1994. After September 30, 1994, any requests for payment associated with the obligations will be handled on a case-by-case basis; that is, any portion of obligations referred to in this notice for contracts, grants or cooperative agreements that was canceled may, within limits established in Pub. L. 101&hyph;510, be paid from funds currently available for award for the same purpose. If current funds are not available, the payment of canceled balances would depend on a new budget request and favorable congressional action upon that request. Authority: Pub. L. 101&hyph;510. Dated: July 27, 1994. Richard W. Riley, Secretary of Education. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;18819 Filed 8&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4000&hyph;01&hyph;P
