Speaking at a news conference in Vilnius on Thursday, Slezevicius said that "if previously the administration of the Kaliningrad region tolerated Vilnius' efforts to settle Lithuania's ties with Russia on a mutually advantageous basis, lately it has been trying to press for unilateral concessions from Lithuania." "However we believe that we must seek a way out for adopting decisions which would be beneficial to both countries," he said. Primarily, automobile transportation through Lithuania, "simplified" visa procedures for the region's citizens and other problems, he added. About four months ago Lithuania sent a note to Moscow, requesting to speed up the ratification of the signed package of economic agreements. But there has been no reply since then, the premier said. He noted that a high-level delegation left for the Kaliningrad region on Thursday to seek a "positive solution to all questions on the spot, including the construction by the Lithuanian side of housing for Russian servicemen returning from Lithuania and Estonia."
