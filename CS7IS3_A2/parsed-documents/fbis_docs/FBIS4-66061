Martino told reporters on the fringes of the Conference on Stability in Europe here that Mitterrand's comments about the presence of the neo-fascist MSI [Italian Social Movement] in media magnate Sivlio Berlusconi's government were "unacceptable". He recalled that Mitterrand himself had in 1981 criticised those who carped at the presence of communists in his cabinet. Berlusconi's office put out a statement Thursday [26 May] saying that there was nothing fearsome or equivocal about Berlusconi's coming to power.
