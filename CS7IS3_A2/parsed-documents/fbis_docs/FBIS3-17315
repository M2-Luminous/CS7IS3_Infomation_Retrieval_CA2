[Hryb] Unfortunately, so far, there have been no concrete changes for the better. To some extent, this is because we announced the formation of an economic union with Russia and a single ruble zone a long time ago. This somehow restrained people and prevented them from taking active measures to develop production. Enterprise, kolkhoz and sovkhoz managers, as well as ordinary people were waiting for the unification to occur. Special hopes were pinned to an exchange rate of 1:1. Many people thought: Why invest Belarusian payment bills in anything, when tomorrow I may receive valuable Russian rubles for them. Mutual payments between enterprises and even states were stopped, because everyone was thinking: When? I do not know who is to blame for prolonging unification; everybody acted in good faith. However, not everything depended on us -- there was the Russian side, too. There are advocates and opponents of this "marriage" both in our Republic and in Russia. The entire affair has been dragging on for too long. That is why we, the Supreme Soviet, had to discuss the issue of a credit-monetary system. The question was asked squarely: Until the issue of an economic union with Russia is finally resolved, payment bills should be granted the status of full-fledged money. We should decide and explain to the people what we do next -- form a unified monetary system or make our payment bill the only legal tender on our territory. We are very concerned with other economic problems, too. In particular, these are our old ailments: A need to liquidate customs barriers and grant our products wider access to the Russian market, because our industries have always been oriented toward the latter. Without this, we will hardly resolve our other problems. [Hoytan] Once there was a suggestion to unilaterally liquidate customs posts on the border with Russia. How do things look in reality? [Hryb] Such declarations were voiced, all right. However, this has not led to anything. We do not have a customs union with Russia thus far. If we managed to liquidate customs posts, the cost of our products would be some 40 percent lower, regardless of the high prices for power resources. I believe that the issue of an economic union with Russia has not been removed from the agenda yet. However, this unification may last longer and be carried out step- by-step. [Hoytan] What measures are envisioned for a structural reshaping of production? For instance, for a couple of years now we have been speaking about producing Belarusian cars. What for? Are we seriously planning to catch up with Japan, South Korea, the United States, Germany, and France in the motor industry? [Hryb] In my opinion, priority should primarily be given to high-tech industries in which we have an appropriate material base and a qualified staff. However, it will take time to introduce these structural changes. In general, we do not aim to catch up with anybody. We should develop those industries in which we have certain experience and with which we can easily enter the world market. Nobody in the West would sell us designs yielding huge profits; most probably they will try to palm off today's or even yesterday's technologies. With regard to the conversion of our defense industries, we have a certain plan which will soon be discussed by the Supreme Soviet. We are planning to form a nonstaff economic council subordinated to the Supreme Soviet chairman. The council will be comprised of 25 leading economists. We are also going to form a nonstaff committee for legal issues made up of leading lawyers. The main authors of the Constitution will become members of the committee. [Hoytan] A couple of weeks ago, the Russian Gazprom almost brought the Republic to her knees by announcing a dramatic reduction of gas shipments. What is being done to improve the situation and avoid these kinds of cataclysms in the future? [Hryb] We have managed to resolve this issue. Besides, the Russian side brought the price down from $80 to $50 per cubic meter. A governmental delegation headed by Deputy Council of Ministers Chairman Stanislaw Bryl visited Moscow to discuss this issue. Moreover, we have reached an agreement to recalculate gas payments as of January 1994. [Hoytan] Let us now address the topic which is more familiar to you, that of fighting crime. What measures does the Supreme Soviet and the government take to normalize the criminous situation? [Hryb] The increase in crime is an acute problem in both Belarus and other CIS states, where the criminous situation is no better. While the disruption of the single economic space brought about most negative economic consequences, the disruption of the single legal space had an even more dramatic effect on the increase in crime. Besides, for a long time there were no state structures in the Republic; in fact state power was absent altogether. In other words, without a real state structure there can be no real power. That was why the Supreme Soviet has recently directed all its efforts to adopt a constitution. The Constitution has been passed and it precisely distinguishes between legislative, executive, and judicial powers. Our Republic is going to be presidential. All this will add prestige to the executive power and will make it possible to step up the fight against crime and corruption. At the same time, we have drafted a special program on fighting organized crime. The program will have been discussed by the Supreme Soviet Presidium and the government by 1 April. Incidentally, we have never had a similar program before. The issue of fighting crime is being treated at the state level for the first time ever. [passage omitted]
