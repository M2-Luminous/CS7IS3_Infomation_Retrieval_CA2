Such investment was encouraged by the appreciation of the yen against foreign currencies, higher costs of manpower in Japan and the growth potential of other countries, a ministry official said. The figure was the fifth largest annual total on record. Direct overseas investment hit a record in fiscal 1989 but has since been declining, totaling 34,138 million dollars in fiscal 1992. Japanese manufacturers invested strongly in the Asian region, with investment rising 17.9 percent to 3,659 million dollars. Machinery makers stepped up investment in Asia by 103.8 percent to 434 million dollars, while food manufacturers raised theirs by 95.8 percent to 139 million dollars. Other manufacturing sectors also boosted investment, with 63.7 percent growth reported by the electric machinery industry and a 55.6 percent increase by the transportation industry. China and Hong Kong were the most popular regions for direct investment, with growth of 58.0 percent in total investment in China and a 68.4 percent increase in Hong Kong. In contrast, direct investment in North America by Japanese manufacturers fell by 0.7 percent while Europe saw a 2.9 percent decline. Investment by Japanese nonmanufacturers, however, grew by 20.4 percent in Europe and by 6.3 percent in North America. Although large investments were seen by electric appliance companies in North America, and by chemical firms in Europe, the ministry official said that "large-scale investment in these areas has basically peaked out." Foreign direct investment in Japan fell 24.6 percent to 3,078 million dollars. Investment in the manufacturing sector dropped 2.8 percent, while falling a sharp 38.8 percent in the nonmanufacturing sector. In the nonmanufacturing sector, investment in service businesses declined by 74.8 percent, and by 77.2 percent in the financial and insurance industries. Japan's economic slump and high investment costs discouraged foreign investors, the official said.
