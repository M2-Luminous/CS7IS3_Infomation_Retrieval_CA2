Various locales have adopted effective measures to ensure sufficient funds for the procurement of agricultural and sideline products and to lessen peasants' burdens. As a result, the purchasing power of the vast number of peasants has increased to a certain extent, sales in rural markets have increased, and the gap between urban and rural markets has been further reduced. From the second half of last year to early this year, there was a quite different situation in the rate of increase of sales in urban and rural markets. The rate of increase of sales in cities was far greater than that in the rural areas, and this extremely uneven situation has created a conspicuous structural contradiction in China's market situation. Some experts analyzed the situation and pointed out that this situation was mainly due to the fact that some locales have not earnestly implemented the policy of the party Central Committee on accelerating the development of agriculture, that the peasants' burdens were too heavy, and that the funds for procuring agricultural and sideline products were not appropriated promptly. The rate of increase in peasants' income was slow, and the extent of the increase of their purchasing power was relatively small. Based on information from the State Statistical Bureau, since the beginning of this year's second quarter, various locales have strengthened measures to promote agricultural development and have achieved initial results. Peasants' income from selling agricultural and sideline products has increased to a certain extent, and their purchasing power has increased significantly. In April, the total volume of retail sales of consumer goods was 117.1 billion yuan. Of this amount, total retail sales of consumer goods in cities were 70.3 billion yuan, which was a 25.4-percent increase compared to the same period last year. Total retail sales of consumer goods in counties and lower levels were 46.8 billion yuan, an increase of 22.8 percent over the same period last year. The rate of increase of retails sales in rural areas in April was 1.8 percent higher than the previous month. The gap between the rate of the increase in sales of consumer goods between cities and rural areas was reduced from 5 percent in the first quarter to 2.6 percent. The extent of the increase in retail sales of consumer goods in counties and lower levels in Shandong, Hebei, Guangdong, Hunan, and Henan Provinces has even exceeded that of cities.
