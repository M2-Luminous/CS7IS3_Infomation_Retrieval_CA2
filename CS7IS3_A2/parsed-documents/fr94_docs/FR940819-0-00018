FR940819-0-00018 FR940819-0-00007 e. The fourth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms to assure that small business stationary sources receive notice of their rights under the Act in such manner and form as to assure reasonably adequate time for such sources to evaluate compliance methods and any relevant or applicable proposed or final regulation or standards issued under the Act. The State has met this requirement. The State has committed to provide methods for notifying small business stationary sources on a timely basis of their rights under the CAA, including the following: (i) The SBAP will develop a data base that includes all small business stationary sources and associations, and will coordinate with appropriate agency staff to notify affected sources of potential changes or rules that affect them; (ii) Formal public notification procedures will be developed and implemented agencywide that ensure timely notice of small businesses of their rights and obligations under the CAA; and (iii) The SBAP will work with trade associations, local agencies, educational facilities, and community leaders to establish environmental partnerships to bring about voluntary compliance with regulations under the CAA through participation and educational activities. f. The fifth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms for informing small business stationary sources of their obligations under the Act, including mechanisms for referring such sources to qualified auditors or, at the option of the State, for providing audits of the operations of such sources to determine compliance with the Act. The State has met this requirement. Methods that are identified in paragraph II.B.1.b.(ii) above (concerning the first requirement) shall be utilized by the State to inform small business stationary sources of their obligations under the CAA, including a program for referring sources to qualified auditors or for the State to provide for audits of the operations of such sources to determine if they are within the rules of the CAA. The audit program will be established no later than November 15, 1994. g. The sixth requirement is to develop procedures for consideration of requests from a small business stationary source for modification of (A) any work practice or technological method of compliance, or (B) the schedule of milestones for implementing such work practice or method of compliance preceding any applicable compliance date, based on the technological and financial capability of any such small business stationary source. The State has met this requirement. The State will: (i) Provide a system for collecting and coordinating information on compliance methods and technologies. Data bases and experts in different areas will provide definitive guidance information. (ii) Develop procedures to respond to requests from small business stationary sources for modification of any work practice or technical methods of compliance, schedule of milestones for implementing such work practice, or method of compliance preceding any applicable compliance date, based on the technological and financial capability of any such small business stationary source. No such modification may be granted unless it is in compliance with the applicable requirements of the CAA. (iii) Establish approved procedures to provide review of requests from small businesses for modification of work practice or technical methods of compliance based on financial and technological capability. The SBAP core portion of the PROGRAM will be staffed with 18 positions. Hiring of all staff positions to support the Texas SBAP will be completed by mid-1994. Most of the assistance provided to small businesses will be managed by this group of staff members with assistance and input from the Small Business Advocate's (Ombudsman's) Office. Subsection I.A.3.c) of the SIP, entitled ``Establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP)'', describes the details of the SBAP, which meet the six requirements set forth in section 507(a), and stated above. Furthermore, ยง382.0365 of the TCAA requires the establishment of the SBAP and requires the TNRCC to implement this core portion of the PROGRAM in accordance with the CAA and the EPA requirements. 2. Ombudsman The second PROGRAM element is the establishment of a State Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory process. Section 507(a)(3) requires the designation of a State office to serve as the Ombudsman for small business stationary sources. The State has met this requirement by hiring the Ombudsman on February 17, 1992. The Ombudsman reports directly to the TNRCC Commissioners (previously to the TACB) and is not within the chain of command of the State agency itself. Thus, the Ombudsman is separate from the air quality regulatory branch of the State agency, and therefore can be an independent advocate for small businesses. The office is located at the central offices of the TNRCC, Office of Air Quality (previously the TACB) at 12124 Park 35 Circle, Austin, Texas 78753. The office is currently partially staffed and operational, and has been since October 1992. The Small Business Advocate's (Ombudsman's) Office will ultimately be staffed with 11 positions by mid-1994, and the Office is responsible for administering the Ombudsman element of this PROGRAM. The TCAA, ยง382.0365(b)(3) provides the legal authority for establishment of the Small Business Ombudsman. The Ombudsman has the authority to request information from other State agencies that assist small businesses and has the ability to testify before the Legislature. a. It shall be the responsibility of the State office to represent small business stationary sources that require assistance in air pollution matters. b. The Ombudsman's Office has an adequate staff that includes appropriate personnel to assist in all phases of air pollution control. Specific staffing plans are presented in Appendix C of the SIP. c. The Ombudsman's Office has been and will be provided adequate funding to maintain the office. d. The Ombudsman's Office is charged with the following duties: (i) Conducting independent evaluations of all aspects of the SBAP; (ii) Reviewing and providing comments and recommendations to the EPA, the State, and the local air pollution control authorities regarding the development and implementation of regulations that impact small businesses; (iii) Facilitating and promoting the participation of small businesses in the development of new regulations that impact small businesses; (iv) Assisting in providing to higher authorities and the public information regarding the applicability of the requirements of the CAA to small businesses; (v) Aiding in the dissemination of information (i.e., upcoming regulations, control technologies, etc.) to small businesses and other interested parties; (vi) Participating in and sponsoring meetings and conferences with State/local air pollution control authorities, industry groups, and small business representatives; (vii) Periodically reviewing the work and services provided by the SBAP with trade associations and small business representatives;
