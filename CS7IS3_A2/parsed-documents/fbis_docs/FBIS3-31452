According to a correspondent in the operational zone of the 7th South Operational Group, "the chetniks have started fierce tank and infantry attacks in the Filipovici region. These attacks have been going on for four days." He also says that in a "powerful counterattack, the fighters from this region destroyed yet another tank. Several dozens of chetniks have been put out of action. A number of infantry and antitank weapons were captured. This was the 77th enemy tank to have been destroyed in this region." Brcko correspondents Hamiz Deronjic and Nihad Salikovic report that "continuous shelling of our positions has been going since this morning. The fiercest attacks are being launched by the enemy on the area between Omerbegovaca and Vranovaca. The chetniks are using mortars, of 155-mm and 122-mm howitzers, tanks, hill guns, portable mortars, and [word indistinct]. Double charge shells are being used increasingly frequently. The Brcko defense positions have been attacked for the first time with shells that explode about 10 meters above the ground. There are indications that this kind of shell was used by the aggressor for the massacre of civilians at the Sarajevo market [on 5 February]." According to a reporter from the Information Service of the First Army Corps in Sarajevo, the "chetniks are continuing to violate the cease-fire in some parts of Sarajevo today. This started early this morning when they targeted NATO aircraft with illuminating [svetleci] bullets from Nedzarici. Then they fired mortar shells from Decija Glava and also used portable mortars to attack Hladivode from Gradina. Chetnik snipers have again been active, especially from Vraca, and they are using silencers so citizens are warned to exercise the maximum caution."
