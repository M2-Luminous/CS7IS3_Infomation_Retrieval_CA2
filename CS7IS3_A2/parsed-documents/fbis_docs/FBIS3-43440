Announcing the campaign at a Johannesburg media conference, ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Regional Executive Committee member Jessie Duarte said the aim of the campaign is to build peace consciousness in the area. She said the peace plan is a call from all South Africans for help to build the social fabric in the area. Organizations across the political spectrum have been invited to a meeting on 15 January. This is when a working group will lay the foundation for the campaign. Duarte says among other plans, the ANC has proposed that people from outside the East Rand, irrespective of political affiliation and race, spend time and talk to residents in violence plagued areas. She says the campaign was initiated by the ANC, but it is for all South Africa who need to hold a free and fair election and a peaceful transition.
