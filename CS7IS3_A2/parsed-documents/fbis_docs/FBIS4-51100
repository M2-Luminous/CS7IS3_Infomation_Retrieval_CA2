The meeting summarized the 1993 work in halting deficits and increasing profits, analyzed the present situation in industry, and called for efforts to mobilize all the people in the province to summon up their courage, seek unity of thinking, fortify their confidence, and try every possible means to check the slowdown in the tempo of production and the increase in deficits among the state-owned industrial enterprises of the province. At the meeting, Xu De, secretary general of the provincial government read out the provincial government's decision on commending the localities and enterprises who were exceptional in halting deficits and increasing profits and on criticizing the four enterprises that each incurred over 10 million yuan in deficits. Cong Zhenglong, vice governor of the province, attended the meeting and gave a speech. At the meeting, mayors of various cities signed certificates of responsibility for halting deficits. In 1993, the province achieved some results in halting deficits and increasing profits, and the industrial economy maintained a trend of relatively rapid progress. According to the statistics compiled among the province's budgetary state-owned industrial enterprises, last year, 464 enterprises in the province were operated at a loss, accounting for 26.04 percent of the total, 5.26 percentage points lower than that in 1992, if calculated in terms of the comparable standards not covered by the general rule on financial affairs of enterprises and the standards for enterprise accounting. Meanwhile, the volume of deficits of such enterprises was 800 million yuan, 250 million yuan fewer than the deficits incurred in 1992, with the margin of decrease in deficits reaching 23.52 percent. As a result, the province fulfilled the task of decreasing the range of deficits by 5 percent and the volume of deficits by 15 percent, that was assigned to the province by the state at the beginning of 1993. Since the beginning of 1994, the province's industrial economy has kept on the trend of relatively rapid progress. By the end of April, the province as a whole realized 99.666 billion yuan in the gross value of industrial output, an increase of 31.2 percent over the same period last year, and realized 57.533 billion yuan in sales value, an increase of 9.4 percent. However, during this period, the province's state-owned industrial enterprises fell into an extremely grim situation, showing signs of slow growth, poor efficiency, increasingly serious deficits, and a soaring range and volume of deficits. According to the statistics complied in the first quarter among the province's budgetary state-owned industrial enterprises, 1,123 enterprises were operating at a loss, 271 more than the figure at the same period last year; the range of deficits was as high as 67.57 percent, 17.13 percentage points higher than the same period last year; and the volume of deficits was 903 million yuan, 524 million yuan more than the deficits incurred at the same period last year, with the margin of increased deficits reaching 138 percent. At the same time, all of the 14 cities in the province and all of the 10 trades that are under key examination experienced increases in deficits at varying degrees and 25 enterprises incurred over 5 million yuan in deficits each, 17 more than the figure of the same period, last year. Vice Governor Cong Zhenglong said in his speech: At present, the deficits incurred by state-owned industrial enterprises has become the most conspicuous problem hampering economic development and affecting the social stability of the province. All localities, all departments, and all enterprises must list the work of halting deficits and increasing profits as a major item on their daily agenda and must adopt effective measures and try every possible means to halt deficits and increase profits. In line with the guidelines of the executive meeting of the provincial government, Cong Zhenglong set the following demands on how to halt deficits and increase profits. We should summon up our courage, seek unity of thinking, and take a more urgent attitude in halting deficits and increasing profits. The second quarter of this year is the key period of halting deficits and increasing profits. Whether we can reduce the range of deficits to 50 percent or lower in the second quarter of this year is critical to fulfilling the target of reducing the annual range of deficits by 5 percentage points and reducing the annual volume of deficits by 10 percent. [passage omitted] We should energetically push forward the reform of property right system and operational methods of enterprises and accelerate the change of operational mechanism of the enterprises operating at a lose. [passage omitted] We should strengthen the system of assuming responsibility for attaining the target of halting deficits and increasing profits and establish a system under which each level assumes responsibility for the work of the next lower level. [passage omitted] We should further strengthen leadership over the work of halting deficits and increasing profits and better construct leading bodies for enterprises operating at a loss. [passage omitted] In conclusion, Cong Zhenglong stressed that this year's endeavor of halting deficits and increasing profits should be focused on Shenyang, Dandong, Jinzhou, Fuxin, and Tieling whose range of deficits has been higher than the average provincial level by 10 percentage points and whose volume of deficits has surpassed 180 million yuan each; on enterprises of the textile, light, chemical industries whose range of deficits exceeds the the province's average level and whose volume of deficits surpasses 200 million yuan each; and on enterprises that have incurred more than 5 million yuan each.
