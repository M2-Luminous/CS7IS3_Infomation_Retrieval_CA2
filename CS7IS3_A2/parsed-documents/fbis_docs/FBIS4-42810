The report also states that Norway can withdraw from the EU. "It is natural to see the introduction of economic and monetary union with a common currency as a further development within the framework of the Single Internal Market and the gradual convergence of member states' economic policies that have been the goals of the EC since the Treaty of Rome was adopted in 1957." This quotation from the report to the Storting on EU membership is not perhaps so very controversial for most people, but it will give rise to reactions. It is an illustration of how the government now views the Union treaty. After the treaty came into existence -- at the Maastricht summit in December 1991 -- there was general agreement that the EC had taken a big step in the direction of integration. Economic and monetary union (EMU) was seen as something qualitatively different from the existing community. In addition there were formulations in the treaty that could pave the way for foreign and security policy union. The treaty also provided for citizenship of the union and opened the way for coordination in the fields of justice and policing. The EC also changed its name to the European Union. The government does not view these changes as fundamental. In a discussion of the Constitution's paragraph 93 (the so-called EU paragraph) reference is made to legal evaluations made in 1967, and it is stated that the changes that have happened since then are not so great as to indicate that new conclusions should be reached. This could be of great significance. If it happens at some point in the future that the Storting has to decide whether the krone is to be replaced by a common EU currency, it will not necessarily have to do so with a three-quarters majority. Trade Minister Grete Knudsen confirmed this at Friday's [3 June] news conference on the EU report. On the other hand the further development of cooperation in the justice sector or in the foreign and security policy area will need a three-quarters majority in the Storting. An important point in the report to the Storting is that the Maastricht Treaty's stipulations in these areas only have the status of international law. Norwegian membership now will not give the various EU bodies any direct authority over Norwegian citizens or companies in the field of justice or in the security field. We are not relinquishing any sovereignty in the traditional sense of the word. The government is also discussing what will happen if conflicts arise between EC law and Norwegian law. Initially membership means that EC law takes precedence -- particularly in the economic field. The Storting report states that it is a Norwegian court that will have the job of reaching a judgment if there is a conflict between the EU's rules and Norwegian legislation. The government does not think that such conflicts will arise. If they do, the report asserts that the EU Court has little scope for action. It could declare that the Norwegian legislation conflicts with EC law, but it cannot declare decisions made by national authorities to be invalid. Both the Treaty of Rome and the Maastricht Treaty state that they are valid for an unlimited period of time, and they contain no rules covering withdrawal from them. This has led many EU opponents and lawyers to claim that Norway's decision this fall is irrevocable. The government makes use of legal and political counterarguments. In the legal context the government refers to the Vienna Convention on treaty law and concludes that the EU treaties are of a type that can be terminated. It also points out that Greenland actually withdrew from the EC and that Britain had a referendum in 1975 in which the question asked was about a possible withdrawal. "A `no' would naturally have led to withdrawal," the report argues. However, this presupposes that Norway and the EU negotiate the terms of a withdrawal, if this were to happen.
