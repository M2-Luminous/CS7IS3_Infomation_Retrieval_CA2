Inienger said in an interview aired on national radio that the UN-supervised force would be "evenhanded" and "neutral" but warned that "any party acting alone or in contract to frustrate disarmament will be forced to disarm." He said he was aware the disarmament process would be lengthy and fraught with obstacles but that his force is "resolved and committed to bring about total peace to Liberia." But so far the Nigerian-led ECOMOG force which began deploying here last Tuesday has made little headway as it attempts to fan out across the country. Local observers fear that an internal power dispute among leaders of one of the country's two main factions, the United Liberation Movement (ULIMO) could scuttle the peace process. On Sunday ULIMO's military command, headed by General Roosevelt Johnson, issued a communique announcing that the president of the movement, Alhaji Koromah, had been dismissed. Johnson is from the Krahn ethnic group and Koromah from the Mandingo group. Johnson in his communique accused Koromah of engaging in "inconsistent activities which the movement considered obstacles in the peace process" and rejected his decision earlier this week to dismiss Thomas Ziah, an ULIMO representative appointed to the country's State Council, an interim collegial presidency which is to rule the country between March 7 and September 7. Koromah's stand against Ziah was apparently prompted by the latter's refusal to support ULIMO representative Mohamed Sheriff to the presidency of the transitional government on February 28. As a result, David Kpormakor, an interim government representative, was elected president of the State Council, a decision immediately contested by the ULIMO representatives. Meanwhile Koromah on Friday ordered his followers to disarm members of the Krahn ethnic group, a decision that resulted in a shootout that left four Krahn members injured.
