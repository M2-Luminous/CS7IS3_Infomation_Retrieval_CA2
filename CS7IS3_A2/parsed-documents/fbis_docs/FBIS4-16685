The time for conversations is over. Bosnian Serbs must realize that Russia embodies a great power and not a banana republic," the Russian president's Special Envoy, Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin told journalists today at the airport on his return from a nine-day visit to former Yugoslavia. Churkin considered the situation in Bosnia as still complex. "If things do not improve, there will be no way to discuss lifting of international sanctions against Serbia," Churkin stressed. He said the Russian policy in ex-Yugoslavia was a "policy of a great power." "Relations with the Serbs can be expressed in a simple formula: when Serbs were stating that the whole world was against them we agreed under the condition that they would follow our instructions. Instead of this, Bosnian Serbs use Russian policy as a shield," Churkin emphasized. In his opinion, during the recent crisis in Gorazde the Serbs should have stopped their offensive on the city. "There were possibilities to prevent the aggravation of the situation. Originally, Serbs offered to send a group of UN observers to their positions near Gorazde. When the Russian side got in touch with UN officials and agreed on the issue, the offer had already been rejected. As a result, the grave crisis in Bosnia aggravated even further," Churkin said. He said that the Bosnian Serbs repeatedly gave assurances about the end of fighting near Gorazde. "Unfortunately, the meetings between the Serbs and the UN representatives mediated by Russia turned out to be fruitless. The Serbs did not show any readiness or sincere willingness to agree. They were just wasting time," Churkin said. Churkin expressed confidence that "if the Bosnian Serbs continue their offensive on Gorazde and fire at least one round towards the city, there will be a huge crisis which will bring the Serb people into the catastrophe." In Churkin's opinion, "a small group of Bosnian Serbs have become mad on war." "Russia should decide whether it should allow a group of extremists to use the policy of Russia for achieving their goals. Our response is simple -- never. If somebody tries to play with Russia's policy, Russia will respond as can be expected from a great power," Churkin said.
