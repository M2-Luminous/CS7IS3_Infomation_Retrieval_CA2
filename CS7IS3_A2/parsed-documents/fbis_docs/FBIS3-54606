An authoritative DFLP source has said that the central leadership of the alliance decided to begin immediately to hold popular conferences inside [the occupied territories] and in the diaspora as an important step toward stripping the bureaucratic PLO leadership of legitimacy and in preparation for holding the general people's national conference, which will elect a new political leadership for the Palestinian leadership and rebuild PLO institutions on democratic foundations. The source believes that beginning to implement this decision will be considered a practical measure of the extent of the alliance's seriousness in its new form. The source also pointed out that the central leadership of the alliance had stressed the decision to form the Islamic National Leadership of the Intifadah in the occupied Palestinian territories -- which requires that all parties concerned hasten to implement it immediately. This is in the knowledge that the present leadership of the intifadah is formed from the DFLP and the Popular Front [for the Liberation of Palestine], as the forces involved in the Oslo-Washington agreement have abandoned it. On the central leadership's other decisions concerning organizational and administrative aspects, the source said that these decisions become valuable when they help to effect the alliance's political role, specifically in two main spheres: holding popular conferences and expanding the intifadah leadership so as to include the other parties of the alliance operating in the occupied homeland which are still outside this unionist framework.
