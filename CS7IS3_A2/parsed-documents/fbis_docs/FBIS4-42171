The Tories divided? Not so, he protests with a languidly elegant movement of the hands: their election manifesto has `accommodated' all sections of the party. `Now, if you said all the parties are responding to an unhappy and querulous national mood in relation to the European Union, then I'd agree.' But in a conversation with THE OBSERVER, the wary Sir Leon did react to the latest Tory idea to deconstruct the Commission, where he is in charge of international economic relations. David Heathcoat-Amory, Foreign Office Minister, last week suggested the Commission emasculate itself by handing over its right to introduce legislation to the Council of Ministers. `It would never work,' says Sir Leon, insistent as a barrister used to talking to not very bright juries. `The essence of the Council of Ministers is that it is 12 governments.' The Council is equipped to `consider proposed laws and decide on them, which is exactly what it does, but it cannot produce them.' Sir Leon does not believe `a fundamental change in the Commission's role is in anybody's interest.' Nor is the Commission too `undemocratic.' People who `criticise the Commission for being unelected would hate the consequences of it being elected, because if it was, you would be well on the way to an embryonic European government.' Happy to demolish Heathcoat-Amory, Brittan is more guarded about a nationalist John Major confessing that his spirit sinks whenever he has to leave Britain's shores. `Just a statement of a patriotic kind. If that's the way he feels, that's the way he feels.' It is obviously not the way Sir Leon feels, for a Tory more comfortable in Europe is hard to imagine. Shortly after arriving in Brussels to take up his job at the Commission, Brittan invited Jacques Delors home to dinner, unawed by the formidable president and ready to entertain him in French. If Brittan now hopes to succeed Delors, it is because he applied the generalist skills of the British politician to the traditionally compartmentalised world of the Union. `Wisely or unwisely, over a period of time I've poked my nose into other people's business and made speeches about everything under the sun.' Brittan's spirits seem equally high on his frequent trips to speak at British Euroelection meetings. His message is bullish: Europe, including that Tory taboo, European monetary union [EMU], is good for you though you may not yet know it. `Britain can be relaxed about EMU. Nobody's pushing Britain to join, just as nobody is pushing us to rejoin the European exchange rate mechanism. Britain has secured the rather remarkable position of having an option (to join EMU) but not an obligation -- as near as you can get in politics to having your cake and eating it.' He insists the convergence of European economies that is a precondition for monetary union will be achieved, and that EMU itself will reduce costs, to everyone's advantage, of trading in the European market. `It is not unrealistic that, by 1999, a critical mass of European countries will be able and want to go ahead.' His chief argument to the sceptical Brits is that the time of European Union excesses is over, and that it would be stupid to bolt when Europe is becoming British-friendly. `Everyone was in favour of the single market and yet it was the creation of the single market which necessarily meant removing 12 national sets of rules and involved the most intrusive intervention in business and other life. Though people desired the end, they were not entirely happy with the means, and didn't appreciate the means were necessary to achieve the end.' These wounds would now be healed by the salve of subsidiarity, explained by Brittan as `you don't do what you don't need to do, and don't hesitate to do what you can do best.' If water quality can best be assured by national governments, clean air is a pan-European concern. The result is that the amount of Eurolegislation proposed by the Commission has halved since 1989. Brittan mocks the over-regulated, over-subsidised Europe of several years ago and says European institutions have to learn a lesson from critical reactions to the widespread Maastricht treaty. `By the way we conduct ourselves and by our vision, we must show that we're not trying to snuff out the nation state but to do together the things that are best done together.' He offers the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as a dramatic example of how Europe has changed to suit Britain. `When I began the international economic relations job, there were large numbers of people who didn't want a settlement at all because they said it was an Anglo-Saxon concoction, and what's this got to do with the great European ideal? But by the end, everyone agreed that the Gatt deal was good.' Leon Brittan sounds like the best President of the European Commission the British could realistically hope to get, but few people in Brussels think Europe's leaders will give him the job when they meet in Corfu next month. The Belgian premier Jean-Luc Dehaene and the former Dutch premier Ruud Lubbers still seem more probable choices. Asked if he is handicapped in the race by being British, he answers in his best old-fashioned courtroom manner: `I thought one of the fundamental principles of the European Union was that we weren't allowed to discriminate on grounds of nationality.'
