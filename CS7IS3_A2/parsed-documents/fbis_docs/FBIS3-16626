Such lotteries are not new, they have been held for several years now, but it is the first time Russians and inhabitants of other countries of the former Union will be able to participate. The lotteries are intended to enable people who do not meet the normal requirements for the issuing of a green card to settle in America. If, say, you do not have close relatives in the United States or there is no employer who is prepared to take full responsibility for you and assure the U.S. immigration authorities that unless you, a unique professional, are given work in America America's prosperity will suffer badly as a result. Judging by information from the embassy, the process of receiving applications to participate in the lottery will begin in the spring. You will not have to fill in any form, all you will have to do is make a written application and send it to the appointed address. The embassy issued another notice: "There will be no need to pay any intermediary for assistance in framing an application. Paying for such services will not improve the applicant's chances of success." The other day it was confirmed for me at the embassy that no additional information has been issued since the February notification. In other words, the details are still being worked out and coordinated. Just wait. But the intermediaries are already buzzing around all over the place. Some made a practical suggestion to the editorial boards of newspapers in the capital, including IZVESTIYA: Act as an agent for a U.S. law firm, help us distribute forms, and then we can share the proceeds. They even sent us a copy of the form which lottery participants would be expected to fill in and which would then be passed on to the U.S. law firm for it to deliver to U.S. territory and register by a certain date. What would the law firm charge for its services? $100 a head. The explanatory letter says that "families will double their chances if husband and wife fill in separate forms." That makes $200. It appears that the U.S. law firm is operating entirely at the potential lottery participants' risk. And, of course, it is trying to make money, big money. Money out of our fellow citizens' ignorance and ingenuousness. I talked on the telephone with those who, as it were, represent the firm's interests in Moscow. I tried to ascertain, in particular, the credentials of this firm, which has been set up in California by people who were compatriots of ours not long ago. Alas, my questions about its successes remained unanswered. The interesting thing is, though, that Russian citizens will find it hard to do without the services of intermediaries. Judging by the experience of past lotteries, the U.S. authorities would like to "eliminate" as many applicants as possible and prevent them from participating in the lottery. And it will be very easy to do this, I was told: Either the application would be declared void on the pretext of some inaccuracy and thrown in the bin or it would take so long to get to the United States that it would fail to meet the deadline. The firm will be accurate and prompt. "Is it true, as the American Embassy says, that the efforts of intermediaries will not improve the chances of success?" "It is true," came the reply. "It is a lottery, after all." Anyway, I personally would not be in too much of a hurry to hand over my greenbacks. At least until the U.S. immigration service has dotted all the i's and crossed all the t's, in particular on the question whether it is indeed possible to try one's luck in the lottery without intermediaries.
