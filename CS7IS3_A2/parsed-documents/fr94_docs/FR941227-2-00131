FR941227-2-00131 FR941227-2-00087 V. Discussion The Commission believes that the proposed rule changes are consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities association and national securities exchanges and, in particular, the requirements of Sections 6 and 15A of the Act. Specifically, the Commission believes that, consistent with Sections 6(b)(5) and 15A(b)(6) of the Act, the Policy does not unfairly discriminate among issuers and will foster investor confidence in the markets thereby protecting investors and the public interest. In addition, the Commission believes that the Policy and the procedures for its implementation further the maintenance of a fair and orderly market. Finally, for the reasons set forth below, the Commission finds that, consistent with Sections 6(b)(8) and 15A(b)(9) of the Act, the proposal does not impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the Act. A. Shareholder Protection and the Public Interest The Commission believes that the issue of shareholder voting rights has far-reaching implications for shareholder protection and the public interest, and that an SRO rule ensuring a minimum level of shareholder protection from disenfranchising actions is appropriate and consistent with the Act. More specifically, it is reasonable for the SROs, in providing a market to trade securities, to ensure that shareholders in that market are treated fairly. Widespread occurrences of shareholder disenfranchisement could undermine investor confidence in the market and diminish investor participation. As discussed below, the Policy, which was independently proposed by the NYSE, Amex, and NASD, and which will operate through their respective listing standards, is drafted to provide public shareholders as much protection as possible from disenfranchisement, while minimizing intrusion into traditional areas of state regulation and not unduly interfering with the ability of public corporations to set their own capital structures. The Commission believes that the minimum standard for voting rights contained in the Policy will help prevent abusive disenfranchisement of public shareholders and provide guidance to issuers that either currently have other than a standard one-share, one-vote capital structure or that are contemplating a capital reorganization that may come under the scrutiny of the Policy. The SROs have identified as narrowly as possible those corporate actions or issuances that would disenfranchise shareholder voting rights. For example, as discussed above, the new Policy is similar, in part, to former Rule 19c&hyph;4, which was designed to discourage issuers from engaging in activity involving corporate issuances or other corporate actions that nullified, restricted, or disparately reduced the voting rights of existing shareholders of common stock and would continue to permit transactions permitted under that standard. Based on the SROs' experience in applying former Rule 19c&hyph;4, and in light of feedback they have received from various groups, the SROs have designed the Policy to be more flexible than Rule 19c-4, especially in addressing certain business or economic situations which would warrant a corporation to issue disparate voting rights stock. As a result, the Policy, in addition to permitting transactions that had been permitted under former Rule 19c&hyph;4, generally will permit corporate actions or issuances that are consistent with the corporation's existing capital structure in addition to allowing the SROs more flexibility in evaluating new issuances on a case-by-case basis. The Commission believes that by assuring the continued permissibility of those corporate actions permitted under former Rule 19c&hyph;4 release and under the interpretations issued pursuant to that rule, the SROs have provided consistency for issuers. 29 On the other hand, the Commission believes that the Policy will provide the SROs useful flexibility in evaluating transactions on a case-by-case basis and permitting issuers to adopt certain new voting rights structures consistent with the Policy. 30 29 In this regard, the Commission has considered the suggestions presented in the HFRRF letter and does not believe that the absence of additional ``structural safeguards'' is inconsistent with any requirements of the Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As stated earlier, the Policy recognizes that an investor in a dual class corporation invests knowing and accepting the capital structure in place and the possibility of additional issuances of disparate voting rights securities. 30 There may be valid business or economic reasons for corporations to issue disparate voting rights stock. The Policy provides the SROs with a voting rights standard which will provide issuers with a certain degree of flexibility in adopting corporate structures, so long as there is a reasonable business justification to so doing, and such transaction is not taken or proposed primarily with the intent to disenfranchise.
