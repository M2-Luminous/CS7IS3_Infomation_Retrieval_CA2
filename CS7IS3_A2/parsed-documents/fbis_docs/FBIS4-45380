FBIS4-45380 "jptdd026__l94059" JPRS-TDD-94-026-L JPRS Narcotics 29 May 1994 NEAR EAST & SOUTH ASIA BANGLADESH Increased Marijuana Cultivation Detailed Increased Marijuana Cultivation Detailed BK0706143794 Dhaka DAINIK INQILAB in Bengali 29 May 94 p 1 BK0706143794 Dhaka DAINIK INQILAB Bengali BFN [By Mushtaq Ahmed] [Text] Marijuana cultivation has increased alarmingly in the three districts of Chittagong Hill Tracts [CHT's] and the hilly areas of Cox's Bazar District. It is estimated that annual production in these areas is more than 500 metric tons. Almost all tribal families living in the inaccessible hilly areas of the three districts of Rangamati, Khagrachhari, and Bandarban in CHT's have become involved in marijuana cultivation. Different sources say that the large-scale cultivation is in accordance with a conspiracy to convert the CHT's into a "second Golden Triangle." It also has been learned that the process of producing superior quality drugs from marijuana has already started in the area. People entrusted with the responsibility of preventing the production of marijuana and destroying the crops are remaining silent, even after realizing the seriousness of the matter. More area in the hilly regions therefore are being turned to cultivation of this dangerous plant. Different sources say that about 80 percent of the marijuana produced in these areas is smuggled to Saudi Arabia, Greece, the United States, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Bangkok. The drug traffickers use Greek ships anchored in deep water. A large mafia group is engaged in the entire process, from cultivation to smuggling. Many people believe that some Department of Narcotics and Liquor officials are directly involved in this issue. Marijuana crops stretch over an eight-mile area on both sides of the Barmmachhari canal 15 miles east of Fatikchhari police station. This marijuana garden extends from the new Barmmachhari market to the old one. In Khagrachhari District, marijuana covers a three-mile area. The leaves of these plants are very developed. Marijuana is also being cultivated in large areas on the western and eastern side of Ranirhat and Bethbunia in the deep jungles of Rangamati District. Large areas of land patroled by the Mahalchhari police station in Rangamati District are also under cultivation. In Bandarban District, there are large tracts under cultivation on both sides of a canal located about eight miles east of the district headquarters. In Cox's Bazar District, marijuana is being cultivated inside the hills at a place about seven miles from the Ukhiya police station. At the beginning, people from Barisal District who have settled in these areas began marijuana cultivation in collaboration with a mafia group. They thought that this was a profitable business. Later, the Rohingya refugees who came to Bangladesh also became involved. Marijuana is being cultivated in 16 kanis [about eight acres] located on the eastern side of the Maricha market patroled by the Ukhiya police station. It is also being cultivated on a large-scale basis in an area covering more than eight to nine miles in the deep forests east of the Ramu police station. In this area, it is mainly the people from Barisal District and the Rohingya refugees who are engaged in its cultivation. Apart from these areas, marijuana is being cultivated in large tracts in the three districts of CHT's and Cox's Bazar. Cultivation began in these areas in 1985 when the government imposed a ban on marijuana production and use. An organized international mafia group is encouraging the poor people living in the hilly areas to cultivate marijuana by paying them in advance. They have started large-scale cultivation of the plant as they make a lot of profit from it. It has been learned that the mafia group buys the leaves of the marijuana plant at a very nominal price from these production centers. The dried leaves are loaded into trucks and brought to Chittagong city, with the bags of marijuana leaves hidden under vegetables. This marijuana is stored in underground warehouses in various parts of Chittagong city, including Patenga. Later, it is carried by small boats to ships berthed at the outer anchorage of Chittagong Port. Marijuana is being purchased from the cultivators at the rate of 1,000 taka [about $25] per kg, but is loaded into ships at a cost of about $300 per kg. Though cultivation has increased alarmingly during the past few years, officials of the department concerned have not taken any action in this regard. It is reported that six tons of marijuana were seized once from Barmmachhari area. It is surprising that the informer who traced the location of these marijuana fields at the risk of his life and reported it to the concerned authorities has not been rewarded. It has been learned that he has gone into hiding, but the personnel of the Department of Narcotics and Liquor have not apprised the senior authorities of the matter. A question has arisen as to whether the government has been informed about this large-scale cultivation of marijuana. If it has been informed about it, then why is it not taking steps to destroy these marijuana gardens? The trusted people of the government high command should make an aerial survey of the areas under cultivation to verify the allegations. Informed quarters feel that if the government fails to take timely action, then it will become difficult to foil the conspiracy which has been hatched to convert these areas into the second Golden Triangle.
