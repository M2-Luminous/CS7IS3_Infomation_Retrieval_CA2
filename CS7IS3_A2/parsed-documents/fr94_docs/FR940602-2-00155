FR940602-2-00155 FR940602-2-00094 The Forest Service, in responding to the administrative appeal decision, seeks a permit review and issuance process that does not show bias in favor of the recreation residence use, nor an intent by policy to remove the permitted use. Readers are reminded that whether recreation residence use should continue to be permitted on National Forest System lands is not the issue addressed in this final policy. The Assistant Secretary's appeal decision did not challenge the appropriateness or continuation of the use. Rather, it focussed on legal flaws identified in the 1988 policy and in the process by which that policy was adopted. This final policy responds solely to the specific provisions in the appeal decision. The agency has not revised, redirected, or otherwise changed the national guidance stated in the 1988 policy and which was not debated in the appeal decision. Several respondents offered editing suggestions on the proposed policy. For example, the words ``lot'' and ``site'' were used interchangeably in describing the holder's permitted area. The agency agrees that use of a single term improves clarity and has used the word ``lot'' throughout the final policy. Also, the words ``permittee'' and ``holder'' were both used to identify the party holding the permit for the recreation residence lot. Holder is the correct term and is used throughout the final policy. The use of terms ``termination'' and ``revocation'' in this policy, when describing the action leading to cessation of the privileges granted by the permit, have caused confusion among holders and agency field personnel alike. A recent amendment to the Manual (FSM 2705) clarified these terms and made their use consistent with regulations at 36 CFR 251. This action requires a conforming revision to the recreation residence policy. In most cases, the term ``revocation'' replaces the term ``termination.'' To aid readers in understanding use of these terms in the final policy, they are defined as follows: Revocation: The cessation of a special use authorization by action of the authorized officer prior to the end of the specified period of occupancy or use due to the holder's noncompliance with the terms of the authorization, failure to exercise the privileges granted, or for reasons that are in the interest of the general public. Revocations are appealable by the holder. Termination: The cessation of a special use authorization by operation of law or the occurrence of a fixed or agreed-upon condition, event or time without the necessity for any decision or action by the authorized officer. Several other editing suggestions are incorporated into the final policy. Finally, many respondents offered comments on provisions of the policy that were not addressed in the Assistant Secretary's appeal decision. For example, several respondents objected to the provision in the permit which requires holders to ``inspect the lot and adjoining areas for dangerous trees, hanging limbs, and other evidence of hazardous conditions which could affect the improvements and or pose a risk of injury to individuals.'' (Permit provision IV.G) This provision was in the permit adopted as part of the August 10, 1988, policy. As such, it was not considered in this revision of that policy. The agency appreciates receiving these comments. They are an indication of holder concerns and will be considered as the policy is updated and kept current. Specific Comments and Response The October 10, 1991, Federal Register notice requested public comments on a proposed revision to the recreation residence policy. The material in that notice was arranged in 7 discussion topics that grouped the revisions into elements or segments of the four agency directives that bear on recreation residences. These 7 discussion topics are also used in this notice. However, the entire recreation residence policy is presented in this notice so that readers can see the revisions in the context of the complete direction. Many of the respondents offering specific comments also asked that key provisions and phrases from one part of the policy be added to provisions elsewhere in the policy to lend emphasis or clarity to the provision. The Forest Service advises that the redundancy occurring as a result of this would be inconsistent with agency directive system policy. Readers are also advised that Forest Service direction for administering recreation residence permits, or any other type of special use authorization, does not stand alone in the agency's administrative manual or handbooks. The direction in this notice is dependent on overall direction affecting the entire special use program which appears in Federal Regulations at 36 CFR part 251, subpart B, and titles 2300 and 2700 of the Manual. In addition, other direction affecting the management of the National Forest System bears upon the recreation residence policy. In particular, direction dealing with planning for all land and resource management activity and related direction dealing with environmental analysis and compliance with the National Environmental Policy (NEPA), found at FSM 1920, and FSM 1950 and FSH 1909.15, respectively, greatly influences the direction contained in this notice. The agency has added cross-references where appropriate when a specific policy provision is guided by broader policy direction.
