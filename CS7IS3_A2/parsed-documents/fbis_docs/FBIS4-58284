This impression is correct, as their movement is gradually gaining strength. This strength is not based on logic, however; it is based on the power of the throat. It is with the force of their voice that the opposition parties have severely shaken all parts of India from Kashmir down to Kanniyakumari [Tamil Nadu]. Their thundering sound was heard mainly in West Bengal. Like the clouds that precede a rainstorm if they encounter a depression, the thunder clouds of their anti-Dunkel movement weakened once they crossed the coasts of West Bengal and entered other parts of the country. Thus the tiger was converted into a mouse. There is nothing to be surprised about. Though the opposition claims they have the people's support, they know very well that public opinion is not in their favor. Neither the number of people attending their rallies at the Calcutta Brigade Ground nor the extent of the anarchy let loose by the people in the streets of West Bengal proves this party has public support. It only speaks to the organizational strength of the party; that is, its capacity to gather people. It is not a great feat for Jyoti Basu [West Bengal chief minister] or Subhas Chakrabarty [West Bengal minister of sports and youth services], who are in power in West Bengal, to display this strength. These anti-GATT rallies in the state, under the patronage of the state government, are just meetings intended to make noise, similar to those held on other occasions. It is not a major achievement to gather people for such meetings in a densely populated country like ours, particularly when holidays are declared in courts and offices and the required number of buses and trucks are provided for participants. This advantage available in West Bengal is not found in other parts of the country. This hue and cry is being raised in the name of the general masses, but they do follow the leftist line at all. Why should they think so? The opposition parties have been launching propaganda against the Dunkel proposals for a long time. Despite this, the general public does not give any heed to their propaganda. Why should they? The people have come to realize that slogans are the only driving force behind this hue and cry. Besides, they have come to learn that this is false propaganda and that false statements are being presented to the people in fancy language. What is happening in the fields and in the parliament is not publicity; it is false propaganda. These political parties claimed that if India signed the Marrakech agreement, in a few moments the price of medicine would increase several fold and people in the villages would not be able to pluck the leaves of their neem trees, adding that U.S. permission would be required to pluck these leaves. These parties further claimed that representatives of international agencies would grab paddy seedlings from the farmers as they went to plant them. They issued many similar warnings. If we listen to all this, it looks as if a grandmother is trying to frighten a child by telling him about witches. The false stories about witches are similar to those of the opposition parties in their propaganda against the Dunkel proposals and the Marrakech agreement. The truth is that a total of 105 countries met and finalized this agreement. In doing so, every country had to give up some of the demands they had submitted. None of the states were able to achieve everything they wanted from this agreement. If a comparative study is made of the profits and losses, it will be seen that India will not lose but will gain from this accord. The valuable information provided by the commerce minister in this regard is a clear yardstick for the gains India will achieve from this accord. Those whose only intention is play politics will not heed these valuable words. Since the Rajya Sabha went into session, these political parties have started jumping up and down in the house. They are raising a hue and cry alleging that the country's independence is being sold out. They are disrupting the proceedings of the assembly. This clearly shows that their condemnation or criticism does not have any healthy objective. It aims only to fulfill cheap political goals. The leftist political parties in the country and like-minded intellectuals are solely responsible for this narrow-minded, illogical, and damaging propaganda. These leftist political parties have committed several mistakes in the past. During World War II, they distanced themselves from the independence struggle and directly obstructed this movement. They did not accept Subash Chandra [independence leader also known as Netaji Basu] as a patriot; they branded him a traitor. They have long been bitter critics of private capital and foreign industrial organizations. They have been forced to admit all of their mistakes one by one. Now their spokesman is paying tribute to Gandhi and Nehru, and they have become followers of Netaji Basu. In recent speeches their leaders have appeared eager for foreign technology and capital. The day will come when they will also admit their mistakes regarding the Dunkel proposals and GATT, but history will not pardon these sinners. In the meantime, the Bharatiya Janata Party's [BJP] condition has become critical because of its involvement in this false propaganda. On the issue of whether to support or oppose the Dunkel proposals, the BJP has decided to oppose them. There is nothing to be surprised about. Behind its cloak of championing the cause of Hinduism, this party is also a leftist party. Vishwanath Pratap Singh's [Janata Dal leader] stand on this issue is different. He has stated that there is no alternative to signing the GATT treaty. Will Jyoti Basu listen to his "friend" today?
