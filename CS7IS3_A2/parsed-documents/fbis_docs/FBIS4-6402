The bigger group that combines seven members of the House of Representatives announced the inauguration of "Jiyuto" (Liberal Party) at a news conference. Six members -- Koji Kakizawa, Seiichi Ota, Shokei Arai, Shizuo Sato, Taku Yamamoto and Kenzo Yoneda -- left the main opposition party earlier this week expressing support for former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe's bid for premiership. The seventh person, Sanae Takaichi, was an independent. Kakizawa, a former parliamentary vice foreign minister, heads the new party. Meanwhile, the three JNP defectors, all House of Representatives members, launched "Group Seiun [Blue Cloud]." The members are Fumihiko Igarashi, Sakihito Ozawa and Akio Nakajima, who tendered their resignations Sunday to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, head of the JNP. The three men, in quitting the JNP, issued a statement critical of moves toward a realignment of political parties, as led by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito [Clean Government Party]. Jiyuto was inaugurated two days after five other LDP defectors launched a new party named New Party Mirai (Future) on Monday. In the upcoming Diet election to select a successor to Hosokawa, Jiyuto is expected to field its own candidate. Since last Friday, 12 LDP lower house members have seceded from the party.
