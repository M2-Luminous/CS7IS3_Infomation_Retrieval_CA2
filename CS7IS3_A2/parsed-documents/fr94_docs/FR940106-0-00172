The provisions of part 3 of subtitle D of title I of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (the ``OTCA''), Public Law 100&hyph;418, approved on August 23, 1988, made material changes in the TAA Program for workers that are reflected in the amended regulations published with this new section on transition guidelines for the 1988 Amendments. States and cooperating State agencies shall be guided by the following paragraphs of this section in the transition to the TAA Program as modified by the 1988 Amendments and reflected in the preceding provisions of this part 617, as well as in the interim operating instructions issued by the Department which are superseded by these regulations. The operating instructions in GAL 15&hyph;90, and the Changes thereto, shall continue in effect as guidance on the proper application of the 1988 Amendments except as modified in these final regulations. (GAL 15&hyph;90 is available from the Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Ave., NW., room C&hyph;4318, Washington, DC 20210.) (a) Oil and gas workers_prospective. Workers in firms or appropriate subdivisions of firms engaged in exploration or drilling for oil or natural gas are newly covered under the TAA Program by an amendment to section 222 of the Trade Act of 1974. This is a permanent change in the Act having prospective effect, and became effective on August 23, 1988. Oil and gas workers covered by a certification issued pursuant to section 223 of the Act and the regulations at 29 CFR part 90 shall be entitled to basic and additional TRA and other TAA Program benefits on precisely the same terms and conditions as apply to other workers covered by other certifications and which are specifically set forth in this part 617. (b) Oil and gas workers_retroactive. Oil and gas workers referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, who were separated from adversely affected employment after September 30, 1985, are covered retroactively under section 1421(a)(1)(B) of the OTCA, if they are covered by a certification issued pursuant to section 223 of the Act which is in response to a petition filed in the Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance on or before November 18, 1988. Administration of TAA Program benefits to these workers shall be on precisely the same terms and conditions as apply to other workers covered by other certifications, except that the limitations of the impact date provision of section 223(b) and the 60-day preclusion in section 231(a) may not be applied to these workers. (c) Benefit information to workers. (1) An amendment to section 225 of the Act requires individualized and published notices to workers covered by certifications issued pursuant to section 223 of the Act. This amendment became effective as a requirement on September 22, 1988, and is applicable to all certifications issued on and after that date. Individualized notices and published notices shall contain the information specifically set forth in this part 617.
