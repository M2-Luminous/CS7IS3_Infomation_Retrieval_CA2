Vielman commented on this visit during an impromptu news conference: [Begin recording] [Vielman] I am going to discuss the travel warning [previous two words in English], the progress of the SGT [expansion unknown], and the so-called parity, which is the temporary treatment the U.S. Government would give to Central American imports to partially align them with the benefits that NAFTA grants. It is also important to present to the U.S. Government the progress made in the peace process, especially because the United States is one of the friendly countries that supports the Guatemalan peace process. I will also meet with the administrative personnel of certain congressmen who have visited Guatemala to assess the country's situation; therefore, it is important that they hear, from the Foreign Ministry, the government's position on various issues. I also plan to grant interviews to the media, such as CNN and others. The Guatemalan Embassy is in charge of that. [Unidentified reporter] When will you travel? [Vielman] Today. [Reporter] How long will the visit last? [Vielman] Three days. The Guatemalan Foreign Ministry can give you the list of meetings I will attend. I have scheduled meetings that will last 30 minutes or one hour each. I have a busy schedule. [Reporter] Who will accompany you? [Vielman] Our ambassador to Washington, Fernando Suzen, director of Multilateral Relations, and Foreign Ministry Adviser Francisco Villagran De Leon. [Reporter] Will anyone from the private sector go? [Vielman] No, not on this occasion, but I am taking with me a copy of an Economy Ministry document on the meetings it held with the private sector last month. We have already coordinated everything so that the position of the government and the private sector will be coherently presented in Washington. [end recording]
