In view of the dramatic changes in Germany, Europe, and the world in the past few years, the priority now must be to make the political and economic unification of Europe irreversible, Kohl said today at the 45th master craftsmen's meeting of Duesseldorf Chamber of Trades and Crafts. Kohl reaffirmed his support for a federal Europe and firmly rejected a central European bureaucracy. It is now primarily a question of bringing life to the Maastricht Treaty. A common asylum policy and the fight against cross-border crime are important issues. Europe is also vital for the German economy, the chancellor said. Over 3.5 million jobs in Europe -- about every 10th job -- now depend on exports to the other countries of the European Union. Kohl pointed out that society needs a lively small business sector which takes risks and is a dynamic force. He called upon the trades and crafts sector to continue this year to do all it can to ensure an adequate supply of training places. The state will provide the necessary supplementary funds -- despite the budget constraints -- only if they are proved to be insufficient.
