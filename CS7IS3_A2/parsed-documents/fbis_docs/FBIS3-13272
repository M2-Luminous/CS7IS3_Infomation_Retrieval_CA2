Al-Shar' stressed that the full peace that Syria wants in return for an Israeli full withdrawal is the kind of peace accepted internationally by all states that have formal peace treaties. The Syrian foreign minister made the remarks to Knesset Members Wahhab 'Abd-al-Darawshah and Talib al-Sani' and the other delegation members when they dined with him for the final meal of the Ramadan fast. Our correspondent Qaysar Kabaha, who is with the delegation, reports that the delegation left Damascus last night for Cairo and are due home this morning.
