Speaking at a press conference in Tallinn on Tuesday, Estonian Premier Laar disapproved of the proposals that the problem be resolved under mediation by other states put forward by some Estonian politicians. However, he suggested that international mediation might be useful when resolving the issue on the borders with Russia which had reached a deadlock. Estonia does not recognize the unification of several regions which belonged to Estonia under the Russian-Estonian treaty of 1920 but then were joined to Russia in 1944-1945. Commenting on the coming round of the Estonian-Russian negotiations on April 5-6, Estonian Premier Laar stated that Estonia would make no concessions on the issue concerning residence permit for Russian retired servicemen living in Estonia. "We will act in accordance with our legislation and we are not going to change it," Estonian Premier Laar emphasized. However, he believes that the treaty on the Russian troops' withdrawal will be signed at the next round of the negotiations despite the fact that Russia conditions this issue with the one on retired servicemen. There are about 2,500 Russian servicemen remaining in Estonia who are expected to be withdrawn by August 31, 1994.
