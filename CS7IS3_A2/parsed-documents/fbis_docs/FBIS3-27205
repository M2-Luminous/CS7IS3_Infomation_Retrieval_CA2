Chairman Fung Kim-kee and Secretary Cheung Ka-min are willing to be Hong Kong affairs advisers; and vice chairman Leung Kuang-cheong, Liu Shing- lee, and District Board member Ou Neng-fa are willing to become district affairs advisers. Another member will make a decision after he finishes his consulting work in the district. The association must give a reply to the Chinese side tomorrow at the latest. According to a XINHUA official, Liu Shing-lee said, the responsibilities of the district affairs advisers will include offering advice on essential matters related to the transition, popularizing the Basic Law, and making proposals on district work. Although the Chinese side has invited us to be Hong Kong affairs and district affairs advisers in the capacity as individuals, Fung Kim-kee said, the association will regard it as a political appointment, which must be conditioned and supervised by the association because the association has to justify itself before the inhabitants.
