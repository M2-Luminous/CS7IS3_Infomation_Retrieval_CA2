The proposal envisages India, Pakistan, China, Russia and the United States together working out a formula for a nuclear-free South Asia. India, however, has been reluctant to participate in any such conference on the grounds that it is not prepared to limit consideration of nonproliferation strategies aimed only at South Asia. It has recently reiterated this position during the course of a visit by the US assistant secretary of state for South Asia. India's contention is that in the presence of a nuclear-armed China it is not possible for it to consider capping its nuclear programme. Now the US proposal to expand the framework to include Britain, France, Japan and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) could be seen as a way of bringing more pressure to bear upon the two sides to work out some kind of an acceptable arrangement. The current US emphasis does not appear to be on absolute nuclear disarmament. The effort is now directed at getting the two sides, at least in the initial stage, to freeze their existing arsenals at current levels. The objective of a roll-back would be pursued at a later stage. As a part of this graduated approach, also, Pakistan has repeatedly signalled its willingness to undertake the necessary nonproliferation measures in tandem with a similar policy on the part of India. The latter has, however, continued to invoke the argument of a nuclear China as well as the need to discuss any such measures not by reference just to South Asia but in a much broader, global, context. In a sense, this proposal by including among the participants all the permanent members of the Security Council, as well as Japan and the IAEA does meet India's demands for a broader context for discussing the issue of nonproliferation. But how much help this will be in getting India to make any meaningful change in its rigid position on the issue remains to be seen. In any such context Pakistan could also find itself being subjected to increasing pressure by powerful global and regional actors. It is important, therefore, for Pakistan's policy-makers to identify its policy options carefully in this regard, beyond the understandable linkage with India's nuclear programme that it has continued to emphasise. There appears to be a heightened US interest in Pakistan's nuclear programme as demonstrated by its recent offer to allow the sale of 38 F-16s that Pakistan has already paid for in exchange for a verifiable capping of its nuclear programme. The upcoming visit by the US deputy secretary of state is also in the same context. While there appears to be general consensus in Pakistan on rejecting this offer it is interesting that it has been opposed also by Senator Pressler as well as Indian policy-makers, perhaps as a result of the apprehension that it will leave Pakistan with the ability to assemble a limited number of nuclear devices in short order while augmenting the ability of its air force, not least in the department of nuclear weapons delivery, in considerable measure. In any case Pakistan, while remaining mindful of its own security interest and the options available, should welcome the proposals to discuss the various aspects of the nonproliferation issue in a broader framework. Among other things, it should help in subjecting India's case for a voiding any meaningful response to Pakistan's various initiatives for a nuclear-free South Asia to a thorough review by the international community.
