The calm which had reigned in Russia since the December elections was shattered on Wednesday 23 February on the eve of Boris Yeltsin's address to the Federal Assembly on his reform program. Although he can pride himself on the "success" of his diplomacy in Bosnia, in Moscow he is being forced into a confrontation with Parliament, whose lower house -- the Duma -- has voted for an amnesty for last October's "putschists" and for the August 1991 "putschists." This is a decision which benefits dozens of his enemies, whether in prison or out of prison, and principally Aleksandr Rutskoy, the former vice president who enjoys a popularity capable of giving the opposition the figurehead it has lacked since Vladimir Zhirinovskiy has been discredited by his extremism. The issue is therefore an important one, and the tone taken by some people close to Boris Yeltsin in condemning this vote is reminiscent of that used on the eve of the October clashes. There is once again talk of a "threat of civil war" and they are warning that the deputies "will have to take all the consequences" of their action.... The former Communists and nationalists, of whom there are even more in the Duma than in the former Parliament, at the instigation of Mr. Zhirinovskiy's party, very quickly found the flaw in the new Constitution, despite the fact that it strips them of virtually all power to the benefit of the president or the prime minister. Although the laws adopted by the Duma can so easily be blocked, the Constitution does not stipulate any limit on its right to grant an amnesty. And yet on Thursday, the president's spokesman warned that there is no question of Boris Yeltsin allowing Aleksandr Rutskoy and the other putschists to leave prison "for weeks or months." He said a new war over interpretations of laws has begun but that the opposition's aims go further. Gennadiy Zyuganov, head of the Communist group in Parliament, has already called for the resignation of Boris Yeltsin and what remains of the reformers in the government as a "compromise" measure.... Boris Yeltsin will therefore have to ignore the Constitution with which he has provided himself and which, as he again stressed on Thursday, is the cornerstone of the country's stability. The West will be all the more tempted to continue to disregard the undemocratic lapses of the "reform president" in Russia even though it is true that these reforms are now taking an entirely different course, overtaken by the explosion of illegal practices, racketeering, and the exodus of capital.
