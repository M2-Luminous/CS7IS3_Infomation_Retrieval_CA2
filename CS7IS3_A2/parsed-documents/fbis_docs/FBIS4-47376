N. Aleksandrov; UDC 528.93:516] [Abstract] Traditional mapping, data collection and processing must give way to computerization and far-reaching automation in order to meet the modern needs of the Russian economy. Geoinformation systems are a point of departure and this concept must be further developed; in particular, integrated regional geoinformation systems are needed. One aspect of related work is digital mapping. In 1992 a federal digital mapping program was organized in Russia which was collated with 28 ministries and departments. It is planned that in 1994 work will be completed on the preparation of digital maps at 1:100 000 for the whole of Russia and by 1994-1996 the same will be done at 1:200 000 for the most important regions. There is a real market for these maps. In the future it is planned that topographic maps at all scales will be converted to digital form. All this will facilitate automation of processes involved in the production of thematic and special maps. The same procedure will be applied in urban and land surveys. These are but the first steps, for example, in ensuring effective ecological monitoring and territorial inventorying of natural resources. The maintenance of regional databanks is a priority task, revision must be on a frequent basis and an ever-increasing number of procedures must be automated. The many related problems involved are discussed. The introduction of geoinformation systems must proceed on an accelerated basis, accompanied by an increase in the productivity of labor by a factor of 5-7. Digital cartographic information must be organized and managed by federal agencies with long-term funding and a uniform quality control must be introduced and implemented. The information system must be organized on the basis of a decentralized model which takes into account the participation of all interested organizations in use of this information and all users must have equal access.
