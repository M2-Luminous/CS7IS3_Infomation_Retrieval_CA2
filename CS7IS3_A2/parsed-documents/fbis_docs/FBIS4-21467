Viktor Danilov-Danilyan, Russian minister for the protection of the environment and natural resources, said this during the course of a meeting today with Japanese Ambassador to Moscow Koji Watanabe. The minister gave this explanation in reply to the ambassador's expressed concern over Japanese press reports that the Maritime Kray authorities were allegedly planning to sanction the further release of radioactive waste into the Sea of Japan. Danilov-Danilyan made the supposition that a decision on the dumping ``may easily be avoided, especially if Japan provides financial and technical assistance at the right time, and we are able to set up temporary coastal capacity to store the waste.'' [passage omitted] During the course of today's meeting, Danilov-Danilyan highly appraised Japan's desire for cooperation in this sphere. He also gave an assurance that his ministry would carry out a thorough ecological study, both of temporary capacities for storing liquid radioactive waste and of capacities for turning it into solid waste.
