He met with Deputy Premier and Minister of the National Unification Board (NUB) Yi Hong-ku earlier in the morning before heading for Pyongyang via Panmunjom. Carter also met with President Kim Yong-sam and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu Tuesday. The former U.S. leader is scheduled to meet with North Korean President Kim Il-song Wednesday evening and will likely convey the international community's concern over Pyongyang's replacement of nuclear fuel rods and abrupt withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. He also plans to inform Kim Il-song of Seoul's and Washington's firm position that if Pyongyang does not accept IAEA inspections, United Nations sanctions are inevitable. Carter, however, is likely to emphasize that if North Korea guarantees nuclear transparency, it can improve its relations with the United States and receive economic support from various countries, a diplomatic source said. The former president plans to stay in Pyongyang four days before returning to Seoul via Panmunjom Saturday to brief President Kim Yong-sam on the results of his talks. He will later hold a press conference to discuss his meeting with Kim Il-song before departing from Seoul.
