He told a nationally televised news conference at his official residence this evening that the government should introduce higher indirect taxes to extend this year's income tax cuts into years ahead. Without a hike in indirect taxes, he said, the government "cannot finance the income tax cut with the issuance of deficit-covering bonds, since the accumulated budget deficit will exceed 200 trillion yen (1.9 trillion U.S. dollars). Hata also said his government will abide by any United Nations resolutions in seeking a solution to the suspected nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula under the constraints of Japan's war-renouncing constitution. Asked how his administration would try to overcome difficulties of a shaky minority coalition cabinet, Hata said he will ask the opposition Liberal Democratic Party and Social Democratic Party to cooperate "on whatever policies they can, such as the legislation of the budget bills." He dismissed suggestions that he would have no choice but to dissolve the 511-seat House of Representatives and call a general election in the face of a possible submission of a no-confidence motion by the opposition.
