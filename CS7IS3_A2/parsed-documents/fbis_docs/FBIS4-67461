The next round of the pre-election struggle is fast approaching, and everybody has suddenly started mentioning ecology. Are the candidates just making eyes at a fashionable topic? Or do you have a different interpretation of this matter? Panov: No. That's the way it has been and always will be in all countries, not only in our young Ukrainian state. Populism, demagogy--neither you nor I made up these words. The world, unfortunately, is unfinished and imperfect. Smaha: That's true, Anatoliy Mykhaylovych, but do you recall how the Green Movement began in Ukraine? That first meeting near the Central Kiev Stadium on 13 November 1988, the First Congress of the Green World [Zeleniy svit] Association with the dazzling greetings by Oles Honchar, the first election--as it were--to a democratic parliament. That "rebuilt euphoria"--what was it that brought it all to an end so suddenly? Panov: In my opinion, it was the profound crisis in the environmental-protection movement. Smaha: But what caused this? Because for nearly seven years you were the deputy chairman and executive director of the Green World Association, and so--to a certain extent--you must have felt responsible for what happened in this country's environmental-protection movement.... Panov: That's true. Nor do I shirk my responsibility in this matter. But understand me correctly: From the very beginning our movement has included forces that can be characterized--so to speak--as centrifugal and centripetal. Some persons (a typical example would be Serhiy Konev from Dniproderzhynsk) who emphasized the political aspects of the cause. Others (and here i could cite Alla Shevchuk from Odessa) regarded the coordinating organ as something to provide help in solving small-scale, regional problems--things live saving the well-know Kulyanyk Estuary near Odessa. The "politicians" and the "practioners" persisted in taking very different stances in their attitude toward the environmental-protection movement. Enthusiasm really did exert a substantial influence on the fate of the Green World Association. Smaha: Just what did happen? Was it something similar to the former Society for Environmental Protection? Panov: No, come on now Valentyn Ivanovych! People were making careers, and the cause stood still. I don't want to publicly name those persons who made careers for themselves based on the phraseology of environmental protectionism. Nor do I wish to enumerate the "beetles" who became rich on Western aid or various kinds of speculative ventures. What I want to do here is to list the problems which Green World has done some organizational work on. The public can solve them or not, as it sees fit.... Smaha: What specific problems do you mean? Panov: First, there should be a moratorium on building new units at nuclear-power stations, and the continuation of operations at the Chernobyl AES [Nuclear-Power Station] should be revoked. These continued operations threaten Ukraine with a catastrophe in the very near future. They will not bring the energy crisis to an end, but rather deepen the economic crisis. The whole trouble is that Ukraine lacks a machine-building and raw-material base for nuclear-power engineering. All the talk about the effectiveness of our nuclear-power stations is a bluff. We do not have such possibilities as Beria had for maintaining order in the atomic-power industry. Nor will we ever have them. It would mean that one out of every three citizens would have to be condemned for the absurd Article 58. What nonsense.... Smaha: Does that mean that the aggressive plans to use nuclear power for Ukraine's future electric-power engineering are basedon nonsensical principles? Panov: Of course! Chernobyl in its present-day guise is potentially hazardous. We "Greens" have officially demonstrated that Kiev lies within the zone which suffered from the accident at this AES. People from Narodnychi have been resettled. But there are districts in Kiev where the level of gamma-type radiation is higher. Why, then, are Kievans not being resettled? Because the Supreme Council has blocked this decision. The reason is a simple one: They don't have the money to do this. Smaha: If they don't have the money, where did it all go? Panov: We must speak honestly about the conditions under which Ukraine's capital is now living. The state cannot help--the world community must come to its assistance! But we seem to regard it as best--during these times so trying to our souls--to conceal our illness within. It's as if we fail to understand that future generations will have to pay for this. Smaha: But could not all this likewise be understood as inflaming the passions? Panov: Certainly. But why, then, are the people who are most competent in these matters leaving Ukraine. Mykhaylo Sorokin has become director of the Kursk AES, after having left the Chernobyl AES. The deputy general director of Ukratomenergonaglyad--Heorhiy Kopchynskiy--has quit working there. And the director of the Ukryttya facility--Mykola Sherbyna--has also left his post. These people are professional experts in the nuclear-power field! They understand better than anyone what is going on. But we--either because of stupidity or willful negligence--continue to keep millions of people in ignorance. Smaha: There's a great deal of talk nowadays about a new isotope--americium. Its appearance will compel us to rethink the entire strategy of eliminating the consequences of the Chernobyl accident. What's your attitude toward this? Panov: I view it as a great deal of speculation on a fashionable topic. Carrying the weight of authority for me are the words of Academician Dmytro Grodzynskyy to the effect that americium will not be any safer that the hot sections in the core of Energy Unit No. 4 at the Chernobyl AES. And the presence of material from these sections has been ascerained even as far away as California.... Therefore, let me repeat the following: The declaration of Kiev as a place which suffered from the Chernobyl AES is a central question in the politics of eliminating the consequences of the accident there. Smaha: Let me make sure that I've understood you correctly: You're saying that the bureaucrats who are shutting their eyes to the obvious truth are knowingly condemning our capital to die out gradually? Panov: I would not use the word "knowingly." It is more through stupidity and ignorance. The central question is up to the strength and possibility of the state environmental-protection organ with strong support from the public. So far our Ministry of Environmental Protection has been producing ambassadors: in Israel and in Romania. Now Mykola Korobko is a functionary in Krivoy Rog. But when he was a deputy, he at least set to work and made an active initiative. The ministry, however, as soon as this project started to gather momentum, has cut it off at the roots by an administrative reduction of personnel. Just think: We are reducing a department which could enable us to survive! Nothing more absurd could be thought up. Everything is perishing in the debates on environmental protection. A typical example is Mykola Fedorynchyk, who is the present executive director of Green World. Words, words, words.... There are no people who do anything--that's the whole trouble. Smaha: As I understand it, the key question is reforming the political system. Are you taking part in the election struggle? Panov: Yes, I am. The collective of the Kiev Polytechnical Institute has put me up as a candidate for the office of deputy from the Radyanskyy Election District. I am participating in the election as a citizen, and I have a calm attitude toward my possible defeat. But the "Greens" are people with intense feelings. The stormy disputes within the Association are turning some truly intelligent persons away from us. The Association is becoming impoverished of intellect and enriched with careerism. This is hardly to the benefit of our cause. I left Green World because of its political intrigues. I consider that the main thing is to achieve effective work by the environmental organs. Here's a simple example. An inspector closes down the Mariopol Sintering Plant as being too harmful to the health of the population there. But the minister opens it up again, citing its "importance" for the Ukrainian economy.... Smaha: And just how will things develop? Panov: As of now, parallel structures are emerging within the environmental-protection movement. They have lost faith in things as they presently exist. I can cite as an example the "Mama-86" organization--an association of young Kievan ecologists. Matters simply cannot go on as they are now. I think that--with some help from VECHIRNIY KYYIV--the Green World Association will achieve a new life. I am opposed to the political bent in its work, and--indeed--I am against politicking as such. Let's try to help the readers of this newspaper to analyze and understand such vitally important questions as the true safety of americium, the ecological time bomb under Kiev, the so-called polygon in Pyrogova, and defective production. Let's give some thought to how to regulate the chaotic building of dachas near Kiev and to accord our city the status of a sufferer from the accident at the Chernobyl AES. There are many other unsolved problems, the solutions to which--I anticipate--we will be seeking with the help of VECHIRNIY KYYIV's readers.
