Dee said the government peace panel is considering "other options" if the talks with NDF Jose Maria Sison and Luis Jalandoni failed. "If the exploratory talks will not take place in the first quarter, we have to consider other options like opening up to the revisionist faction in the communist movement," Dee said. Dee made the statement two days after the Alex Boncayao Brigade (ABB) released the names of some 345 persons marked for liquidation for their alleged involvement in various crimes. He said the threatened new wave of assassination by the ABB hit squad will not affect the peace negotiations between the government and the NDF. Dee said the ABB's threat to liquidate corrupt officials in the government, including police and military officials, will not directly affect the stalled talks with the NDF. He noted that the hit squad had already broken off from the mainstream communist movement.
