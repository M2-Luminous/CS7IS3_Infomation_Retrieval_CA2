He said the south Lebanon issue has nothing to do with the Middle East problem. He expressed the hope that the Lebanese negotiations [with Israel] would resume and that Israel would withdraw from south Lebanon and from all the occupied Arab territories, because the Arabs have a just cause. In his news conference, which coincided with the 19th anniversary of the war in Lebanon, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said: We hoped the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho would have been implemented today. But Israel has retreated from its position. He stressed that the Arabs have a just cause and that the negotiations must continue and succeed, especially if the aim is to achieve peace: [Begin 'Abd-al-Majid recording] There are of course difficulties and obstacles facing the peace negotiations. This is happening on every track: the Palestinian, Syrian, Lebanese, and Jordanian. But the peace process must continue and we must not decide to stop the negotiations with Israel. I do not support such a stance because we have a just cause. It would be the easiest thing to stop the negotiations but the most difficult thing to resume them, especially if their aim is to achieve peace. Peace is [words indistinct] and is missed most by those who are deprived of it. [passage omitted] The peace negotiations must continue but continuing them does not mean I capitulate. Never. I insist on my stance and do not abandon my demands. I do whatever would ensure the success of these negotiations and peace. I reiterate that peace is not a gift from Israel to the Arab countries. Not at all. Israel is acting as if it is honoring us with peace. Thank you very much. When the just and comprehensive peace is achieved, Israel will be among the first to benefit from it.
