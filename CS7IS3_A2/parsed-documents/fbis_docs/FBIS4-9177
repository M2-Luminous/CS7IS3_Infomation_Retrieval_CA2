Pavol Kanis, historian and philosopher, combines in the present post his civilian views on the defense of the state with the reality of military practice and, together with the experts in the department, seeks the way toward the goals that stand above all narrow partisan or group interests. We asked him for an interview on the subject of the first weeks of his work in the present post. [Rusko] Sir, although you have occupied the ministerial post for only a month now, you have held talks already with several partners who have occupied their posts much longer. How would you assess these meetings? [Kanis] That month--i.e., one-sixth of the government before the next parliamentary elections--passed very quickly. I have tried to fill the empty shelves I "inherited" as quickly as possible. The understanding of the important problems and integral ideas of their systemic solutions require much more time. The things are better in the sphere of foreign-security policy. It is possible to build on the long-term orientation trend of the Slovak Republic toward the transatlantic and West European security structures. Similarly, the efforts at a good relationship with the neighboring states and armies continue uninterrupted. My meetings with Hungarian Defense Minister Fur and Polish Defense Minister Kolodejczyk were carried out in this spirit. The talks with these two partners concerned the problems of security in Central Europe, cooperation between the defense sectors of the Visegrad Four countries, and the implementation of individual stages of the Partnership for Peace plan. They included very stimulating exchanges of views on cooperation in the military sphere and specific possibilities for cooperation in special production. I also consider the visit to Israel and the meetings with Prime Minister and Defense Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Sim'on Peres a success. They proved that there are no fundamental points of contention between the Slovak Republic and Israel. The approach of Slovak foreign policy to the Israeli-Arab relations is balanced and conforms to the criterion of rational detachment from the Middle Eastern disputes and conflicts. Concord and cooperation between the Slovak and Israeli military experts and manufacturers and exporters of special technology could be very interesting. [Rusko] You are a civilian. What do you feel when you decide on issues that have always been dominated by soldiers? [Kanis] It is true that I am the first civilian defense minister in this country. It has its advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is, above all, that I do not feel I have to compete with professional soldiers and that I can deal with the issues much more forcefully, regardless of the rank. Our Army is a young army. It needs numerous concepts and regulations that are a part of the legal basis for the operation of the army in a democratic state. This provides a lot of room for a defense minister, a civilian. I focus, above all, on the foreign-security dimension of the defense sector and the society-wide context of the mission and operation of the Army of the Slovak Republic. [Rusko] What is the orientation of the Defense Ministry in the sphere of foreign contacts? [Kanis] The Defense Ministry will base its plans in the sphere of foreign relations and international cooperation on the foreign political line of the Slovak Republic, the Defense Doctrine of the Slovak Republic, which is to be submitted for approval in the government and the National Council of the Slovak Republic, and the Presentation Document, which is a specific derivative of the framework Partnership for Peace document. The security of the Slovak Republic is a component of European and world security. Therefore, in our efforts to guarantee our own security, we orient ourselves, above all, toward the North Atlantic Alliance, the Western European Union, the CSCE, and the United Nations. We consider stable, conflict-free, and fair relations with our immediate neighbors, with an emphasis on the development of multilateral cooperation, an important aspect of our national security. Cooperation in the military sphere with the countries of the Visegrad Four Group is of particular importance. [Rusko] What specific steps will the Defense Ministry take in the implementation of the Partnership for Peace (PFP) plan? [Kanis] The main purpose of the participation of the Slovak Republic in the Partnership for Peace plan is in cooperation with the NATO-member countries to gradually create the basic conditions for obtaining full membership in the North Atlantic Alliance. All of the consequential political entities in the Slovak Republic in principle agree on this step. Nonetheless, we are realists and are aware that the Partnership for Peace plan is also a result of considerations for the geopolitical interests of the Russian Federation in the Central European domain. At this time, after the signing of the framework Partnership for Peace plan by the individual states, we have reached the stage of the drafting and adoption of the Presentation Document, and this will be followed by the formation of the individual program of specific cooperation of each signatory with the North Atlantic Alliance. According to the adopted government policy statement, we will submit the Presentation Document to the National Council of the Slovak Republic. The individual plan, which expresses our joint will and specifies join actions, will be something like a bilateral agreement between the Slovak Republic and NATO. The main objective of military cooperation within the Partnership for Peace plan is the achievement of the degree of compatibility of the Army of the Slovak Republic particularly on the tactical and operational levels needed for its problem-free international cooperation. [Rusko] One can hear about our obligations (PFP) and the modernization of the Army. There are certainly some budget limitations that must be overcome. Is it at all feasible? [Kanis] We must apply two criteria in the defense sector, particularly in the process of building the Army of the Slovak Republic--economy and military strategical efficiency. In the drafted Presentation Document, we reckon with designating 1 percent of the 1994 Defense Ministry budget--i.e., 104 million Slovak korunas--to cooperation within the PFP. How much longer can the needs of defense be reconciled with the limited budget possibilities of the Slovak Defense Ministry? Not much longer.
