M. Dorofeyev, chairman of Belarus State Ecological Committee, by A. Larin; place and date not given: "A Man of Action. If I Survive Until My Pension"] [Text] Look at the photograph. It shows the transfer of power of the chairman of the CIS Interstate Ecological Council (MES). Timofey Fomich Yanchuk, MES executive secretary is on the left, Askhad Sharipovich Khabibulayev, chairman of the Uzbekistan State Committee on Nature is on the right. Anatoliy Maksimovich Dorofeyev, chairman of the Belarus State Ecological Committee is shown in the middle. Presently the coordination of environmental preservation work in his native post-Soviet space is concentrated specifically in his hands. It is a complicated global task. In addition to that it is painstaking and intensive work in Belarus itself. Anatoliy Maksimovich has already been occupying this post for 3.5 years. Before that he did scientific work (an ornithologist by profession), taught and occupied the post of prorector at the Vitebsk Pedagogical Institute. According to Anatoliy Maksimovich himself it is very difficult for a person with his background to become an administrator. In my opinion, however, the Belarus State Ecological Committee was very fortunate with regard to its chairman. In his leisure time Anatoliy Maksimovich conducts ecological and regional studies and loves museums. Among the ones he visits most frequently are the Moscow State University Zoological Museum and the zoological museum on Vasilyev Island in St. Petersburg. It is remarkable when environmental protection work is managed by a person who loves and appreciates nature not only during working hours or because of the post he occupies. Larin: Tell us please about the basics of the environmental protection strategy of the Republic of Belarus. Dorofeyev: I am impressed with the viewpoint held by Albert Gora to the effect that the entire economy should be "green." It is clear, however, that this is something that will be possible only in the distant future. Meantime, while we are shifting to a market economy what is most important is introduction of an economic mechanism for the protection of the environment. In many respects it has already been implemented. A law on the ecological tax was introduced back in November 1991. The nonbudgetary environmental protection fund was restored (60 percent of it remains at the rayon level, 30 percent goes to the oblast, and 10 percent to the republic). Laws concerning protection of the environment and a commission of ecological experts have been adopted. They were received quite well by the specialists. The law on industrial and consumption waste was adopted quite recently, in November 1993, the law on specially protected natural territories was adopted in its first reading. Larin: As far as I know there is no law on waste anywhere in the CIS. Dorofeyev: Probably not. All of us hastened to rewrite it. That is the usual practice in relations. Whoever does it first, he will share with all. The law on protection and rational utilization of the animal and vegetable world was worked out in detail. It was highly praised at the Institute of Environmental Protection in Frankfort on the Main. On the whole it is planned to adopt 16 laws in the sphere of protection and utilization of natural resources. Many would like to see strict maximalist laws. But as long as we live in a transitional period, the laws will also be of a transitional nature. Larin: Anatoliy Maksimovich, one of the most painful issues concerns finances. Dorofeyev: I cannot shout "Hurrah!" for the financing that we receive. Some 1.5 percent of the budget goes for ecology plus a certain part of all capital investments. The total amounts to 2.5 percent. I am pleased with the tendency toward an increase in expenditures on ecology. Even though thus far there is no improvement in the situation and we have no right to expect one in the next two to three years. Larin: How are your relations with the ecological press? Dorofeyev: We have kept the magazine RODNAYA PRIRODA afloat. All of its founders abandoned it. But we carried it out on our shoulders. The newspapers EKOLOGIYA MINSKA and EKOLOGICHESKIY VESTNIK published in Gomel, also appear in the republic. We are planning the publication of an applied science magazine on environmental protection. Larin: Recently our newspaper informed me that a second "green" party, in addition to the Ecological Union, appeared in Belarus. What kind of relations do you have with it? Dorofeyev: I have had no discussions with the second "green" party. The Ecological Union has a more practical tilt to it. They do not substitute political posturing for actual work. They are more concrete, which I like. The development of the "green" party can take place only around that pivotal point. Larin: At present there is a lot of talk about the forthcoming unification of the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus. What is your opinion on this? Dorofeyev: Unification of monetary systems does not mean unification of the economies. I like cooperation with the Russian Federation at an international level, in part, within the MES framework. The value of our ecological alliance with Russia lies in the possibility of utilizing the intellectual and economic potential of each other. Larin: How are your relations with the Ministry of Nature of Russia developing? Dorofeyev: I worked when Vorontsov was there and know many people. The relations that formed are unselfish in many regards. Viktor Ivanovich Danilov-Danilyan sometimes offers intellectual help by sending his specialists which we do not have. At the next MES session, which will take place in Moscow in May, I will be transferring the chairmanship over to him. Larin: After the election of Mechislav Ivanovich Grib as chairman of the Supreme Council, a number of my colleagues have been criticizing him with considerable delight. Does he deserve that? Dorofeyev: No. I can say that Mechislav Ivanovich is a person who is very decisive with a good grasp of the situation which has formed in the republic. I have known him for a long time since Vitebsk, but not closely. It is necessary to give him his due. He is a good jurist, a skilled legal expert, and he will not permit any deviations from the law. Something else. He is having to work in a very difficult time. Larin: Are you referring to Vitebsk? Dorofeyev: Yes. I have gone through practically all of the literature on the history of Vitebsk area. I love to visit the homeland of the father of Belarus literature Jan Borshevskiy. If I survive until my pension I must write a book about the history of the native area, its nature. Larin: Anatoliy Maksimovich, our issue will appear by 8 March. Dorofeyev: I would like for our ecological movement to do everything possible in order to promote the health of women. Nature is vital to life. In protecting it we will improve the life of all women in Russia and Belarus.
