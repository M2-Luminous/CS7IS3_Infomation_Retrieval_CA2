The people are discontent because of the shortage of basic commodities for their survival. This atmosphere of instability is being caused by elements belonging to the government police, and outlaws armed by the government, who continue to raid the Boavista food warehouses near the port of Luanda. These warehouses belong to Lebanese businessmen who were brutally harassed by the government police recently. Mario Paiva from the South African Radio said the turbulent situation experienced in Luanda presently is intolerable. He said one bag of flour is already costing 1.2 million kwanzas, while imported beer costs 500,000 new kwanzas. In the face of this situation, Luanda residents will experience a very difficult period in the coming days.
