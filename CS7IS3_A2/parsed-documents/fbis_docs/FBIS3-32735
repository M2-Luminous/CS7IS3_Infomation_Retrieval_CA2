After the arrest of a cell that planned to "unleash" a strong wave of violence in Tarapoto, the Shining Path continued its attempt to occupy the vacuum left by the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Army (MRTA) in the Huallaga region after the defeat by the Army. During a recent tour of the region, EXPRESO listened to testimony that confirms that the Shining Path has managed to extend its area of action in San Martin Department. With their latest actions, SL members have reached northern San Martin, control some areas in the Lower and Middle Huallaga Valley, and, what is more worrisome, they have managed to hold on to their old areas of influence in the region. The recent Shining Path actions were concentrated in areas abandoned by MRTA. In Tarapoto, SL members attacked two Upper Huallaga Development Program (PEAH) officials, killing one and injuring the other at the beginning of last December. The attack took place at kilometer 22 of the Marginal Highway when the PEAH officials were returning from supervising work in Ponaza Valley. Two weeks before the attack, the SL had threatened the PEAH officials who operated in Aypena, Shamboyacu, and Alfonso Ugarte. PEAH officials who operate in other regions apparently have received the same threats. For example, PEAH engineers in Junjui have not gone to the fields in months as a result of SL threats. A few weeks ago in the town of Santa Clara, located in Mayo Medio -- where the MRTA had great influence -- 150 SL members gathered residents together and appointed some delegates. "We did not know what to do. We did not have weapons with which to defend ourselves," a peasant patrol member in the area told us. In La Banda de Shicayo, a populous neighborhood in Tarapoto, located three blocks from the local arms square, 20 people hailed the SL on the evening of 8 December. In the hamlet of Pasarrya, located near Saposoa, a group of SL members attempted to hold a meeting of residents and appoint delegates a few weeks ago. A short time later in Sisa Valley another group entered the towns of Nauta and Agua Blanca and burned the local municipal files. In Ponaza and Biavo, the SL arrived to control some hamlets and strengthened their presence in the region's capital in the past few months. The SL apparently is concentrating on turning this strategic area of the Huallaga region into its most important bastion because it has not suffered many casualties there and has made much progress. The fast spread of the SL in the region represents serious danger. Until January 1992 the Shining Path and MRTA had divided control over San Martin Department among themselves: The territory from Juanjui to the north was controlled by MRTA and the territory from Huicungo to the south was controlled by the SL. Now with the MRTA out of action, things have changed. The SL currently operates freely in the area previously controlled by MRTA. Its new operation areas are located in the extended territory between Tocache and the Lower Huallaga. The SL still maintains strong influence in its old area of influence between Huicungo and southern San Martin Department. In Huanuco, the group still controls the provinces of Huacaybamba, Huamalies, Huanuco, Leoncio Prado, and Maranon. Military sources guarantee that in these areas several subversive groups operate under the name of T-1, T-2, Astro Rojo, and T-4, which work with the "local force" of the Regional Huallaga Committee, which is the top SL organization in the region. It is thought that 200 SL members operate in those provinces to indoctrinate members. The "main force" operates in Ucayali, forming companies the subversives have named "Conquistar," "Atreverse," "Tormenta," and "Mar Rojo," or "ZB," "JR," and "AQ." These groups control Padre Abad Province and the towns of Aguaytia, Santa Ana, and San Alejandro. The Army believes these columns are "mobile" and are made up of 200 other SL members who are always armed. According to some intelligence reports, the hamlets of Costa Rica, Ledoy, Pajarillo, La Banda, Huayabamba, Barranca, Muralla, Gonzalez Prada, Alfonso Ugarte, and Rocafuerte, among other hamlets in San Martin Department, are the new "red zones" while La Morada, Cuchara, Pendencia, Paraiso, and Primavera continue being areas in which the SL has its "basic force" dedicated to production and surveillance. "Open people's committees" are thought to have been set up in several of the aforementioned places. Local residents and authorities -- like General Alfredo Rodriguez Rivero, the new commander of the Huallaga Counter Subversive Front, who replaced General Eduardo Bellido Mora -- have voiced concern about the spread of the SL in the San Martin region. During a ceremony at the "Leoncio Prado" military post at the end of last year, Gen. Rodriguez declared his concern about the SL's spread in the presence of several reporters from Tarapoto. Intelligence contends that SL's Regional Committee in Huallaga has kept its structure nearly intact. According to police, the Tarapoto cell had planned major attacks and the murder of the city's leading authorities. The cell was made up of 10 SL members, six of whom were captured in Tarapoto. Police reported that the subversives had been entrusted with several missions, including that of recruiting new members from Tarapoto schools and institutes and propagandizing SL ideology in the city. The dismantling of the cell was a severe blow to the SL, but there are no indications that it was a mortal one.
