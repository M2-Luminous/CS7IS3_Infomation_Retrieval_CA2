FBIS4-11479 "drlat082_n_94008" FBIS-LAT-94-082 Daily Report 13 Mar 1994 Chile Chamber of Deputies Leaders on Social, Institutional Reforms Chamber of Deputies Leaders on Social, Institutional Reforms 94SM0322A Santiago EL MERCURIO in Spanish 13 Mar 94 p C2 94SM0322A Santiago EL MERCURIO Spanish CSO [Text] The president and the vice president of the Chamber of Deputies, Jorge Schausohn (PPD [Party for Democracy]) and Alberto Ospina (RN [expansion not available]), respectively, were in agreement in stating that the new government, in its first phase, should give priority to social issues in order to reduce poverty in the country. The deputies expressed the conviction, separately, that the time has come to begin to resolve social problems, leaving political issues for a later phase. Schaulsohn said that it is time to launch important programs in the social area and to insist on a substantial reform of the Isapres [Institute of Public Health and Preventive Medicine] Law. He also supported the need for a basic study of the social security system. However, he said that while the Pension Fund Administration system has many advantages, it has the great defect that it will not provide decent pensions to persons of low and medium incomes, who represent the majority of the population. He advocated correcting the system, and proposed that the Chamber of Deputies designate a special commission to make proposals to restructure, correct, and improve Chile's social security system, which should be among the top priorities of the government that, since last Saturday, is headed by President Frei. Meanwhile, referring to reforms of existing institutions, Deputy Alberto Espina said that the opposition is prepared to approve those constitutional reforms that restore Congress's investigative powers and facilitate the passage of proposed laws through Congress. But the opposition is not disposed to approve those constitutional reforms, supported by Concertation, aimed at ending the permanency of the commanders in chief, and other reforms proposed by the outgoing government, which were included in the program of Eduardo Frei's administration. Espina thought it would be advisable, with the presidential and congressional elections over, to study the binomial electoral system in order to perfect it, but not to do away with it. Asked about the position expressed by Interior Minister German Correa in favor of preparing a draft bill which would permit the direct election of mayors, he said that it showed there was absolute agreement between opposition and government. He said that the right is in favor of ending the system of indirect election of mayors, as long as there is no repetition of the phenomenon that councilmen with 6 percent of the votes end up running the municipalities, without any kind of representativity. He repeated that the opposition supports the passage of that kind of law, emphasizing that "the government will be able to count on our strongest support for a law of that kind." In supporting this initiative, his colleague Schaulsohn said that it is important that all officeholders be elected by direct vote, especially mayors, because they have a great responsibility and because it would prevent maneuvers by political parties, such as what occurred "with the famous mayors' protocol," that allowed the placement of persons as mayors who had not the slightest popular support. Alberto Espina said that the right is prepared to maintain close and strict checks on the government, as is appropriate to a good opposition. But he was also certain, he remarked, that President Frei would be very rigorous, as he had promised, in assuring that officials did not abuse their power and that there would be no symptoms of corruption. The opposition leader said that, in the social sphere, he is convinced that if there is good will on the part of the government and the opposition, decisive steps can be taken to achieve the social goals that have been laid down. In Espina's opinion, the government of Eduardo Frei has a great opportunity to take advantage of the country's current situation to carry out social programs, especially as there are no elections on the horizon. Therefore, he believed it crucial that an immediate start be made to resolve problems in health and education, and in confronting the problem of poverty. Otherwise, he said, the recently begun administration will waste a great opportunity for the country. "I am convinced--he repeated--that if there is good will on the part of the government and the opposition, decisive steps can be taken to achieve the social goals that have been set." Asked whether that meant the opposition is prepared to approve more financing to fight poverty, he replied that the opposition has always been prepared to give the government all of the facilities really needed to fight poverty, not with words or demagoguery, recalling that the leadership of the RN said that it desired the greatest success for the government "because the government's success is Chile's success." The vice president of the Chamber of Deputies said yesterday that the binomial electoral system must be carefully studied, in order to reveal its strengths and its defects, for the purpose of correcting and perfecting it, but not of changing it for the corrected proportional system.
