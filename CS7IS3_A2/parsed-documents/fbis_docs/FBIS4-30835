Good afternoon, Mr. President. [Tudjman] Good afternoon, Mr. Galic. Let me first congratulate you on the appointment to the very responsible position of director of Croatian TV. [Galic] Thank you and welcome to the Croatian TV program, in which our viewers and political party representatives will ask you questions. The first question is prompted by the events themselves. This year, Statehood Day coincided with a crisis in the Croatian parliament, which has not been solved and which will, in a way, be dormant during the celebrations. Could you tell us -- so far you have not voiced your opinion either as the party leader or the head of state -- whether the assembly will start a session with all deputies, and whether the crisis and the blocking of the parliament will be overcome immediately after the Statehood Day holiday? [Tudjman] You see, I think that the crisis has already been overcome because those who wanted to cause a parliamentary and constitutional crisis did not succeed. They did not manage to cause a rift in the majority party. Seeing that this failed, there was no crisis on the scale the scenario-makers wanted. You said that I had not voiced my opinion. That is not entirely true because before the sessions of both chambers of the assembly I invited party leaders -- both of the HDZ [Croatian Independent Democrats] and the opposition parties -- and asked them -- in state interests -- to solve the crisis created by the defection of the presidents of the two chambers and the creation of the new party. I pointed out to them that the stability of the democratic system was in the interest of the Croatian state. It was precisely with the stability of its democratic system that Croatia has gained confidence of the important international players, but the world also needs a stable Croatia. [sentence as heard] Considering the circumstances in which we live and the tasks that the Croatian state is facing, in dealing with all issues we should bare in mind this demand by both the Croatian people and the world. I told our most influential politicians that it would be in the interest that the crisis which arose -- not the one they wanted to create -- be overcome. I think that a positive solution has been reached. Not only because the majority party has retained its majority in both chambers, so the parliamentary system can continue to function, but also because the division inside the opposition party failed. There are rifts in all parties, but the opposition parties have now adopted a more reasonable approach, not only to the problems of solving the parliamentary crisis, but also to the whole of the state policy. Consequently, I believe that after Statehood Day that crisis will be solved formally as well. [Galic] You tried -- this is why you summoned all party leaders -- to reach a certain accord on some important issues of Croatia's political system and political activities. Is that one of the guidelines of your political activity, especially now when Croatia must have, one the one hand, stability, and on the other social and political unity in the country? [Tudjman] These have been my commitments and my policy, not only now but since we started creating democratic Croatia. We need the highest possible accord, since we are still facing the occupation of certain areas of Croatia. But we also need a stable government and stability in the parliament. We should not forget that the fact that we have had a majority government and an accord on all important issues was a precondition for our victories. We should therefore not give up on that and not forget that it was precisely due to our firm and stable democratic system that we could have achieved all the successes in relation to the aggression, the economy and the international acceptance of Croatia as an important factor not only in solving the crisis on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, but also as one of the most important factors in creating a new international order in this part of southeastern Europe. [Galic] There have been a lot of suggestions about what could happen if the parliamentary crisis is not solved, if the ruling party becomes a minority -- which has not happened -- if the opposition continues with its demands -- which also seems not to have happened. Still, generally speaking, theoretically, as the party leader and head of state you have two ways of exerting influence on the crisis. One, you can influence your party. Two, you have the constitutional power to suspend the parliament and call elections in the event of a huge crisis. Have you ever considered doing that because that has been speculated on in the public? Under what conditions would you possibly agree to that or do it yourself? [Tudjman] You see, there is an old saying in Zagreb: What would be if it would be. I would not like to speculate on this. In any event, I would make a decision in the interest of Croatian democracy, the free democratic Croatia, the Croatian state. If the rift had succeeded, naturally, we would have tried to solve the stability of the future government within the parliament. Failing that, it is certain that I would use my constitutional power and address the nation to explain to them the problems and causes of the parliamentary crisis, what tasks Croatia faces and what we must do. I had faith in the Croatian people since the first parliamentary elections in 1990. We held elections in 1992 and in 1993 when we did not have to, but we wanted to strengthen the democratic system and prove to the world that we are a country that wants to get out of the old socialist, communist system as soon as possible. I had faith in our people then, and I would have it now. I also believe that if that situation had arisen -- if we had to go, if I had had to take other steps -- we would have come out of it democratically strengthened, not weakened. Let us have a look at the world. In parliaments where there is not one majority party, but different parties and different ideological approaches, where there are coalition governments -- in many countries, from the Baltics to the Black Sea and the Adriatic the communists are coming back to power or there are coalition governments -- they are helpless in solving not only political, but also economic problems. Precisely because we have had a stable government and a majority in the parliament, we have managed to achieve all the successes we have achieved. I have said this once before. For me as the president of the republic, it would be simpler if I did not interfere in inter-party relations. However, I state with all responsibility that if we did not have the majority party, we would not have been able to pursue this policy and achieve political and economic successes, both internally and on the international scene. This is why I invited the party leaders and asked them to solve this crisis so that we could address our main problems as soon as possible. [Galic] We will now hear the first opinions. We have recorded many questions by citizens and political party leaders. We will now hear the first opinions and questions by party leaders in connection with the current crisis in the parliament. [Mira Ljubic-Lorger, of Dalmatian Action] It is sad and almost tragic that after two years as a deputy in the Croatian Assembly, this is the first time that I can ask the president of the state a question. However, here is my question: Mr. President, do you not think that it is high time you stopped thinking what else we could take away from Croatia, but that we -- headed by yourself -- started thinking what we could give or give back to Croatia? In my opinion, we should give it primarily freedom, democracy, and tolerance. [Tudjman] Mrs Lorger, I will answer your question by repeating part of it. It is sad that you ask such a question. If we have given anything to Croatia in the past four years, then we have given it freedom and democracy, despite the war of aggression against Croatia and despite the fact that they wanted to prevent the creation of the independent Croatian state. We have not achieved everything that we wanted because this is a continuing process, but in the opinion of objective outside observers -- some not even favorably inclined to Croatia -- in many areas we have achieved more than many other former socialist and communist countries have done. [Galic] The second question is by your former party colleague Slavko Degoricija. [Slavko Degoricija, of Croatian Independent Democrats] Mr. President, can you use your influence to reduce the stubborness of some Croatian Democratic Union [HDZ] negotiators in dealing with the current parliamentary crisis? Can you also use your influence to calm the media war and stop the spreading of false information and petty swindles until we overcome the crisis? [Tudjman] It has been shown before that I really can influence the decisions and behavior of representatives and deputies of the majority party, and not only theirs. Still, we should admit that it was the majority party that -- in the interest of Croatia -- displayed flexibility and goodwill during the negotiations to overcome the staged parliamentary crisis as soon as possible. It did this in order to remove all objective reasons which might lead to the worsening of Croatia's position, the aggravation of internal problems and problems on the international scene, to the obstructing of the liberation of the occupied areas of Croatia, and to the clipping of Croatia's potential to exert an effective influence on solving the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which the world expects us to do. Concerning the media war, neither I nor the majority party have a considerable influence on the work of any paper, daily or weekly. Many objective foreign observers -- not only from the media, but also from diplomacy -- say not only that there is enough democracy in Croatia in that respect, but that there is in fact too much anarchy, which is incompatible with better cultural relations in the civilized world. [Galic] Here is the third question in this section: [Ivan Jakovcic, of the Istrian Democratic Party -- IDS] Mr. President, do you intend to have any influence on the attitude of the state leadership to Istria, taking into account the stands of Istrian citizens who -- as we all know -- voted in a referendum in favor of the program of the Istrian Democratic Assembly? [Tudjman] It goes without saying that I as the head of state will do everything in my power to see that the will of Croatian citizens is respected, but at the same time I will do everything in my power to ensure -- especially in the case of Istria -- the implementation of the Croatian state policy. As we have witnessed in the past, Istria was occupied by fascists, the Croatian people in Istria suffered enormous losses in the war against fascism and in fighting to join the Croatian motherland. Since you mentioned the last elections, we must not ignore the fact that the program of the IDS certainly had its positive points which ensured that the IDS obtained a majority, but at the same time that it supported the interests of those factions or tendencies which could threaten the survival of Istria within Croatia. With its ideas about a transregional Istria, about the demilitarization of Istria -- against the background of ever-present irredentist and neofascist factions which have recently emerged in Istria, Rijeka and Dalmatia -- the Croatian policy must take measures to protect Croatian interests as a whole, i.e. to protect its territorial integrity. The Croatian policy will of course protect every county and especially Istria, because of its historic background and the confrontations we are witnessing today. [Galic] The second topical issue -- which gives rise to a question -- and about which there is no need to consult either political party leaders or the citizens, is the introduction of the kuna as the Croatian national currency. All opinion polls showed that there was hardly a single voice against it, everyone was satisfied or even proud that Croatia was getting its own currency. There were only questions about its name -- whether it should have been kuna or kruna or perhaps even krona. They say, Mr. President, that you had a decisive influence on the name of our currency. What do you think about these objections? Are they well founded or not? [Tudjman] Perhaps my influence was decisive. I am not denying it and I am also not shirking the responsibility for this. Initially we decided to have a kruna [crown] instead of the politically and economically compromised dinar. But after a discussion we decided that -- since other countries in Europe, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Sweden, Finland, Iceland use a crown as their currency -- we agreed to call the Croatian currency in the independent democratic Croatian state by the name which existed in history. Kuna [marten] has been a means of payment in Croatia since long ago -- its existence has been recorded since the 11th century, 1018. The marten features on the coat of arms as the main symbol of the Croatian kingdom of Slavonia which was once synonymous with the entire Croatia. Why shouldn't we therefore accept this distinctive name which is a special feature of Croatia and which shows that Croatia had its own currency from Istria to Cres, the currency also used in some other countries, in Russia and somewhere in the west. So why not kuna, when it had already existed as a means of payment. There were attempts to introduce kuna after the creation of the Croatian province [banovina] in 1939, but it was opposed by both Yugo-unitarists and Yugo-integralists in both Zagreb and Belgrade. The fact that the kuna was introduced in the NDH [Independent State of Croatia -- Nazi puppet state] and suffered the fate of the NDH and the Axis is not the reason for not using it now, because Germany had the mark, France the franc and Italy the lira and none of these countries have changed their national currencies. [Galic] Are you not afraid that in the west, in the countries which have not always been favorably inclined to Croatia, that there can be interpretations which could harm Croatia? [Tudjman] As you can see, in serious circles in the west there are no objections. There is some opposition on the part of some individuals who have never accepted the reality of the free, sovereign Croatia. It is very interesting that in Croatia itself there is no opposition. Only two or three people dared express this publicly, as opposed to, I believe, 98 percent of the Croatian people. [Galic] Do you think that the introduction of the kuna could hamper agreements and the negotiations with the Serbs, the Serbs who do not accept the Croatian state? Will that be an additional reason for them to say: The Croatian kuna will not find its way into Serbian pockets? [Tudjman] Serbs in Croatia must understand one thing: They are a minority here, and they must recognize Croatia as their homeland. They can take an equal part in it -- Croatia will guarantee them this -- but they cannot, as they did in the past, impose solutions on state policy and, least of all, on the name of the Croatian national currency. [Galic] Mr. President, you personally advocated rapprochement, negotiations, and the normalization of Croatian-Serbian relations, both in Croatia and between the Republic of Croatia and Serbia or Yugoslavia. [Tudjman] Yes, I have been advocating that for a long time. I have written about this subject as well, and even today I believe that the normalization of Croatian-Serbian relations is necessary in order to solve the problem of the occupied areas of Croatia and to create preconditions for the normal life of the Serb ethnic community in Croatia. The normalization of relations between Croatia and Serbia on the basis of mutual recognition is also necessary. That is in the interests of both Croatia and Serbia, and that is an important prerequisite for creating a new international order in southeast Europe. Without that there can be no lasting peace, and if this untenable situation remains -- and it cannot remain forever -- it would be detrimental for both Croatia and Serbia. In my books -- in "The National Issue in Europe" and in "The Wastelands of Historic Reality" -- I have given examples. The Scandinavian countries fought each other for centuries until the beginning of this century, until 1905 when they finally recognized each other, and the Scandinavian peninsula is today the model of friendly relations of the Scandinavian countries and of the respect for differences between ethnic and national minorities in certain countries. It is also the model of democracy -- we could perhaps agree -- in the most perfect sense. About 20 years ago I expressed the hope that once we would see -- I used this particular word -- the Scandinavization of the Balkans. No future can be built on mutual hatred between Serbs and Croats and on the wish to exterminate one another. Besides, there is the philosophy that nations and people start acting wisely when they use up all possible [sentence unfinished as heard]. In that context I also gave the example of Germany and France. There are no two other nations in Europe which fought so many wars as Germany and France in the last century and this one. The relations between Germany and France are nowadays such that these two European powers are the backbone for the creation of the European Union [EU]; the EU in which no European nation will be created, but a Europe which will be a homeland to all peoples and all states. Consequently, I believe that reason will win and that Croatian-Serbian relations will be normalized. It would be good if this happened without another war. [Galic] In order to introduce Scandinavia-like relations in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, and for relations between Croatia and Serbia one day to resemble the relations between Germany and France, both sides should aspire toward that. It does not seem that the Serb side, the negotiators from Knin, truly wish to bring the process of normalization to an end. Some people want to know -- and I will ask you, Mr. President -- whether Croatia is perhaps giving in too much, and not obtaining in return what it is giving, or what it is prepared to give. [Tudjman] First of all, let me say whether Croatia is giving in too much. The problem could be reduced to the question of why we accepted the UN-protected areas at all. We accepted the peace forces at the end of 1991 when we wanted to get out of the war in which one-third of the Croatian territory was occupied, and in which that territory was destroyed like Vukovar and Gospic, Dubrovnik, and Konavle. At that time we did not have our army, forces, or friends in the world who would help us continue the war and prevent the rest of Croatia from being completely destroyed -- Osijek, Sisak, Zagreb, Zadar, Sibenik, Split, Rijeka, Varazdin and so on. Therefore, at that moment and under those circumstances, because of the objective balance of power in the territory of the former Yugoslavia and in the world, we agreed that the peace forces should be deployed in those occupied areas. However, the basis was that these areas are Croatian areas, and that only the status of the Serb population in Croatia needs to be solved. Therefore, that was the reason for doing it, and some people have forgotten why it happened. It is not that the Croatian policy was lenient, but the objective circumstances forced us to do that. After that, things developed the way they did. In talks with Serbian leaders, including [Serbian President] Milosevic and [former FRY President] Cosic, we aimed at creating preconditions for what we have already discussed -- the historic necessity to overcome all differences between Serbs and Croats. Our explanation was that it should be clear that both Croats and Serbs in the South-Slav union, in the former monarchist and then socialist Yugoslavia had their own intentions -- and not all of those intentions were idealistic. It was with the help of the Yugoslav idea that the Croats wanted to rule Serbia, counting on being more civilized and more progressive. They failed to do that, but the Serbs used the Yugoslav idea to impose their hegemony. On the other hand, the Serbs did not manage to destroy the Croatian nation or establish a permanent rule over Croatia either through the idea of a Greater Serbia or a Yugoslav idea -- which they turned into a means of their rule. Therefore, conclusions should be drawn and the problem of normalizing relations tackled. In my talks with the Serb leaders, both Cosic and Milosevic agreed that it was necessary and in the interests of both nations to normalize relations. It was along these lines that we opened representative offices in Zagreb and Belgrade. However, the Serbian representatives -- who Belgrade said would pursue the policy of normalizing relations -- have recently gone to extremes and spoken of Krajina as a separate state, which is a stupidity. Croatia will never agree to that, and the world will never accept that because the world has nowhere given minorities the right to self-determination. The initial Serb theory was that if the Croatian nation had the right to self-determination and if they could proclaim their independent, sovereign state, then the Serbs had the same right. Yes, but there is a small difference. The Serbs are in the Croatian state, on Croatian territory which has never been part of Serbia. They are a minority here and, under international provisions on which the international order is based, minorities do not have the right to self-determination, while nations have that right. Currently the relations are quite tense, but they are linked to solving the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In any event, now we will see. If the Serb representatives from Knin to Baranja fail to accept the gradual normalization, if they continue to oppose Security Council resolutions guaranteeing Croatia's territorial integrity, Croatia will not be willing to extend the UN mandate and it will have to use all means to reintegrate the occupied areas of Croatia into its constitutional and legal system. [Galic] Judging by some recent moves by the Croatian authorities, it seems that, as you have said, Croatia wants to bring to a head the issue of extending the mandate to the UN peace forces because it is obvious that further extension will create the situation commonly referred to in the world as the Cyprus-style situation, that is, a division which could be permanent. Croatia will not accept that. Do you feel there is a danger that the world would want to, or might recognize that Cyprus-style formula in Croatia? How will Croatia react to that? [Tudjman] It would be possible to find in the world, and even in official circles in some countries, people who would be in favor of applying the Cyprus-style model to Croatia because they do not accept an independent Croatia and because of the pressure exerted on Croatia. However, what is important is that nowadays Croatia has Security Council resolutions and that we have clear statements by the most influential international players -- from the main world superpower United States to the EU, and even to Russia -- on recognition of Croatia's borders, and that the Serbian problem needs to be solved within Croatian borders. Therefore, if in the current circumstances, refusing to allow the application of the Cyprus-style solution to Croatia, as you said, we must take, then, we can count on, and I hope that the world will understand that such a situation can no longer be tolerated, and that we will have on our side not only the world's democratic public opinion, but also the important international players [sentence as heard]. [Galic] As you will see from the questions Croatian citizens are asking you, the Croatian public wants to know about that problem. [Unidentified Croatian Army soldier] Mr. President, as a Croatian soldier, I would like to know when we will have internationally recognized borders for our Croatia. [Tudjman] I would be happy if I could give a date. But, as I said before in response to earlier questions, we are determined to start the process of implementing Security Council resolutions. Specifically, the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] should start implementing Resolution 769 on the control of the borders, and Resolution 871 on the gradual reintegration of the occupied areas of Croatia should start being implemented. If this does not happen, it is certain that, relying not only on 250,000 refugees from those areas, but also on the whole of the Croatian nation -- and nowadays we also have the army which is ready to fulfill its tasks -- we will have to start the process of liberating the occupied areas. [Galic] Another Croatian soldier wanted to know the same thing. [Second unidentified Croatian soldier] Four years ago the Croatian banner unfurled in Zagreb. Can you promise us that it will unfurl in Knin before Christmas? [Tudjman] I hope so. Besides, I have promised that to some Croatian people who were born in Knin and who remember that after the Second World War Croats accounted for half the population of Knin; now there is not a single one. I also promised Croatian basketball players that I would invite them for dinner in Knin. I hope I have fulfilled all my promises so far. The question is when it will happen. That does not depend entirely on me, but I am convinced that I will fulfill that promise of mine as well, and that the Croatian banner will fly on the fortress of Knin, on Zvonimir's royal city. [Galic] One more question please. [Josip Ivankovic, poet] How many more poems about Vukovar will I still have to write? I have said that I will write the lyrics for every record of the Zlatni Dukati band until Vukovar is free. [Tudjman] Yes, Vukovar is a symbol of Croatian resistance, of the Croatian struggle to establish the independent Croatian state. Vukovar is a symbol of the untamed aspiration of the Croatian people to be their own masters, the masters of every inch of the Croatian land. It is absolutely certain that there can be no dilemmas about our return to Vukovar. We are to sing and fight until that day. [Galic] Croatian politicians, representatives of political parties, are also interested in the Croatian-Serbian relations -- as we will see in the next two questions. [Milan Djukic, of Serbian People's Party] President Tudjman often sends messages to the Serbian people in Croatia offering hospitality. Isn't this a proof that Serbs are foreigners in their own homeland and isn't this a support for those forces in Croatia who wish to divide Serbs into loyal and disloyal? My question is -- does President Tudjman, as the president of all his citizens, really think that in this way he can reintegrate the UN-protected areas into Croatia by peaceful political means and at the same time secure lasting peace and good Croatian-Serbian relations in this region? [Tudjman] You see, Mr. Djukic, you and I have already talked about it, and I have said it publicly, both on official occasions and unofficially: The problem of Serbs in Croatia is very complex because in former Yugoslavia, both the kingdom and the socialist Yugoslavia, Serbs had a fully privileged status in everything, a ruling status; and not just in former Yugoslavia, since Hungary also used Serbs to support their rule and impose hegemony over Croatia. There is a saying which is historically and politically true: Knin ruled Croatia, its finances and its police, and also other things. With the establishment of the independent democratic Croatia, all this had to change. Right from the beginning, though, we held -- on the basis of our democratic orientation and on the basis of our knowledge -- that a lasting peace cannot be created amid the dissatisfaction of the majority of people. We offered Serbs all civic and national-ethnic rights. I personally sent for Professor Raskovic [former leader of Serb Krajina] to have talks with him and tell him -- let's agree on what you Serbs in Croatia really want -- because Raskovic was at the time a representative of the civic Serbian party as most Serbs in Croatia did not recognize those Serbian representatives who belonged to the League of Communists or who were members of the Croatian parliament. I said -- if you as the true representatives of the Knin Serbs do not recognize them, then you should put forward your proposals. Let's organize our relations in a democratic and correct way. You know what happened instead. The Serbs accepted the arms forced upon them by the Yugo-communist army. They have been provided with arms in those areas which Belgrade wanted to include in greater Serbia and in which Belgrade wanted to involve the Serbs in a struggle against the democratic authorities. This is the problem here, and not the lack of willingness on the part of the Croatian Democratic Union to grant the Serbs in Croatia all the rights they are entitled to. And something else: The Serbs have become the tools with which to bring down the democratic authorities in Croatia, and to threaten the recently won freedom. And for conquering Croatian areas to -- as they had indicated in their maps -- the Virovitica-Karlovac-Karlobag line. The Croatian democratic authorities treated the Serbs in Croatia in an extremely tolerant and democratic way. The Serbs remained at the Croatian university, their representatives remained in the government and the parliament. Admittedly, the relations changed within the police. Instead of 70 percent, the Serbs now make up some 7 percent of the police force, according to the latest figures, in particular in the most sensitive departments. This was changed [laughs]. But the Serbs in Croatia were given conditions for normal life. And let us remind ourselves, when wars break out between countries and nations we see -- for example when the war was declared between the United Nations and Japan all ethnic Japanese were detained in special reception centers, or should I call them camps, their property was taken away from them. And they could clearly not threaten the American authorities and the American state to any significant extent, as it was the case in the armed rebellion of the Serbs in Croatia. We are still discovering explosive and weapons dumps, left here in Croatia by both military and civilian secret services which masterminded the action to bring down the Croatian authorities, in which the Serbs in Croatia were involved. Therefore, the Croatian side should not be seen as guilty for eveything. The Croatian side is the least guilty of all and the Serbs must understand that. The Serbs must aspire toward the attitude expressed by [scientist Nikola] Tesla: He is a Serb, but Croatia is his homeland; he respects it and he will have all the rights guaranteed. The Serbs will have more representatives from Knin and elsewhere, as nowadays they already have representatives in the parliament, the Croatian Government, the Supreme Court, the Constitutional Court and so on. This is something for which conditons should be created on both sides. The lies to the Serbian population should stop. Two big deceptions: One that this independent, democratic Croatia is the continuation of the NDH, and the other that at least 600,000 to 700,000 were executed in Jasenovac in the NDH. As you know, greater Serbian imperialists and hegemonists who cannot accept any form of Croatian identity have set that figure as high as 1.5 million. Let me tell you, Mr. Djukic and the Serbian public, during the Second World War altogether 597,000 people died on all the fronts in the whole of Yugoslavia. This includes ustashas, home guards, chetniks, Germans, Muslims, Slovenes, and Macedonians -- 597,000, and this is already a huge figure. Why should they now build their policy toward the independent democratic Croatia on this and deceive ignorant Serbs from Knin to Baranja by saying that they cannot live with Croatia because the Croats killed at least 600,000 to 700,000 people in Jasenovac alone. This is something that should be settled once and forever. There should be new foundations for life which the democratic world wants today and which, as I have just said, have been achieved on the Scandinavian peninsula where a Swede in Finland or Norway enjoys the same rights as all other citizens. We are ready for that. Besides, you have proofs for that as well as those from Zagreb University who are spreading such lies and are partly contributing to solving the problem of Serbs in Croatia in a political and democratic way [sentence as heard]. [Galic] There is another question on the same issue. [Ivica Vrkic, of Croatian People's Party] Mr. President, what do you think about the proposal I put forward to Prime Minister Velentic that a new round of talks with the Serbs be held in Mostar? We would thus make a concession to the Serbs -- to hold talks on the territory of a third country -- and at the same time, Croatian state interests would not be harmed because the talks would be held in a town which is a symbol of the struggle for the survival of Croats outside Croatia, and which is also under the international protection of the EU. [Tudjman] Your idea is quite interesting. However, the talks with Serbs in Croatia will not be held anywhere outside Croatian state territory. [Galic] One of the most difficult and most complex problems of the Croatian state today is the large number of its refugees who still cannot go back to their homes which are destroyed, occupied, or confiscated. People we have talked to and polls we have conducted show that impatience is rising and that the Croatian authorities will probably have to deal with that impatience more often in the near future. [Tudjman] I fully understand the dissatisfaction of the Croatian people driven out from the occupied areas. After all, speaking about them, we must bear in mind that they are not only refugees, but also witnesses of the sacrifices they and their families suffered in those areas. They were witnesses, they watched members of their families killed, evicted from their centuries-old family homes, humiliated. Those people are full of wrath and hatred, and we have had to invest huge efforts to placate them and convince them that we will ensure their return, even to destroyed homes; that we will help them restore their family life, rebuild their villages, and not only Croatian ones because Hungarians, Czechs, Slovaks, and Ruthenians have also been driven out. Their dissatifaction is justified. Their demands and our promise to ensure their return have been delayed too long. Therefore we are currently at the stage when we will take steps to ensure their return with the help of the international community, and -- as I said -- if we fail to obtain effective assistance from the international community in doing that, it is certain that the 250,000 refugees and the whole of the Croatian people will stand up with the Croatian army to liberate those areas and enable those people to return to their villages and destroyed towns -- Vukovar and Dubrovnik -- and live normal lives. [Galic] The following questions raised by our refugee citizens illustrate this best: [Unidentified refugee] I want to know, since we cannot return -- whether we can ever return is a major question, well, if we cannot return I want to know what kind of plans the president has for us refugees. There is a large number of us. Does he plan to resettle us, for example, in some Serb villages, so to speak, I mean the houses abandoned by the Serbs who lived there? Does he plan to put us up there? Does he plan to secure some accomodation for us anywhere? Homes and jobs, that is what we need. [Tudjman] We have to create conditions for your return. Until then, we have so far been doing our best to give you the best possible accomodation in line with our conditions. We opened all our hotels. It is a perfectly certain fact that it is not normal, namely, that our refugees have difficult housing problems while somewhere there are abandoned houses. It is important nevertheless that we direct all our efforts and political activity and that we carry out concrete preparations so you can return to your homes. Until then you might find a job through local authorities and your own initiative and you can feel the same way in your Croatia as you do in your homeland. Consequently, you have a right not only to life but to education and development. Precisely because you were driven out of Croatian territories. Rest assured that we will succeed in this. This is the entire Croatian people's task, not only in the homeland but in the diaspora, too. [Galic] Let us hear another question. [Second unidentified refugee] My first question, the most important question for all of us from Vukovar is about the missing. What about them? When are we going eventually to hear true reports? All we hear is rumors. [Tudjman] Dear madam, you see, in addition to the 7,000 people who have been registered as dead, Croatian soldiers and civilians fighting the Yugoslav communist aggression and then the Serbian aggression. First, we had a list of 14,000 missing people. This number of missing people has been gradually reduced through our efforts and negotiations with the Serbs on the release of Croatian prisoners. We have now ended up with a list of 7,000 missing people. Unfortunately, today we have to conclude that it is likely that most of these victims of the aggression and bestiality of the chetnik hordes who attacked Croatia, there is a slim chance that a large proportion of these 7,000 missing are still alive. However, in keeping with international norms and the Red Cross principles, it is not possible yet to establish what has happened to individuals. In any case, this testifies to the fact that the Croatian people have suffered a great deal, not only the fighters, soldiers who defended, who in fact had emerged from civilians as fighters for Croatia's defense. The Croatian people as a whole have made great sacrifices in its struggle against the Yugo-communist and Serbian aggression. This is yet another reason why we must as soon as possible solve this problem of missing people in particular, we must as soon as possible finalize negotiations and solve the problem of occupied territories. Only at that point it will be possible to reveal the whole truth. [Galic] Another question please. [Third unidentified refugee] Mr. President, we young people from Vukovar want to return as soon as possible to Vukovar. We do not want to wait any longer for anything. We want to have our own homes. If you have some solution, please tell us. We cannot go on like this any longer. [[Tudjman] I was in Vukovar in late August 1991, at a time when it was no longer possible to enter Vukovar in a normal way. I had to take country roads so I could visit those who were still defending Vukovar. I will return to Vukovar with you. [Galic] The last question on this issue. [Branko Pek, secretary of the Refugee Association] Mr. President, you and other party leaders have often been promising that refugees will soon return to their homes. Having patiently waited for three years, the refugees are embittered with both Croatian state policies and the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] as their promises have not materialized. In those eastern parts of Croatia an exodus took place at an even earlier stage and those people never returned. Is there any danger of the same happening to the Croat refugees? [Tudjman] I have, by and large, already given you my answer to this question. We can indeed feel dissatisfaction with the UNPROFOR. The UNPROFOR has not carried out its major duties. But this is not a case of the UNPROFOR, as it is, not wanting to do so. We have to be objctive towards members of UNPROFOR units. Understandably, the UNPROFOR has various ways of relating to our problems, to the Croatian people and the Serbian population. What is essential, though, is this -- the UNPROFOR has carried out one of the key tasks. When we agreed to, and when the United Nations sent its protection forces, this put an end to the war between Serbia-Yugoslavia and Croatia. Likewise, thanks to the UNPROFOR we secured the withdrawal of the Serb army, the Yugoslav Army from the Dubrovnik area and Prevlaka. This was not only a result of our armed operation, which was the most important element, but of diplomatic activity, too, including the involvement of the peace force. These are some things that the UNPROFOR should be given credit for, so to speak. However, the UNPROFOR has not managed to disarm, the UNPROFOR in its capacity as a peace force was in fact not tasked with disarming Serbian paramilitary formations. On arrival the UNPROFOR was tasked with keeping the peace. The Serbs opposed this. Not only did they oppose the disarmament of their paramilitary formations but they carried on with ethnic cleansing. As far as we know, since the UNPROFOR's arrival about 650 Croatian people have been killed in the UNPROFOR-protected areas. They have been killed by the Serbian occupation authorities in these areas. [Galic] Do we know how many people have been driven out of these areas over this period? [Tudjman] In this period, I do not know the exact figure, but Croatian people have been constantly driven out. From this point of view we cannot understandably be satisfied with the UNPROFOR. To this effect we have demanded that the UN Security Council give wider authority to the peace force and, consequently, the power to exercise this authority. So far these efforts of ours have not been successful. In the course of these efforts we have nevertheless secured resolutions such as those on guaranteed borders, on the need for a gradual reincorporation of these areas into Croatia. We are now in a period when, in order to solve the refugee question and not only the refugee question but because of its entire national and state life, because of the restoration of communications etc -- Croatia will have to take steps to enable refugees to return and to reincorporate these areas either with the help of the peace force and the international community or on its own. Today, the world will have more understanding for these justified demands from Croatia. [Galic] The next major topic to discuss on the occasion of Croatian Statehood Day is Bosnia, the situation there,and Croatian policy on Bosnia. After the Washington agreement and the supplementary agreement in Vienna were reached, the roots of the Croat-Muslim confrontation seem to have been eliminated and Croat-Muslim relations have reached a new phase, a phase of great cooperation, where conditions are to be created for co-existence within Bosnia-Herzgovina, a federation of Croats and Muslims, and, to a certain extent, coexistence with Croatia, in the confederation. Do you, Mr. President, believe that, after what has been achieved at the diplomatic level, conditions have been created to eliminate the Croat-Muslim confrontation, if not forever then for a considerable period of time? [Tudjman] Everything you said is true. The problem of Croat-Muslim relations and [pauses], if you look at it as a whole, the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina is objectively the most complicated problem in the world today, for the very reason that three nations are confronting each other, and not only three specific nations but also three civilizations. The state [of Bosnia-Herzegovina] was, when it was created and later throughout its history, not only an area of competition on an ethnic basis between the Serbs and Croats, but also an area where Muslims existed first as a separate religious and later ethnic community and where attempts were made to create a Greater Serbia by including the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and where attempts were also made by certain fundamentalist circles from abroad to create a base in Bosnia-Herzegovina for an extreme fundamentalist policy in the center of Europe. [Galic] Was this realistic? Was it possible? [Tudjman] As was proven in real life -- it was not possible, but the danger, the tendency was there. As we are speaking about this, it would be difficult to understand that the world as it is and a disunited Europe could allow Serb aggression of the kind we saw -- if it had not been for the world fearing this danger that you have just asked about. There have been even some specific studies about this, both in the east and in the west. Some Muslim leaders, despite saying that they were fighting for a secular state, have given statements to the effect that they will create a state in Bosnia governed by Islamic laws, whether others like it or not. You know that this is also a civilizational problem of today's world, that the largest number of Islamic states want to have normal coexistence with other civilizations, but that there are also those who call for a jihad, a holy war to destroy other civilizations. But, let us get back to concrete things. The Croatian policy from the beginning wanted to protect the Croatian identity as a whole in Bosnia-Herzegovina. As you know the Croatian identity is most compact in western Herzegovina, but it is also present in central Bosnia, Sarajevo, and in Bosnian Posavina, in the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina, or in its largest part. This is why we accepted, and not only accepted but also instigated -- I personally did, the first proposals on a system of cantons, then on the resolution of the crisis based on the division of Bosnia into provinces. Understandably, we helped the formation of the Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosna when the republic of Srpska was practically already a separate entity, and when the Muslim leadership also accepted the idea of the creation of a separate Muslim republic. As you know, that agreement with the Serbs was signed and made public. Naturally, by pursuing such a policy and helping the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, through the Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosna, we managed to prevent the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina from falling into the hands of a greater Serbia, and then to defend the Croatian areas even in central Bosnia. There have been proposals that we can annex western Herzegovina to Croatia immdiately, which I rejected, because I considered the Croatian areas as a whole, especially the threats to the Croats in central Bosnia. With such a policy we did not passively accept, but we brought about the Washington agreement [as heard]. We did not have to be forced to sign it, regardless of the fact that some individuals, even in Croatia, do not understand that. As I said, the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina is truly complex, and some people even in Croatia speak about a unitary humanitarian Bosnia. Some would like to annex only a part of Bosnia, and so on. However, in our policy Croatian national and strategic interests coincided with the interests of the Western world. The understanding that the Muslims can survive only in an alliance with the Croats also prevailed among the Muslims, in the Muslim leadership. That was the basis of the agreement. [Galic] Do these agreements and the principles of the agreements from Washington and Vienna guarantee the realization and protection of Croatian national interests and Croatian state interests? [Tudjman] Absolutely. Why? Because on the basis of the constitution and the constitutional principles of the federation, it is the first time that the Croatian people in the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is in fact -- judging by the signed agreements and the opinion of international law experts; there is a document signed by American Professor Dr (Boyle) analyzing the whole agreement over 26 pages and in 121 articles and proving that the federation, and especially the confederation, are ensuring an absolutely equal status for Croatia [sentence as heard]. Therefore, the Croatian national entity -- both here in Croatia and in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- should always remember the heritage which speaks about and warns that the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina have always been in a subjugated position. They were first under Serb hegemony when they were pushed into the background and eliminated even physically from Bosnia-Herzegovina. And, recently, they have been under Muslim hegemony. Therefore, the Croats must understand that the constitution on the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation grants them an equal position, and that they can no longer be placed in an unequal, subjugated position because of the equality there, and especially because of the confederation. After all, neither the Croats in the Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosna nor we here would accept the agreement, the proposal by the United States and the important European players, if it had not been for the link between the federation and the confederation. That confederal relation between the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation and Croatia guarantees that the Croats there can be completely equal, and that they will be responsible for governing Bosnia-Herzegovina in the direction of the interests of today's democratic world and for linking Bosnia-Herzegovina with western civilization through Croatia, despite some extremist trends. [Galic] Some uncertainty and even fear is present among the Croats over the issue of what will happen to Croats in the mixed cantons, the cantons which have been declared mixed but have a Croatian majority. Medjugorje is a certain example where such concerns are present, Medjugorje which is to be part of a mixed canton. [Tudjman] First of all, full equality is also guaranteed in mixed cantons. In those municipalities of the mixed cantons where the Croats are in the majority -- no Muslim or any other authority can be imposed, or any symbols etc. This very example of Medjugorje being in a mixed Mostar-Neretva canton shows that this canton, because of Medjugorje, will be more likely to be known as more Croat rather than as more Muslim, for the whole world knows of Medjugorje. I was myself surprised by how many people came to Medjugorje even in the war conditions, from as far as America, Canada, and Indonesia. This example shows that this canton will not be less Croat than it is Bosniak-Muslim. [Galic] What will actually happen with Bosnia? Some people think, and a lot has been said about it in public, that there is some secret, or I do not know what kind of agreement, between you and Mr. Milosevic on the division of Bosnia and that everything else is just a game. Many have denied this, and many have spoken about it. I would like you to answer this question -- is there any truth about the alleged agreement on Bosnia with Mr. Milosevic? [Tudjman] There has been no agreement with Milosevic or anyone else. Except for an agreement with [Bosnian President] Izetbegovic [laughs]. At the time when it was being said that the Bosnian crisis should be resolved through a union of three republics, I signed an agreement with Izetbegovic, now I can say a secret agreement, on cooperation between the Croat and Muslim republics within the union, and on a confederation between these two and Croatia. This was even signed. There has been no agreement with Milosevic, either written or verbal. I did have talks first with Milosevic and then, a few days later, with Izetbegovic, and then all three of us met. This was before the war flared up in Bosnia, when Yugoslavia had disintegrated and Bosnia was on the agenda. My view was: Gentlemen, let us try to prevent a war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, for this war will have have even more terrible consequences than in Croatia. I said then: There are two possibilities to resolve the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. One is the confederal solution which would satisfy all three nations, the other one is the division. There is no third option. So, let us try a politically acceptable solution for all three nations. There is no ideal solution in such complicated conditions. This was the gist of my talks with Milosevic, my talks with Izetbegovic, and the talks between all three in Split. And there is nothing else to add. And where are we today? We were in a position to create a union of three republics. Let us be completely open: The prevailing opinion among the most responsible circles of the world politics was that the creation of three separate republics in Bosnia-Herzegovina would not suitable. In some future the republic of Srpska would probably join Serbia, and the Croat one would join Croatia, and a separate Muslim one would remain, as we have mentioned a few minutes ago. A proposal was then made, acceptable to us -- since it resolved the problem of Croats in general and the strategic interests of the Croatian state -- to create the Bosniak-Croat federation. And now the question of borders remains. As you have seen, at the latest ministerial meeting the world did not accept the 58:42 division. The position of the European ministers and Secretary of State Mr. Christopher is that the divison should be 51:49. In my opinion such a division should be executed and the republic of Srpska should then remain in some loose union with the federation, as a transitional solution. In my opinion a solution will be found at some kind of a new Berlin congress. In a letter to President Clinton after he took office, I said that the United States should take over the leading role, since the European countries were not united as regards this, that an agreement in Bosnia-Herzegovina would not be easily reached, and that international circles would have to make a decision to even, if it needed be, impose peace -- to prevent a war which could in this area assume a proportion of a war between civilizations. Not only a third world war, but -- bearing in mind constant involvement of some radical, Bolshevik or Orthodox circles, on Serbia's side and a manifestly open desire by some Islamic circles to get involved on the Muslim side. Croatia has been and remains in favor of finding a political solution as soon as possible, to achieve peace and create conditions for a stable future international system in this area. [Galic] Would Bosnia within this concept remain in its pre-war borders? [Tudjman] Now, a solution is being sought along these lines but everyone is saying that this is a transitional solution. [Galic] It seems that the Washington agreement, which was after all signed under U.S. patronage or under considerable U.S. influence, has resulted in relations between Croatia and the United States being elevated to a level they never reached before. It was you who was talking about special relations, about partnership between the United States and Croatia. Does this U.S. background, this U.S. support for Croatia, regarding both Bosnia and Croatia in particular, determine in a way the character of Croatia's foreign policy, of the Croatian state and its international status? Is the United States our main ally or partner in the world? [Tudjman] Well, I think, yes. In other words, by pursuing this policy of ours, a principled policy from the point of view of protecting Croatian interests, and by bearing in mind international circumstances, we won not only the sympathy of the United States as the world's main power but also its friendship, something that is our greatest success. The Washington agreement crowned this policy. The United States indeed regards Croatia as a key factor in the implementation of this policy. Yesterday, I received not only President Clinton's congratulations on statehood day but also his separate letter about their wish to carry on with our mutual efforts to solve the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. At the same time on the other end of the world there is a country such as China, the world's superpower with the largest population. We are also developing economic and cultural relations in the spirit of friendship. Our policy has created allies and friends in Europe too, not just among those who are traditionally inclined toward us but who demonstrated a great deal of misunderstanding as regards our complicated position, our involvement, so to speak, in Bosnia-Herzegovina.... [Galic, interrupting] Are you referring to Germany? [Tudjman] Yes, Germany among others. Even Germany was eventually convinced by my peace initiative of 1 November last year and particularly by my meeting with the Muslim leadership in Bonn, i.e. in St. Petersburg, when it was revealed what we were offering and when there were no grounds any longer for casting suspicion on this Croatian policy which had been continuously of such a nature, which wanted peace and cooperation with the Muslims and offered solutions. Hence, I would say yes to your question, yes we maintain friendly relations with the United States in all spheres, not only regarding the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina but in the economic sphere, the political sphere and all other spheres. But we also have friends and allies, precisely thanks to our principled character. You know how the Vatican supported us. The Washington agreement enabled us to create conditions for the development of friendly economic relations with Islamic countries. Consequently, in recent days Croatia has achieved indeed, your colleague, our ambassador Hido Biscevic in Ankara has sent a letter to me saying that there is a document that Turkish President Demirel, he is a statesman of great experience, has said that the world is witnessing, with surprising satisfaction and even admiration, how Croatia has been managing to win friends and that its policy has contributed to some prospects for a solution to this complex crisis [sentence as heard]. [Galic] One of the party leaders will ask you a question about the relations between Croatia and the other former superpower. [Boris Kandare, of Croatian Party of Rights] I would like to ask you what influence the Russian Federation and its policies will have on future political events in the Republic of Croatia and in Bosnia-Herzegovina and how you personally intend to resolve this burning issue? [Tudjman] This is a good question. Russia, whether the Russia of Peter The Great, Ivan The Terrible, Stalin or Yeltsin, remains an Euro-Asian power which will have permanent influence in the world and even in this part of the Balkans -- although I do not consider Croatia a Balkan state, but a state of southeast Europe. Russia's presence here is felt through Serbia and through its influence over the Orthodox population of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. The recent changes in Russia showed that the Russian policy is felt to such an extent that other international circles, Europe and the United States, have to acknowledge it. I can say with satisfaction that the official Russian policy has played a positive role in the attempts to resolve the crisis in the former Yugoslavia and the Serb question in Croatia. It was in my presence in Belgrade that a Russian representative proposed to Milosevic to recognize Croatia. The Russian ambassador to Zagreb has been to Knin and has said that the Serbs in Croatia have to resolve their relations with the Croatian authorities within Croatia. The influence of the official Russian policy is now positive. But, on the other hand, there are some extreme circles in Russia, both from old Bolshevik ranks and from radical Orthodox ones, who have supported and continue to support Serbia's imperialist policy. Yet, it is to be expected that Russia will continue with its positive policy. But also -- Russia's positive democratic position remains in the context of Russia's desire to secure its sphere of influence in this part of the world. As far as we in Croatia are concerned, we have to acknowledge the positive role Russia has played in attempts to resolve the problems in the former Yugoslavia. We also have very intensive economic relations with Russia. As a country which wants to have friendly relations with all countries in the world we should try to develop our economic and cultural relations with Russia as much as possible. Despite its desire to have Serbia in its sphere of interest Russia will want to have good relations not only within the Orthodox world, but also with what used to be called the western Slavs. All in all, we have to be not only pragmatic, but we must also remember that cultural links between the Croatian and Russian people existed [a long time ago] and that understanding for the Croatian problem is reflected in the attempts by Russian diplomats to support a right solution. [Galic] You said Croatia is not a Balkan country and this will certainly be accepted by everyone. Croatia is a European country. How will the process of Croatia's integration into European organizations and systems -- political, cultural, economic, etc -- develop by the end of this year? Is it realistic that the Council of Europe is the first step? Is Croatia determined to fight for full European status? [Tudjman] Absolutely. After the Washington agreement not only the Germans but also U.S. representatives explicitly said that Croatia has been accepted as a constituent part of the western world, western Europe. But we must be realistic here. Regardless of changes of government, some lasting components remain within European countries, which would like -- as they wanted to preserve Yugoslavia -- to create some new regional alliances. For this reason some did not want to have Croatia as it is. Until 1991 they did not want to have Croatia at all -- and some very influential circles wanted Croatia to be defeated. When we managed to survive they worked on producing changes in Croatia which would take Croatia into some new regional alliances in the former Yugoslavia. Because of the spheres of influence, not only between Russia and Europe and Russia, Europe, and the United States, but also within Europe -- you [Galic], as a man who lived in Paris for a long time, know very well that there is significant difference between Paris, London, Bonn, and Rome...[Tudjman pauses] Croatia is absolutely on its way to the EU. Not only is it on its way but, as I have mentioned, Croatia is an important factor in the creation of an international order which will guarantee that no new twists will happen in this turbulent area. [Galic] A country like Croatia, which is neither in a state of peace nor war, must use up a great proportion of its potential on financing its refugees, organizing its armed forces. At the same time its economic potential is not fully utilized. This certainly creates many social problems, some of which you will see reflected in our citizens' questions. [Unidentified pensioner from Osijek] Mr. Tudjman, would you and your wife be able to survive on a pension of 750,000 [Croatian dinars] if your household bills totalled 450,000 [dinars]? [Tudjman] Dear madam, this is too little. We cannot be satisfied with this. We must and will do everything to increase our incomes, our salaries. Then again, let us be realistic, let us be proud, both you and I and all Croatian citizens of having weathered all of this, everything we have weathered. In Croatia no one went hungry. There has been no shortage of fuel in Croatia. There has been no shortage of anything in these wartime circumstances. Your [pension] and my salary are still better than in any former socialist country with the exception of the Czech Republic and perhaps Slovenia which is far above....[Tudjman pauses] Consequently, in these changes which were brought about, which we had to survive, understandably, we had to weather all kinds of things, particularly what Mirko [Galic] has just said, that we had to create an army under unfavorable circumstances. War in every country, in a country such as Croatia in particular, because it was occupied as a whole in the beginning and than one-third was ruined. [sentence as heard] It is a miracle that we have managed even in this economic sphere to avert starvation and poverty. As soon as we get out of the war, and even now we are already increasing salaries. Private enterprises, private initiatives are being launched. The tourist trade is being restored, and so on. We are heading for higher living standards. One thing is essential, though. Today we have our Croatian authorities who have no other task but to take care of the well-being of Croatian citizens. In other words, we have now created a situation in which your and my toil and effort and that of the Croatian people is no longer drained down the Sava and the Danube to God knows where. Croatian people can find jobs where they could not before -- in the Croatian Army, the Croatian diplomatic service. Now, our destiny, our future, the issue of what kind of salaries we will have and what kind of culture and science, is in our hands. Rest assured that we are doing our best to get the most capable Croatian people involved in resolving these problems. [Unidentified refugee] Refugees find it extremely hard to find a job. They would like to work. [Tudjman] A job? I am puzzled, I am puzzled indeed to learn that refugees who want to work -- every refugee should want to work -- cannot find a job. In Croatia we are already facing a shortage of labor, a shortage not only in construction companies but in the tourist industry, too. Consequently, in this context, there are problems which we ourselves, the Croats, are responsible for. This is what we have to overcome. So far I have only heard of obstacles facing those who want to return from abroad. I have had to intervene in a huge number of cases to enable people from the diaspora to take part in the privatization process, to buy these former socialist facilities that belong to no one, and to help them in finding jobs. In two cases the returnees went back to Australia and Canada after having experienced a cold welcome here. It was my intervention that brought them back. Let this be known. I have only heard of such cases in which people from abroad face obstacles to finding jobs. Understandably, there are also positive cases. I know of some hundred young people from the diaspora who are not only employed in their own companies but who have found jobs after returning from abroad. One of thes people is a man who was born in Argentina. He works now for the Privatization Fund. I have not, however, heard so far that you refugees are facing obstacles. On this occasion I appeal to all Croatian people in business life and the administration to give Croatian refugees, above all, a chance to find a job. People will find this burden of refugee existence less painful if they work, if they are occupied, if they know that they are useful rather than being a burden. Consequently, this is our shared issue. Dear madam, not all things in Croatia are as they should be. This is not only a matter of political revival, of the implementation of the economic revival we have achieved. We must also bring about a moral revival, a moral restoration so to speak, so that we can create the preconditions for Croatia's integrity. For, in its history, this Croatia has never been a unified state. There are still regional tendencies. There is still mistrust, say between Dalmatians and Slavonians, or between Herzegovinians and Istrians, and so on. Consequently, we must overcome these regional features within the Croatian national entity that we have inherited from the past as soon as possible. Regional allegiances most certainly have an influence on whether someone gets a job or not. I, for one, have intervened on a great many occasions. I do everything so we can achieve a state of harmony among the Croatian people that is demanded at this historic juncture. We have just established the Croatian state. It should be consolidated. Its stability in international terms will depend on this as well as on its stability in terms of finding the best solutions for all internal problems. There are problems in every country, in every society. Particularly so in our newly-created state because of, as I mentioned, leaving the Yugoslav and socialist hell. [Galic] There is another similar question. [Unidentified female soldier] Mr. President, has Croatia come to the point where a Croatian soldier who has been in service since 1991 is living on 360,000 [Croatian dinars] a month? That is a shame! [Tudjman] I do not know your case precisely. If you are referring to a soldier who is capable of working and who is willing to work, then 360,000 is less than a living wage and society, our state, should find a solution for him to have a wage which we can guarantee. Our average wage is about 300 [German] marks, and in many firms as much as 500, 600, 700 and even over 1,000 marks is paid. Therefore, it depends on resourcefulness, and sometimes, if someone is not capable of solving his problems, our social services should help him. In this particular case, if we are really talking about a soldier, I simply do not understand it. [Galic] Political parties are also interested in social policy. You will see that party leaders are asking about the social situation in our country, our society. [Mato Arlovic, Social-Democratic Party] What will be done to improve the social, financial, and equal status of workers and pensioners? Which measures should we take to improve the standards of living of a man, a worker, and his family -- at least to ensure respect for human dignity and the dignity of the family? This is my question. I believe that if the fragmentation of society continues, it will -- and it has already started doing so -- slowly start affecting the unity of all citizens, which could have serious implications on the security of the state. [Tudjman] Of course, it is a task of the authorities to deal effectively with all social problems. However, in that respect we are limited by circumstances. As long as we have to earmark the main part of the budget for the creation of an armed force, an army; as long as we have to support an army three times larger than we would normally need; as long as we have to invest money in the establishing of our diplomatic service, which is not cheap either; briefly, as long as we do not come out of the isolation in which we have been so far, the possibilities of the state authorities are limited. However, there has always been and there will always be the fragmentation of society. The state authorities should exert a positive influence, but that problem should certainly not be addressed by socialist and self-management phraseology and by giving promises and granting rights without a realistic basis. If we opted for a free market, we should respect the laws of the free market, including resourcefulness or the lack of it. Of course, some will become rich, some will go bankrupt. We cannot avoid that, especially during the period of [ownership] transformation. But, I agree that precisely for these reasons the state authorities have a greater responsibility to alleviate the position of those in society who are most at risk -- pensioners and others -- in order to enable them to live a normal life and to create conditions for all classes, all segments of the Croatian people for the first time to take part in the rebuilding of their homeland. [Galic] Mr. Pankretic will ask you a question in his own way. [Josip Pankretic, Croatian Peasants' Party] Since you have appropriated land from the conglomerates as state land, the land has been abandoned. None of the state-owned land along the road from Sesvete to Vrbovec has been sown with corn, and it was not sown last year either. People in the villages wonder why the state does not sow corn when we do. That causes problems for us because my peasants do not sow either. Seeing that you own that land, would you please say something about that? [Tudjman] Dear Pankretic, you cannot help acting as if you are in an electoral campaign. First of all, we have not appropriated any land for the state, but we have been looking for ways of privatizing former socialist large farms without threatening production. I visited Romania recently where they took rash steps and reduced production by 50 percent, and the people were hungry, so they had to return the land. Therefore, we, the state, have not appropriated the land, but we tried to keep up production, and at the same time to privatize the farms. I can give you the same answer as before: We have had such success that there has been no hunger, but I am sure that we can do more for villages. I know very well that the Croatian people have survived because of village life and the peasants. Conditions should be created for the farmers not to leave villages, but to stay there. We should create conditions, as in Denmark for example, for the farmer to be lord of his land. [Galic] Many people will say that a huge, maybe the greatest, treasure of Croatia is its people, very resourceful people. Are they well deployed, appointed to the right positions? A party leader will ask you that. [Jozo Rados, Croatian Social-Liberal Party] With all due respect to the political experience of the president of the republic, but stressing that his experiences stem from the communist system -- both as a brain behind it and a dissident against it -- and acknowledging that he is a scientist, I personally believe that the human resources of the Republic of Croatia should be deployed in a better way. I know how difficult and strenuous it is to create and govern a state. But, there are opinions in the public that many mistakes made by Croatian policy came about because the large volume of work and many tasks have been too much for the strength of one man. I would like to hear the president's opinion on these thoughts. [Galic] Mr. President of the Republic? [Tudjman] It seems that Mr. Rados is speaking here as a party representative. I affirm that Croatian policy has made no strategic mistakes either in politics or in the economy, either internally or in the international sphere. On the contrary, causing surprise, admiration, and bafflement on the part of some people, it has made achievements precisely because it had a leadership, it knew what it wanted, and it mobilized all the intellectual potential -- regardless of party affiliation -- to solve both political and economic problems. One of the most complex tasks was the creation of the Croatian Army. From what, and against which odds did we create it? We managed to defend ourselves and create a force to which the enemy will have to give serious consideration. Look at Croatian diplomacy, look at those people. They are professors, scientists, doctors of sciences, people who have contributed to the victory of Croatian state policy and who are respected in the world. In the economy, where are those economic experts who have been left out? So, we have achieved much, thanks primarily to a good personnel policy. Of course, more can and must be done, but we must create a climate in the whole of Croatia's public life in which there will be a clear difference between state interests on the one hand and party political -- let me not say petty political -- interests on the other hand. Speaking about Croatian state interests, no party differences should be seen in the activities on the international sphere. In the international sphere we should be united in defending the Croatian state and Croatian state interests. That means giving support to those who people voted for and entrusted their confidence in, and, I dare say, those who have justified that confidence and brought Croatia to the point where internally it has one of the most stable systems compared to other former socialist countries, and in international relations it has been recognized and has won the friendship of the most important international players.
