Before 1 July 1994, the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers will examine the question of price formation in the agro-industrial complex, starting from the need to observe optimal parity between prices for agricultural output and raw materials and industrial output. 2. The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers, in agreement with the Ukrainian National Bank, will grant, on a priority basis, in June-September 1994, special-purpose credits to enterprises and organizations of the agro-industrial complex against state contracts and orders for delivery of agricultural output to state food resources and for preliminary payment for animal husbandry products within the limits of the possibilities of putting a primary credit emission into circulation for this period. The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers, in agreement with the Ukrainian National Bank, will within 10 days direct 1.7 trillion karbovantsy, taken from the return of stabilization resources, to enterprises of the meat, dairy, canning, food, and other sectors of industry that process agricultural output and raw materials to make payments to the commodity producers of the agro-industrial complex for agricultural output and raw materials purchased. 3. It is established that, in 1994-1995, the Ukraine joint-stock commercial agro-industrial bank will perform state functions associated with credit, settlement, and currency services to the enterprises and organizations of the agro-industrial complex in their activities aimed at generating state resources of foodstuffs. Procedures for performing these functions will be established by the Ukrainian Ministry of Finance in coordination with the Ukrainian National Bank. 4. It is established that, beginning on 15 June 1994, commercial banks will direct 10 percent of their mobilized credit resources to credit for enterprises and organizations of the agro-industrial complex and to purchase certificates of deposit of the Ukrainian National Bank. It is established that for commercial banks that direct mobilized credit resources to credit for enterprises and organizations of the agro-industrial complex and to purchase certificates of deposit of the Ukrainian National Bank, the income tax rate for the part of income received from these credits and certificates of deposit will be lowered to 11 percent. Credit at an annual interest rate of 30 percent will be granted to enterprises and organizations of the agro-industrial complex to finance state agrarian programs. The difference between the rate at which credit resources are attracted (not greater than the discount rate of the Ukrainian National Bank) and the 30-percent rate for credit use will be compensated for from the Ukrainian State Budget. During preparation of proposals to specify the indicators of the 1994 Ukrainian State Budget, the Ukrainian Ministry of Finance will envision the appropriations necessary for this. The Ukrainian Ministry of Finance, with the participation of the Ukrainian National Bank, will within 10 days develop and ratify the procedure for forming and using mobilized credit resources, keeping records of the commercial bank income received in this, and applying tax to such income. 5. The Ukrainian National Bank, with the participation of commercial banks and the appropriate ministries and departments, will within 10 days define and institute a mechanism, mandatory for commercial banks and their debtors, for transferring indebtedness on loans granted out of credit resources that the state has granted to agricultural commodity producers and enterprises of the processing and mixed feed industries to the purchasers of their output. 6. Before 1 July 1994, the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers will see that procurement and processing enterprises and organizations are given 50-percent advance payments for agricultural commodity producers against the state contract, including advances for seed for agricultural crops and for pedigreed livestock, and they will envision the appropriations needed for this during preparation of proposals to specify the indicators of the 1994 Ukrainian State Budget. 7. The Ukrainian National Bank will establish a most favored status for commercial banks that take part in carrying out priority agrarian programs. Agricultural enterprises and organizations will make extensive use of the credits received against the security of their output. In this connection, one exception will be established for them in payment of the state fee for registering security; it will be 0.3 percent of the value of the property used as security, but not more than 5 million karbovantsy. 8. It is established that enterprises of the wholesale and retail networks, regardless of their form of ownership and including consumer cooperative enterprises, will use all of the earnings they receive, with the exception of the trade margin, from the sale of agricultural output and food bought from the producers of Ukrainian agro-industrial output exclusively for settling accounts with those producers. If these earnings are used for other purposes, the tax inspectorates will impose an indisputable penalty of three times the amount used improperly, to be paid to the local budget. 9. It is established that wholesale and retail trade enterprises, regardless of their form of ownership and including consumer cooperative enterprises, must pay a fine of 3 percent of the total payment to suppliers of agricultural output, raw material, and food and a 3-percent payment to the local budget for each day payment is overdue after a three-day period, unless a larger penalty is envisioned by agreement. The Ukrainian National Bank will institute a procedure for collecting this fine from its clients who violate payment discipline by a nonacceptance withdrawal. 10. The Ukrainian State Committee on Material Reserves will put an additional 90,000 tonnes of animal fat and 30,000 tonnes of meat into the state reserve in June-August 1994. The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers will ensure timely payment for this output and envision the means for this in the state budget. 11. The government of the Republic of Crimea and the oblast, Kiev, and Sevastopol state administrations, with the participation of the Ukrainian Ministry of Agriculture and Food and other interested ministries and departments, will ensure that, before 10 June 1994, the accounts of agricultural commodity producers and enterprises of the processing industry with organizations of wholesale and retail trade, regardless of forms of ownership and including consumer cooperatives, for agricultural output and processed food products delivered as of 1 June 1994 are reconciled. The purchasers of agricultural output and processed food products are obligated to complete payment for the output received before 15 June 1994. Article 9 of the present edict will apply to enterprises who do not ensure timely payment for output received. 12. In connection with the present Ukrainian presidential edict, Edict No. 458, dated 15 October 1993, entitled "Payments for Deliveries of Food and Agricultural Output" is declared repealed. 13. The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers and the Ukrainian National Bank will bring normative enactments published earlier into line with the present edict. 14. The present edict goes into force on the day it is signed. [Signed] President of Ukraine L. Kravchuk City of Kiev, 2 June 1994
