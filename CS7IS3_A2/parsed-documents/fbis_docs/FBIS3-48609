The country's smallest party, in a political statement read by its chairperson Megawati Sukarnoputri at the commemoration of its 21st anniversary here last night, said a `single majority' is not in line with the 1945 Constitution or the Guidelines of State Policy decreed by the People's Consultative Assembly last year. "The Constitution says the state protects `all Indonesians' based on the national unity for their good and welfare," the statement said, adding that the state must rise above the interests of individuals or groups in pursuing this goal. "The system of deliberation leading to a consensus is the core of Pancasila democracy, while the `single majority' clearly deviates from this spirit," it said. "`Single majority' is also in opposition to the spirit of openess, cooperation, and ethics in politics," the statement said. It added that the system tends to discourage people from observing the Guidelines of State Policy. "Democracy means that sovereignty comes from the people, for the people and is supervised by the people," it said while throwing doubts on the congruity between the system of single majority and democracy. The PDI also urged government to avoid the unnecessary cost of development paid by the people in the second 25-year development program.
