In §92.211, paragraph (a)(2) is revised to read as follows: §92.211 Tenant-based rental assistance. (a) *␣*␣* (2) The participating jurisdiction selects families in accordance with written tenant selection policies and criteria that are consistent with the purposes of providing housing to very low- and low-income families and are reasonably related to preference rules established under section 6(c)(4)(A) of the Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.). Selection policies and criteria meet the ``reasonably related'' requirement if at least 50% of the families assisted qualify, or would qualify in the near future without tenant-based rental assistance, for one of the three Federal preferences under section 6(c)(4)(A) of the Housing Act of 1937. These are families that occupy substandard housing (including families that are homeless or living in a shelter for homeless families); families that are paying more than 50 percent of (gross) family income for rent; or families that are involuntarily displaced. The participating jurisdiction may select low-income families currently residing in units that are designated for rehabilitation or acquisition under the participating jurisdiction's HOME program without requiring that the family meet the written tenant selection policies and criteria. Families so selected may use the tenant-based assistance in the rehabilitation or acquired unit or in other qualified housing. * * * * * 14.
