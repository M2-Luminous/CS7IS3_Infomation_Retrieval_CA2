FR940830-0-00120 FR940830-0-00014 * * * * * 21. Section 3833.0&hyph;3 is amended by revising the first sentence of paragraph (a), revising paragraphs (e) and (f), and adding new paragraphs (g) and (h) to read as follows: §3833.0&hyph;3 Authority. (a) Sections 314(a) and (b) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (43 U.S.C. 1744), as amended by the Act of August 10, 1993 (30 U.S.C. 28f&hyph;k, 107 Stat. 405), require the recordation of unpatented mining claims, mill sites, and tunnel sites, and the filing of information concerning annual assessment work performed on unpatented mining claims in the proper BLM office within specified time periods. *␣*␣* * * * * * (e) Sections 10101&hyph;10106 of the Act of August 10, 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, 107 Stat. 405), require an annual maintenance fee of $100 to be paid to the proper State Office of the Bureau of Land Management for each non-waived mining claim, mill site, or tunnel site. With certain exceptions provided in §3833.1&hyph;6, this fee is in lieu of the requirement to perform and record annual assessment work under 30 U.S.C. 28&hyph;28e and section 314(a) of FLPMA. Failure to pay the fee within the time limits prescribed by the Act of August 10, 1993, constitutes a statutory abandonment and forfeiture of the non-waived mining claim, mill site, or tunnel site. Provisions relating to maintenance fees and waivers are contained in §§3833.0&hyph;3(f), 3833.1&hyph;5, 3833.1&hyph;6, and 3833.1&hyph;7. (f) Section 2511(e)(2) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (30 U.S.C. 242) requires oil shale claim holders to pay an annual fee of $550 per oil shale claim, notwithstanding any other provision of law. The Act of August 10, 1993, specifically states that the maintenance fee provision shall not apply to any oil shale claims for which a fee is required to be paid under Section 2511(e)(2) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The $550 fee requirement for oil shale claims remains in effect. The $550 fee is first payable on or before December 31, 1993, and on or before each December 31st thereafter. (g) The Stockraising Homestead Act of December 29, 1916 (SRHA) (43 U.S.C. 299), as amended by the Act of April 16, 1993 (107 Stat. 60), provides that no person other than the surface owner may locate a mining claim on SRHA lands after October 13, 1993, until a notice of intent to locate has been filed with the proper BLM State Office and the surface owner is notified of the filing. (1)(i) When a notice of intent to locate a mining claim has been properly filed by a mining claimant, no other person may, until 90 days after the date the notice of intent is filed: (A) File such a notice with respect to any portions of the lands covered by the first notice; (B) Explore for minerals or locate a mining claim on any portion of such lands; or (C) File an application to acquire any interest in any portion of such lands pursuant to Section 209 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1719). (ii) The 90-day exclusive right may be extended by filing a Plan of Operations pursuant to subpart 3809 of this title. The extension runs until the BLM has approved or denied the Plan of Operations. (2) The mining claimant may not locate mining claims on the lands encompassed by a notice under the Act of April 16, 1993, until at least 30 days after he or she has properly notified the surface owner by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.
