The stagnation of infrastructural construction has upset and restricted the development of our national economy. In the 1990's -- during which time our country will raise its national economy to a new level -- the task of infrastructural construction is even more arduous and heavy. We must seize opportunity, develop overall plans and rational distribution, plan, effectively build and manage infrastructural constructionl, and make it yield maximum social and economic benefits. Since the beginning of reform and opening up, we have gradually changed the old pattern of relying completely on state investment in the field of infrastructural construction, and have created a new situation in which the central government, local governments, and enterprises make joint investments through various channels and comprehensively use foreign funds in infrastructural construction at various levels. Enthusiasm has been greatly aroused in all quarters. Infrastructural construction is proceeding vigorously in all localities, entering a stage of rapid development. However, in recent years infrastructural construction has also shown a trend of disregarding objective conditions and economic efficiency, and of blindly seeking large and rapid construction. Some localities are so eager to accelerate development they vie to put forward impractical development objectives, ignore the unified plan for infrastructural construction, and build "small-and-all-embracing" as well as duplicate projects in small areas. Some of them disregard the realities of local financial and material resources; they love to build large projects and emulate others, thus wasting money and creating low utility rates and losses in operation. Some of them violate construction procedures and encourage the practice of "beginning construction first to hasten approval from higher authorities" and "acting first and reporting afterwards." Some of them down-size large, key projects in their reports so it is easier to get state approval; after obtaining approval, they will upgrade the projects in both scale and standards. Others give foreign businessmen unauthorized guarantees for greater share of profits from joint ventures and cooperative infrastructure projects. The consequences of so doing are detrimental to the healthy development of a socialist market economy, to the rational allocation of resources, to overall economic efficiency, and to the coordinated development of the economy as a whole. Some of the practices even hurt the interests of the state. For this reason, leaders at all levels must pay great attention to them. We should be realistic in doing everything. While we should do everything we can, we should act according to our capability. Since the policy decision on a major infrastructural project and its execution directly affect the overall arrangements of the national economy and the overall macroeconomic balance, it must be made under unified state planning and guidance. Infrastructural projects are usually systems engineering projects which require large investment; long construction times; and complex, well-coordinated support facilities. They must follow construction procedures prescribed by the state. The construction procedures embody the requirements of the inherent laws of engineering. Strictly following construction procedures is an indispensable guarantee for making scientific decisions on a construction project and for its smooth construction. The objective of economic construction is to yield benefits. In infrastructural construction, we should also give full consideration to both social and economic benefits. We should try in every possible way, and should concentrate our strength to build the infrastructural projects which concern the interests of the whole and meet the urgent needs of economic development. However, infrastructural construction should proceed in an orderly and step by step manner. It will not do to lag behind. It will not do to either go all out in building projects blindly in disregard of feasibility and benefits, or to exceed by too much the actual needs. In our country -- where the economy is relatively backward and shortages of funds and material will exist for a long time to come -- we should concentrate our forces even more in order to fight a battle of annihilation and prevent duplicate and blind construction from causing great waste. For infrastructural construction, all localities and departments should do a good job in formulating a regional development plan under unified state planning and guidance, and in consideration of their own realities and characteristics. Leading cadres at all levels should take the lead in studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, should comprehensively and accurately understand Comrade Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, should firmly establish the notion of taking the entire country into account, should act according to our capability in a realistic manner, should stress benefits, and should do a down-to-earth job in effectivley building infrastructural projects.
