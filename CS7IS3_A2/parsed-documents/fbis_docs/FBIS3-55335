It is assumed that two key decisions will be adopted: Readiness to accept new members into the bloc has been expressed, and the start of the implementation of the "Partnership for Peace" program, aimed at closer military-political cooperation between NATO and the countries of the former socialist community, has been announced. The insistent knocking on NATO's door by a number of former Warsaw Pact countries -- first and foremost Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, joined by Lithuania in the past few days -- has provoked a negative response from Moscow, which with every justification assesses the possible eastward expansion of the North Atlantic alliance as a manifestation of bloc ideology and an attempt to isolate Russia from Europe-wide processes. This assessment was voiced in a statement made by Vyacheslav Kostikov, the Russian Federation president's press secretary, and a number of speeches made by Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. "The over-hasty eastward expansion of NATO has the potential to provoke the development of a most terrible scenario," the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry stressed notably during an interview with the German FRANKURTER RUNDSCHAU. "It will deliver into the hands of extremists in Russia a strong argument in favor of the need to revive the Russian empire in order to resist the 'offensive from the West.'" According to Andrey Kozyrev, the fears about a renewed "threat from the east" about which our neighbors have been talking recently can be dispelled first and foremost through the strategy of partnership with democratic Russia, which is moving toward a rule of law state and a market economy. Those who talk about some kind of "aggressive" policy in Europe on Moscow's part are in no position to cite any specific evidence. Nevertheless, East Europeans have the right to obtain greater guarantees for their security. No one is disputing this. But they can be secured in practice without becoming a permanent member of any military-political alliance. In particular, this aim can be achieved by carrying out the strategy of partnership in political questions, as well as in the sphere of security, put forward by Russia. As we know, Washington has agreed to this idea, formulating it in the "Partnership for Peace" program, as have the capitals of other European states. Right away, on his first day in Brussels, U.S. President Bill Clinton noted: "The changes which have occurred in recent years in the international arena require the NATO allies to review the organization's role and channel efforts into developing partnership with the East European countries which have embarked on the path of democracy." Other Western leaders agree with this stance. "I am in favor of NATO's expanding its relations with Russia in the security sphere," FRG Chancellor Helmut Kohl stated on the eve of the Brussels summit. At the same time, he especially stressed the need to dispel concerns that the West is pursing a line aimed at isolating Russia. Speaking in turn about the North Atlantic alliance's East Europe strategy, NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner stressed that the alliance's leadership has not yet determined specific dates for new members to join the bloc. Today we will find out how close these statements are to specific actions. But one thing is clear: Without Russia's participation, security in Europe is impossible.
