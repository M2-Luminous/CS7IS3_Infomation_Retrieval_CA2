On behalf of the provincial party committee, people's congress standing committee, government, and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference committee, and the people throughout the province, Cheng Weigao, secretary of the provincial party committee, extended cordial festive greetings to all the commanders and soldiers of the army units stationed in our province and the people's armed police force who had made great contributions to maintaining social stability, developing the economy, and consolidating national defense. After introducing Hebei's economic and political situation, Cheng Weigao said: In the past year, the province saw continuously deepened reform, expanded opening up, developed economy, political stability and unity, and social development and progress. This was a result of the concerted efforts of the people across the province, but it could not be separated from the active participation and great support of the vast number of officers and men stationed in the province. Cheng Weigao pointed out: The endeavor of seizing the opportunity to deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, promote development, and maintain stability, requires the strong unity and cooperation between the army and the government and between the army and the people as well as the continued warm concern and great support of the people's army. From the perspective of defending social and political stability and promoting comprehensive social progress, party committee and governments at all levels and the people across the province should put the efforts to support army building and maintain close army- government and army-civilian relations in an important position to meet the general demand of sharing the common fate and linking the hearts of the people to each other. They should defend our great wall of steel and enhance the army's prestige as they cherish their eyes and achieve still better results in the double-support work in the new situation.
