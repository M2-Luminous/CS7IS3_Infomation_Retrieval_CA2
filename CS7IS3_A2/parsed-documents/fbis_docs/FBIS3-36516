Peacekeeping Will Cost Moscow a Lot"] [Excerpt] As reported, during Russian President Boris Yeltsin's official visit to Georgia, representatives of the Russian and Georgian sides signed the agreement "On the Status and Conditions of Functioning of the Russian Federation Border Troops Staying on the Territory of the Republic of Georgia." Pavel Grachev said in an interview to Georgian journalists that a protocol of intention concerning Russian bases in Georgia was also signed during the visit. In his words, it is planned to set up three bases: in Tbilisi (in the Vaziani area), Akhalkalaki, and Batumi. The Batumi military base, Grachev said, would have branches in Poti, Sukhumi, and Gudauta. The bases will rely only on the Russian troop units in the Transcaucasus that are currently deployed in the areas. Pavel Grachev's last statement refutes recent rumors that Russian military units leaving Germany will allegedly be moved to Abkhazia and other Georgian regions. According to Grachev, warships of the Black Sea Fleet are planned to be stationed in the Poti area. All the bases will be set up by 1 July 1994. In his interview for the SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA newspaper, which was published 4 February, Pavel Grachev said with regard to the military bases' objectives: "The objectives of these military bases are to ensure the security of Russia and the states of the Transcaucasus region that are parties to the Collective Security treaty. When asked whether the question of border troops was resolved, Pavel Grachev noted that the existing border between Georgia and Russia will not be moved. Regarding the resubordination of Russian troops deployed in Abkhazia to General Reut, commander of the Group of Russian Forces in the Transcaucasus, the Russian defense minister remarked that all troops staying in Georgia are subordinated to Reut except for the 345th Airborne Regiment, which, according to Grachev, is a regiment subordinate directly to the Russian defense minister and remains his strategic reserve. Answering a question by SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA's correspondent about to whom the Russian troops that will serve as peacekeeping forces in Abkhazia will be subordinated and who will finance them, the defense minister said: "These troops are under the command of Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev. As for financing, this is a painful question. We still do not have a UN Security Council mandate for Russian troops to carry out peacekeeping missions in the former USSR countries, for them to be peacekeepers under UN aegis. This is why they do not pay us and we have to bear all the costs on our own. Nonetheless we do not give up our mission, seeing Georgia as a single body." [passage omitted]
