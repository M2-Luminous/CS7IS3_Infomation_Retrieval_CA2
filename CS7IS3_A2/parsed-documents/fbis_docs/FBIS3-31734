The hope that both countries would quickly get closer to each other on the path of reconciliation after the conclusion of the friendship and neighborhood treaty two years ago has not been fulfilled. Rather, stagnation seems to have become the main quality of mutual relations. In particular, the unsolved issues from the time of the war and the immediate postwar period have proved to be a constant strain on the political atmosphere between Prague and Bonn. These include compensation for the Czech victims of Nazism, but also the "Sudeten German problem": the insistence of the Germans driven out of Bohemia and Moravia on their "right to their home." However, Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus does "not" assess current German-Czech relations as being "as poor as various commentators" in Prague. He does not see "anything dramatic" in the bilateral relations, Klaus says in an interview with this newspaper: "Czech-German relations are as they are. One cannot improve them artificially, but one should not worsen them artificially, either." Klaus points out that there are hundreds of thousands of contacts between Germans and Czechs everyday. These contacts at the "micro level" are the "meat and blood" of the relations, and they are excellent. The "network of microrelations" today is a hundred times larger than two years ago and a thousand times larger than five years ago. Therefore, he does not see a deterioration of relations--"quite the contrary." Contacts between institutions and governments are not the most important thing, the head of the Prague Government says. At this level, the Sudeten German problem has repeatedly caused displeasure on both sides. The demands of the more than 3 million expellees for a right to return and the return of their property, which Prague had nationalized without compensation after the war, have been categorically rejected by the Czech Government so far. Even talks about this matter were refused. Most recently, Czech Parliament President Uhde categorically refused any kind of discussion on this matter during his visit to Bonn, thus offending his host, Bundestag President Suessmuth. The Czech prime minister said that the Sudeten German problem is an "unfortunate complication" that has been inherited. "For us, it is quite clear: We cannot solve all of our inherited problems right now. Various inheritances are constants of our life, and solving the problems that arose from the situation during the first days after World War II is part of that. Unfortunately, we cannot accept the undermining of these constants." However, for the first time, Klaus indicated an alternative that might offer a way out of the stalemate. As the head of government says, in the Czech Republic, individual rights have priority over collective rights, and that also applies to looking back into the past. "This is a principle of our interpretation of life and reality." He, Klaus, is quite sure that there will not be any solution for the "collective of the Sudeten Germans": "Such a solution does not exist for me, and therefore it is quite unnecessary to look for one. However, I am quite sure that this problem can be solved at the individual level. At this level, I do not see any problems for the Sudeten Germans." The head of government says that for him this is a "new concept," the interpretation of which he first must develop further for himself. "The terminology is completely new, and this terminology can lead somewhere. The way out of the stalemate is an individual solution, not a collective one. This is a change in paradigms." However, this also means that the Prague Government will continue to stick to its "no to collective discussions" (with representatives of the expellees). In Klaus's view, compensation for the Czech victims of Nazism is "certainly the German side's problem." His government is dealing with the short-term question of how much is to be given to the victims as a preliminary advance from the state budget as long as they do not get anything from Germany. As an economist and politician, he understands very well Germany's domestic difficulties in the election year, "at this stage of economic development and in view of high unemployment." Therefore, he does not expect anyone in Germany to be powerful enough at the moment to tackle the issue of compensation. Klaus says that the same principle as for the restitution of Jewish property or the restitution of church property must be applied to compensation for the victims of the war: "We can only attempt to alleviate the consequences of injustice that someone has suffered." This is a rational and pragmatic concept "that is acceptable for all of us." One must not understand the sums that have been cited "as an objective yardstick of injustice." As regards church property, his government is looking for a mutually acceptable solution. The (coalition) partners must, however, accept that "we cannot turn the world back to 24 February 1948. I cannot find a solution under the flag of the restitution of property," the prime minister said. The 53-year-old chairman of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), unchallenged in heading the opinion polls, denies that there is animosity toward the German neighbor. In his country, he has never, not even over the past decades, "seen, heard, or found" animosity toward Germany. Still, recently, it was a small surprise for him to hear that the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, "a jewel of national pride," has a German as chief director. He was taken aback a bit when he heard that. "However, the term `animosity' really falls into a different category." Of course, Klaus says, matters are different when speaking about fear or fears of Germany. However, it is quite normal that the smaller entity is a bit afraid of the larger one. Still, this is not an aggressive attitude toward the Germans. "I do not expect anything bad from Germany," the prime minister said. Klaus does not care to heed warning voices, stemming mainly from historians' circles, saying that the people in Bohemia and Moravia know too little about the multifaceted nature of their German neighbors. He is certain that the Czechs know more about the Germans than 90 percent of the world's nations about their respective neighbors. "Most certainly, our knowledge of German history, literature, and current affairs is qualitatively much better than German knowledge about the Czech Republic," Klaus says. He states that demands for an institute for "German studies" are "lobbyism." Klaus also rejects the accusation that he is against border-crossing cooperation. The Czech Government is for a maximum of border-crossing cooperation as long as it takes place at the "micro level--that is, the individual, companies, towns, and communities." Prague is not against it when two border towns jointly organize their sewer system. "I have said a hundred times: Fine, do that, more quickly and better than today." However, he is not a friend of regional cooperation. "Regions are something unnatural for us. I always say that we must enter Europe as a whole country and not as the European region of Egrensis, the European region of Neisse, or the European region of the Bohemian Forest." Klaus says that, after the disintegration of Czechoslovakia, his country is "slowly but zealously" searching for its identity. It is still at the beginning of a process that must be gone through and cannot be anticipated with analytical definitions. The foreign policy goals of the Czech Republic, on the other hand, are completely clear. "We belong and have always belonged to the Central European area, not to the East European area or even to the Balkans." Conclusion are drawn from that, such as the desire to join all important European institutions. Desirous of becoming a member of the European Union (EU) and, at the same time, being one of the most prominent critics of European "excess bureaucratization"--Klaus does not see any contradiction in that. These are two sides of the same coin. The Czechs have fears that are linked to their past: "We know what integration in a community with a capital that is 2,000 km away means. There are very few opportunities to change things when nonelected bureaucrats sit and have great power." He, Klaus, "certainly does not" compare "the absolute aspects of the EU with Soviet hegemony. However, from the structural viewpoint, there are various things there that I can compare." Recently, he agreed with the president of the European Parliament that the ratio of nonelected officials within the EU must be changed for the benefit of elected officials. The Czech prime minister also energetically defends himself against the accusation, primarily from Poland, that Prague refuses cooperation with the other Central European states. Indeed, Klaus does not like to use the term "Visegrad" (the informal association of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia): "We speak ofCEFTA (the planned Central European Free Trade Association)." It is the Czechs who are pushing this project ahead and who have problems pulling the others along. The members of the Visegrad Group as well as Germany and Austria are natural partners, with whom one wants to have the best conceivable relations. And what about Slovakia? Is the relationship with Bratislava already considered "business as usual" by Prague, or is there still a "special relationship"? "A bit of both," the Czech prime minister says. Thus, the dissolution of the common state is already so far in the past for the Czechs that he, Klaus, has forgotten to mention it abroad several times. On the other hand, he regrets the negative developments in Slovakia. At the moment, there is no one in Slovak politics strong enough to overcome the instability there. Unfortunately, one must still wait for a solution to the crisis in Bratislava. In other fields, too, Klaus, who is married to a Slovak, crosses his fingers to the former "brothers": for the Olympic ice hockey game--as long as they do not play against the Czechs, one may assume.
