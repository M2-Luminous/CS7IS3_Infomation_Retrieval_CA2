FBIS4-54314 "dreas103_c_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-103 Daily Report 26 May 1994 North Korea ROK Denounced for Participation in Rimpac ROK Denounced for Participation in Rimpac SK2705140994 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1225 GMT 26 May 94 SK2705140994 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1225 GMT 26 May 94 Korean BFN [NODONG SINMUN 26 May commentary: "Servants of Aggressors"] [Text] As is known, the South Korean puppet navy will participate in the Rimpac joint operation -- which will be conducted in the western waters off the Pacific from late May to the mid-July -- by being assigned to a combined fleet of the U.S. Navy and the Japanese self-defense navy. Japan, since 1980, and the South Korean puppets, since 1990, have participated in the joint military exercise, which has been conducted every two years in the Pacific Ocean under the baton of the United States since the early 1970's. This will be, however, the first time the puppet South Korean Navy will participate in the joint operation, thus being assigned to the combined fleet of the United States and Japan. Regarding this, an official of the Japanese Defense Agency made it plain that the joint operation in Rimpac will be a political message to North Korea's nuclear program. This shows that the joint operations by the United States, Japan, and South Korea in the Rimpac joint military exercise are a dangerous military action directed at our Republic. It is well-known that the Rimpac joint military exercise -- in which the United States' massive armed forces, including the armed forces of the countries of the Asia-Pacific region that follow the United States, will participate -- is a product of the United States' aggressive global strategy and its ambition to dominate the world, and that it is also the commotion of nuclear war based on its aggressive plan to strengthen its naval strategy and to raise the nuclear attack capability in the Asia-Pacific region. In particular, the United States has intended to facilitate the formation of the U.S.-Japan-South Korea triangular military alliance and, at the same time, to establish a collective security system involving the whole of the Asian-Pacific region by inveigling the South Korean puppet army and Japan into the joint military exercise. The U.S. hardline conservative forces are now giving impetus to increasing military buildup and to preparing the nuclear war under the pretext of the so-called nuclear issue, while talking about sanctions against us. Taking advantage of this, the Japanese reactionaries have strengthened their anti-Republic plots by making an attempt to enact registration in preparation for the emergency situation on the Korean peninsula. The South Korean puppets, by being a shock brigade of the imperialist reactionaries' commotion of nuclear pressure against us, have babbled about the international cooperative system and the strong steps against the North and, also, are indiscriminately running about to commit an act of crushing [apsal] the same fellow countrymen and to exterminate [myolsal] the whole nation with the backing of outside forces. Under these circumstances, the puppet South Korean navy has planned to participate in the joint operation this time by even joining the combined fleet of the U.S. and Japanese armed forces. This clearly shows that the U.S.-Japan-South Korea triangular military alliance system, which has been formed to crush the Asian socialist countries including our country, has entered the stage in which it is being operated practically. The Korean peninsula is the first target in the new military strategy of the United States, which seeks a new world order after the end of the Cold War. Also, it is the invariable goal pursued by the United States in its aggressive Asia-Pacific strategy to put the Korean people on the altar of a nuclear war. The Kim Yong-sam group is actively behaving as a shock brigade in the execution of this criminal aggressive strategy and, also, is fully revealing its true color as a faithful war servant of the United States and a group of traitors trying to slay the fellow countrymen in collision with outside forces. We have put forward a proposal for negotiations to establish a new peace guarantee system [pyonghwa pojang chegye], which will replace the Military Armistice Commission, in order to secure durable peace and security on the Korean peninsula and are making efforts for its realization. At this juncture, the South Korean puppets are actively participating in the United States' adventurous military action against us. This is a grave criminal act of running counter to detente and peace on the Korean peninsula and of posing a threat to peace on Korea and Asia, as well as an unforgivable challenge to our people, the people in the Asian socialist countries, and those ones in the countries of the Asia-Pacific region. The Kim Yong-sam group is trying to maintain its unstable power in return for its service as a servant and a shock brigade of the U.S. aggression and its war policy and to achieve its ambition to reunify the country by a Northward invasion with the arms of force. This is, however, a foolish act. The South Korean puppets must stop committing a reckless act of serving the United States' perilous policy of war, clearly being aware that they have nothing to get from toeing outside forces' policy of strength.
