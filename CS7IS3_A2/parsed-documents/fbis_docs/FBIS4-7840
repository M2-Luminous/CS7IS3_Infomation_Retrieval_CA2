This week's live relay of our Pressclub roundtable is taking place on a different day because the Cabinet, headed by Jozef Moravcik, held its fourth session one day later than usual. The main point on their agenda was an extraordinarily important document--a draft government program statement. After discussing it in detail, the Cabinet approved it at today's session. I welcome our guests, who are in the studio to brief us about today's session: Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik and Deputy Prime Ministers Brigita Schmoegnerova and Roman Kovac. I also welcome our colleagues, the journalists who accepted our invitation. [passage omitted] [Announcer] Mr. Prime Minister, could you please assess realistically the situation and risks you took into account when drafting the starting analysis of the program document? [passage omitted] [Moravcik] From the economic viewpoint, the macroeconomic viewpoint, the most serious problem is probably maintaining the budget--that is, the budget's deficit--on a certain acceptable level. [passage omitted] What is the situation in this sphere? One considerable negative element is last year's high deficit of the state budget. It amounts to roughly 6.8 percent, if I remember the figure correctly. This means 23 billion korunas [Sk]. If we add other state budget debts, the overall state debt amounts to Sk60 billion. This is a big figure, which indeed represents a certain risk for the future development of our economy. [passage omitted] The decline of last year's GDP was roughly 4.1 percent. This is also a negative factor in developing our economic policy. A big discrepancy, a big difference between our export and import, is something very negative, and the Cabinet has to tackle it, to face this problem. Last year our export fell and our import increased. [passage omitted] [Announcer] Deputy Prime Minister, what are the main macroeconomic objectives of the government's policy statement? [passage omitted] In the present economic situation, where are the possible sources for the development of the economy? [Schmoegnerova] As to the first part of your question, we have agreed that in our policy statement we would define the basic macroeconoic objectives in a relatively explicit way. We pledged that we will try to achieve zero growth of the GDP, keep the deficit at the level envisaged for this year, and try to keep inflation within 10 to 13 percent, at most. Also, unemployment must not exceed the limit envisaged in the budget for this year. Further, we have pledged that, in cooperation with the National Bank of Slovakia, we will try to create conditions to keep foreign currency reserves at a level that will allow normal internal convertibility without any additional measures. Our experience with such measures taken at the beginning of the last year was rather unfavorable. We have also pledged to retain a positive balance of payments. [Announcer] Deputy Prime Minister, I would like to ask you what the problems linked to our stand-by loan are. [passage omitted] Do you think we will succeed and reach an agreement [with the IMF]? [Schmoegnerova] I think we have never in our history enjoyed such a favorable situation as the current situation we succeeded in bringing about. [passage omitted] Our current attitude toward the IMF is built on a totally different basis than was the case in the past. This is the first time in our history that we have put forward our own economic policy outline. We have analyzed the risks linked to this economic policy, and we have also presented measures intended to eliminate those risks. This is a different approach from that in the past. Up to now, it was always the other side that presented us with proposals, and the government accepted them in a passive way. I am not saying that it was a totally passive acceptance, but, in substance, it was passive. This, unfortunately, has applied also to our past dealings with the World Bank, not just with the IMF.
