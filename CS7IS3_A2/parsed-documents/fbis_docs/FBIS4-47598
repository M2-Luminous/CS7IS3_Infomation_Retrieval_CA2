It was proposed to return it to the government for fundamental revision. What prompted the subcommittee (one of the concerns of which, incidentally, is the adjustment of the budget for the purpose of reducing state spending) to take such a resolute step? We offer for your attention the line of reasoning of the experts of the subcommittee, which was set forth in the conclusion on the draft of the law of the Russian Federation ``On the Federal Budget for 1994'' with respect to the section ``Basic Research and the Promotion of Scientific and Technical Progress.'' ``The amount of financing of basic and applied science, which is envisaged by the draft of the budget, is catastrophically inadequate. As compare with 1991, when the share of science came to 1.03 percent of the gross domestic product, the spending on scientific research in comparable prices has decreased to one-half. The proposed draft of the budget preserves the deformed structure of expenditures on science, which has formed in recent years, when the share of assets for the remuneration of labor and social insurance came to more than 81 percent. The indicated structure completely ignores the sharp, thirty- to fiftyfold, increase of the prices for energy resources and the substantial increase of the cost of transportation and municipal services and the outlays on scientific equipment, materials, reagents, and scientific information. Thereby merely the maintenance, moreover, the extremely inadequate maintenance, of a portion of the scientific personnel is being achieved, without the possibility of conducting scientific research itself. The sum of the proposed expenditures on science of 11.8 trillion rubles [R], which appears in the aggregate balance, should not be misleading, since the extrabudgetary research and development fund, the deductions to which are not of a mandatory nature and, therefore, under the conditions of the economic crisis are unrealistic (in 1993 of the forecast R1.7 trillion of extrabudgetary assets of research and development only R41.6 billion were actually received), makes up two-thirds of this amount. Thus, it is actually necessary to count only on the budgetary component--R4.5 trillion (0.6 percent of the gross domestic product). In the submitted draft of the budget the remainder principle of the financing of the scientific sphere is firmly established, since it is financed from the development budget, the formation of which, in accordance with the law 'On the Budgetary System of the Russian Federation,' is carried out only in the absence of a budget deficit, but such a deficit is incorporated in the submitted draft. Thus, science does not have in practice guarantees of financing. In the opinion of the subcommittee, the spending on civilian science, which is included directly in the federal budget for 1994 in Article 15 of Section 4, should come not to R4.5 trillion, but to not less than R7.7 trillion (1 percent of the gross domestic product and 4.2 percent of all budgetary spending, which is half the share of the gross domestic product that is allocated for science in developed countries and is acceptable only in case of substantial tax, tariff and customs benefits), of which not less than R2.8 trillion should be allotted for material expenditures, the purchase of scientific publications, the assurance of a modern level of information service of scientists, as well as the compensation of the energy outlays on the maintenance of scientific institutions and the covering of the energy costs of energy-intensive scientific project. Thus, the minimum expenditures on science will require the additional allocation of R3.2 trillion. Even these funds will make it possible to meet the needs of only a portion of the scientific research, therefore, at the same time it is necessary to envisage an increase of the share of the direct financing of projects and programs and the addressed support of scientific schools and collectives and individual researchers. The share of budget assets (including the assets liable to distribution through funds), which ensure the implementation of a selective scientific and technical policy, should make up not less than 45 percent of the total spending on science. Here it will become possible to channel into the financing of basic science, which is national cultural property and creates the prerequisites for the economic revival of the country, about R2.5 trillion (0.35 percent of the gross domestic product, which corresponds to the pattern of spending for these purposes in developed countries). It should be emphasized that throughout the world the state assumes practically entirely the financing of basic science.'' The conclusion about the necessity of allocating additional assets was supported by the participants in a conference held in the subcommittee, which representatives of the RAS, the Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the Russian Academy of Education, the Russian Academy of the Arts, the Russian Academy of Architecture and Construction Sciences, the Russian Engineering Academy, the Academy of Technological Sciences, the Academy of Natural Sciences, Moscow State University, the Council of Rectors of Moscow Higher Educational Institutions, the State Archival Service, the State Committee for Higher Education, and the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy of Russia attended.
