Cho Yong-kil, director of the Strategic Planning Bureau at the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) headquarters, denied reports Monday that the Defense Ministry plans to bring in Patriot missiles from 1997 as part of Korea's next-generation anti-air defense project. Defense authorities have looked into replacing aging Nike Hercules and Hawk (homing all-the-way killer) missiles with more advanced surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems because parts will be difficult to get after 2000, Cho said. But no decision has been made on introducing Patriot missiles from 1997 and including them in the long-term weapons procurement blueprint, joint strategic objectives plan (J-SOP), he said. "We will be able to decide on the next-generation anti-aircraft missile project in four to five years, after sufficient testing of similar weapons from all over the world," he said. Rep. Yim Pok-chin of the opposition Democratic Party (DP) claimed that the Defense Ministry had included introduction of Patriot missiles in the SAM-X project starting in 1997 in Monday's interpellation.
