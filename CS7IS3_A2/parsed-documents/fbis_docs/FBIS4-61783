Mykola Semenchenko, head of the Donbas regional council of strike committees, and representatives of company staffs from Rivne and Vinnytsya Oblasts were also invited to participate in the conference organized at the initiative of the Ukrainian National Assembly-Ukrainian National Self Defense [UNA- UNSO]. UNSO Deputy Commander Dmytro Korchynskyy speculated that the workers' movement is currently in a state of "clinical death." Therefore, in his opinion, the UNA-UNSO should revive the movement which will defend the interests of Ukrainian workers. Rostyslav Novozhenets, deputy chief of the Lvivprylad company, pointed out in his speech that, as of today, privatization is ruinous, because it is conducted without taking into account workers' demands, favoring the Mafia instead. In his opinion, the independent trade unions are no longer able to defend workers, despite the fact that they are headed by Rukh People's Deputy Yaroslav Kendzyor. Oleksandr Ilyuk, a representative of the Rivne metal-concrete construction plant, as well as other participants, noted that they no longer trust any civil or political parties and trade unions, such as Rukh or the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists. In their opinion, only UNA-UNSO can really uphold workers' demands. Participants in the conference adopted a resolution to establish, under UNA auspices, the Ukrainian Labor Assembly which will comprise company staffs, free trade unions, and strike committees. Also voiced at the conference were appeals to workers to support UNA-UNSO candidates in the local elections.
