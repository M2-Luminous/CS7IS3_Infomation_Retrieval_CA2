Kim, currently visiting Russia, made the remark while delivering an address to the Council of the Russian Federation. "If and when the nuclear issue is settled, the Republic of Korea is ready and willing to provide economic support to North Korea to help it rebuild its shattered economy and carry out reform," he said. Kim arrived in Moscow on Wednesday and has held two summit meetings with Russian President Boris Yeltsin. "... It is imperative to resolve international suspicions about North Korea's nuclear development program as quickly as possible. Without a decisive solution to the nuclear issue, it will be impossible to preserve peace not only on the Korean peninsula but also in Asia as a whole." He added, "I sincerely appeal to you, distinguished members of the Federation Council, to actively cooperate in solving this issue." The president also emphasized that Russia and Korea will be able to work together in ushering in the fledgling Asia-Pacific era. "It will be impossible to preserve peace in Northeast Asia without Russian cooperation. This is the very basis for the joint efforts of our two countries to advance shared prosperity."
