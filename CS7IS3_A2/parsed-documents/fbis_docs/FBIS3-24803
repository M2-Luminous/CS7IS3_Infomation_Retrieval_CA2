According to the radio, a group of six rebels, who came to trade fleece in a market, was surprised by a detachment of the Republican Guard, which opened fire, killing four of them. The national radio did not give any details about the fate of the two remaining Chadian rebels. This incident occurred while a Niger delegation led by Interior Minister Ousmane Oumarou was in Ndjamena from 27 to 28 January for a series of talks devoted to the problem of Chadian refugees in Niger and, more generally, to security at the border between the two countries. According to Oumarou, some 3,600 Chadians have taken refuge in Niger since the political changes that have taken place in Chad over the past few years. The Niger minister, quoted by the national radio, assured the Ndjamena authorities that "Niger would not serve as a rear base and would not tolerate the presence of armed soldiers on its territory seeking to destabilize the current democratic process in Chad."
