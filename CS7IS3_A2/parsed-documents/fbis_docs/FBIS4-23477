Cease-Fire Commission [CCF] Chairman Pier Giorgio Segala feels the problem can no longer be resolved at the CCF level and he has submitted it to the Supervision and Control Commission [CSC]. MEDIAFAX has obtained two documents connected with this matter: A memorandum from Segala to the CSC, dated 25 May 1994, and a government reaction to this memorandum, dated 26 May 1994 and signed by Brigadier Joao Aleixo Malunga, head of the government delegation to the CCF. The issue in question is this: Has the government or has it not hidden some of its troops? The memorandum from Segala outlines: -- On 5 May 1994, Minister Teodato Hunguana told the CSC that the government delegation to the CCF informed the CSC on 9 November 1992 that the government had 61,638 troops to be confined and that it would provide later the number of government troops in centers for nonconfined troops. -- On 18 March 1993, Lieutenant Genearal Hama Thai "presented to the United Nations figures produced by the Defense Ministry's Logistical Department" with a view to providing provisions for the confined 61,638 FAM troops. Hama Thai stressed that the 61,638 troops do not include troops in centers for nonconfined troops. -- On 26 April 1993, the government signed "a memorandum of understanding" with the World Food Program to provide food aid to 62,000 troops in 29 assembly areas. The memorandum adds: In November 1993 the government presented to the "CCF the first figure of government troops in centers for nonconfined troops. The figure was 14,849 troops. -- Beginning December 1993, in daily reports, issued by the Technical Unit of the UN Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz], "it is repeatedly stressed" that the government will confine 61,638 troops. Thus, until 20 April 1994, the correct figures presented to Unomoz were: 61,638 troops for assembly areas and 14,849 troops for centers for nonconfined troops. "The government did not object to these figures". On 21 April 1994 the government informed the CCF that the total number of troops in assembly areas and centers for nonconfined troops is 64,118. Within 24 hours a total of 12,369 troops were missing. "Since the figure of government troops in centers for nonconfined troops had changed by only 369 troops, from 14,849 in November 1993 to 14,480 in April 1994, the new figure was accepted, leaving a total of 12,000 troops missing." After the issue was submitted to the CSC, it returned to the CCF on 5 May 1994. Since then the CCF has held four meetings to discuss the issue. "All these meetings were unfruitful," Segala says in his letter to the UN's Aldo Ajello. Segala's memorandum goes on to say: "At the first CCF meeting on 5 May 1994, the head of the government delegation explained the discrepancy of 12,000 men, referring to difficulties in updating the figures of serving troops during the period of war in a country facing serious logistical problems. He said the figures of government troops are being constantly reexamined. He said the specific reasons for the discrepancy include the time gap between the event on the field (for example the death of a soldier) and the time the event is registered in different books kept by the Ministry of Finance, the Defense Ministry's Logistic Department, and the FAM Supreme Command; the tendency by camp commanders to inflate the figures of troops under their command in order to obtain more provisions for the troops; the tendency of some officers to inflate the number of troops under their command in order to pocket the salaries of nonexistent troops; and the practice of not removing the names of demobilized troops from the salary list until their military pensions have been fixed." Segala's memorandum points out that if this discrepancy does not only appear in relation to confinement and demobilization processes, then similar discrepancies should be observed in the total number of troops registered in the Ministries (of Finance and Defense) in August 1992. "A well-documented statement by the government that discrepancies [words indistinct] to the figures presented for assembly areas and demobilizaation would greatly help to calm people's concerns that troops are being hidden or kept in reserve." Segala says in his memorandum that Brig. Malunga agreed "to try to find out whether there is an original document proving the transfer of government troops to the police force." At the CCF meeting held on 13 May 1994 Malunga said the issue could not be resolved because relevant specialists were "out of Maputo." The CCF met again on 23 May 1994. At that meeting, Malunga refused the proposal that the government should prepare a well-documented statement with the discrepancies, pointing out that the problem was just a mere question of interpretation." "In conclusion, Malunga said that the issue of whether or not the government was hiding troops would come to light at the end of the demobilization process because it would be known whether the government left any troops on the field." The fourth CCF meeting scheduled for 24 May 1994 did not take place because of the absence of the Renamo representative. Segala concludes his memorandum by saying: "I lament to inform you that the CCF has exhausted all its possibilities for resolving the matter. I am, therefore, forced to submit it to the CSC for urgent attention". On 26 May 1994 Brig. Malunga addressed a written protest to Segala, demanding that the issue be returned to the CCF. The government delegation to the CCF said Segala [words indistinct] true contents of the discussions on the issue. The protest letter describes the decision by Segala to submit the issue to the CSC as not a "very dignified" decision. As far as the government is concerned, Segala's role is "exclusively" that of a CCF "moderator" and a "trustworthy reporter" of what is taking place. "In the General Peace Accord there is no room for unilateral actions and deductions by the CCF chairman without, at the very least, obtaining a consensus from the parties". The government's protest letter says that by transferring the issue to the CSC, Segala created "serious doubts" about his "real intentions." What is more, he did not wait for a reply from the head of the Renamo delegation. "The real party interested in this problem is not Renamo as we are constantly made to understand." "Segala's role in this particular case should not be to heighten contradictions between the parties." The letter goes on to say that the government delegation to the CCF "is deeply astonished by the pressure, something strange, applied in unison and concerted manner against the government over discrepancies in the figure of its troops, as if this was a problem that only affected the government." The protest letter reiterates that the government "does not have and it has never had any intention to hide troops."
