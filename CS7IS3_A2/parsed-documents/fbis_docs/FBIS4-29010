FBIS4-29010 "dreas115_d_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-115 Daily Report 15 Jun 1994 South Korea 15 Jun Newspapers Comment 15 Jun Newspapers Comment SK1506102094 SK1506102094 BFN [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of articles and editorials published in Seoul vernacular newspapers on 15 June regarding North Korea's withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA. The conservative CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "We Can No Longer Let North Korea Take the Initiative." The editorial stresses that North Korea is not a rational society and that it has been obstinate in its unreasonable demands for almost half a century. The editorial holds the South partially responsible for "spoiling" the North by accepting their unreasonable demands. Analyzing the withdrawal from the IAEA as "a strategy to earn some more time to develop nuclear weapons and gain better conditions for negotiations," the editorial warns that it is not significant that North Korea is holding back its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, NPT, and the government should stop accepting unreasonable demands. The editorial concludes that the government should review how the United States and Russia ended their nuclear competition after the cold war and should develop the most practical strategy to deter war. CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 4 a 1,200-word article by reporter Pak Tu-sik on the ROK Government's stance regarding the withdrawal. The article reports that the government believes North Korea's withdrawal is a strong political and psychological attack aimed at restraining further resolutions and leaving the U.S.-North Korean talks as the only communications channel. The article reports that the government plans "to include a measure in the UN Security Council's sanction resolution that could cause North Korea substantial damage," while continuing to persuade China to agree to the UN resolution. The article continues that the government's policy is that there is no alternative to sanctions and that the existing strategy of inducing North Korea to reform and opening up may change to a strategy of isolating North Korea. CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 5 a 1,600-word article by the deputy editor-in-chief entitled "North Korean Nuclear Issue and the Economy." Noting that the ROK people have finally become aware of the emergency situation and have begun to purchase emergency materials, the column reports that it is very fortunate, however, there are no signs of an economic crisis. The column says that "the ROK people have been well trained for emergencies for the past 40 years of confrontation between the North and the South" and even developed an economy amid such a tense situation. The column recalls that the ROK people were able to create a "compressed growth" in a short period with an aim to outdo the North during the Pak Chong-hui regime. The column stresses that the government should strengthen internal cohesion and concludes that the best way for the people to repel a North Korean threat is to concentrate on their daily life dauntlessly and not show signs of social chaos. The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 1,100-word article by reporter Yang Sung-hyon on the ROK Government's reaction to North Korea's withdrawal from the IAEA. The article reports that the government does not view the withdrawal as a new trick, but a part of the existing card, however, the withdrawal can be interpreted as "North Korea's determination that a UN Security Council sanction resolution will be followed by North Korea's withdrawal from the NPT." The article reports that a government official analyzes that the withdrawal only makes China and Russia less inclined to oppose sanctions. The article says that the government may expedite the adoption of a UN sanction resolution early next week if North Korea does not change its attitude after former U.S. President Carter's visit to the North. The article reports that the government is also considering economic consequences and doing its utmost to maintain stability through impeccable security measures against North Korea's armed provocation. The article concludes by quoting a government official: "Our side, as well as North Korea and the international community, are all in a tense confrontation fearing that one step back will make one lose the initiative forever." The independent moderate MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN, specializing in economic topics, publishes on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "Tension of the North Korean Nuclear Issue and Preparedness." The editorial analyzes that North Korea withdrew from the IAEA merely to avoid losing face caused by the IAEA resolution and urges readers not to be affected by North Korea's nuclear game. The editorial stresses that the ROK people should not respond to North Korea's threats, such as their remarks about regarding sanctions as a declaration of war, and maintain economic activities unswervingly. The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 1,000-word article by Yi Sung-chul on the government's reaction to North Korea's declaration of its withdrawal from the IAEA. The article reports the government "will continuously push ahead with its original policy for sanctions against North Korea by the UN Security Council" because it believes North Korea's declaration on withdrawal from the IAEA "does not have any practical meaning, but has political and symbolic meaning." The article continues: "The government believes the nuclear issue has not changed at all in essence since North Korea is still obligated to accept inspections as a signatory of the NPT despite its declaration of withdrawal from the IAEA." The article quotes a ranking government official as saying that the declaration by North Korea is "at an expected level [yejongdoen sujun] following the adoption of the UN Security Council resolution" and is regarded as "a bluff to counter the UN Security Council's moves toward sanctions" rather than "a new card." The article also reports that the government's adherence to its original position on sanctions shows its will to take the lead in South-North relations in the adverse situation following North Korea's replacement of fuel rods. Quoting a government official's remarks, the article notes: "The declaration by North Korea gave us an advantage in persuading countries like China, which have declined to agree to sanctions against North Korea." The article reports that the government considers adding "stronger terms" [kanggyong naeyong] in the UN Security Council draft resolution in response to North Korea's follow-up measure and that the government will convey "the international community's mood" and the fact that "there is a limit to the flexibility of the United States and the ROK" through former U.S. President Jimmy Carter. The moderate TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 5 in its "Today and Tomorrow" column a 1,000-word article by senior reporter Choe Maeng- ho entitled "The `Level of Crisis' on the Korean Peninsula." The article remarks on the lack of attention to security on the part of the people because they think "North Korea cannot afford to carry out a war" and believe "it will not provoke a war unless the United States attacks first." Noting that the purchase of emergency food supplies does not seem to be motivated by serious anxiety, the article ascribes the people's "lack of security sense" to the feeling "there would be no particular way out even if a war takes place." After touching on the government's "inconsistent policy on North Korea" and stressing that "the situation regarding the nuclear issue is certainly developing into a crisis," the article concludes by urging the government and people to make every effort to "avoid the possible demise of both South and North Korea." The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "North Korea's Reckless Run to Withdrawal From the IAEA." The editorial denounces North Korea's withdrawal from the agency as "a serious challenge and an illicit act that has devastated the international order," and warned against North Korea's aim to "bargain over the nuclear inspection issue only with the United States, excluding the IAEA." The editorial stresses the need to "sternly proceed with imposing pressure and UN Security Council gradual sanctions on North Korea in close cooperation among the ROK, the United States, and Japan until North Korea retreats from its withdrawal from the IAEA and allows an overall nuclear inspection" [chonmyon haek sachal]. The editorial also emphasizes that "exclusive negotiations between the United States and North Korea should be held after North Korea returns to the IAEA and allows the inspection." The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries on page 3 a 900-word editorial entitled "North Korea's Adventurous Choice" analyzing the reason for North Korea's withdrawal from the IAEA. The editorial analyzes this action by North Korea as "a reaction against the agency's repeated acts, unfavorable to North Korea, following the United States" and as an expression of its "determination to be separated from the IAEA, which has ceaselessly raised new issues even after North Korea allowed nuclear inspections." Pointing out the possibility that "the keen confrontation between North Korea's strong strategy and the U.S. intent to show its stern resolution to punish the North will further aggravate the situation on the Korean peninsula," the editorial stresses the need to make efforts to find a way "from confrontation to dialogue." The editorial also comments on the "need to review closely the reason for North Korea remaining in the NPT, after withdrawing from the IAEA."
