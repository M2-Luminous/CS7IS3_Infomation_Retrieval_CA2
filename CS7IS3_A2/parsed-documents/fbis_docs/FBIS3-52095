Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres presented the draft to the Palestinian delegation in Cairo last week. The official said the Palestinian delegation told Peres it will convey these proposals to the Palestinian leadership to adopt an appropriate position. The Palestinian leadership rejected most of the proposals. The official added that Israel tries, through its media and statements by its officials, to cause confusion among Palestinian ranks.
