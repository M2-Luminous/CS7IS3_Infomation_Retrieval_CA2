Meeting with reporters, the prince said that the kingdom has received the credentials of ambassadors from 55 countries. Some are not residing in the country yet and have carried out their duties from various other cities, such as Bangkok and Beijing. Somehow, the diplomatic ties between our Cambodia and those countries have been reinforced and expanded. The prince added: Our country is considering the possibility of establishing an embassy in Malaysia, since the good relations between the two countries have continued to improve. As for the ties with Thailand, they have progressed, but recently we have had some problems with the Thais. We still have border demarcation problems with Thailand and Vietnam. Among our neighbors, Laos is our best friend. For this reason, we have permitted the Lao to use the port in Sihanoukville while they have allowed us to use their airport in Vientiane. What we have done is in the interests of both countries. The prince also said that the creation of a border committee proposed by Thailand represents the position of the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC]. The only way to solve the border problems is to adopt the Cambodian map of the 1960s, which indicates that Cambodia has an area of (191,055) square kilometers. International observers should use the map to establish the borders and to draw up a report concerning the matter for their headquarters in New York. Answering a question about the problem of illegal immigrants, the prince said the government has never persecuted immigrants, especially the Vietnamese. Rebutting a Vietnamese human rights group charge that the RGC has committed human rights violations, the prince said: Instead we have ensured security for them (?for humanitarian reasons). He added that illegal immigrants do not consist of only Vietnamese but also Thais, Chinese, and other people coming from various regions, and that this issue will be completely settled after the National Assembly adopts an immigration law in the near future. Commenting on the concerns of foreign investors, the prince said the RGC has no intention of revising contracts concluded previously. The RGC, however, will review those transactions. The prince also said: The issues concerning (?business deals) and a floating hotel have already been settled once and for all. We only want to legalize their businesses with appropriate contracts.
