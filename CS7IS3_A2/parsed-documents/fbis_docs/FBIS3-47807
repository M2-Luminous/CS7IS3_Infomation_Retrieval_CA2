They also prattled that they would stage in August this year a large-scale war game by integrating two military drills codenamed "Ulchi" and "Focus Lens", in case the "Team Spirit" was suspended. Those remarks worsening the North-South relations and carrying the situation of the Korean peninsula to the extreme pitch of strain are an open manifestation of their criminal intention to continue to run headlong towards confrontation and war, not reconciliation and unity, inciting an atmosphere of war, not of peace. The South Korean puppets are making desperate efforts to stage another joint war game, crying for "expansion of another form of drill", at a time when a positive prospect is in sight for the solution of the nuclear problem between the DPRK and the United States. This is a sinister move to block the progress of DPRK-U.S. talks at any cost and lay another grave obstacle in the way of the solution of the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula. If another large-scale joint military drill were staged in South Korea to replace the suspended "Team Spirit" it would mean, as a matter of fact, its continuation. Should they stage another joint military drill which would be equal to the "Team Spirit" in essence, though different in codename, the nuclear problem could never be solved on the Korean peninsula nor detente and peace be expected but a more dangerous situation of potential war would prevail. We are ready both for dialogue and for a war. If the puppet clique recklessly provoked a war, we would determinedly control them with fire. The South Korean puppets must not act rashly, mindful that their leading the situation of the peninsula to a phase of confrontation will only result in their own destruction.
