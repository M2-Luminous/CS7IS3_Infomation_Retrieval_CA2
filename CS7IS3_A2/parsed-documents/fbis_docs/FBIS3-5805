Delegates said the donors pledged a total of 486 million dollars of aid projects and programs for this year and half that amount for 1995. The meeting of the International Committee on the Reconstruction of Cambodia [ICORC], chaired by Japan, was attended by delegates from 32 countries, the European Union and 12 international organizations. One senior Japanese Foreign Ministry source said the amount pledged was more than expected, particularly in light of the so-called "aid fatigue" believed to have set in among many donor nations. "Tokyo seems to be a lucky place for Cambodia," said another senior Japanese official, referring to the last such meeting here in 1992 when participants pledged 880 million dollars. The pledges came in answer to a call from ailing Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk, read out at the meeting on his behalf, for a modern-day "Marshall Plan" to help the war-ravaged country back on its feet. Many, if not most, of the delegations participating in the two-day meeting pledged fresh funds toward the roughly projected 200 million dollars that Cambodia will require over the coming year. Japanese parliamentary Vice Foreign Minister Syozo Azuma pledged on Tokyo's behalf the equivalent of 87.7 million dollars in grant aid for the coming year, while U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced 73 million dollars in new U.S. assistance to Cambodia over a two-year period. Among international financial institutions, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) announced it will provide Cambodia with some 129 million dollars in loan assistance for 1994-97, as well as technical assistance of some 28 million dollars for the same period. The World Bank said it is planning to offer Cambodia roughly 75 million dollars in reconstruction assistance in the coming fiscal year. The first ICORC meeting, held at a working-level in Paris last September, saw 119 million dollars in fresh commitments added to the 880 million dollars pledged at a previous ministerial conference on Cambodia held in Tokyo in June 1992. While most of those funds were for short-term financial support, the present ICORC meeting is focused on Cambodia's mid- to long-term aid requirements. At the outset of the meeting, Cambodian First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh conveyed an appeal from his father Sihanouk, who has been undergoing medical treatment in Beijing. "The gift of which my country has the greatest need, having suffered from so many years of turpitude and devastation, is none other than a new unconditional Marshall Plan gauged to specific needs," Sihanouk said in the message. Sihanouk's reference was to a multibillion-dollar plan drawn up by late U.S. Secretary of State George Marshall in the late 1940s to rehabilitate the shattered economies of post-World War II European nations. Japan was the largest donor at the conference, followed by the U.S. and france, Foreign Ministry officials said. Of the 15.77 million dollars committed to the Cambodia Mine Action Center, the U.S. was the largest contributor, followed by Japan and Australia, they said. During the meeting, Cambodia explained its economic and development policies. Cambodia's shift toward a market-oriented economy seems to be progressing steadily, the officials said. International organizations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) positively evaluated Cambodia's reconstruction efforts, they said. The participants of the conference also agreed to hold the third ICORC meeting next year in Paris as scheduled, but timing of the conference has not yet been set, the officials said. The Cambodian delegation also expressed its intention during the conference to join the Yokohama-based International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO), the officials said. The ITTO consists of 23 timber producing countries such as Brazil, Colombia and Peru, and 26 consumer countries such as Australia, Japan, Canada, China and the U.S.
