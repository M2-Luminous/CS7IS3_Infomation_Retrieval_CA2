It has been reported that a peace march was made to the Bavel region last Saturday and that two or three marchers were shot dead. This report hinted at the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] as being responsible for the incident. The NADK spokesman would like to emphasize that the NADK had nothing to do with this peace march. In fact: 1. The NADK did not know the starting point nor destination of this march. 2. The situation in the western part of the town of Battambang is marked by the fact that the communist Vietnamese, their puppets, and their allies' puppets have been launching fierce and continuous operations against the national resistance forces and people, thus causing inestimable damage and endless misery to the villages and people in this region. 3. The NADK would like to emphasize that anyone who wants to find the culprit in the peace march incident should look at the evildoers, that is, the communist Vietnamese, their puppets, and their allies and puppets who have kindled the war together and are continuing to kindle the flames of war which has burned and ruined Cambodia, the Cambodian people, Buddhism, temples, and monasteries for 15 years now. By now, half of Cambodia is becoming another Kampuchea Kraom. To cite Lord Buddha, all these atheists are the ones who have committed all kinds of evil deeds, especially killing and stealing. The Democratic Kampuchea and the Cambodian nation and people are the victims, victims who have suffered untold misery and not been allowed even to protect themselves. They have jointly attacked and accused us in an unjust, inhuman, arrogant, and brutal manner in line with their evil nature as demons who like to suck human blood. 4. Questions: Who does not know that the communist Vietnamese have installed their puppets to serve as a smokescreen for the communist Vietnamese to continue their aggression and occupation of Cambodia? Who does not know that the allies have integrated their puppets with the communist Vietnamese puppets since July 1993 in order to continue fueling the Vietnamese war to kill the nation, people, and resistance forces? In Lord Buddha's moral precept, who has done all these evil deeds? In the way of the world, who have been the aggressors against the Cambodian nation and people for the past 15 years? From these few questions, people can clearly see without any delusion what is white and what is black. [Signed] NADK spokesman [Dated] 2 May 1994
