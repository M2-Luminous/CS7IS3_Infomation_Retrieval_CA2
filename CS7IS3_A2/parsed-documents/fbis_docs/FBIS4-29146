The 10th meeting is being attended by representatives from 17 APEC member countries, Chile, which is scheduled to join the group in November, and the Pacific Economic Cooperation Committee (PECC). Discussions will be held in four subcommittees -- the education forum, the economic development network, the management network and the industrial technology network. Participants are expected to concentrate on an occupational training program proposed by South Korea at the fifth APEC ministerial conference and the manpower development projects agreed at the APEC leaders' meeting in Seattle, Washington, last year. The APEC occupational training program calls for exchanges of teachers, technology and technicians, job training, equipment support and the formation of a network to exchange information on occupational training. Pae Yong-sik, an official of South Korea's Economic Planning Board and chairman of the conference, said the meeting is aimed at promoting the introduction to developing countries of management skills from advanced nations. South Korea hopes to foster a favorable investment and trade climate in other countries by providing occupational training for workers from developing states, Pae said.
