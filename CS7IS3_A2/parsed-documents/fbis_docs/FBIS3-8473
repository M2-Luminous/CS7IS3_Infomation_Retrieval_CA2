"We didn't ask UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] escort since it is not operating in this area," Peter Kessler, spokesman for the UN High Commission for Refugees said. Asked about the UN Protection Force's mandate for protecting humanitarian convoys, UNPROFOR spokesman Major Jose Labandeira said the organisation had not agreed to force the convoy's passage through blockades. "We don't want to use force. If we do it, they (the local Bosnian Serb militia) can destroy bridges and put mines on roads," Labandeira said. Kessler said that the last UNHCR convoy which tried to get into Maglaj on October 26 was given a UN military escort. Two of the convoy's driver's were killed in the action. Maglaj, which has a majority-Moslem population, has been under seige by Serb forces since last June. UNHCR has supplied Maglaj by airdrops, some of which fell onto Serb lines, Kessler said.
