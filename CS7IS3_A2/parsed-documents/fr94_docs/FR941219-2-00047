OMB Number: 3060&hyph;0595. Title: Updating Maximum Permitted Rates for Regulated Cable Services ``Update Form''. Form Number: FCC Form 1210. Action: Revision of a currently approved collection. Respondents: State, local governments and businesses or other for-profit. Frequency of Response: On occasion reporting requirement. Estimated Annual Burden: 33,600 responses, 11 hours average burden per response, 69,600 hours total annual burden. Needs and Uses: On 2/22/94, the Commission adopted a Second Order on Reconsideration, Fourth Report and Order, and Fifth Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in MM Docket No. 92&hyph;266, Implementation of Sections of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, Rate Regulation. Using a more sophisticated economic model, we have recalculated the competitive differential to reflect a more accurate estimate of the difference between competitive and noncompetitive cable rates. In addition, we have improved the measure of equipment and installation revenues. On 11/10/94, the Commission adopted a Sixth Order on Reconsideration, Fifth Report and Order, and Seventh Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, referred to as the ``Going Forward'' order. This Order further revised its rules for rate adjustments when channels are added or deleted, or new programming service tier channels are added or deleted, or new programming service tiers are established. To reflect the new rule sections adopted by the Commission, Section 76.922(e)(1) and (2), we are expanding the Instructions for FCC Form 1210, to enable cable operators to implement the revised methodology reflected in these rules. It is anticipated that these additional instructions will be used on an interim basis between January 1, 1995 and March 31, 1995, for operators who choose to use the new methodology. A revised version of the FCC Form 1210 that is being submitted to OMB for approval will become effective April 1, 1995. Federal Communications Commission. William F. Caton, Acting Secretary.
