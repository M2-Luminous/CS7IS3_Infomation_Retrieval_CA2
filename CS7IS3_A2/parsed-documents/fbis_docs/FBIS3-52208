In his first sermon, Amini speaks on the various aspects of Shi'ite leadership and the source of emulation, including the meaning of religious judgment, the need for religious leaders, and conditions for the post. He says that there are hundreds of capable individuals at theological schools who could be sources of emulation, but have failed to do so because they are more interested in teaching.
