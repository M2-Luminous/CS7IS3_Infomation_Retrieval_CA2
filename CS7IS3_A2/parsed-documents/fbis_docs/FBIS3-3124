A few other topics were also discussed at today's meeting. The State Council submitted the draft budget law to the NPC Standing Committee in October 1993 for examination. Based on the examination opinions of members of NPC special committees and of its Standing Committee, the State Council made another revision to the draft law. Entrusted by the State Council, Liu Zhongli gave an explanation at the meeting concerning some major issues in the draft law. Liu Zhongli said: Over the years, because China has not had legal stipulations governing budgetary management, there have been many problems in the preparation, examination, approval, implementation, adjustment, final settlement, and supervision of budget. For instance, the procedures for budget preparation have not been clearly set out, the authority and responsibility of budgetary management have not been clearly defined, examination and approval of budgets have not been strictly carried out, budgets have not been faithfully implemented, and supervision over budget implementation has not been effective, resulting in the budget's lack of legal effectiveness. The 14th CPC National Congress laid down the goal of establishing a socialist market economic system, stressing the need to give full play to the financial work's macroeconomic regulation and control role in establishing a socialist market economic system and in refining it. In this situation, it has become a pressing need to quicken the pace of financial reform to improve the state's macroeconomic management. At the same time, we also urgently need to clearly define in legal terms the budget management authority of organs of power, government organs, and finance departments at all levels, as well as of all departments and units; and to improve management and strengthen supervision over the preparation, examination, approval, and implementation of budget, in order to ensure healthy economic and social development. Therefore, enacting the Budget Law is very necessary. Liu Zhongli also gave an explanation on the guiding thought for enacting the Budget Law and on some major issues in the draft Budget Law. Entrusted by the NPC Standing Committee, Xue Ju, chairman of the NPC Law Committee, made an explanation on the "NPC Decision on Authorizing the Xiamen City People's Congress, Its Standing Committee, and the Xiamen City People's Government To Separately Enact Laws and Regulations for Implementation in the Xiamen Special Economic Zone (Draft)." Xue Ju said: The Xiamen Special Economic Zone [SEZ] is one of the country's earliest SEZ's, as well as a SEZ with the State Council's approval to implement some free port policies and to carry out comprehensive reform of the urban economic system. Considering the Xiamen SEZ's development needs, the NPC Law Committee suggests that the NPC Standing Committee table a motion to the Second Session of the Eighth NPC to authorize the Xiamen City People's Congress and its Standing Committee, taking into consideration the SEZ's reality and needs, based on the Constitution, and according to the basic principle of established laws and administrative regulations, to enact laws and regulations for implementation in the Xiamen SEZ; and to submit the enacted laws and regulations to the NPC Standing Committee, the State Council, and the Fujian Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee for the record. It is also suggested that the Second Session of the Eighth NPC authorize the Xiamen city people's government to enact related regulations for implementation in the Xiamen SEZ. Entrusted by the Eighth NPC Standing Committee, Vice Chairman Tian Jiyun delivered a report on the NPC Standing Committee's work over the past year and the main tasks for the coming year. In the report, Tian Jiyun said: In the past year, the Standing Committee conscientiously carried out the various duties prescribed in the Constitution, strengthened economic legislation, improved supervisory systems, promoted reform and development, and safeguarded socialist stability, thereby making headway in all fields: 1. giving economic legislation top priority and scoring notable achievements in legislative work; 2. striving to improve and strengthen supervision and further perfecting supervisory mechanisms; 3. earnestly handling motions and suggestions of deputies and forging close ties with the masses; 4. actively developing exchanges with foreign parliaments and creating a favorable international environment for China's reform, opening up, and modernization drive; and 5. intensifying efforts to build up its organizations and bringing into play the role of its special committees. Tian Jiyun pointed out: We must be aware of the shortcomings and defects in our work. They are reflected mainly in the incompatibility of legislative work with the needs of reform, opening up, and economic expansion; in the weak links in supervisory work, especially inadequate inspection and supervision over law enforcement; and in the organizational construction of the Standing Committee, which still cannot meet the requirements under the new situation. To this end, Tian Jiyun called for efforts in the work of four areas: continuing to give economic legislation top priority so as to establish a legal system that conforms with a socialist market economy; paying close attention to the inspection and supervision of law enforcement to facilitate the implementation of various reform programs; enhancing the awareness of law in all of society to create a sound legal environment for reform and construction; and intensifying the Standing Committee's organizational construction and training a strong contingent of NPC cadres. At the plenary meeting, Ren Jianxin, president of the Supreme People's Court, and Zhang Siqing, procurator general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, also delivered reports on the work of the court and the procuratorate. Ren Jianxin discussed the following aspects of the court's work last year: persistently cracking down on crimes to safeguard social stability; severely punishing serious economic crimes to facilitate the deepening of the anticorruption drive; using judicial means to regulate economic relations and promote the development of a market economy; conducting trials to protect the lawful rights and interests of citizens and corporations; and strictly enforcing laws and stepping up efforts to improve the quality of court personnel. Ren Jianxin said: In 1994, the guiding ideology for the work of courts throughout the country is to be guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line; to earnestly implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; and to adhere to the principle of "grasping two links at the same time" in strictly enforcing laws, striving to improve judicial quality, and reforming and perfecting the judicial system so as to provide a strong judicial guarantee for maintaining social stability, for accelerating the establishment of a socialist market economic structure, and for maintaining a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the economy. Discussing the overall procuratorial work in 1993, Zhang Siqing said: In the past year, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, in the light of the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress and the First Session of the Eighth NPC, carried out various procuratorial activities in line with the principle of "strictly enforcing laws and relentlessly handling criminal cases." People's procuratorates throughout the country and military, railway, and other special tribunals reinforced their legal supervision function. They devoted a lot of effort to handling major embezzlement and bribery cases, severely dealing with criminal cases, and cases involving infringement of people's democratic rights and dereliction of duty were also handled, thereby making positive contributions to maintaining national and social stability, and safeguarding the establishment of a socialist market economic structure and the smooth progress of modernization construction. Zhang Siqing said: The main tasks of the procuratorial work at the present and for some time to come are: persisting in taking Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the guide, implementing the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, adhering to the principle of "grasping two links at the same time," strengthening supervision over law enforcement, strictly enforcing law and relentlessly handling criminal cases, concentrating efforts on investigating and handling major and serious cases of embezzlement and bribery, cracking down on serious criminal offenses, safeguarding state interests from being infringed upon, protecting lawful rights of citizens and corporations, and ensuring political and social stability, so as to create a sound legal environment for reform, opening up, and modernization and to facilitate the establishment and development of a socialist market economic structure. The meeting voted to approve a decision to accept Yang Yanyin's request to resign as a member of the NPC Standing Committee, as well as the election procedures for the Second Session of the Eighth NPC. According to the election procedures, the number of candidates for additional members of the NPC Standing Committee to be elected will be the same as that to be elected; and they shall be elected through secret ballots.
