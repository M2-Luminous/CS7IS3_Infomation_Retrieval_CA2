Cuban diplomatic sources denied Canada had expelled Adolfo Martin and Orlando Brito, two officials of the Cuban Consulate in Montreal, as Cuban dissidents Pedro Martori and Antonio Tang reported in Montreal. Martori and Tang, who represent Miami-based radical dissident groups told the Canadian media that Canada had expelled Consul Martin and Vice Consul Brito. Cuban Ambassador in Havana Carlos Castillo told NOTIMEX diplomats from any country are subject to rotation and Martin and Brito had completed their assignments a few weeks ago. A Cuban diplomatic source concurred with the Canadian Attorney General's Office in explaining that Martin and Brito had been living in Montreal for years, and "their term had to end someday." Political sources told NOTIMEX the report on the expulsion "is related to the expansion of economic relations between Canada and Cuba," and, in particular, to the investments Canadian mining and hotel companies and other sectors are making in the Caribbean island. Cuban solidarity groups stated the Cuban exiles in Canada, linked to radical groups in the United States, are "upset" over the Havana initiative of beginning this month a dialogue with sectors of the Cuban exile community. "Alpha 66" -- a Miami-based dissident group -- "continues to issue communiques, stating it will attack Canadian tourists who go to Cuba. It is a sign of their powerlessness regarding the dialogue" between Havana and the Miami community, a Cuban source affirmed. Canadian Government circles, which supported the idea of a dialogue between Havana and the exiled community, admit Cuban opposition groups are "very resentful" of the good relations that exist between Canadian businesses and Cuba. The expulsion story was a recent reaction by radical Cuban exiles aimed at adversely affecting business contacts between Cuba and Canada. In April 1993, Tang and Florencio Aspillaga Lombard -- another Cuban exile living in Miami -- told DIARIO LAS AMERICAS of Miami that Ottawa had suspended the firm Rapitel Communications S.I.'s permission to operate in Cuba. The statement made by Tang and Aspillaga Lombard about this company, which sells telephone communications service with Cuba, also turned out to be false. Canadian analysts said the report was aimed at eliminating telephone service between Canada and Cuba, which serves as a bridge for numerous Cubans living in the United States. According to the sources that were consulted, another reason for the "charge" made by Martori and Tang was a result of the support given in Canada to the "Cuban friendship caravan," an initiative to send humanitarian aid to the island. The caravan left various Canadian cities on 20 February destined for Mexico from where caravan members will sail to Cuba. The caravan will pass through various U.S. cities and will join the efforts made by the "Pastors for Peace," who for the third consecutive year will send humanitarian aid to Cuba and will confront the economic blockade imposed on Cuba by Washington three decades ago.
