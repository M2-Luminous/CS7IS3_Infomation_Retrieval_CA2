Foreign Ministry Spokesman Shen Guofang made this remark on Thursday [14 April] in Beijing during the ministry's weekly press conference. Li Peichun was there: [Begin recording] [Li Peichun] Spokesman Shen Guofang's remarks came just after the Chinese and American trade negotiators reportedly encountered difficulty in their talks on China's re-entry into GATT in Morocco. Although the specific difficulty has yet to emerge, the Chinese representative has reiterated that trade should not be mixed up with social issues. Meanwhile, U.S. trade negotiator Mickey Kantor said that China has to make more efforts before it is accepted by the multilateral trade agreement. [Shen Guofang in Chinese] The U.S. Government has promised on several ocassions its firm support for China's re-entry into GATT, we hope that... [fades into Li Peichun's comments] [Li Peichun] The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said Beijing has noticed the importance of the U.S. in GATT, but he has stressed that the U.S. is merely one of the 105 contracting countries and should not be equated to the international body itself. Shen Guofang said the U.S. Government has repeated its promise to support China's re-entry, and it should make real efforts to materialize its commitments. China's re-entry is one of the main issues of the GATT ministerial meeting in Morocco. On another subject, spokesman Shen Guofang criticized a report published on Wednesday by the House of Commons on London's ties with Beijing. Shen Guofang said the part concerning the Hong Kong issue disregards facts and defends Governor Chris Patten's erroneous approach to his political reform. Commenting on London's desire to hold talks with China on human rights, which is expressed in the same report, Shen Guofang said that Beijing is willing to talk with any country, but on the basis of equality and mutual respect. Finally, the Foreign Ministry spokesman said China hopes that relations along the Taiwan Straits will not be adversely affected by the Qiandao Lake case, in which 24 Taiwan tourists died in Zhejiang last month. Reacting to Taiwan's suspension of various exchanges with the mainland, Shen Guofang said closer links along the Taiwan Straits are in the interest of all Chinese. He added Beijing will listen to proposals from Taiwan in handling the case. For China Radio International, I am Li Peichuan. [end recording]
