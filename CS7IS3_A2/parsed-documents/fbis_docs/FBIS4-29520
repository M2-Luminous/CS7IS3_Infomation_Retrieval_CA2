The proposal, contained in a message from South Korean Deputy Premier Yi Yong-tok to his North Korean counterpart Kang Song-san, said that a three-member delegation from each side led by a deputy premier-level official should meet at the truce village of Panmunjom at 10 A.M. The decision to propose the contact was made at a unification-related ministers' meeting held early Saturday morning chaired by Deputy Premier Yi. "Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who recently visited your side, has relayed to us that your top leader proposed holding a South-North summit in the near future without any conditions," Yi said in his message to Pyongyang. "I was authorized to let you know that we agree to the proposal as it is the most ideal event considering the inward and outward conditions of our country and the fervent wish of our people," he said. The burden on both South and North Koreans has been getting heavier over the past half-century because of distrust and confrontation, Yi said in the message. "We have been saying that a meeting of the top leaders is favorable if it would quickly dissolve the South-North tension aroused by the nuclear problem and settle a relationship of reconciliation and cooperation by opening the door to peaceful reunification of our country," Yi said. Unification Minister Yi Hong-ku, meeting reporters after the inter-Korean contact proposal was made, said there is no reason to delay the summit because "the sooner, the better." He explained that Seoul made the proposal based on its position that denuclearization of the Korean peninsula must be realized, peacefully, through negotiation. "It's the government's stance that results should be produced in the near future so that this preparatory contact would not drag on or pose problems in procedure and agenda-setting as in past contacts," he said. The proposed meeting on June 28 is not designed to discuss exchanging special envoys but to prepare for a summit, the unification minister said. "It will be a working-level contact to decide on the time and location soon so that the summit can take place."
