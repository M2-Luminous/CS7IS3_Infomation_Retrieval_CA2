Saiget] [Text] Beijing, Feb. 10 KYODO -- China's environment is seriously threatened and a system of law and enforcement is urgently needed to prevent pollution and protect natural resources, the chief of the country's environmental watchdog has warned. Qu Geping, chairman of the environmental protection committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), made the call in a speech given at a closed meeting of an NPC conference on the environment last December 15 and only recently made available. Qu methodically laid out the serious problems of growing pollution emissions and overexploitation of natural resources as China's economy develops. Air pollution is steadily increasing in China's 500 major cities, as smoke and dust emissions have grown at an average annual rate of 7.6 percent and sulfur dioxide emissions increase by 3.5 percent, making several cities "invisible to satellites," Qu said. Although industrial emissions may be controlled by 2000, he said, sulfur dioxide emissions, the leading cause of acid rain, will rise from 16 million tons per year now to up to 23 million tons in 2000. Such increases will come as China's annual coal consumption grows from the present 1.2 billion tons to a projected 1.6 billion tons early next century when experts predict China will be the largest single producer of both carbon dioxide, the leading cause of global warming, and sulfur dioxide. Qu said China presently produces 100 million tons of wastewater a day, leaving several rivers "in a state of crisis." By 2000 China will produce between 30-32 billion tons of industrial wastewater annually and 17 billion tons of organic wastewater, he said. During the 1980s, acid rain was limited to the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou and Sichuan, but now has appeared in Jiangxi, Fujian and Shandong, and if not controlled will greatly harm the agricultural, livestock and fishing industries, he said. Nearly six billion tons of solid wastes cover an area of more than 50,000 hectares around China and by 2000, industrial solid wastes will grow from the present 180 million tons a year to 250 million tons annually, Qu said. Qu also described an increasingly unbalanced ecological situation which includes diminishing forest cover, soil erosion due to excessive mining and road-building and an average loss of some 2,100 square kilometers of arable land per year to desertification. Water sources are also diminishing faster than they can be replaced as more than 300 of China's 500 large cities are short of water, with more than 40 seriously lacking water, he said. China's per capita arable land is two-fifths the size of the world average and is shrinking due to mining, road construction and economic development, as well as the hazards of increase chemical use in fertilizers, he said. As much as 10 million hectares of arable land are affected by pollution, which Qu said costs up to 12 billion kilograms of grain in economic losses a year. Uncontrolled mining, low rates of mineral recovery at existing mines and low utilization ratios were quickly depleting resource reserves that, using China's present day technology, are readily exploitable. The unusually frank speech, while stressing the interrelation between ecological imbalances and economic development, called for the perfection of China's legislative system and authoritative laws capable of enforcing environmental legislation.
