At the meeting, Wang Hanmin relayed the instructions of the national economic work meeting. Tian Chengping made a speech on how to make a success of this year's economic work. In his speech, Governor Tian Chengping pointed out: Last year Qinghai basically maintained speedy and healthy economic development. The province's GNP and gross industrial and agricultural output value topped 10 billion yuan. In line with the policy of high quality, high yield, and high efficiency in agriculture, we adjusted its internal composition and gained good results. In industrial production, we freed ourselves from old practices and materialized speedy and healthy development. Investment in fixed assets and local revenue increased. All these have provided favorable conditions for this year's economic work. Governor Tian Chengping continued: There are still many problems and difficulties in the province's economic work and these are restricting the province's normal economic operation. Therefore, in this new year, we must correctly seize the opportunity, take advantage of our favorable conditions, overcome our difficulties, and promote the province's economic work. Governor Tian Chengping raised the following ideas for this year's economic work: Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, we will comprehensively implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and seize the favorable opportunity to increase the momentum of reform and opening up and to expedite development. On the basis of optimizing structure, improving quality, and producing better economic results, we will maintain the sustained, speedy, and healthy development of the national economy. According to this guiding principle, Governor Tian Chengping requested all localities and departments to expedite the establishment of the socialist market economic structure in this new year and to further widen the scope of opening up to the rest of the country and the world. He said: This year is a crucial year for making overall progress and breaking through focal points in economic structural reform. There is a need to actively carry out enterprise reform in light of the province's specific conditions, to conscientiously implement the state's macrocontrol and regulatory measures, to further strengthen the position of agriculture and animal husbandry as the foundation, to develop the rural economy, to increase investments in resource exploitation, and to expedite the development of energy and raw materials industries.
