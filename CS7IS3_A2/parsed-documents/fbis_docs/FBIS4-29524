Security Council Monday of its decision to propose a contact with North Korea for an inter-Korean summit. Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho said the notices were sent to Japan, the United States, the permanent members of the Security Council and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) right after the morning's unification-related ministers' meeting decided in favor of the proposal. Chang again welcomed the agreement on a South-North summit, saying that it moves forward inter-Korean relations in dealing with the nuclear problem. "The significance lies in the fact that the South Korean Government will secure a role," said the spokesman. He predicted that the talks leading up to the inter-Korean summit will progress in pace with the third round of high-level dialogue between Pyongyang and Washington, adding that North Korea's intentions must still be confirmed beforehand. If it comes off, the summit will serve to revive the activities of various inter-Korean committees, including the joint Nuclear Control Commission to implement simultaneous nuclear inspections between the two sides. "Inter-Korean dialogue will progress in a mutually complementary fashion with North Korea-U.S., North Korea-IAEA dialogue," Chang said. "South Korea and the United States will keep in close consultation."
