About 2,000 residents started from Chater Garden and marched to the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY to lodge a protest and urge the Chinese authorities to release MING PAO reporter Xi Yang. This was the largest protest since the sentencing of Xi Yang. The demonstrators first held a brief gathering in Chater Garden and set off at 1530. About 2,000 demonstrators, holding a dozen or so streamers and a large number of placards, chanted slogans like "Release Xi Yang," "Release Tian Ye," "Defend Press Freedom," and "Oppose Black Box Operations" along the way. With representatives of organizations and legislative councillors holding a large black steamer at the front of the procession, they set off from Chater Garden and marched to the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY in Happy Valley through Queensway, Hennessy Road, and Percival Street. The demonstrators included MING PAO staff members and workers, people from other press agencies, three-tier councillors, mass organization members, and residents. Along the way they chanted slogans and sang songs, including "We Shall Overcome" and "Unity," while at the same time distributing leaflets and asking onlookers to join. While they were marching, a large number of pedestrians stopped to watch and people in residential buildings stuck their heads out to look. Some pedestrians joined the demonstration to express their support. The police made special traffic arrangements along the way so that the demonstrators could pass through. The demonstrators sat down on the opposite side of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY on Queen's Road East, where they held a gathering, during which four speakers spoke. Subsequently, a member of the joint action read out a statement. In the statement, the "Joint Action To Rescue Xi Yang" demanded that the Chinese authorities immediately rescind all the charges against Xi Yang and Tian Ye and release them; it should announce all the details of the case and affix the responsibility for this; it should revise the relevant law and practice freedom of the press. In her speech at the gathering, Li Yuet-wah, chairman of the Hong Kong Journalists' Association, said: As the 1997 power transfer is approaching, Hong Kong reporters will face heavier pressure and this is something to be expected, but unexpectedly, these reporters will have to carry out 12 years of combat for Xi Yang's sake. She continued: The Xi Yang case has sounded the alarm for the prospects of Hong Kong's press freedom, but as long as Hong Kong residents and reporters work with one heart and one mind, there will still be hope for Hong Kong's press freedom. MING PAO employees' representative Lam Man-chong said: The Xi Yang case is not an unfortunate matter for Xi Yang alone, nor is it only a concern of MING PAO employees, it is an important matter of how to maintain Hong Kong people's free lifestyle. Legislative Councillor Szeto Wah and Lau Shan-ching, a pro- democracy activist who had been jailed for 10 years by China, also said at the gathering that China's secret trial of Xi Yang violated Chinese law, was unfair to Xi Yang, and affected Hong Kong's press freedom. After the reading of the statement, more than a dozen mass representatives marched to gate of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY amid slogans and songs, and stuck the statement and a streamer on the gate. The gathering ended at 1800 and the 2,000 demonstrators peacefully dispersed. Yeung Ying-wai, assistant police commander of the Wanchai District, indicated that the police had sent about 180 policemen to the scene to help open a route for the demonstrators, adding that the demonstration proceeded in good order. The "Joint Action To Rescue Xi Yang" will hold a candle-lit night party in the Clock Tower square in Tsim Sha Tsui this coming Saturday for Xi Yang's release.
