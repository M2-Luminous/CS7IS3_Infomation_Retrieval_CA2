"Negotiations are under way between the two countries," Hong said. "As to the size and time of deployment, decisions will be made after further consultations." South Korea will not be purchasing the Patriots, the vice foreign minister said, the anti-missile defense system will be part of the weaponry deployed by the U.S. Forces in Korea at their bases here. Though officials deny it, the decision is likely to negatively affect the stalemated nuclear negotiations with North Korea. "The threat of North Korean missiles is very real," Hong said. "We hope that the deployment (of Patriot missiles) will enhance South Korea-U.S. defense capability." The idea of importing the Patriot system has been on the table ever since its celebrated success against Iraqi Scud missiles during Desert Storm, but some military experts are questioning its accuracy and effectiveness, insisting that the defensive missiles are already outmoded. North Korea is believed to have upgraded the Soviet Scud in its Nodong-1 missile, making it nuclear-capable with a 1,000 km range. The stalinist state sent shudders through South Korea and Japan when it successfully test-fired a Nodong missile last summer. Hong said the negotiations will be handled by the defense ministries of the two countries.
