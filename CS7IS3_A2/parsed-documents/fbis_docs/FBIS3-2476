The fourth lecture, entitled: "Separated Financial and Taxation System," is given by Vice Minister of Finance Xiang Huaicheng. Xiang Huaicheng begins by noting that according to a State Council's decision, the tax assignment system -- a new system for financial management -- came into force beginning 1 January. Xiang says this marks an important reform in China's financial and taxation system, and goes on to explain: 1. The background and significance of conducting reform of the tax assignment system: Since the founding of New China, the state has basically practiced unified state control over revenue and expenditure; the financial management system has been reformed many times since the reform and opening up policy was adopted; and finally, various forms of contracted financial responsibility systems have been adopted in various localities. However, as the market gradually plays a bigger role in distributing resources, the shortcomings of this system are becoming more apparent. Therefore, based on Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee decided to establish a socialist market economy and strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control; to achieve this goal, the tax assignment system has been introduced. Xiang defines the tax assignment system as "a financial management measure for assigning various categories of taxes into central and local revenue as based on the division of power between central and local authorities." According to this principle, all categories of taxes are put under three main taxes: Central tax, central-local sharing tax, and local tax. "While dividing power and assigning taxes," Xiang stresses: "It is also necessary to establish separate central and local taxation organs and systems." Having described the basic framework of the tax assignment system, Xiang states some advantages of the system, mainly: Rationalizing the distribution relations between the central and local authorities, gradually increasing central government's revenues, and gradually establishing a unified market around the country. 2. The specific contents in the reform of tax assignment system: To start with the reform, the power between central and local authorities must be divided clearly first, then comes the division of taxes. Xiang says the general principles for dividing taxes are, as clarified in the "Decision" adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee: "The categories of taxes required for safeguarding national rights and interests, and the exercise of macroeconomic regulation and control are assigned as central taxes; the main categories of taxes directly related to economic development are assigned as sharing taxes; and categories of taxes that can be properly collected and managed by local authorities and are conducive to inspiring the enthusiasm of local authorities are assigned as local taxes." Xiang then goes on to explain why value-added tax, stamp tax (imposing on stock transactions), and resource tax are assigned as sharing taxes. As a result of the reform, the proportion of the national revenue taken by the central authorities has risen from 38.6 percent to about 57 percent as a whole. However, Xiang says this does not mean that the central authorities have greatly increased their tax income or transferred their financial deficits to local authorities, because, he explains: "One of the principles for this reform is to maintain local authorities' vested financial resources." In compliance with this principle, the central fiscal organ will first collect sharing taxes, and then return and transfer the part belonging to local authorities every year. Xiang stresses: "A very distinct Chinese characteristic in this practice is that the central authorities do not instruct how to use the funds returned; the local governments have full rights to decide how they should be used." Having expounded the principles for this reform, Xiang immediately explains why the central authorities must take nearly 60 percent of national revenue, why the tax assignment system affects localities only slightly, and why the central fiscal organ does not greatly increase its revenue income through this reform (because of the aforementioned practice of returning funds to localities). 3. Key features in tax assignment system reform: Xiang sums up the basic features of this reform as "a mild and step-by-step reform" and gives some facts to support this point; for example, the original distribution setup remains unchanged temporarily, the central government takes more only from the increased amount in the value-added tax, and local interests are taken care of. 4. Some problems to be attended to in the course of reform: To effectively carry out tax assignment system reform, Xiang calls for implementing other supporting reforms properly, namely the reform of business tax system and reform in the distribution of profits between the state and state-owned enterprises. He says it is also important that reforms in other systems (investment system, enterprise management system, foreign trade system, financial and foreign exchange system), which are launched together with this reform, be carried out properly, because they are closely correlated. At 0715 GMT Xiang concludes: The most important matter is: "We must unify our thinking and action in carrying out all reforms, including tax assignment system reform." Xiang stresses the need to help cadres and people understand the contents of these reforms, and relations among reform, development, and stability, so as to gain their support.
