Patricial Serrano filed this report: [Serrano] Five EZLN members were killed during three clashes in Comitan Municipality, Chiapas States. The incidents occurred when EZLN members trespassed on the ranchers' properties to rustle cattle. The ranchers reacted immediately to save their property and the lives of their families. Upon being informed of these events, Subcommander Marcos confirmed from an undisclosed location in Lacandon jungle that indeed two [number as heard] EZLN supporters were killed in clashes with ranchers. Meanwhile in San Cristobal de las Casas, the EZLN demanded the release of 21 civilians from El Cerezo de Cerro Hueco Prison who were arrested on suspicion of being EZLN members. From that place, Subcommander Marcos also said that keeping these innocent individuals in jail is an obstacle to peace talks with the federal government. Marcos stated that the indiscriminate arrest of civilians on unfounded charges that they are members of the EZLN is an arbitrary action. Ceremonies, parades, marches, and festivities were held in Chiapas on Sunday to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the death of revolutionary leader Emiliano Zapata.
