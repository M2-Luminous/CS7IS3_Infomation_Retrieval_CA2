Speaking at a meeting with the New Hong Kong Alliance yesterday, visiting Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office (HKMAO), Wang Fengchao, said the civil servants should not be afraid of revealing their British citizenship. The chairman of the Hong Kong Civil Servants' Association, Peter Wong Hyo, last night welcomed the clarification. He said it was a good thing for the Chinese Government to clear the doubts of civil servants. "The Chinese Government will not discriminate against civil servants who have obtained British citizenship through the British Nationality Scheme," Mr Wang was quoted by Pao Ping-wing, of the Alliance, as saying. Yesterday's assurance cleared up fears about China's attitude towards the nationality scheme, which was introduced to tackle the confidence crisis following the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989. It grants full British citizenship to 25,000 families in phases. China's refusal to recognise the scheme has created uncertainty over whether civil servants who obtained the right of abode in Britain would be victimised. Mr Wang said: "Holders of the citizenship have no reason to worry about the exposure of their status." The nationality factor would only carry weight in the promotion of civil servants to secretary and deputy secretary levels, he added. Article 101 of the Basic Law stipulates that government posts at the rank of policy secretaries and deputy secretaries should be held by Chinese citizens with no right of abode in other countries.
