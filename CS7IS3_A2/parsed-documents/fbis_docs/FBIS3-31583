Coposu said that, generally speaking, Romania enjoys the sympathy of the West, but there is also some reticence, which Coposu termed as a tendency to set up a left-wing government and reestablish communism in Romania. As a consequence of this, Coposu stressed that the West might reconsider its position regarding Romania's final acceptance as a full member of the Council of Europe. Coposu also said that during his tour, he paid a visit to Versoix [Switzerland, residence of Romanian King], where he met with the former sovereign of Romania, after which he emphasized that the king does not intend to apply for an entry visa for Easter or 10 May [Romania's national day during the monarchy], although he did express his wish to visit Romania as soon as possible, reports our correspondent Iulia Gherman.
