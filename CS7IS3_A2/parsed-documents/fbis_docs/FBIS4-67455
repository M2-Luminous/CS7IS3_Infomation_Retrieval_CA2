It follows from this that our country, with all its antediluvean industry and its smoking transportation is doing its best to save mankind from the greenhouse effect. These unexpected results that were achieved after prolonged experiments and miscalculations, are apparently capable of giving trumps not only to our industrialists in the fight against the "Greens," but also to the politicians who are discussing ecological problems on an international level. Sergey Kurayev, chief of the Climatic Programs Department of Rosgidromet [Russian Hydrometeorological Service], states: "The chief contribution to the global warming of the climate is made by carbon dioxide. It is not by accident that the developed countries have pledged to stabilize emissions of this gas. The United States, for example, `blow' into the atmosphere 22 percent of the worldwide emissions of carbon dioxide, which is more than Russia (11 percent) and China (10 percent) combined. But, in our opinion, the crux of the matter is not how much you emit, but, rather, how much you take back. Currently at the negotiations dealing with the convention, a question that is being raised sharply is whether one should employ the balance-sheet approach: to require a country to report on the difference between emission and absorption. Otherwise, in accordance with the currently accepted methodology for making computations, the largest polluter of the earth's atmosphere is Luxembourg: the country is minuscule, there are no forests, but there are a tremendous number of motor vehicles." As became known recently, 4.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide "goes into the sky" annually from the territory of Russia, and 4.62 billion tons is absorbed. The total result is that 420 million tons of carbon dioxide is absorbed annually by our forests. (Although there are other opinions on this score.) The most interesting thing is that there are few people who can venture a guess about our negative balance with regard to carbon dioxide. In any case. when I mentioned this at a recent meeting with officials from the German Ministry of Ecology, the Germans' eyes bulged out. I shall quote a few lines from a report written by RF Academy of Sciences academician Zavarzin: "The obtained results definitely indicate the role played by Russia and other countries in the humid zone of the Northern Hemisphere as being the Earth's lungs. Contrary to the generally accepted opinion, the countries in the tropic zone are not absorbers of carbon dioxide on a world scale."
