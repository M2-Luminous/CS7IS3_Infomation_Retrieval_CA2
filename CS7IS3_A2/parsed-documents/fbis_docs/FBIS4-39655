The Negotiations Are Ahead"] [Text] When the meeting between the delegations of the Crimean and Ukrainian Supreme Councils started, observers were convinced that representatives of the Crimean Parliament were fundamentally not ready to cooperate. According to one of the members of the Ukrainian delegation, the Crimeans saw nothing but military stratagem in all proposals on the part of the Kievans. This is not surprising though, since, among the participants in the negotiations on the Crimean side, only N. Bekyrov, a member of the Majlis, was not a military man, while the rest were colonels and lieutenant colonels, both in the active army service and retired. Notwithstanding that, following lengthy and difficult discussions that ended late in the evening on 3 June, the Kiev and Simferopol leaders reached an agreement and adopted a summing up document in which the sides "reached an understanding of the fact that the Constitution of the Crimean Republic adopted on 6 May 1992 contains some clauses, which do not conform to Ukrainian legislation, in particular, on the definition of the status of the Crimean Republic as an autonomous constituent part of Ukraine." In order to resolve the constitutional and legislative collision that had taken shape, the delegations favored the creation of a joint working group, which would, by 15 June, "advance proposals for coordinating the Constitution and legislation of the Crimean Republic with the Ukrainian Constitution." Both delegations appealed to President L. Kravchuk and called upon him not to introduce, until 15 June, the mechanism provided for by the corresponding Ukraine's Supreme Council decree and to Crimean President Yu. Meshkov and the local parliament not to take measures that might disrupt interaction between the state power bodies of Ukraine and the Crimea. Just like in Simferopol, the negotiations in Sevastopol were also difficult. Russian and Ukrainian groups of experts on the Black Sea Fleet met there. However, certain progress was achieved there, too. According to Commander of Ukraine's Naval Forces Vice Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, experts managed to specify the list of the Black Sea Fleet ships and vessels that will be allocated to each side after the division, even though the Russian representatives insisted that those ships and vessels that were given to Ukraine in 1991 as sailing means for military schools and had never been a part of the Black Sea Fleet be included in the general list. However, this problem could also be settled. The negotiations on the problems of dividing the Black Sea Fleet will continue at a higher level in Kiev on 8-9 June.
