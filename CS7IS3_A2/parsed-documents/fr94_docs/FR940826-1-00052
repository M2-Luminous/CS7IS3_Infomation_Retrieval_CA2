FR940826-1-00052 FR940826-1-00008 (g) An exception request is deemed approved unless it is disapproved within 60 working days after it is filed with its intermediary. (h) In determining the facility's payment rate under the exception process, HCFA excludes all costs that are not reasonable or allowable under the reasonable cost principles set forth in this part. (i) Except for exceptions approved under §413.182(c), a prospective exception payment rate approved by HCFA applies for the period from the date the complete exception request was filed with its intermediary until the earlier of the_ (1) Date the circumstances justifying the exception rate no longer exist; or (2) End of the period during which the announced rate was to apply. (j) A prospective exception payment rate approved by HCFA under §§413.182(c) and 413.188 applies from the date of the extraordinary event until the end of the period during which the prospective announced rate was to apply, unless HCFA determines that another date is more appropriate. If HCFA does not extend the exception period and the facility believes that it continues to require an exception to its rate, the facility must reapply in accordance with the procedures in this section. (k) HCFA denies exception requests submitted without the documentation specified in §413.182 and the applicable cross-references. (l) Facilities that have been denied exception requests during the 180 days may file a subsequent exception request if all required documentation is filed with the intermediary by the 180th day. 12. A new §413.182 is added to read as follows: §413.182 Criteria for approval of exception requests. HCFA may approve exceptions to an ESRD facility's prospective payment rate if the facility demonstrates by convincing objective evidence that its total per treatment costs are reasonable and allowable under the relevant cost reimbursement principles or this part 413 and that its per treatment costs in excess of its payment rate are directly attributable to any of the following criteria: (a) Atypical service intensity (patient mix), as specified in §413.184. (b) Isolated essential facility, as specified in §413.186. (c) Extraordinary circumstances, as specified in §413.188. (d) Self-dialysis training costs, as specified in §413.190. (e) Frequency of dialysis, as specified in §413.192. 13. A new §413.184 is added to read as follows: §413.184 Payment exception: Atypical service intensity (patient mix). (a) To qualify for an exception to the prospective payment rate based on atypical service intensity (patient mix)_ (1) A facility must demonstrate that a substantial proportion of the facility's outpatient maintenance dialysis treatments involve atypically intense dialysis services, special dialysis procedures, or supplies that are medically necessary to meet special medical needs of the facility's patients. Examples that may qualify under this criterion are more intense dialysis services that are medically necessary for patients such as_ (i) Patients who have been referred from other facilities on a temporary basis for more intense care during a period of medical instability and who return to the original facility after stabilization; (ii) Pediatric patients who require a significantly higher staff-to-patient ratio than typical adult patients; or
