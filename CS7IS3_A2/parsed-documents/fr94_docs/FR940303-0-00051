FR940303-0-00051 FR940303-0-00014 33 CFR Part 165 [COTP Miami 94&hyph;008] Safety Zone Regulations; North Miami Beach, FL AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Temporary final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone in the Intracoastal Waterway at Bakers Haulover Inlet Florida. This safety zone is needed to protect vessels from a safety hazard associated with severe shoaling in the channel between Biscayne Bay daybeacon 6 (light list number 41185) and Biscayne Bay light 9 (light list number 41210). Entry into this safety zone by tugs towing or pushing barges with drafts exceeding four feet, beams exceeding 16 feet, and all barges carrying oil, or hazardous material is prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port, Miami, Florida or his designated representative. EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation becomes effective on January 28, 1994 at 1 p.m. and terminates at 7 p.m. on April 11, 1994, unless sooner terminated by the Captain of the Port. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Chief Boatswains Mate Robert F. Chason, Port Operations Department, USCG Marine Safety Office Miami, Claude Pepper Federal Building, 5th Floor, 51 SW. First Avenue, Miami, Florida 33130&hyph;1608, (305) 536&hyph;5693. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this regulation and good cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days after Federal Register publication. Publishing a NPRM and delaying its effective date would be contrary to public safety interests since immediate action is needed to prevent potential damage to the public. Drafting Information The drafters of this regulation are Chief Boatswains Mate Robert F. Chason, Project Officer for the Captain of the Port, Miami, Florida, and Lieutenant J. Losego, Project Attorney, Seventh Coast Guard District Legal Office. Discussion of Regulations This safety zone is needed to protect vessels from a safety hazard associated with severe shoaling in the channel between Biscayne Bay daybeacon 6, (light list number 41185) and Biscayne Bay light 9 (light list number 41210). There have been several recent tug and barge groundings caused by the current channel conditions, and the potential for a severe marine casualty is great if unrestricted commercial vessel traffic is allowed to continue. This area of the channel is scheduled to be dredged to its published depth between February 7, 1994 and April 11, 1994. Until the channel is dredged, entry into this safety zone by tugs towing or pushing barges with drafts exceeding four feet, beams exceeding 16 feet, and all barges carrying oil, or hazardous material is prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port, Miami, Florida or his designated representative.
