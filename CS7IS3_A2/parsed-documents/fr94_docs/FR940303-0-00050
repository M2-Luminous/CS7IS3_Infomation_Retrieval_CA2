FR940303-0-00050 FR940303-0-00013 Discussions of Comments and Changes No comments were received in opposition to the proposed rulemaking. Regulatory Evaluation This temporary final rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant under the Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impacts of this rule to be so minimal that a Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary. We base our decision on the light and infrequent commercial traffic on the subject waterways during the hours affected by this rule. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.) the U.S. Coast Guard must consider whether rules will have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act. Because this final rule imposes no new requirements on small businesses and will result in partial relief from a regulatory burden on the owner or operator of these bridges, the Coast Guard does not expect this rule to have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This rulemaking contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Federalism This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that the rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.g.(5) of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, promulgation of operating requirements or procedures for drawbridges is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination has been prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket. List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 117 Bridges.
