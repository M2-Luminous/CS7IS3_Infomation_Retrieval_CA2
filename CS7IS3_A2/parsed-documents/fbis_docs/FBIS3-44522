In its wake, he met U.S. President Clinton, and visited Cuba, Brazil and Portugal. His trip was highly appreciated by the Chinese military. The Army, Navy and Air Force, all branches of the services, the Defense Ministry, all military regions, advanced military institutes and academies have sent letters and cables to salute and extend regards to Jiang Zemin. This is a rare situation in China's political life. Originally, some leading members of the military -- including some old generals -- wrote to the Central Committee to express their hope that Jiang Zemin would refrain from attending the Seattle summit on the grounds that the United States had pursued a series of incidents to oppose China and intervene in its internal affairs. These include the "Yin He" incident and the U.S. Congress' opposition to China's application for the 2000 World Olympics, as well as the false charge that China provided guided missiles for Pakistan. They said China should respond to these things and not endure the bullying of U.S. hegemony and power politics. Some even suggested de-escalation of Sino-U.S. diplomatic relations, recalling the Chinese ambassador to the United States, and so forth. Later, the CPC Political Bureau Standing Committee sought instructions from Deng Xiaoping, who stated: It is better that he should go, for he can express China's position so as to promote understanding. Thus the Standing Committee made the decision on Jiang Zemin leaving for the United States to meet President Clinton. At the same time, Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen -- the two Central Military Commission vice chairmen -- together with CPC senior statesmen Wan Li and Bo Yibo, went separately to do ideological work among the military and old generals. Facts have demonstrated the correctness of Deng Xiaoping's decision. Chi Haotian on Three Major Events On Jiang Zemin's return to Bejing, Colonel General Chi Haotian, member of the Central Military Commission and concurrently minister of defense, at an 8 December Defense Ministry report meeting, appraised Jiang Zemin's trip highly, saying: Three major events took place in our party, country and Army in November: 1) The report meeting on Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaopeng presided over by General Secretary Jiang Zemin; 2) The successful conclusion of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee, presided over by General Secretary Jiang Zemin, at which the historical document on building the socialist market economic structure was adopted; and 3) Jiang Zemin, in his capacity as state president, went to Seattle by inviation to participate in the APEC conference. During a meeting with U.S. President Clinton, he frankly [tan shuai di 0982 3764 0966] set out the Chinese Government's principle stand and views on a series of incidents, while adhering to the Chinese Government's wishes to improve bilateral relations on the basis of the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques. Zhang Zhen Says the Military Supports Jiang On 6 December, two days before Chi Haotian made his speech, Zhang Zhen attended a discussion meeting for senior coaches of the three military institutes, He dealt with the world situation and stressed Jiang Zemin's mid-November trip to Seattle. Zhang said: Our respectful Comrade Jiang Zemin, chairman of the Central Military Commission, went to Seattle on invitation to participate in the APEC conference. He held a Sino-U.S. summit with Clinton there, during which he explicitly expressed China's persistent principle stand, the hope for China and the United States to proceed toward world peace and the long-range friendly cooperation of the two countries in seeking common ground while resolving differences. He was neither haughty nor humble. Zhang added: Whether in the past, the present, or the future, China will never barter away its sovereignty and principles; the Chinese people have a deep understanding that nothing is more precious than the country's independence and initiative. History -- in which the Chinese people suffered the aggression, bullying and plundering of foreign powers -- will never be repeated. At the Sino-U.S. summit, President Jiang Zemin expressed the Chinese Government's position to the whole world, and won the support of peace-loving, independent countries throughout. The Chinese People's Liberation Army, in its entirety, is proud of and inspired by Comrade Jiang Zemin as the supreme leader of the party,state and Army. In addition, all military regions have held report meetings to express their support for Jiang Zemin's leadership.
