According to reports from various European capitals which arrived in Jerusalem recently, the talks are being held up because Britain has been impeding the talks on approving Israel's acceptance to the research and development plans. Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin is leaving this morning on a four-day visit to Britain, where he will hold discussions on promoting the Israel-EU relations and bilateral relations with Britain.
