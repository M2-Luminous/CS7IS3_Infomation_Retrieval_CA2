Sato says that the auctions carried out by the government with the objective of increasing coffee quotations abroad also increased prices in the domestic market. Sato said that the average annual quotations in dollars of green coffee beans suffered a variation of 34.56 percent in 1993 in comparison with 1992, or 28.8 percent above the IGP-M [Market Prices General Index] of the same period. The average price adjustment in dollars during 1993 was 31.69 percent. This difference, Sato said, caused a monthly loss of $8.5 million for the coffee industry. In 1993 coffee production increased only 1.4 percent in comparison with the previous year while the initial forecast was a 4.6 percent increase. The sales volume during the second half of the year remained 2.5 percent below the average sales for the period. "The sharp increase in the price of coffee, which is responsible for 45 percent of the costs of the industry, has prompted a coffee price increase above the inflation which, together with the loss of the purchasing power, caused an immediate reduction of consumption," Sato said. Consumption -- According to Abic, total consumption of roasted and ground coffee in the domestic market during 1993 was not greater than 9.3 million bags, which is equivalent to an annual consumption of 2.9 kg per capita. The Abic had expected a consumption of 9.5 million bags or 3 kg per capita. "Many coffee companies have already stopped their activities. Unless the government establishes a partnership with the coffee industry, with some mechanisms to regulate the price of the raw material, the crisis in the coffee industry will become worse during the present year," Sato said.
