The Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights in Saudi Arabia issuing a statement said that it was pursuing its mission in London for continuing its struggle until justice is established and oppression is eliminated in Saudi Arabia. The statement added that the group, which was set up by scholars and professors in May 1993, had no choice because "all means and methods of free expression and reform became impossible" and that it would be "unwise and risky to postpone undertaking the initiative." The committee called on the Saudi citizens and others eager to support the elimination of injustice to cooperate until their goals were accomplished. Repressive measures listed against the group included being banned from travelling, dismissal from work, closed down of professional practices, imprisonment, torture and threat of murder, it added. The committee's statement was signed by the official spokesman, Dr. Muhammad al-Mas'ari, who was reported to be missing in March. But the group said his disappearance after his release from prison last November was a cover to arrange his escape to Europe. Scores of the group's members, including al-Mas'ari, a physics professor from King Sa'ud University, were arrested last year, following the submission of a letter to King Fahd, demanding reforms. The statement said that the state's response, although violent, convulsive and escalatory, did not alter their determination to pursue a peace path for the just cause of justice in Saudi Arabia.
