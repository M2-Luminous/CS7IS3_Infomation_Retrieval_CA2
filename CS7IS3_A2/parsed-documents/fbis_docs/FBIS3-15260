This statement was made in an interview with Interfax on Thursday [3 March] by the special envoy of the Russian president, Vladimir Kazimirov, who leads Russia's mediatory mission for a settlement in Karabakh. On Wednesday he returned from a trip to Yerevan and Baku. According to him, his trip was designed to implement a protocol signed by the defence ministers of the conflicting sides in Moscow on February 18th. The protocol provided for ceasing fire, halting military actions and disengaging the warring sides for some distance with a view to "consolidating an end to the bloodshed". "The principal task was to secure a ceasefire at midnight on March 1st. That task was accomplished," Kazimirov said. According to him, the only guarantee for the ceasefire can be to disengage the two sides' armed units for a distance insurmountable by artillery fire. "This means that each side must retreat and withdraw its heavy weapons about 10 or 15 kilometers away from the front line. So far this condition has not been met, and separate violations of the truce continue," Kazimirov said. When the two sides withdraw their forces, 30 mobile groups of observers comprising Russian servicemen stationed in the area will be deployed in "the disengagement strip". Representatives of the warring sides will be included in these groups. "This is the only way to determine objectively which side is responsible for one violation or another, and raise the issue of calling to account the direct violators, and possibly their military commanders," Kazimirov pointed out. Russia's latest actions in the area were "well coordinated" with the efforts of the CSCE Minsk Group, he said. In the course of his trip he conferred with the chairman of the Minsk Group, Ian Elliason, and stressed "Russia's willingness to cooperate". However, the diplomat said, "Russian groups of observers will act as pioneers after all." "We are prepared to keep Russian groups locally for two days after the disengagement of the warring sides. Unfortunately, the CSCE has no such opportunity," Kazimirov said.
