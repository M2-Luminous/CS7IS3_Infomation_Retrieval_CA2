President Kim told his secretaries to submit to the National Assembly on Saturday a bill asking for parliamentary endorsement of his appointment of Yi Yong-tok as new prime minister. Chongwadae [presidential office] spokesman Chu Ton-sik said in an announcement soon after Yi Hoe-chang's weekly Chongwadae [meeting] reporting that "Prime Minister Yi tendered his resignation as prime minister at 5 p.m. and President Kim accepted it promptly." President Kim met Prime Minister Yi at Chongwadae for about 40 minutes beginning 4 p.m., during which the president was learned to have reproached Yi in connection with his recent behavior. A source said that Prime Minister Yi did not express his intent of resignation during his Chongwadae meeting with the president. But, on return to his office in the integrated government building, Yi tendered his resignation through Government Administration Minister Hwang Yong-ha, the source said. The acceptance by President Kim of Yi's resignation is taken as the revelation of the president's determination to firm up the discipline of the cabinet under the presidential system. The president is expected to appoint a new deputy prime minister and national unification minister soon after the parliament endorsed the choice of Yi Yong-tok as new prime minister.
