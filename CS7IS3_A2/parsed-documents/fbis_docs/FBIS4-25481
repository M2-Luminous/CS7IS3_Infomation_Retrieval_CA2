Chen Jianguo pointed out: The transaction of property rights of enterprises is the outcome of the market economy, an effective way to achieve optimum distribution and rational flow of assets under the condition of the market economy, and a means adopted by the government to readjust industrial structure. Over the past few years, quite a few localities in the province have conducted useful explorations and experiments for transactions of property rights of enterprises and have helped separate government administration from enterprise management and change the operation mechanism of enterprises through the methods of absorbing more owners of shares and selling and leasing enterprises to others. As a result, the vitality of enterprises has been enhanced and some new experiences have been created. Some new circumstances and new problems have also emerged, however. In particular, the loss of state-owned assets has been extremely serious in a few localities and enterprises. Chen Jianguo stressed: The transaction of property rights is a work deeply related to policies and professions. In this regard, we should not only be positive but also appropriate. In guiding the specific work, we should successfully grasp the following several points: First, the transactions of property right should persistently follow the direction of socialism. Second, the transactions of property right should aim at safeguarding the property and interests of the state. Third, the transactions of property rights should be combined with the optimization of industrial structure and the optimization of the distribution of resources. Fourth, the transactions of property rights should give full consideration to the placement of enterprise workers and staff and to social stability.
