Three deputy ministers and a dozen officials of a little lower rank had worked it out, but I was unable to obtain the 20 or 30 pages of typewritten text. Most surprising of all was the fact that this does not concern the latest weapon, where secrecy would have been entirely appropriate, but just..."A Concept for Reforming the Pension System in the Russian Federation." As far as I know, the document bore no security classification, but the high ministry officials, as if they were partisans being interrogated, kept the secret paper to themselves, fearing to let it out of their hands. L. Bezlepkina, the first deputy minister of social security, adopted an inflexible position right away: "The `Concept' is still being worked on, in `raw form,' so to speak, and it will be refined and improved. For this reason, I cannot give you the text. When the government approves the `Concept,' then please..." "But after all, Lyudmila Fedorovna, journalists were invited to the collegium of the Ministry of Social Security where this `Concept' was being discussed. Does this mean we can hear the discussion but not read the document?" "Yes, it was possible to listen, but not to read..." Yu. Lyublin, the deputy chairman of the Pension Fund, also categorically refused my request. Deputy Minister of Labor V. Yanvarev showed the ill-fated text in his hands from a distance, rapidly turning the pages, but he gave a decisive "no" to my request to read it. "First of all, this is official material," Yanvarev told me. "Secondly, we are making extensive changes in it at the Ministry of Labor now. Thirdly, this is not our material at all, and fourthly, we do not agree with a great deal here..." Yanvarev laid the typewritten pages on his desk and carefully covered them with other papers--it does not matter that I have good vision and I could read something... Just what kind of a secret are the high ministry officials guarding from a journalist, and hence from readers--from Russians? What is the secret "bomb" hidden in these papers, which no outsider can be allowed to even come close to? Ultimately, matters related to pensions concern tens of millions of citizens, and even working documents and the course of the discussions themselves are of great interest to all citizens. Previously, any decisions affecting the people were prepared in secret, behind double doors and thick walls. Perhaps the ministry officials of today long for those days? However, I obtained the "supersecret" document anyway, though illegally, and I gave my word that I would not say who passed it to me. And after reading the concept, I surmised why Yanvarev, Bezlepkina, Lyublin, and the other officials charged with looking after the people's welfare refused so persistently to give out this material. There are really "bombs" in it! Here is one of them relating to pension age. At the beginning of this section of the "Concept," it is correctly pointed out that the rise in unemployment in the transition to a market economy requires that pension age be lowered so that the older groups vacate the work places for younger employees. In emphasizing this correct thesis, the "Concept" authors (employees of the Ministry of Social Security, Ministry of Labor, the Pension Fund, and others) put the principal accent on another idea--the need to increase the age at which employees have the right to be pensioned. These are the arguments here: the population is getting older and the proportion of pensioners is increasing, thereby increasing the "load" on those who are working. We have less than two workers for each pensioner at present. For this reason, they say, it is very difficult to provide for an adequate level of pensions for those who really cannot work. Hence the conclusion: subsequently, to the extent that the economy and the labor market is stabilized, we can shift to a higher pension age, first increasing it by 2 to 3 years, and later on setting 65 years for men and 60 for women. At the same time, it is proposed that the principle of "flexible" age, that is, the opportunity to receive an early pension of a lesser amount, be adopted. The section ends like this: "According to preliminary estimates, taking demographic forecasts into account (that is, the increase in pension age--V.G.), it may be implemented after the year 2000. However, the preparation for this step should be begun now." But why "now?" Will tomorrow really be too late? I would like to ask the authors of this version of the "Concept" whether they know the average life expectancy in Russia now. According to preliminary estimates, it is less than 60 for men (it was 64 in 1990). In other words, the life expectancy of representatives of "the stronger sex" is declining rapidly. And this is obvious from the obituary notices without scientific research: they often die at 56, 54, or 58... The Goskomstat [State Committee for Statistics] points out that the mortality rate of citizens of working age is increasing at a faster rate. Today 30 percent of those who have died did not reach pension age. And under these conditions, raising the question of increasing pension age in the not-too-distant future (the year 2000 is 5 years away) is intolerable and immoral. Even according to the most optimistic forecasts, our economy will have to deal with a large number of problems in the next 5 to 10 years. There are no grounds to assume that life expectancy will increase. And under these conditions, raising the pension age is not simply wrong, it can lead to serious social conflicts. Well, don't our "protectors of the people's interests" understand this? I think they understand; otherwise, they would not have made this document so "secret." But why did they do it if they understand this? In order to save some crumbs for a future budget at the cost of those who die before reaching pension age? You cannot say this is a "humane" approach. I was very ashamed to read this "Concept." Incidentally, it was obviously not by chance that they "forgot" to involve specialists from the FITUR [Russian Federation of Independent trade Unions] in the work. In the meantime, I have a counter-question: why are the trade unions themselves sleeping? At the Ministry of Social Security collegium where they discussed the document, officials from the Ministry of Labor sharply criticized many provisions of the "Concept." It is now being reworked. Will the prosposals to increase the pension age remain in the new version? Deputy Minister of Labor V. Yanvarev, who would not give me the notorious document, chose his words carefully, saying that in his opinion, "there are no grounds to raise the question of revising the pension age in the near future." But this is the opinion of just one deputy minister. Let us see what appears in the second version. Incidentally, Yanvarev promised to send this new document to the editorial staff. Unless he has second thoughts, of course.
