FR940524-2-00018 FR940524-2-00017 Office of Hearings and Appeals Termination of Execption Relief AGENCY: Office of Hearings and Appeals, Department of Energy. ACTION: Termination of exception relief and opportunity to file refund applications (Case No. LFX&hyph;0008). SUMMARY: The Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) announces the final procedures for the disbursement of a portion of the approximately $131,000,000, plus interest, obtained by the DOE as the result of the termination of exception relief granted to the 341 Tract Unit of the Citronelle Field. The OHA determined that each refiner's share of the available Citronelle fund would be based on the percentage of its runs to stills on the Entitlements List for November 1980. Further, the OHA determined a presumptive level of absorption of the additional cost of the Citronelle recertification of 5.4 percent. DATES AND ADDRESSES: Applications for Refund will be accepted from those participants on the DOE's November 1980 Entitlements List which have not previously filed briefs or evidence in this proceeding on the refiner absorption issue. (Those refiners which previously filed refund applications in this Citronelle proceeding need not file again.) The Applications must be postmarked no later than June 15, 1995, and should be addressed to the Office of Hearings and Appeals, Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20585. All applications should display a reference to Case Number RF345. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thomas L. Wieker, Deputy Director; Virginia Lipton, Assistant Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Ave. SW., Washington, DC 20585, (202) 586&hyph;2390 (Wieker), (202) 586&hyph;2400 (Lipton). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Notice is hereby given of the issuance of a final Decision and Order, dated May 18, 1994, entitled the 341 Tract Unit of the Citronelle Field, that provides for the procedures the DOE will use to disburse the escrowed funds which were received as a result of the termination of exception relief granted to the 341 Tract Unit of the Citronelle Field. The exception relief permitted the Unit to recertify a sufficient quantity of its prior production of price-controlled crude oil to produce $63.8 million. The funds generated by the recertification were placed in an escrow account. These funds, with accrued interest, now total approximately $131,000,000. Interest continues to accrue on the funds, which are presently deposited in an interest-bearing escrow account maintained at the United States Department of the Treasury. The recertification by the Unit had the effect of raising per-barrel prices of crude oil to crude oil refiners who were participants in the Entitlements Program as of November 1980. Accordingly, as part of a proceeding akin to that set forth at 10 CFR subpart V (Special Procedures for Distribution of Refunds), the OHA decided to consider what portion of the escrowed funds should be reserved for refunds for those participants. The OHA invited interested parties to submit evidence regarding the refiners' level of absorption of the cost of the Citronelle recertification. The OHA received briefs and evidence submitted by a group of Refiners, a group of States and a group of End-users regarding the amount of the Citronelle recertification that refiners absorbed. The OHA also convened an evidentiary hearing and oral argument regarding this issue. After considering all the evidence, the OHA determined in the Decision that the Refiners had not shown that they absorbed the cost of the Citronelle recertification at a level greater than the 5.4 percent overall average absorption rate found in the OHA's Stripper Well Report. Accordingly, the OHA decided to adopt a presumptive absorption rate of 5.4 percent of the cost of the Citronelle recertification. The OHA further determined that each refiner's portion of the available Citronelle funds (its allocable share) would be its percentage of the total runs to stills on the November 1980 Entitlements List. The OHA stated that it would apply the 5.4 percent presumption to the refiners' allocable shares. The OHA set forth a list of the information that should be included in all Citronelle refund applications. In a previous determination, the OHA directed refiner applicants who submitted briefs and evidence regarding the absorption issue to file Citronelle refund applications concurrently with their refund claims. We received claims from 25 refiners during that phase of the Citronelle proceeding. Refiners that were named on the November 1980 Entitlements list and that did not submit briefs and applications during that phase of the Citronelle proceeding should do so at this time. These applications must be postmarked by June 15, 1995. Copies of the Decision and Order may be obtained through the Public Reference Room of the Office of Hearings and Appeals at 1000 Independence Ave. SW., Washington, DC 20585. Further, this Decision will be published in Federal Energy Guidelines, a commercially published loose leaf reporter system. Dated: May 18, 1994. George B.
