In summit talks with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Tokyo on Tuesday, Zia was quoted as offering to drum up support for Japan's bid to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The 48-year-old premier said Bangladesh's support stems from its belief "that the leadership and positive posture of Japan are important for further strengthening the role of Asia in international relations." During her visit, Japan pledged to extend a 23 billion yen official aid package to Bangladesh, Foreign Ministry officials said. The pledge, covering two projects, was formalized in a ceremony to exchange notes between Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and Bangladesh Finance Minister Saifur Rahman, the officials said.
