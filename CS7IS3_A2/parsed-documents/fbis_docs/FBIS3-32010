In a discussion with German journalists during the predawn hours today at the Cuban beach resort of Varadero, Castro added, nevertheless, that Cuba, despite the boycott, is capable of "surviving these more difficult times." "Clinton seems to be a man of peace," especially concerned by his country's domestic problems, "but U.S. presidents have huge power limitations," the Cuban president said. Castro said Cuban exiles in the United States exert great pressure on the Washington Government. The Cuban president said for the United States "the problem with Cuba is a domestic problem, not a foreign one." Castro expressed gratitude for European economic aid, particularly German aid to Cuba, during the official inauguration of a new Cuban hotel operated by Germans. "Germany is a very important player in today's world, not only for Cuban economic interests but also for Third World interests," Castro said.
