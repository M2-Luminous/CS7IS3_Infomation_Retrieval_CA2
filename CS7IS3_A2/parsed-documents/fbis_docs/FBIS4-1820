The decision was made during a two-day meeting concluded here today by the economic subject panel of the preliminary working committee for the preparatory committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR). Members of the economic subject panel agreed that such a group is necessary when exceedingly high housing and land prices in Hong Kong have already adversely affected the livelihood of local residents and Hong Kong's economic growth. During the meeting, these members heard a report on the question of land in Hong Kong and the Chinese Government's policy regarding the approval of land there. Zhong Qiquan, secretary-general of the Guangdong Provincial Government, briefed the members on the large construction projects being undertaken in Guangdong. The members discussed how to coordinate large construction projects undertaken in the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong. Moreover, members of the banking and finance panels of the preliminary working committee also met here to discuss an initial report on how to manage the land fund of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region after 1997.
