You will recall that a European Parliament initiative lies at the origin of these programs, aimed at promoting the development of democratic societies based on the rule of law and the expression of the free will of the citizens. The current program consists above all in a support for selected local nongovernmental organizations, through partnerships between them and similar organization in states of the Union. Thus, projects covering a wide range of activities (but not political party activities, nor capital expenditure, nor grants for conferences) will be able to benefit from subsidies of up to ECU150,000, which could be funded to the tune of 70 percent of the costs of each project. One of the conditions, however, is that the projects need at least three partners, two from the European Union and one from the beneficiary state. Moreover, ECU1 million extra is planned for those countries benefiting from the PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary], with view to financing a new aspect of the Program for Democracy, i.e. micro-projects: In this case, the subsidies from the European Union -- from ECU3,000 to ECU10,000 -- can finance up to 90 percent of the cost of the projects, and partnership with European Union organizations are not necessary. The European Commission will be assisted in the management of the programs by the European Human Rights Foundation, which has a lot of experience in similar programs undertaken by nongovernmental organizations [NGOs] which work to promote human rights and democracy. Thus, the Commission will select the projects and the Foundation will then follow their implementation.
