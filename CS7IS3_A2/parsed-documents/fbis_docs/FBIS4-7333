Noting that the United States is reinforcing the aggression forces in South Korea, crying for "the increase of the capability of the U.S. forces in South Korea to counter a surprise attack by North Korea," the analyst says: The U.S. seeks to find an excuse to pursue the policy of stifling the DPRK in kicking up a dust over the non-existent "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. The U.S. Forces in South Korea and in Japan are the main lever in executing its Asia-Pacific policy. U.S. arms buildup in South Korea is motivated by the strategic aim to strengthen its domination over Asia and the Pacific with force. "North Korea's surprise attack" advertised by the United States is nothing but a sophism to justify arms buildup in South Korea. The United States' reinforcement of armament in South Korea poses a serious threat to the peace and security of the Korean peninsula and the Asian-Pacific region. The United States must stop arms buildup in South Korea, not ignoring the desire of the people in this region for independence and peace.
