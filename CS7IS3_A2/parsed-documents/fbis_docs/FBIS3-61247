Igor Mefodyevich was glad to grant an interview to GOLOS UKRAINY. [Pisanskaya] We have heard about the "Turkish miracle"--the economic reforms which, if they have not transformed this not very rich country into a civilized paradise, have at least led its citizens onto the path of abundance. And indeed even with a brief acquaintance with Turkey one is struck by its immense commercial market. It would probably be logical for Ukraine to arrange economic relations with this neighbor of ours as quickly as possible. [Turyansky] As logical as it gets... And I understood this the first day I worked here: The immense prospects for economic cooperation are practically not being realized, mainly because of the passivity of Ukrainian entrepreneurs. But the Turks are extremely efficient people. For them their word is like law. If we have discussed some proposal on the telephone in the morning, in the evening a fax of a joint agreement is sure to arrive. They have an excellent understanding of our difficulties and are trying to help. But we, unfortunately, are not prepared to accept this help. And we are unprepared at the very highest levels. [Pisanskaya] And is Turkey prepared to cooperate? [Turyansky] Yes. Business people here are well aware that Ukraine is renowned for its metallurgical industry, coal, and sugar. These are traditional items in our exports and the Turks are interested in them. And it would not hurt Ukraine to have the consumer goods which are plentiful in Turkey. Moreover, the Turks are excellent builders and cooperation is possible here as well. [Pisanskaya] Have there been any concrete proposals from Turkish enterprises? [Turyansky] Of course. But they are being realized extremely unsatisfactorily. For instance, in May a Turkish company proposed to invest $50 million in Ukraine. Within two days I had sent the documented information to Kiev. And what do you think happened? Specialists from the Eksimbank did not arrive for negotiations until the end of October... [Pisanskaya] It took Turkey 13 years to carry out its reforms. What do you think--will it take Ukraine just as long? [Turyansky] Ukraine does not have that possibility. We are so far behind in our development that we have to make haste. And to do this we must say farewell to our illusions once and for all. We must have patience and build partnership relations with the surrounding world. [Pisanskaya] What part of Turkey's experience in economic reform may be used by Ukraine? [Turyansky] I would put the question differently. The now late president of Turkey, Turgut Ozal, during my meeting with him named several factors that are keeping Ukraine from moving forward. They include, first, the dependency on a single source of energy. He was convinced that energy sources must be diversified. And he gave an example: At the beginning of the reforms Turkey was unable to cover the cost of imported energy sources with exports--this took 120 percent of them. Now Turkey is paying for its energy sources with just 18 percent of its exports. Second, Ukraine is still not relying on small and medium-sized enterprises. Is it really so difficult to understand that if a person has something of his own he does not have time to wave flags and banners and he will no longer have to take it away from someone else? Incidentally, in the sphere of services and trade the Turks work from 0700 until 2300. They are aware that each client means a kopek in their pockets. [Pisanskaya] You tell me about the great prospects for Ukrainian-Turkish cooperation, and yet it has already turned out that our politicians and entrepreneurs have been and still are oriented more toward Western countries... [Turyansky] You see, it is not so much that they have been oriented that way as that they have been expecting that the West will help us, give us something. This is a mistake. It is possible to give, but only a little. Relations with Turkey are no panacea either, but it is extremely advantageous partner and, the most important thing, it is interested in cooperation, and we are linked by excellent sea transportation arteries. Regular air communications have now been opened up. But for now we are losing great opportunities for cooperation. It is already uncomfortable to look in the eyes of Turkish entrepreneurs who, on my recommendations, are traveling to Ukraine and returning from there with empty hands without even having found any interest in their proposals. [Pisanskaya] But there are lively communications with bazaar merchants--the so-called wild financial-trade tourism. Is there a problem with this? [Turyansky] There is. Each year about a half million people travel from Ukraine to Turkey--to buy some things and to sell some things. I thought that everything had already been shipped from Ukraine to Poland. It turns out that this is not the case. Hammers, nails, watches, cigarettes--you can see everything in the Turkish bazaars. And even when our compatriots are guests they sometimes act as though they are at home, and sometimes so rudely that it is difficult for the embassy to straighten things out. Some people lose their passports and money, others have them stolen, and others connive to save money on their ticket home. There are also those who bring in contraband and violate customs rules. There are now 15 citizens of Ukraine serving time in Turkish jails. But the telephones in the embassy are never quiet and the doors never close for other reasons as well--the entrepreneurs of Turkey are trying to set up relations with us. I believe that this interest will serve both countries for a long time to come.
