He did not refer to the precise scale of the proposed cut. Mori told reporters that raising the consumption tax to make up for a shortfall of government revenues would have a "negative impact" on the economy's recuperation. Mori said the issue of whether or not to raise the consumption tax from the present 3 percent could even lead to the destruction of the coalition government. The Social Democratic Party, the largest of ruling coalition parties, is against a consumption tax hike. He also said a drastic easing or even a temporary freezing of land taxes and a zero interest rate on housing loans should be scrutinized as ways of stimulating slumbering business.
