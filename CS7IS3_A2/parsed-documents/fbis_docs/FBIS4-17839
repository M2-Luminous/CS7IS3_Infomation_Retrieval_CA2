As to material satisfaction, each of the people's servants did his best to get it in accordance with his own efforts and perceived needs during his time in office. However, in addition to the barrel loads of praise which the former deputies will undoubtedly heap upon each other, several urgent matters are awaiting the deputies. In particular, despite their present state of relaxation, they will have to confront numerous reports on violation of the Electoral Law, which they themselves passed. Specifically, these were cases of elections with only a single candidate contesting--only one candidate running--in four districts. In each of them, there were ten or more contenders running in the first round. Here is how Volodymyr Sumin, chairman of the Association of Ukrainian Lawyers, comments on this issue. [Sumin] Of course, it is strange that certified lawyers from the Central Election Commission deliberately -- because that's how it was -- violated the law. Not only does Ivan Yemets, head of the commission, take the liberty of bending the law, he also claims that it is absolutely right to do so. The law clearly states that the elections must be held with more than one candidate. I agree, somebody can die or withdraw his candidacy. In this case, however, the next best-rated candidate is proposed. We are not talking about districts where only one candidate was put forward -- there were none during this election. Instead, there were four districts, where one of the two candidates decided not to run for parliament in the second round, and so the election was held without an opponent. Our position is that a repeat election must be called in each of those districts, and that the "victors" should also participate, because technically, it is not their fault that they remained alone in the second round. It is the fault of the commission, and a repeat election must be held. Thus, the four newly elected deputies, including Volodymyr Hrynyov, head of the "Blasko" joint stock company, Pavlo Kudyukin, and others will have to prove their right to sit in parliament once again. I hope that the Supreme Council, which will hold its last meeting on 22 April, will correct the commission and its chairman's mistake; perhaps, it might even assess the actions of Ivan Yemets. I feel sorry for Ivan Yemets, who has worked all his life in the [state] apparatus and became its servant. Obviously, he performed some function in this apparatus, but no lawyer can act this way. There is no reason for Ivan Yemets to charge the Association of Ukrainian Lawyers with interfering in the election procedure. On the contrary, we helped him with our analysis and expertise on the violations reported by the people as well as by parliamentary candidates, and which we also witnessed ourselves. Analyzing the reaction of the commission and its head, one gets the feeling that the law was violated to please someone or something, not because of any lack of knowledge.
