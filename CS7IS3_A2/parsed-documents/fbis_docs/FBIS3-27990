We regard your high-level visit to our country as a good omen for friendly relations between the Lao and Thai peoples, especially between our two legislative institutions. We firmly believe that the successful talks held this afternoon in an atmosphere of friendship and mutual understanding will be an important factor in building and strengthening the time-honored, fine, traditional relations between Laos and Thailand. Your Excellency, ladies, gentlemen, and distinguished quests: The ties between the Lao and Thai peoples are based on a spirit of close brotherliness and neighborliness that has existed traditionally since ancient times. This was noted in the speech by His Majesty King Phumiphon Adunyadet the Great at a banquet in honor of His Excellency [H.E.] Kaysone Phomvihan, president of the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR], on 6 January 1992. The king observed: Relations between our states and peoples are so close that they have become inseparable; this bond makes us close relatives. In his speech at the same banquet, H.E. President Kaysone Phomvihan said: It is clear that if we uphold the spirit of close brotherliness and neighborliness, avoid developing a sense of animosity and ill intentions toward each other, and firmly adhere to the teachings of the Lord Buddha and the five principles of peaceful coexistence, we can be certain that any conflict between Laos and Thailand will be resolved. In this spirit, and in our capacity as the legislative organizations of the two countries, I believe we will continue to encourage all concerned sectors to solve the problems between our countries. This will keep our relations smooth forever and further deepen the affection and solidarity between the fraternal Lao and Thai peoples. On this auspicious occasion, I invite Your Excellency the President, your wife, your party, and all our distinguished guests to make a toast: To the happiness of His Majesty King Phumiphon Adunyadet the Great, her majesty the queen, and all the members of the Royal Family of the Kingdom of Thailand; the good health of His Excellency LPDR President Nouhak Phoumsavan; the health and happiness of Your Excellency the President, your wife, and your party; the health of all the ladies, gentlemen, and distinguished guests at this banquet; and the health and prosperity of the Lao and Thai peoples.
