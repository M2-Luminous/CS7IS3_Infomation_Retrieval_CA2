O. Petrosyants, I. A. Kharitonov, Moscow State Institute of Electronics and Mathematics (Technical University); UDC 621.382] [Abstract] A modified model of a MIS transistor is developed which, in contrast to standard models, provides a continuous description of the volt-ampere characteristic, providing a more accurate model of analog circuits operating in pre-threshold mode. The slope and displacement of model pre-threshold characteristics is determined by induced charges which reflect physical processes in the irradiated structure. A new method of determining threshold voltages and current from measured volt-ampere characteristics is proposed. Compared to the method which determines threshold voltage at a constant current, this method more accurately describes the volt-ampere characteristic of irradiated transistors in weak inversion mode. The standard model of a bipolar transistor is supplemented with recombination components of the base current that arise in various areas of the structure. Each recombination component is unambiguously physically linked with the electrophysical parameters of the semiconductor structure, the geometric dimensions, and the radiation dose. Consequently, the new model can rather easily evaluate various design variants of transistor structures from the point of view of radiation resistance. Software has been developed to determine model parameters and radiation coefficients for this model. Figures 8; references 24: 4 Russian, 20 Western.
