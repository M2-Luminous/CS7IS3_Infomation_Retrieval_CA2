Earlier, the U.S. Defense Department declared that it would send reinforcements of mobile strike force to South Korea and its surroundings. Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says: The attempt of the hardline conservative forces in the United States to put military pressure on us, while hastening arms buildup, shows that they are not interested in a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula but intend to stifle the DPRK with "strength". They are persistently working to carry the situation of the Korean peninsula to an extreme phase and putting pressure on those calling for a solution to the nuclear issue on the peninsula through dialogue and negotiation. It is a unanimous demand of the world people to solve this issue through dialogue and negotiation. A military option cannot be a way of solving it. If the way of solving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through dialogue and negotiation is blocked by the reckless military pressure campaign, the consequences will be unpredictable. The U.S. hardline conservative forces must act with discretion, coolly looking into the reality.
