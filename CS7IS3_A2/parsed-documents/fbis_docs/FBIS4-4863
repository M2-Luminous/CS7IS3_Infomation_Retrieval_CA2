Hosokawa made the remarks during a meeting at his official residence with labor unions' leader Akira Yamagishi. Yamagishi, head of the Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo), urged the government to raise public servants' salaries fully in accordance with the recommendation. "If a recommendation is offered, I will respect it and make utmost efforts to realize it at an early date," Hosokawa said. The premier was also positive about the idea of granting Japanese firefighters the right to organize and engage in labor movements. Among industrialized nations, only Japan has refused to grant its firefighters such a right. Labor Minister Chikara Sakaguchi, who also attended the meeting, proposed the establishment of a new consulting body with representatives of the government, labor unions and employers to exchange views on promoting employment. Yamagishi invited Hosokawa to a Rengo-sponsored "May Day" assembly on May 1 as the government representative.
