This view was stated to ITAR-TASS on Monday by Professor Anatoliy Torkunov, one of leading Russian experts on Korea who heads the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. Torkunov said demands of the international community to North Korea are fair. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) does not require of North Korea anything beyond what it expects from other countries. Russia fully shares this attitude to the nuclear problem which is the root-cause of the present Korean crisis. Russian approach was set out in detail during the negotiations Russian President Boris Yeltsin held with President of the Republic of Korea Kim Young-sam in Moscow the other day. The Russian scientist warned against a rash recource to sanctions. Pyongyang got accustomed to relying on its own resources. Sanctions can only lead to the further spiral of ideological confrontation which, in the long run, will affect the position of ordinary Koreans. The further heightening of tension is fraught with unpredictable consequences as the Korean peninsula is inundated with arms in its both parts. An international conference in the Korean peninsula suggested by Russia could be an effective way of easing the situation, Professor Torkunov believes. An ever greater interest is now shown in this idea as it essentially meets the interest of all the parties, including North Korea. The conference could put an end to the isolation of North Korea which has been increasing of late. South Korea has succeeded in establishing diplomatic relations with Russia, China and East european countries in the recent years. Meanwhile North Korea does not have diplomatic relations with the United States and others leading Western countries. If an international conference is held, Pyongyang could get real diplomatic levers to protect its own interests. North Korea should realise that the factor of menace to South Korea is no longer as important as it used to be. South Korea has a strong army, and Seoul interacts in defence matters with the United States on a basis on a treaty. All the parties concerned should use every method of persuasion. China has levers of influence too. Beijing has traditional ramified ties with Pyongyang. Tokyo has levers of influence as trade with Japan is important for North Korea as an outlet to the Western world. Russia must be flexible on this matter, Torkunov said. Russia has a certain stretch of common border with North Korea, and power politics in relations with neighbours can hardly be expedient. This is why the Russian line is to coordinate diplomatic efforts with other countries. Possibilities of a political settlement have not been exhausted, Torkunov said.
