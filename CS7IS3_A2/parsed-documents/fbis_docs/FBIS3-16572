Mikhail Lapshin, leader of the Agrarian Party of Russia, assures, for example, that the party will participate in the elaboration of a memorandum of civil peace but will raise a lot of questions. In particular, about the revival of the Russian countryside and will see to it in every way that "accord would not lead to a suppression of part of society". Nikolay Travkin, leader of the Democratic Party of Russia, said he visualises the way to civil accord only in the attainment of agreement between the two branches of power -- executive and legislative -- and not in some single document, however complete it is and whatever the number of parties signing it. TRUD comments on Thursday's [17 March] remarks made by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin at the Federation council session, quoting him as saying that "we do not need a state of emergency in the economy" which is fully controlled by both the president of Russia and the government. The newspaper's opinion is that if the measures mentioned by the Russian premier are implemented (namely, a solution to defaults of payments, a selective support of enterprises, restructuring, etc.) "the country will stand real chances to get out of the crisis." RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA on the problem of non-payments. Vladimir Chumakov, general director of the Yugtransgaz state-run enterprise, states that "defaults of payments are our sore point now. More than 60 per cent of the amount of sold gas has not been paid for." Such a financial reality, Chumakov said, "deforms our economic, technical and social policies". In order to remove the cause of the economic disorganisation, he pleads the need to revise, first of all, the taxation policy and to determine a reform policy in a clear-cut manner "so that people and enterprises would know the direction we proceed along." RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA singles out a report that Boris Shurinov, vice- president of the UFOlogy union, has accused a number of servicemen from the Russian Defence Ministry of "clandestine sales" of information on the UFO problem from secret archives to the Americans. Next week the newspaper promises to give details of the russian "UFO-gate". KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) on Pavel Grachev-William Perry meeting: "A fundamentally new relationship -- businesslike, partner's and mutually respectful -- is taking shape between the two great powers. They are imbued not with chill but with business efficiency which is undoubtedly devoid of certain original enthusiasm which marked the turn of the decade". KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with Russia's former prosecutor-general Aleksey Kazannik who asserts that "the incumbent authorities lack moral principles" and that "selfish interests are predominating among them". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the start of overt confrontation between Presidents Yuriy Meshkov of the Crimea and President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine, who cancelled Meshkov's decree about an autonomy referendum. "This balancing on the verge of a precipice may also easily lead to an aggravation of Russo-Ukrainian relations and turn the Crimea from an increasingly costly health resort into a hotbed of civil war". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with Gennadiy Voronin, deputy chairman of the Russian state committee for the defence industry, who warns that Russia runs the risk of "losing the status of great power" and emphasises that "the duty of the Russian state is to save its navy". PRAVDA gives prominence to the text of an address to the citizens of Russia by the leaders of the left-centre opposition who call on people to unite in order to "prevent a final breakup of historical Russia and the disruption of cultural, economic and political relationships that took shape for centuries between its equal peoples".
