Fu Quanyou, member of the Central Military Commission and director of the PLA General Logistics Department, said today at an Army-wide telephone conference on agricultural and side-line production that the armed forces' farming effort was significant in reducing the burdens on the state, subsidizing supplies to the Army, improving the soldiers' living standards and promoting the reform and building of the Army. He noted that in recent years, great progress had been made in the farming by the armed forces. Last year, he added, the whole Army produced 650 million kilograms of grain, 225 million kilograms of meat, fish and eggs and 600 million kilograms of vegetables, with a total value of 700 million yuan. However, Director Fu pointed out, the prices on the market have been rising quickly. So there was still a gap between the current board expenses of soldiers and the actual need, although the Central Military Commission had decided to raise the level of the soldiers' board expenses. In order to narrow the gap, Fu stressed, it was necessary to make greater efforts to develop agricultural and side-line production so as to raise the forces' self-supply abilities. Director Fu called on the leadership of the armed forces at all levels to pay closer attention to and strengthen the management of agricultural and side-line production, to raise it to a higher level.
