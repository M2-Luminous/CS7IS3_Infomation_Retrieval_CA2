The banks used in the recycling scheme included Monte dei Paschi di Siena, Banca Commerciale Italiana and the Banca Populare dell'Etruria e del Lazio. Vigna said his office was notifying Bank of Italy about the financial institutes failure to report bank operations over 20 million lire. "Under present rules, only administrative sanctions can be applied against banks that don't comply, but that needs to be changed," Vigna said. "A traffic on a scale and of a nature such as to risk throwing out of kilter the mechanisms of the gold market in Italy and, indeed, throughout the world," was how expert Adriano Pansa described the laundry set up by the Cali cartel and the Arezzo gold traders. Revealing that investigators had uncovered details on just three single operations totalling 300 million dollars, Pansa pointed out that the money-washers were not overconcerned about making a profit, since their main objective was simply to change the drug revenue into cash, and thus often sold their gold below the going rate. He expressed the view that the apparent lack of Sicilian Mafia involvement did not mean Cosa Nostra had not also been using the laundry, since the mob has made a point of delegating recycling to so-called "white-collar" teams, especially since the massive Green Ice narco-traffic bust 18 months ago. Six of the eight arrests in Italy, including Delgado (37), were made at or near the northeastern city of Vicenza, home of an alleged Italian ringleader, jewelry trader Rino Perozzo, and also home to the twice-yearly Vicenza Gold trade fair (reputedly the world's most important jewelry event), which has just opened. The others arrested at Vicenza or nearby Bassano del Grappa were Carlo Fabbroni (35), Fabrizio Meotti (47), Luciano Pataro (43), and Nicola Pirro (25). Pataro's brother was arrested in Arezzo. Of the four arrests in Panama, two were a well-known pair of brothers--only the surname, Schwartz, was released here--who have reportedly held a monopoly in gold trading since the time of felled dictator Roberto Noriega. The operation began last June when the US Drug Enforcement Administration notified Italian authorities of a payment of 150,000 dollars from a US bank. Investigators traced the money back to three Arezzo companies: Aurea Trading International, Italian representative for the US Universe Gold Enterprise (both owned by the Pataro brothers); Simar Joyeros Mayoristas, with an office in Arezzo headed by Meotti and another in Panama run by the Schwartz brothers; and Eurocatene, headed by Fabbroni. These three companies held the bank accounts into which the narcodollars were sent to be used to buy up gold on the Italian market. The gold was then sent to be sold in Panama, after which the clean dollars returned to the drug-traffickers.
