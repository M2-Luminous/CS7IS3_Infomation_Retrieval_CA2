In an exclusive interview with XINHUA, Hata noted that friendly Sino-Japanese relations, which were normalized in 1972, have entered a new phase and should be broadened for the benefit of the international community. Hata, who leaves for Beijing tomorrow on an official visit, reiterated Japan's support for China's reform and modernization drive. "A long-term and sustainable economic development in China is of vital importance," he observed. "China's bid for a socialist market economy, if it succeeds, will have a significant bearing on the global economy, and on peace and stability in Asia and the world at large." He discounted the threat of China's military buildup, saying China will not "go for big-military power status" despite its efforts toward arms modernization. On the question of Tokyo-Taiwan ties, the foreign minister said that the Japanese Government has been committed to maintaining only non-official contact with Taiwan since 1972. Although there are divergent views on the issue in his country, Hata noted that Japan's Taiwan policy is unchanged, and promised that it will remain so in the future.
