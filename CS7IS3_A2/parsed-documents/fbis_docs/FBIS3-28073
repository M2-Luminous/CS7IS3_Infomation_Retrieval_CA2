According to a high-ranking U.S. State Department official, the State Department approved a one-day-two-night Washington visit by Representative Pak and he is scheduled to attend the national breakfast prayer meeting to be held on the morning of 3 February. The official said that an encounter was possible between President Clinton and Representative Pak at the prayer meeting. Representative Pak's Washington visit to attend the breakfast prayer meeting is noteworthy because it is taking place at a time when tension in U.S.-North Korea relations has risen anew with North Korea's warning that it may not withhold withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and with the plan to deploy Patriot missiles in the ROK. White House officials said: "President Clinton is scheduled to attend the 3 February morning prayer meeting but how long he will stay and with whom he will meet has yet to be decided upon." A White House official said: "With the current situation in which negotiation between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency is at stalemate, it would be very meaningful for President Clinton and Representative Pak to meet even briefly." The U.S. State Department gave advance approval for Representative Pak's Washington visit because the activities and travel of North Korean diplomats to the United Nations, including Representative Pak, are restricted to a 25 mile-radius in New York.
