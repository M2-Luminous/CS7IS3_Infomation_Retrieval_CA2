The two companies will integrate their engineering design and analysis products so as to offer CATIA users a complete analysis system for injection-formed plastic parts. The interface between CATIA and Moldflow makes it possible to analyze the flow of material during the injection and cooling of the part, monitor surface effects and weld lines, check shrinkage, and so on. The part is designed and meshed by CATIA before being subjected to Moldflow's specialized problem solvers. The analysis results are then displayed using CATIA's postprocessor. The development agreement provides the first solution for analyzing and simulating plastic injection in complete integration with CATIA, according to Francis Bernard, general manager of Dassault Systems. It also makes it possible to "optimize the design of injected plastic parts by simplifying the design process and reducing analysis times." Moldflow Proprietary, Ltd., established in 1978 and now the world leader in the plastics analysis market, develops and markets computer-aided engineering software specifically for the molded-plastics injection market. That technology, consisting of a combination of software and design concepts, has literally revolutionized the design of parts and moldings all over the world. The firm's headquarters are in Melbourne, Australia, with subsidiaries in Great Britain, Germany, Korea, China, and the United States employing about 100 people.
