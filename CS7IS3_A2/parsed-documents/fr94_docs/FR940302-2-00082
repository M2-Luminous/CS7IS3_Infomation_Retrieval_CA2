FR940302-2-00082 FR940302-2-00061 Biweekly Notice Applications and Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses Involving No Significant Hazards Considerations I. Background Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person. This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from February 5, 1994, through February 17, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on February 16, 1994 (59 FR 7685). Notice Of Consideration Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, And Opportunity For A Hearing The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for each amendment request is shown below. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the Federal Register a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number of this Federal Register notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room P-223, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below. By April 1, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed to (Project Director) : petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this Federal Register notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. Arizona Public Service Company, et al., Docket Nos. STN 50-528, STN 50-529, and STN 50-530, Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, Unit Nos. 1, 2, and 3, Maricopa County, Arizona Date of amendment requests: January 13, 1994 Description of amendment requests: Request for NRC consent to the indirect transfer of control of El Paso Electric Company's interest in Operating License Nos. NPF-41, NPF-51, NPF-74 and to amend Operating License Nos. NPF-51 and NPF-74 to delete provisions for El Paso Electric Company's sale-leaseback arrangements. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensees have provided their analysis about the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: Standard 1 -- Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. This amendment request does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated because the proposed change is administrative in nature. The proposed change deletes Sections 2.B.(7)(a) and (b) of License No. NPF-51, and Sections 2.B.(6)(a) and (b) of License No. No. NPF-74. These section describe the structure of the financing of El Paso's interest in Palo Verde, specifically authorizing sale and leaseback transactions. The proposed change does not affect the assumptions used in the accident analyses, nor does the proposed change result in changes to the physical configuration of the facility, design parameters, technical specifications, or operation and maintenance of the facility. Therefore, this amendment request does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Standard 2 -- Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed. This amendment request does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed because the proposed change is administrative in nature. The proposed change deletes Sections 2.B.(7)(a) and (b) of License No. NPF-51, and Sections 2.B.(6)(a) and (b) of License No. NPF-74. These sections describe the structure of the financing of El Paso's interest in Palo Verde, specifically authorizing sale and leaseback transactions. The proposed change does not involve modifications to any of the existing equipment nor does the change affect the operation and maintenance of the facility. Therefore, this amendment request does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident not previously analyzed. Standard 3 -- Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. This amendment request does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because it is administrative in nature. The proposed change deletes Sections 2.B.(7)(a) and (b) of License No. NPF-51, and Sections 2.B.(6)(a) and (b) of License No. NPF-74. These sections describe the structure of the financing of El Paso's interest in Palo Verde, specifically authorizing sale and leaseback transactions. The proposed change does not involve changes to any existing plant equipment or accident analyses that provide for or establish margins of safety. There are no changes to the operation or maintenance of the facility and the existing margins of safety are not changed by the proposed change. Therefore, this amendment request does not involve a signigicant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensees' analysis and, based on that review, it appears that the proposed license amendment reflects only a change in the structure of the financing of El Paso's interest in Palo Verde and the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Phoenix Public Library, 12 East McDowell Road, Phoenix, Arizona 85004 Attorney for licensees: Nancy C. Loftin, Esq., Corporate Secretary and Counsel, Arizona Public Service Company, P.O. Box 53999, Mail Station 9068, Phoenix, Arizona 85072-3999 NRC Project Director: Theodore R. Quay Carolina Power & Light Company, et al., Docket No. 50-400, Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1, Wake and Chatham Counties, North Carolina Date of amendment request: February 4, 1994 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification 3/4.6.4, Containment Systems Combustible Gas Control, by eliminating the 12-hour channel check surveillance requirement for the containment hydrogen monitoring system in conformance with the new Standard Technical Specifications, NUREG-1431. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Final Safety Analysis Report [FSAR] section 6.2.5.2.3 states that the Hydrogen Analyzer is only required to be functioning (continuously indicating and recording hydrogen concentration) within 30 minutes of safety injection initiation. The performance of an analog operational test every 31 days and a channel calibration test every 92 days verifies this operability. Based on this, the monitors will be fully capable of performing their intended design function following a safety injection initiation. Therefore, the elimination of the 12-hour channel check would not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The Hydrogen Monitors perform an ``indication'' function only, [sic] to help ensure that hydrogen concentrations within containment are maintained below flammable limits during a post-LOCA [loss-of-coolant accident] condition. The proposed changes do not involve any modifications or additions to plant equipment and the design and operation of the plant will not be affected. Therefore, the elimination of the 12-hour channel check does not affect any parameters which relate to the margin of safety as defined in the Technical Specifications or the FSAR. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed elimination of the 12-hour channel check does not affect any parameters which relate to the margin of safety as defined in the Technical Specifications or the FSAR. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Cameron Village Regional Library, 1930 Clark Avenue, Raleigh, North Carolina 27605. Attorney for licensee: R. E. Jones, General Counsel, Carolina Power & Light Company, Post Office Box 1551, Raleigh, North Carolina 27602 NRC Project Director: S. Singh Bajwa Commonwealth Edison Company, Docket Nos. 50-237 and 50-249, Dresden Nuclear Power Station, Units 2 and 3, Grundy County, Illinois Date of amendment request: March 26, 1993 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would modify trip level settings for the Isolation Condenser and High Pressure Core Injection (HPCI) System Steam lines to more conservative values. In addition, the proposed amendment would revise the Emergency Core Cooling System Low-Low Water Level initiation trip level setting tolerance. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated because: HPCI Steamline High Flow Isolation Trip Level Setting The purpose of the HPCI leak detection systems are to detect breaks in the system piping. Normal steam flows within the system can fluctuate in excess of 250% rated flow and exceed 500% rated steam flow after experiencing a break. During the original licensing of the plant, it was analytically determined by GE that three times maximum steam flow (300%) is the optimum setpoint for the isolation of HPCI. A 300% steam flow setpoint ensures that spurious trips are avoided and that breaks in the piping are identified. Because the HPCI High Steamline Flow Isolation setpoint is not assumed as an accident precursor, the probability of any previously evaluated accident is not increased by the changed setpoint. The proposed changes to the setpoint allow a more accurate and conservative value for 300% steam flow. The proposed change in conjunction with a more conservative field setting ensures HPCI isolation occurring between the range of 300% and 500% steam flow, thus ensuring HPCI isolation in the event of a pipe break. Because the HPCI high steamline flow setpoint will be maintained above normally found operational values (272% steam flow) and below expected conditions with a pipe break (500% steam flow), the consequences of any previously evaluated accident are not increased with the proposed setpoint change. solation Condenser Steamline High Flow Isolation Trip Level Setting The purpose of the Isolation Condenser leak detection instrumentation is to detect breaks in the system piping. Normal steam flows within the system can fluctuate in excess of 250% rated flow and exceed 500% rated steam flow after experiencing a break. During the original licensing of the plant, it was analytically determined by GE that three times rated steam flow (300%) is the optimum setpoint for the isolation of the Isolation Condenser. A 300% steam flow Isolation setpoint ensures that spurious trips are avoided and that breaks in the piping are identified. Because the Isolation Condenser High Steamline Flow setpoint is not assumed as an accident precursor, the probability of any previously evaluated accident is not increased by the changed setpoint. The proposed changes to the setpoint provide a more accurate and conservative field setting for 300% steam flow. The proposed changes in conjunction with a more conservative field setting results in Isolation Condenser isolation occurring between the range of 300% and 500% steam flow, thus ensuring Isolation Condenser isolation in the event of a pipe break. Because the Isolation Condenser High Steamline Flow Isolation setpoint will be maintained above normally found operational values (272% steam flow) and below expected conditions with a pipe break (500% steam flow), the consequences of any previously evaluated accident are not increased with the proposed setpoint change. Reactor Low-Low Water Level Trip Level Setting Tolerance The Low-Low Reactor Water Level trip setting is designed to initiate ECCS when reactor water level is less than or equal to 444 inches above vessel zero. Top of active fuel (TAF) is defined as 360 inches above vessel zero. -59 inches is 84 inches above TAF. The present trip setting tolerance (84 inches, + 4, - 0, above TAF) only allows a deviation of 4 inches in the conservative direction. The proposed change (greater than or equal to 84 inches) does not impose a restriction on the limit toward the conservative direction. Because a level switch trip level setting by itself is not assumed as an accident precursor, the probability of any previously evaluated accident is not increased by the changed setpoint. The proposed change eliminates a restriction on the trip level setting for Low-Low Reactor Water Level. Dresden proposes modifying the acceptance limit of the Low-Low trip setting such that the instrument field setting will not deviate below 84 inches. Therefore, the actuation of appropriate ECCS are unchanged and the consequences of any previously evaluated accident are not increased with the proposed setpoint change. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because: HPCI Steamline High Flow Isolation Trip Level Setting The purpose of the HPCI Steamline High Flow Isolation trip level setting is to detect breaks in system piping and initiate isolation of the system if breaks are discovered. Normal steam flows within the system can fluctuate as high as 250% rated flow and exceed 500% rated steam flow after experiencing a break. 300% steam flow has been used as the setpoint to ensure that spurious trips are avoided and that breaks in the piping are identified. The changes to the HPCI High Steamline Flow setpoint ensure that isolation occurs at 300% rated steam flow (below 500% rated steam flow). The current setpoint will also isolate below 500% rated steam flow. Because the new setpoint continues to allow normal operational flexibility and ensures isolation in the event of a pipe break, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident than previously evaluated. Isolation Condenser Steamline High Flow Isolation Trip Level Setting The purpose of the Isolation Condenser Steamline High Flow Isolation trip level setting is to detect breaks in system piping and initiate isolation of the system if breaks are discovered. Normal steam flows within the system can fluctuate in excess of 250% rated flow and exceed 500% rated steam flow after experiencing a break. 300% steam flow has been used as the setpoint to ensure that spurious trips are avoided and ensures that isolation occurs at 300% rated steam flow (below 500% rated steam flow). The current setpoint will also isolate below 500% rated steam flow. Because the new setpoint continues to allow normal operational flexibility and ensures isolation in the event of a pipe break, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident than previously evaluated. Reactor Low-Low Level Trip Level Setting Tolerance The Reactor Low-Low Water Level trip setting is designed to initiate the appropriate ECCS when Reactor Water Level is decreasing. The proposed change to the setpoint only eliminates the overly burdensome restriction within the setpoint tolerances. The absolute low limit of 84 inches is unchanged, thus maintaining all assumptions related to 84 inches (-59 inches indicated level) within Dresden's Safety Analysis. The removal of the upper tolerance will not increase the probability of inadvertent ECCS initiation since the actual field setting will be at a reactor vessel level which has not been reached in 40 + years of operation at Dresden Units 2 and 3. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident than previously evaluated. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety because: High Pressure Coolant Injection Setpoint The HPCI high steamline flow setpoint ensures that isolation occurs at 300% maximum steam flow (below 500% rated steam flow). The current Technical Specification setpoint will also allow isolation below 500% rated steam flow but at a value greater than 300%. Thus, the proposed setpoint isolates at a lower steam flow rate than the current limit. Therefore, because isolation of HPCI would occur at a lower steam flow rate during a pipe break, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. Isolation Condenser Steamline High Flow Isolation Trip Level Setting The Isolation Condenser High Steamline Flow Isolation Trip Level setting ensures that isolation occurs at 300% rated steam flow (below 500% rated steam flow). The current setpoint will also isolate below 500% rated steam flow but at a value greater than 300%. Thus, the proposed setpoint isolates at a lower steam flow rate than the current limit. Therefore, because isolation of the Isolation Condenser would occur at a lower steam flow rate during a pipe break, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. Reactor Low-Low Level Trip Level Setting Tolerance The Reactor Low-Low Water Level trip setting tolerance ensures the proper initiation of appropriate ECCS in the event of a loss of inventory to the vessel. The proposed change to the setpoint only eliminates the restriction within the setpoint tolerances. The absolute low limit of 84 inches is unchanged, thus maintaining all assumptions related to 84 inches (minus 59 inches indicated) within Dresden's Safety Analysis. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Morris Public Library, 604 Liberty Street, Morris, Illinois 60450 Attorney for licensee: Michael I. Miller, Esquire; Sidley and Austin, One First National Plaza, Chicago, Illinois 60690 NRC Project Director: James E. Dyer Commonwealth Edison Company, Docket Nos. 50-254 and 50-265, Quad Cities Nuclear Power Station, Units 1 and 2, Rock Island County, Illinois Date of amendment request: December 20, 1993 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would revise a minimum critical power ratio (MCPR) safety limit from 1.06 to 1.07 based on General Electric Standard Application for Reactor Fuel II (GESTAR II) NEDE-24011-P-A-10 for GE10 fuel design. The NRC staff has previously reviewed and approved the GE10 fuel design. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated because: The change is based on GE's generic rule licensing document GESTAR II (NEDE-24011-P-A-10) which has conservatively addressed the use of GE10 fuel in D-lattice cores with NRC approved methods and therefore does not adversely affect the consequences of previously evaluated accidents. The Safety Limit MCPR change does not affect the probability of analyzed accidents because it does not adversely impact any equipment important to safety. Increasing the Safety Limit MCPR from 1.06 to 1.07 upon implementation of GE10 fuel for Cycle 14 operation of Quad Cities Units 1 and 2 therefore does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated in the FSAR. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because: The Safety Limit MCPR change results from the use of NRC approved methods in GESTAR II NEDE-24011-P-A-10 for application to GE10 fuel for Cycle 14 for Quad Cities Units 1 and 2. The Safety Limit MCPR change does not result in any new interaction with equipment related to the safe shutdown of the plant. The change does not adversely impact equipment important to safety and, therefore does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident scenario. Therefore, the Safety Limit MCPR change from 1.06 to 1.07 in no way creates the possibility of a new or different kind of accident scenario from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because: Since the GE10 design in a D-lattice core has a geometry between C-lattice and D-lattice designs and the C-lattice design has a higher, more restrictive safety limit MCPR that the D-lattice design, the use of C-lattice safety limit MCPR for the GE10 design is a conservative approach. The GE10 fuel design has been generically analyzed with approved methods per GESTAR II NEDE-24011-P-A-10 and the use of the 1.07 Safety Limit MCPR value has been previously approved as conservative for application to GE10 fuel in D-lattice plants such as Quad Cities. Therefore, the proposed change to increase the Safety Limit MCPR from 1.06 to 1.07 maintains the margin to safety relative to the current level. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Dixon Public Library, 221 Hennepin Avenue, Dixon, Illinois 61021 Attorney for licensee: Michael I. Miller, Esquire; Sidley and Austin, One First National Plaza, Chicago, Illinois 60690 NRC Project Director: James E. Dyer Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Docket No. 50-247, Indian Point Nuclear Generating Unit No. 2, Westchester County, New York Date of amendment request: December 10, 1993 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment request would revise the Technical Specifications to amend (1) Section 5.3.A (Reactor Core) to allow the use of VANTAGE + fuel with ZIRLO cladding and fuel with filler rods to allow fuel reconstitution, and (2) the Basis to Section 2.1 (Safety Limit: Reactor Core) to allow the use of departure from nucleate boiling (DNB) Correlations applicable to VANTAGE + fuel. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: Consistent with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.92, the enclosed application involves no significant hazards based on the following information: 1. Does the proposed license amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated? Response: Neither the probability nor the consequences of an accident previously analyzed is increased due to the proposed changes. As discussed in [Letter from Thadani to Tritch, ``Acceptance for Referencing of Topical Report WCAP-12610, VANTAGE + Fuel Assembly Reference Core Report'' (TAC No. 77258) July 1, 1991] the fuel containing ZIRLO clad will meet all the same material and mechanical design criteria as the Zircaloy clad fuel. The use of approved Westinghouse Methodology for fuel assembly reconstitution as documented in [Letter from Thadani to Tritch, ``Acceptance for Referencing of Topical Report WCAP-13060-P, Westinghouse Fuel Assembly Reconstitution Evaluation Methodology'' (TAC No. M821391), March 30, 1993] will ensure that all criteria are met. The change to the basis of Section 2.1 more accurately describes DNB methodology and application. 2. Does the proposed license amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated? Response: The changes will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. The proposed changes involve approved methodology which have been shown to meet design and safety criteria. In addition, approved procedures will be used to implement the changes. Response: 3. Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety? The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The changes involve the use of approved methodology which meet design and safety criteria. The change to the Section 2.1 basis is descriptive and will more accurately describe the DNB methodology used in conjunction with the use of VANTAGE + fuel. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: White Plains Public Library, 100 Martine Avenue, White Plains, New York 10610. Attorney for licensee: Brent L. Brandenburg, Esq., 4 Irving Place, New York, New York 10003. NRC Project Director: Robert A. Capra Duke Power Company, et al., Docket Nos. 50-413 and 50-414, Catawba Nuclear Station, Units 1 and 2, York County, South Carolina Date of amendment request: September 28, 1993 Description of amendment request: The requested amendments would delete the portion of the 18-month surveillance requirement on the autoclosure interlock (ACI) contained in TS 4.5.2.d associated with verifying that the decay heat removal system suction isolation valves automatically close on a reactor coolant system pressure signal. The terms decay heat removal (ND) and residual heat removal (RHR) are used interchangeably here. Also, an obsolete footnote to TS 4.5.2.e relating to the completion of the first Unit 1 refueling outage is proposed to be deleted. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: The requested amendments reference Westinghouse topical report WCAP-11736-A, ``Residual Heat Removal System Autoclosure Interlock Removal Report for the Westinghouse Owners Group'', for the general justification and safety analysis for removing the ACI feature from the Catawba ND suction isolation valves. This WCAP, which specifically covers the Catawba Nuclear station, has been deemed an acceptable reference by the NRC for use in making plant-specific licensing submittals. Additional Catawba-specific information/ improvements and analyses, as required by the WCAP and associated NRC safety evaluation, have been either completed or committed to, thereby ensuring that the WCAP/SE conclusion that removal of the RHR ACI produces a net safety benefit remains valid. Criterion 1 The requested amendments will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The deletion of the RHR ACI was analyzed in the WCAP for Callaway Nuclear Station in terms of (1) the frequency of an interfacing LOCA, (2) the availability of the RHR system, and (3) the effect on overpressure transients. Callaway is the WCAP's reference plant for Catawba Units 1 and 2, and a Catawba-specific Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) review of the WCAP determined that removal of the ND ACI at Catawba will not invalidate the basic conclusions of the WCAP. Consequently, the following information from the Callaway analysis is considered applicable to Catawba Units 1 and 2. With the removal of the ACI and addition of a control room alarm, the probabilistic risk analysis predicts a decrease in the frequency of interfacing LOCAs from 1.52E-06/year to 1.16E-06/year, a decrease of approximately 24%. The availability of the RHR system was analyzed in three phases: initiation, short term cooling, and long term cooling. The probabilistic analysis indicated that deletion of the RHR ACI has no impact on the failure probability for RHR initiation. During short term cooling (72 hours after initiation), RHR ACI deletion decreased the RHR failure probability by 12%, from 1.64E-02 to 1.44E-02. The long term cooling RHR failure probability was calculated to decrease by 70%, from 3.91E-02 to 1.17E-02. Appendix D of the WCAP presents the analysis used to determine the effect of removal of the ACI on overpressurization transients. The analysis categorizes the types of initiating events, determines their frequency of occurrence, and then identifies the consequences of these occurrences both with and without the ACI feature. The result is a list of overpressure consequence categories with associated failure probabilities (reference the WCAP's Appendix D, Tables D-14, -15, and -16). For the charging/safety injection event, consequence frequencies increased on the order of 1.0E-12/shutdown year. This is an insignificant increase, as the overall consequence frequency of the charging/safety injection event is 1.25E-01. Likewise, for the letdown isolation with RHR system operable case, one frequency category was increased on the order of 1.0E-15. Again, this is insignificant when compared with the total frequency of these events of 1.25E-01. For the letdown isolation with RHR system isolated event, the overall consequence frequency was reduced from 4.45E-01 to 2.22E-01. This occurs because many spurious closures of the RHR isolation valves cause the isolation of letdown. Removing the RHR ACI reduces the frequency of this event by approximately 50%. It is concluded that the removal of the RHR ACI circuitry has an insignificant impact on the frequency of overpressurization events at Callaway (and thus Catawba) Nuclear Station. Criterion 2 The requested amendments will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The effect of an overpressure transient at cold shutdown conditions will not be altered by removal of the ND ACI function. With or without the ACI function, the ND system could be subject to overpressrue for which the ND relief valves must be relied upon to limit pressure to within ND design parameters. While it is true that the ACI initiates an automatic closure of the ND suction/isolation valves on high NC system pressure, overpressure protection of the ND system is provided by the ND system relief valves and not by the suction/isolation valves that isolate the ND system from the NC system. (Refer to NUREG-0954, ``Safety Evaluation Report related to the operation of Catawba Nuclear Station, Units 1 and 2,'' Section 5.4.4.3.) The purpose of the ACI feature is to ensure that there is a double barrier between the ND system and the NC system when the plant is at normal operating conditions (i.e., heated and pressurized) and not in the ND cooling mode. Thus, the ACI feature serves to preclude conditions that could lead to a LOCA outside of containment due to operator error. The safety function of the ACI is not to isolate the ND system from the NC system when the ND system is operating in the decay heat removal mode. There are several methods to ensure that there is a double barrier between the ND system and the NC system when the plant is at normal operating conditions. First, plant operating procedures instruct the operators to isolate the ND system during plant heatup. Second, the alarm that will be installed as part of this change will annunciate in the control room given an open or intermediate valve position signal in conjunction with a high NC pressure signal. This alarm will alert operators that any of the four suction/isolation valves is (are) not fully closed and that double isolation has not been achieved. In conjunction with this alarm, operators will be trained using an annunciator response procedure to ensure that they act to restore double isolation or return to a safe shutdown condition. Third, the Open Permissive Interlock (OPI), which is not being removed, will prevent the opening of the valves whenever NC system pressure is greater than 385.5 psig. Since relief valves prevent overpressurization of the ND system during shutdown conditions and since several methods are in place to ensure that the ND system is isolated from the NC system during normal plant conditions, removal of the ACI will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. Criterion 3 The requested amendments will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The ND ACI function is not a consideration in a margin of safety in the basis for any technical specification. Since the probabilistic analysis of the WCAP for Callaway (which is applicable to Catawba as discussed above) indicates that the availability of the RHR system is increased with the removal of the ACI, overall safety will be increased. In addition, similar amendments for other Westinghouse plants in the past have been determined to not involve significant hazards considerations. Based upon the preceding analyses, Duke Power Company concludes that the requested amendments do not involve a significant hazards consideration. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Plisco, Acting Duke Power Company, et al., Docket Nos. 50-413 and 50-414, Catawba Nuclear Station, Units 1 and 2, York County, South Carolina Date of amendment request: January 27, 1994 Description of amendment request: The requested amendments delete the verification that each upper and lower Containment Purge System (VP) supply and exhaust valve actuates to its isolation position on a High Relative Humidity (>70%) isolation test signal and will allow elimination of the humidity control function of the VP System humidistats. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: CRITERION 1 This TS [Technical Specification] amendment will not increase the probability or consequences of an accident which has been previously evaluated. No physical changes will be made to the plant that would impact fuel handling inside containment, therefore, there is no increase in the probability of an accident. Control wiring changes that remove the humidistats from the [Containment Purge] System control circuits will be the only physical change. The heaters will be maintained providing additional margin over analyzed conditions. For the reasons stated above, there will be no increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated. CRITERION 2 This proposed TS amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. This proposed TS amendment will not cause any physical changes to the plant that will impact the handling of fuel inside containment or changes to fuel handling procedures. Because the plant will operate the same way it does now, this proposed amendment does not create the possibility of any new or different accident from any previously evaluated. CRITERION 3 This proposed TS change will not cause a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The test method use[d] to evaluate the carbon after TS changes #90 ([Unit] 1) and #84 ([Unit] 2) does not consider heater availability. However the heaters will be tested and maintained per Technical specification 4.9.4.2.d.2. Therefore, the relative humidity of the air entering the carbon adsorber is never expected to reach 95% [relative humidity]. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Plisco, Acting Entergy Operations, Inc., Docket No. 50-313, Arkansas Nuclear One, Unit No. 1 (ANO-1), Pope County, Arkansas Date of amendment request: January 13, 1994 Description of amendment request: This amendment revises the specifications governing the reactor protection (RPS). It modifies the use of the RPS channel bypass as specified by Technical Specification (TS) 3.5.1.3 and revises a note with Table 3.5.1-1, to refer to a more appropriate action. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: Criterion 1 - Does Not Involve a Significant Increase in the Probability or Consequences of an Accident Previously Evaluated. The RPS and EFIC [emergency feedwater initiation and control] system provide accident mitigation features and are not considered to be accident initiators. The accident mitigation features of the plant are not affected by the proposed amendment. In any configuration allowed by the revised specifications, the trip logic instituted on the RPS is at least equivalent to the trip logic instituted by placing a channel in channel or maintenance bypass. The RPS remains single-failure proof with one channel in channel bypass, manually tripped, or with an inoperable function unbypassed in the untripped state. Therefore, upon receipt of an initiating signal, a single failure will not prevent the proper actuation of RPS. Should a channel of RPS contain an inoperable function unbypassed in the untripped condition which does not affect an EFIC channel, any channel of EFIC may be placed in maintenance bypass. RPS and EFIC remain single-failure proof in this configuration. Administrative controls are established to ensure that all inoperable RPS functions are evaluated for continued operation in the untripped state. Upon detection of a failed function in any channel of RPS, the administratively controlled condition reporting process evaluates the failure and its effect on other systems for continued operability. The operator is informed of the continuing status of inoperable functions through the use of Station Log entries and Plant Status board entries. In addition, during operation with an inoperable function in the untripped, unbypassed condition, the remaining RPS channel key-lock channel bypass switches will be ``Hold Carded'' (tagged) to prevent their operation without prior management approval consistent with the requirements of TS Table 3.5.1-1. Plant management maintains the responsibility to approve continued operation with inoperable functions unbypassed in the untripped state to ensure that the plant is operated in the safest configuration with regard to the extent of the failure, and the plant operating conditions. Prior to placing any channel of RPS or EFIC in bypass, the operator checks the status of redundant systems for operability and TS compliance and takes the proper action as required by existing plant conditions, plant operating procedures and TS. The clarification to TS 3.5.1.3 which directs the operator to the appropriate actions if multiple channels become inoperable, or in the event of an inoperable channel or inoperable function occurring concurrent with one channel in bypass is considered to be administrative in nature. The change to Note 6 of Table 3.5.1-1 results in the correction of misleading information and directs the Operator to place the plant in a safe mode depending on the system which is affected by a failure, and is also considered to be administrative in nature. The Bases changes add additional information to clarify the specifications. Therefore, this change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated. Criterion 2 - Does Not Create the Possibility of a New or Different Kind of Accident from any Previously Evaluated. The probability or consequences of equipment important to safety malfunctioning will not be increased. In any configuration allowed by the revised specifications, the trip logic instituted on the RPS is at least equivalent to the trip logic instituted by placing a channel in channel bypass. The RPS remains single-failure proof with one channel in channel bypass, manually tripped, or with an inoperable function unbypassed in the untripped state. Therefore, upon receipt of an initiating signal, a single failure will not prevent the proper actuation of RPS. Should a channel of RPS contain an inoperable function unbypassed in the untripped condition which does not affect an EFIC channel, any channel of EFIC may be placed in maintenance bypass. RPS and EFIC remain single-failure proof in this configuration. The clarification to TS 3.5.1.3 which directs the operator to the appropriate actions if multiple channels become inoperable, or in the event of an inoperable channel or inoperable function occurring concurrent with one channel in bypass is considered to be administrative in nature. The change to Note 6 of Table 3.5.1-1 is also considered to be administrative in nature, in that misleading information in the specification has been corrected to an appropriate requirement. The Bases changes add additional information to clarify the specifications. Therefore, this change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. Criterion 3 - Does Not Involve a Significant Reduction in the Margin of Safety. The RPS and EFIC system have the same capabilities to mitigate and/or prevent accidents as they had prior to this proposed change. Allowing flexibility in the response to a function failure in one channel of RPS allows placing the plant in the safest operating condition for the existing plant conditions considering the extent of the function failure. Operation of an RPS channel with an inoperable function unbypassed in the untripped state results in placing the inoperable function in a 2-out-of-3 trip logic (equivalent to channel bypass) while the remainder of the RPS functions remain in the normal 2-out-of-4 trip logic. The ANO-1 RPS has been reviewed as a 3 channel system with one channel in bypass. Implementing this change results in additional conservatism with respect to any postulated single-failures. Administrative controls are established to ensure that all inoperable RPS functions are evaluated for continued operation in the untripped state. Upon detection of a failed function in any channel of RPS, the administratively controlled condition reporting process evaluates the failure and its effect on other systems for continued operability. The operator is informed of the continuing status of inoperable functions through the use of Station Log entries and Plant Status board entries. In addition, during operation with an inoperable function in the untripped, bypassed condition, the remaining RPS channel key-lock channel bypass switches will be ``Hold Carded'' (tagged) to prevent their operation without prior management approval consistent with the requirements of TS Table 3.5.1-1. Plant management maintains the responsibility to approve continued operation with inoperable functions unbypassed in the untripped state to ensure that the plant is operated in the safest configuration with regard to the extent of the failure, and the plant operating conditions. Prior to placing any channel of RPS or EFIC in bypass, the operator checks the status of redundant systems for operability and TS compliance and takes the proper action as required by existing plant conditions, plant operating procedures and TS. Should a channel of RPS contain an inoperable function unbypassed in the untripped condition which does not affect an EFIC channel, any channel of EFIC may be placed in maintenance bypass. RPS and EFIC remain single-failure proof in this configuration. The clarification of TS 3.5.1.3 which directs the operator to the appropriate actions if multiple channels become inoperable, or in the event of an inoperable channel or inoperable function occurring concurrent with one channel in bypass is considered to be administrative in nature. The change to Note 6 or Table 3.5.1-1 results in the correction of misleading information and directs the Operator to place the plant in a safe mode depending on the system which is affected by a failure, and is also considered to be administrative in nature. The Bases changes add additional information to clarify the specifications. Therefore, this change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

Local Public Document Room location: Tomlinson Library, Arkansas Tech University, Russellville, Arkansas 72801 Attorney for licensee: Nicholas S. Reynolds, Esquire, Winston and Strawn, 1400 L Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20005-3502 NRC Project Director: William D. Beckner Entergy Operations, Inc., et al., Docket No. 50-416, Grand Gulf Nuclear Station, Unit 1, Claiborne County, Mississippi Date of amendment request: January 13, 1994 Description of amendment request: This amendment requests the removal of the interim technical specification limit on the number of spent fuel assemblies that may be stored in the spent fuel pool at Grand Gulf Nuclear Station. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. No significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated results from this change. The NRC approved the installation of high density spent fuel storage racks in Amendment 17 to the Grand Gulf Nuclear Station (GGNS) Operating License. This amendment also brought GGNS into compliance with Standard Review Plan criteria which required maintaining the spent fuel pool at less than or equal 140 ○F. The 140 ○F Technical Specifications (TS) limit remains in effect thereby preventing operation at excessive temperatures. The only outstanding question from Amendment 17, which resulted in a 2324 assembly technical specification limit, was whether the fuel pool cooling system could handle the heat load of a full fuel pool without excessive reliance on residual heat removal for extensive fuel pool cooling assist. Entergy Operations' proposed solution to this question was accepted in the NRC's letter dated July 30, 1992. The NRC accepted the solution pending submittal of results from tests to verify the specified flows. These results were submitted in a letter dated November 08, 1993. With previous approval of the installation of the high density spent fuel storage racks, the confirmation of adequate heat removal capability, and the 140 ○F TS temperature limit, removal of the 2324 limit to allow full use of the spent fuel pool would not cause an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. This change would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The additional heat load generated by a full spent fuel pool (4348 assemblies) was evaluated. The evaluation concluded that full use of the spent fuel pool storage spaces would not exceed the temperature limits as are currently in place with the 2324 limit. The NRC letter dated July 30, 1992 and Entergy Operations letter dated November 08, 1993 resolved all outstanding heat removal questions. Therefore, this change would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. 3. This change would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Entergy Operations demonstrated in their November 01, 1991 letter that the fuel pool temperature could be maintained at or below 140*F as specified in TS 3/4.7.9. This letter also demonstrated the ability to handle single active failures. Approval of measures outlined in this letter was provided in a Safety Evaluation Report contained in an NRC letter dated July 30, 1992. Given the 140 ○F maximum temperature requirement as contained in TS 3/4.7.9 and compliance with single active failure criteria, this change would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Based on the above evaluation in accordance with 10CFR50l92(c), Entergy Operations, Inc. has concluded that operation in accordance with the proposed amendment involves no significant hazards considerations. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Judge George W. Armstrong Library, Post Office Box 1406, S. Commerce at Washington, Natchez, Mississippi 39120 Attorney for licensee: Nicholas S. Reynolds, Esquire, Winston and Strawn, 1400 L Street, N.W., 12th Floor, Washington, DC 20005-3502 NRC Project Director: William D. Beckner Florida Power and Light Company, Docket Nos. 50-250 and 50-251, Turkey Point Plant Units 3 and 4, Dade County, Florida Date of amendment request: December 28, 1993 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendments would revise the Technical Specifications (TS) for Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 to incorporate features for steam generator (SG) overfill protection. Specifically, TS Tables 3.3-2, 3.3-3, 4.3-2 and the associated BASES section would be revised to add SG Water Level-High-High protection logic, instrumentation trip setpoints and surveillance requirements. The proposed TS changes would be in accordance with NRC Generic Letter (GL) 89-19, ``Safety Implication of Control Systems in LWR Nuclear Power Plants.'' Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As a result of the technical resolution of USI A-47, ``Safety Implications of Control Systems in LWR Nuclear Power Plants,'' the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or the staff) concluded that all Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR) plants should provide automatic SG overfill protection. On September 20, 1989, the staff issued GL 89-19 and recommended that plant procedures and TS include provisions for automatic SG overfill protection including surveillance requirements to assure that automatic overfill protection is available to mitigate main feedwater overfeed events during reactor power operation. The licensee proposed TS changes in response to GL 89-19. No physical changes to the plant would be required as a result of the proposed license amendments. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: (1) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Including the SG Overfill protection requirements in the Technical Specifications is not assumed in the initiation of any analyzed event. These amendments will not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated since the SG overfill event is not required or assumed for accident mitigation in any Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) safety analyses that comprise Turkey Point licensing basis. The additional requirements for the SG overfill system helps ensure that continuous addition of feedwater and carryover of excessive moisture to the turbine, is prevented. As a result, equipment protection is improved by the availability of this system function. As such, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. (2) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The operation of the facility will not change as a result of the proposed license amendments, since Turkey Point currently maintains this protection logic. This change involves only the inclusion of the systems requirements into the Technical Specifications. The proposed change will not impose any new or unique requirements. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. (3) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety as the function, operation and testing of the installed SG Overfill protection is not described in the UFSAR. In addition, the SG overfill protection logic is not required or assumed for accident mitigation in any of the safety analyses that comprise the Turkey Point licensing basis. The proposed change formalizes the existing design, operating and testing requirements in the Technical Specifications. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The proposed change to the Technical Specifications does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated because the redundant train will remain available to assure that the RHR will respond to an accident as assumed in the accident analysis. A one time increase in the allowable outage time from 3 to 7 days has been shown to have only a small effect on the calculated frequency of core damage. 2. The proposed change to the Technical Specifications does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because the change only results in a one time increase of the allowable outage time. It does not result in an operational condition different from that which has already been considered by the Technical Specifications. 3. The proposed addition to the Technical Specifications does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because the effects of increasing the allowed outage time on the calculated core damage frequency has been evaluated and determined to be small. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.

The title of the position responsible for the management of the Nuclear Division has also been changed to ``Vice President, Nuclear'' from ``Manager-Nuclear Division.'' Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1) The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. No physical or operational changes to the DAEC will result from changing the corporate name or the position title. The DAEC will continue to be operated in the same manner with the same organization. The position title change results from the elimination of a layer of management. Formerly, the Manager-Nuclear Division reported through the Vice President, Production to the President of IELP. Now the Nuclear Division is headed by the Vice President, Nuclear who reports directly to the President of the corporation. 2) The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. No physical or operational changes will result. The title change results from the elimination of a layer of management. 3) The proposed change will not reduce any margin of safety. This change only revises the operating company name and changes a title.

Local Public Document Room location: Cedar Rapids Public Library, 500 First Street, S.E., Cedar Rapids, Iowa 52401 Attorney for licensee: Jack Newman, Esquire, Kathleen H. Shea, Esquire, Newman and Holtzinger, 1615 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20036 NRC Project Director: John N. Hannon Indiana Michigan Power Company, Docket Nos. 50-315 and 50-316, Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Berrien County, Michigan Date of amendment requests: January 17, 1994 Description of amendment requests: The proposed amendments would change Technical Specification (TS) 3/4.1.3 for both units to increase the limit for control rod misalignment at or below 85% rated thermal power (RTP). The proposed changes would also increase the TS limit for control rod 8misalignment about 85% RTP if there is sufficient margin in the heat flux (F Q (Z)) and the nuclear enthalpy (F N delta H ) hot channel factors. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: Per 10 CFR 50.92, a proposed amendment to an operating license will not involve a significant hazards consideration if the proposed amendment satisfies the following three criteria: 1. Does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed, 2. Does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed or evaluated, or 3. Does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Criteria 1 and 3 As seen in Attachment 4 [of the amendment request], sufficient margin exists in power distribution at 85% RTP to allow for increased misalignment. At 100% RTP, increased misalignment is allowed only if there is adequate margin in the peaking factors. Therefore, initial conditions remain unchanged from that assumed in the safety analyses. As far as the dropped rod and rod ejection accidents are concerned, the analyses were performed with conservative assumptions to envelope the increased misalignment. It should be noted that the power dependent insertion limit for Unit 1 will be changed in a conservative manner at the beginning of cycle 14. Based on these analyses, it is concluded that the proposed T/S changes do not significantly increase the probability or consequences of a previously analyzed accident or constitute a significant reduction in the margin of safety. Criterion 2 The proposed T/S changes will not result in physical changes to the plant. Therefore, we believe that the proposed T/S changes will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. Also, operation of the reactor with possible deeper rod insertion will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.

Randolph Blough, Acting Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, Docket No. 50-220, Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station Unit No. 1, Oswego County, New York Date of amendment request: January 21, 1994 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification (TS) 4.6.3, (Emergency Power Sources) to eliminate unnecessary testing of an operable emergency diesel generator (EDG) when the redundant EDG becomes inoperable. Eliminating unnecessary testing will potentially increase EDG reliability by reducing the stresses caused by such testing. The licensee stated that this proposed change is consistent with the guidance provided in NUREG-1366, ``Improvements to Technical Specifications Surveillance Requirements,'' and NUREG-1433, ``Improved Standard Technical Specifications, General Electric Plants.'' Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Technical Specification 4.6.3.e requires that the operable diesel-generator be manually started and operated at rated load for a minimum time of one hour immediately and once per week thereafter in the event any diesel-generator becomes inoperable. Niagara Mohawk proposes to revise Technical Specification 4.6.3.e such that if a diesel-generator is declared inoperable due to preplanned maintenance or testing or due to a support system being inoperable, redundant diesel-generator testing would not be required. Declaring a diesel-generator inoperable due to preplanned maintenance or testing or due to a support system being inoperable does not affect the reliability of the operable diesel-generator nor does it in any way imply that a common cause failure exists. The normally required Technical Specification surveillance testing schedule demonstrates acceptable reliability and assures that the operable diesel-generator is capable of performing its intended safety function. Niagara Mohawk proposes to add wording to Technical Specification 4.6.3.e to permit an operator to evaluate a diesel-generator failure to determine if a common cause failure exists before requiring testing of the redundant diesel-generator. As noted above, the intent of the additional diesel-generator testing is, in part, to determine if a common cause failure exists. Once the potential for a common cause failure has been examined and dismissed, testing beyond the normal surveillance schedule is excessive and does not contribute to improved diesel-generator reliability. Within eight (8) hours, the determination that no common cause failure exists is required to be completed or the operable diesel-generator will be tested. Eight (8) hours is consistent with the guidance provided in NUREG-1366, ``Improvements to Technical Specifications Surveillance Requirements.'' Technical Specification 4.6.3.e requires that the operable diesel-generator be operated at rated load (i.e., connected to offsite power) to demonstrate its operability in the event any diesel-generator becomes inoperable. As indicated in Information Notice 84-69, when a diesel-generator is operated connected to offsite or non-vital loads, the emergency power system is not independent of disturbances on the non-vital and offsite power systems. Therefore, diesel-generator availability is potentially lessened by a demonstration of operability requiring connection of the diesel-generator to offsite power sources. At a time when at least one diesel-generator is already inoperable, this Surveillance Requirement could add further risk to losing the remaining operable diesel-generator. Therefore, Niagara Mohawk proposes that Surveillance Requirement 4.6.3.e be changed such that a diesel-generator does not have to be operated at rated load. These changes will preclude offsite power source disturbances from affecting diesel-generator reliability. Existing Technical Specification 4.6.3.e requires that the operable diesel-generator be started immediately in the event a diesel-generator becomes inoperable. The requirement to immediately test a diesel-generator is overly burdensome when compared to more recent diesel-generator Technical Specification requirements. As previously discussed, Niagara Mohawk proposes to add wording to Technical Specification 4.6.3.e to give an operator eight (8) hours to determine whether a common cause failure exists or to test the operable diesel-generator when a diesel-generator is declared inoperable for a reason other than an inoperable support system or preplanned maintenance or testing. Eight (8) hours is consistent with the guidance provided in NUREG-1366, ``Improvements to Technical Specifications Surveillance Requirements.'' Existing Technical Specification 4.6.3.e requires that the operable diesel-generator be tested immediately and once per week thereafter. Technical Specification 3.6.3.c requires that an inoperable diesel-generator be returned to an operable condition within seven (7) days to meet the Limiting Condition for Operation. Therefore, the requirement to test the operable diesel-generator ``once a week thereafter'' is not applicable. In addition, testing the operable diesel-generator one time is adequate to confirm operability of a diesel-generator. Repetitive testing following initial confirmation of operability is unwarranted. Therefore, Niagara Mohawk proposes to delete the requirement to test the operable diesel-generator weekly following the initial test. Because the proposed change does not affect the design or performance of the diesel-generators nor adversely affect the reliability of the diesel-generators, the change will not result in an increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated (i.e., Station Blackout analyses). Because this change does not affect the probability of accident precursors, the proposed change does not affect the probability of an accident previously evaluated. The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated The proposed change to Technical Specification 4.6.3.e does not introduce any new operating configurations or new accident precursors and does not involve any physical alterations to plant configurations which could initiate a new or different kind of accident. The proposed change does not affect the design or performance characteristics of the diesel-generators nor does the change create the possibility of the loss of both diesel-generators because common cause failure assessments will be performed. The change will delete excessive diesel-generator testing and therefore increase overall plant safety by increasing diesel-generator reliability. Therefore, the proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety The proposed change to Technical Specification 4.6.3.e will not reduce the number of emergency power sources required by Technical Specification Limiting Condition for Operation 3.6.3 or affect the normal surveillance requirements as described in Technical Specification 4.6.3. The normal surveillance tests demonstrate acceptable reliability and assure that the operable diesel-generator is capable of performing its intended function. The proposed change to delete the excessive testing requirements does not affect the design or performance of any diesel-generator and does not adversely affect diesel-generator reliability. Eliminating unnecessary testing will potentially increase diesel-generator reliability by reducing the stresses caused by such testing. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Wetterhahn, Esquire, Winston & Strawn, 1400 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005-3502. NRC Project Director: Robert A. Capra Northern States Power Company, Docket No. 50-263, Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant, Wright County, Minnesota Date of amendment request: November 30, 1993 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would change sections 3.2/4.2, Protective Instrumentation, and 3.17/4.17, Control Room Habitability, by deleting the requirements for a chlorine detection system and revises the limiting conditions for operation for the Control Room Ventilation System to be more consistent with Standard Technical Specifications. Due to design changes at the Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant, chlorine is no longer stored onsite as a liquified gas and regulations requiring early warning of an onsite chlorine release do not apply. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. Concerning Deletion of Requirements for the Chlorine Detection System The proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Postulated chemical releases of chlorine have been shown to be such that incapacitation of the control room operators would not occur within allowed time frames for the donning of protective breathing equipment, or that the probability of a chlorine trucking transportation accident which causes incapacitation of control room operators with potential consequences of a radioactive release in excess of 10 CFR 100 guidelines is well below the level of concern as established in regulatory guidance. Therefore, this amendment will not cause a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated for the Monticello plant. The proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed. The performance of a new toxic chemical analysis for the Monticello site has demonstrated that human detection may be relied upon to detect chlorine toxic chemical releases. Operator protection is established via the donning of protective breathing equipment. The capability to manually isolate the control room with dampers is retained. The ability of the operators to cope with a chlorine toxic gas hazard remains consistent with the protection measures available for other toxic chemicals stored onsite, stored in the vicinity of the site, or transported near the plant site. The proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. The proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The performance of a new toxic chemical analysis for the Monticello site has demonstrated that incapacitation of the control room operators would not occur within allowed time frames for the donning of protective breathing equipment and that a postulated hazardous chemical release due to a trucking transportation accident involving chlorine is of a sufficiently low probability of occurrence that it need not be considered. The basis of the chlorine detectors and associated Technical Specifications is to provide protection against an accident scenario which has been demonstrated to be of extremely low probability (a trucking transportation accident involving chlorine within five miles of the plant), therefore removal of the chlorine detectors from the plant design and the associated Technical Specifications will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 2. Concerning the Limiting Conditions for Operation for the Control Room Ventilation System and Technical Specification Bases The proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The Control Room Ventilation system ensures that Main Control Room habitability is maintained such that personnel and equipment located in the control room can respond to mitigate the consequences of an accident. The system does not contribute to the probability of occurrence of any design basis accident. The operability requirements as proposed for the revised specification 3.17.A ensure that the Control Room Ventilation system is operable during plant conditions for which significant radioactive releases are postulated consistent with the Standard Technical Specification. The proposed changes ensure the Control Room Ventilation system is restored to an operable status or that actions are taken to minimize the importance of the system function within time frames which take into consideration the low probability of an event occurring which would require Control Room Ventilation system function. Therefore, this amendment will not cause a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated for the Monticello plant. The proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed. The proposed changes to Technical Specifications 3.17.A do not alter the function of the Control Room Ventilation system or its interrelationships with other systems. The proposed changes provide requirements to ensure the Control Room Ventilation system is capable of performing its required function or that actions are taken to minimize the potential for its function being required consistent with regulatory guidance; therefore, this amendment will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed. The proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The operability requirements as proposed for the revised specification 3.17.A ensure that the Control Room Ventilation system is operable during plant conditions for which significant radioactive releases are postulated. The performance of a new toxic chemical analysis for the Monticello site has demonstrated that a postulated hazardous chemical release due to a trucking transportation accident involving chlorine is of a sufficiently low probability of occurrence that it need not be considered. As the basis of the chlorine detectors and current operability requirements for the control Room Ventilation system is to provide protection against an accident scenario which has been demonstrated to be of extremely low probability, the proposed revision to the Control Room Ventilation operability requirements will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed changes to Technical Specification 3.17.A ensure that both trains of the Control Room Ventilation system are restored to an operable status within a time frame which takes into consideration the low probability of an event occurring requiring Control Room Ventilation system function, the availability of the redundant Control Room Ventilation train and the capability of the safety related Emergency Filtration Train to pressurize the control room without the Control Room Ventilation system. The proposed changes provide requirements to ensure the Control Room Ventilation system is capable of performing its required function or that actions are taken to minimize the potential for its function to be required consistent with regulatory guidance; therefore, the proposed change will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Minneapolis Public Library, Technology and Science Department, 300 Nicollet Mall, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55401 Attorney for licensee: Gerald Charnoff, Esq., Shaw, Pittman, Potts and Trowbridge, 2300 N Street, NW, Washington, DC 20037 NRC Project Director: L. B. Marsh Northern States Power Company, Docket No. 50-263, Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant, Wright County, Minnesota Date of amendment request: January 3, 1994 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would revise the requirements of Technical Specification 4.6.E.1.a, which currently specifies that a minimum of seven safety/relief valves shall be bench checked or replaced with a bench checked valve each refueling outage. The proposed amendment would change this specification to require the valves to be tested in accordance with the Section XI Inservice Testing Requirements of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. The proposed change is consistent with the Improved Standard Technical Specifications, NUREG-1433. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: a. The proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed amendment is limited to changes to the surveillance testing requirements (bench checking or replacement) applicable to the main steam system safety/relief valves. This surveillance requirement is performed while the plant is in a cold shutdown condition at a time when the safety/relief valves are not required to be operable. The performance of this evolution is not an input or consideration in any accident previously evaluated, thus the proposed change will not increase the probability of any such accident occurring. Current safety analyses conclude that the pressure relief capabilities of the Safety Relief valves are adequate assuming that one of the eight safety/relief valves fails to open upon demand. The proposed change will not adversely affect the reliability of the valves and will therefore not reduce the conservatism of this assumption. Similarly, the proposed amendment specifies testing requirements consistent with accepted industry codes and regulatory guidance to provide assurance that the valves will function as designed. The amendment will not diminish the capability of the safety/relief valves to perform as required during any accident previously evaluated and will therefore not increase the consequences of any such accident. b. The proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed. The proposed amendment does not involve any modification to plant equipment or operating procedures, nor will it introduce any new safety/relief valve failure modes that have not been previously considered. The net result of the proposed amendment will be to allow the plant staff the option of decreasing the frequency of safety/relief valve testing to a level that has been acknowledged as acceptable by the ASME Code and NUREG-1433. We therefore conclude the proposed changes will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed. c. The proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed amendment does not involve a decrease in the number or capacity of safety/relief valves that are provided in the system, nor does it involve any change in safety/relief valve setpoints, operability requirements, or limiting conditions for operation. Based on these considerations, we conclude the proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

B. Marsh Northern States Power Company, Docket No. 50-263, Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant, Wright County, Minnesota Date of amendment request: January 4, 1994 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would change Technical Specifications section 3.11, Reactor Fuel Assemblies, by removing information concerning the analytical method to determine average planar linear heat generation rate (APLHGR) and providing reference to the presentation of the information in the Core Operating Limits Report. In addition, this proposed amendment would change section 6.7, Reporting Requirements, by revising the listing of approved analytical methods for developing the Core Operating Limits Report, and it would revise the Technical Specification Bases for section 3.11 concerning the calculation methodology for MCPR [minimum critical power ratio]. The proposed change to specification 3.11.A would eliminate the duplication of requirements specified in specification 6.7.A.7 and the Core Operating Limits Report for establishing APLHGR limits. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: The proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The APLHGR limits originate from and are associated with LOCA [loss-of-coolant accident] analyses. Standard exposure dependent APLHGR limits are generated from LOCA analyses initiated from rated power and flow conditions. For any allowable off power and off flow condition the APLHGR limit is the smaller of the flow dependent or power dependent limit. These limits are also used in the fuel thermal-mechanical analysis and transient analysis. Flow dependent APLHGR requirements will continue to be established based on analysis and fuel type specific limits determined using NRC approved methodologies to ensure that peak transient average planar heat generation rate during these events is not increased above the fuel design basis values. Power dependent APLHGR limits will continue to be established based on analysis and fuel type specific limits determined using NRC approved methodologies to ensure that peak transient average planar heat generation rate during any transient is not increased above the rated fuel design basis transient values. The proposed amendment establishes appropriate controls to ensure that the APLHGR limits will continue to be determined and established using NRC approved methodology; therefore, this amendment will not cause a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated for the Monticello plant. The proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed. The proposed amendment does not involve any modifications to plant equipment or operating procedures, nor will it introduce any new failure modes. The proposed amendment ensures that cycle specific APLHGR limits are determined and established using approved methodologies and will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. The proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed amendment removes duplication which exists in the Monticello Technical Specification for the identification of the approved analytical methods for establishing the APLHGR core operating limit. In addition the proposed amendment adds the NRC approved Siemens' analytical method for the determination of APLHGR limits based on LOCA/ECCS [emergency core cooling system] analyses. Inclusion of the NRC approved Siemens' analytical method ensures proper coordination of the methodology employed to establish the APLHGR limiting condition for operation for each type of fuel as a function of axial location and average planar exposure. APLHGR limits will continue to be determined using NRC approved methodology as established in specification 6.7.A.7.b. The established APLHGR limits will be verified to be consistent with the accident analysis contained in the Monticello Updated Safety Analysis Report. The proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Minneapolis Public Library, Technology and Science Department, 300 Nicollet Mall, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55401 Attorney for licensee: Gerald Charnoff, Esq., Shaw, Pittman, Potts and Trowbridge, 2300 N Street, NW, Washington, DC 20037 NRC Project Director: L. B. Marsh Northern States Power Company, Docket Nos. 50-282 and 50-306, Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Goodhue County, Minnesota Date of amendments request: September 21, 1992, as revised December 29, 1992, and November 24, 1993 Description of amendments requests: The proposed amendments would change various Technical Specification (TS) sections and associated Bases for surveillance test intervals and allowed outage times for the engineered safety features and reactor protection system instrumentation consistent with the NRC Staff position as documented in NRC letters to the Westinghouse Owners Group. The proposed license amendment request also updates operation modes to be consistent with Westinghouse Standard Technical Specification operational modes and also includes several editorial changes to the Prairie Island TS that are unrelated to the changes described above. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The determination that the results of the proposed change are within all acceptable criteria have been established in the SERs prepared for WCAP-10271, WCAP-10271 Supplement 1, WCAP-10271 Supplement 2 and WCAP-10271 Supplement 2, Revision 1 issued by References 1, 2, and 5 [of the November 24, 1993, application]. Implementation of the proposed changes is expected to result in an acceptable increase in total Reactor Protection and Engineered Safety Features Systems yearly unavailability. This increase, which is primarily due to less frequent surveillance, results in a[n] increase of similar magnitude in the probability of an Anticipated Transient Without Scram (ATWS) and in the probability of core melt resulting from an ATWS and also results in a small increase in core damage frequency (CD) due to Engineered Safety Features unavailability. Implementation of the proposed changes is expected to result in a significant reduction in the probability of core melt from inadvertent reactor trips. This is a result of a reduction in the number of inadvertent reactor trips (0.5 fewer inadvertent reactor trips per unit per year) occurring during testing of Reactor Protection System instrumentation. This reduction is primarily attributable to less frequent surveillance. The reduction in inadvertent core melt frequency is sufficiently large to counter the increase in ATWS core melt probability resulting in an overall reduction in total core melt probability. The values determined by the Westinghouse Owners Group and presented in the WCAP for the increase in core damage frequency were verified by Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) as part of an audit and sensitivity analyses for the NRC Staff. Based on the small value of the increase compared to the range of uncertainty in the core damage frequency, the increase is considered acceptable. The changes of an editorial nature, including the change to Standard Technical Specification format for the instrumentation Technical Specifications and mode definitions, have no impact on the severity or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes do not result in an increase in the severity or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Implementation of the proposed changes affects the probability of failure of the Reactor Protection System and Engineered Safety Features but does not alter the manner in which protection is afforded nor the manner in which limiting criteria are established. 2. The proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed. The proposed changes do not involve hardware changes and do not result in a change in the manner in which the Reactor Protection System and Engineered Safety Features provide plant protection. No change is being made which alters the functioning of the Reactor Protection System or Engineered Safety Features. Rather the likelihood or probability of the Reactor Protection System or Engineered Safety Features functioning properly is affected as described above. Therefore the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The changes of an editorial nature, including the change to Standard Technical Specification format for the instrumentation Technical Specifications and mode definitions does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. . The proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed changes do not alter the manner in which safety limits, limiting safety system setpoints or limiting conditions for operation are determined. The impact of reduced testing other than as addressed above is to allow a longer time interval over which instrument uncertainties (e.g., drift) may act. Experience has shown that the initial uncertainty assumptions are valid for reduced testing. Implementation of the proposed changes is expected to result in an overall improvement in safety by: a. Less frequent testing will result in less inadvertent reactor trips and actuation of Engineered Safety Features components. b. Higher quality repairs leading to improved equipment reliability due to longer repair times. c. Improvements in the effectiveness of the operating staff in monitoring and controlling plant operation. This is due to less frequent distraction of the operator and shift supervisor to attend to instrumentation testing. The changes of an editorial nature, including the change to Standard Technical Specification format for the instrumentation Technical Specifications and mode definitions [do] not lead to a reduction in any margin of safety.

B. Marsh Omaha Public Power District, Docket No. 50-285, Fort Calhoun Station, Unit No. 1, Washington County, Nebraska Date of amendment request: December 28, 1993 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment to the Technical Specifications would revise the surveillance test frequency from monthly to quarterly for several channel functional tests for Reactor Protective System and Engineered Safety Feature Instrumentation and Controls based on Generic Letter 93-05. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: The proposed change does not involve significant hazards considerations because operation of Fort Calhoun Station Unit (FCS) No. 1 in accordance with this change would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Increasing the surveillance test interval (STI) from monthly to quarterly for the Reactor Protective System (RPS) and Engineered Safety Features Actuation System (ESFAS) instrumentation has two principal effects with opposing impacts on core melt risk. The first impact is a slight increase in core melt frequency that results from the increased unavailability of the instrumentation in question. The unavailability of the tested instrumentation components is translated to result in a failure of the reactor to trip, an Anticipated Transient Without Scram (ATWS), or a failure of the appropriate engineered safety features to actuate when required. The opposing impact on core melt risk is the corresponding reduction in core melt frequency that would result due to the reduced exposure of the plant to test-induced transients. This results in a net decrease in core melt frequency of approximately 4.1x10 -8 per year. Representative fault tree models were developed for FCS and the corresponding changes in core melt frequency were quantified in evaluations CEN-327-A and CEN-327-A, Supplement 1. The NRC issued a Safety Evaluation Report (SER) which found that these evaluations were acceptable for justifying the extensions in the STIs for the RPS and ESFAS from 30 days to 90 days and that the RPS unavailabilities resulting from extending the STIs were not considered to be significant. Estimates of the reduction in scram frequency from the reduction in test-induced scrams and the corresponding reduction in core melt frequency were found acceptable. STIs of 90 days were found to result in a net reduction in core melt risk. A plant specific calculation/setpoint drift analysis was conducted, as required by the NRC SER, that analyzed the effect on instrument drift of extending the RPS and ESF instrumentation and controls functional STI from monthly to quarterly. The results demonstrated that the observed changes in instrument uncertainties for the extended STI do not exceed the current 30-day setpoint assumptions. Therefore, it is unnecessary to change any setpoints to accommodate the proposed extended STI. Operation of the facility in accordance with this proposed change, therefore, will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed change does not involve any changes in equipment and will not alter the manner in which the plant will be operated. RPS and ESFAS setpoints will not be changed as the instrument uncertainties resulting from the proposed STI (calculated using actual plant data) are less than the instrument uncertainties assumed for 30 days. Thus, this proposed change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. There are no changes to the equipment or plant operations. RPS and ESFAS setpoints will not be changed as the instrument uncertainties resulting from the proposed STI (calculated using actual plant data) are less that the instrument uncertainties assumed for 30 days. Implementation of the proposed changes is expected to result in an overall improvement in plant safety due to the fact that reduced testing intervals will result in fewer inadvertent reactor trips and less frequent actuation of ESFAS components. The conclusions of the accident analyses in the FCS Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR) remain valid and the safety limits continue to be met. Thus, this proposed change does not reduce a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: W. Dale Clark Library, 215 South 15th Street, Omaha, Nebraska 68102 Attorney for licensee: LeBoeuf, Lamb, Leiby, and MacRae, 1875 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20009-5728 NRC Project Director:William D. Beckner Power Authority of the State of New York, Docket No. 50-333, James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant, Oswego County, New York Date of amendment request: December 28, 1993 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment to the James A. FitzPatrick Technical Specifications (TSs) clarifies Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.5.D.4. Amendment No. 179 to the TS added LCO 3.5.D.4 to permit hydrostatic and leakage testing at temperatures up to 300 ○F without requiring certain equipment, including the automatic depressurization system (ADS), to be operable. However, LCO 3.5.D.4 can be mistakenly interpreted to require the ADS be operable at temperatures less than 212 ○F. Requiring the ADS to be operable during hydrostatic and leakage testing with temperatures below 212 ○F was clearly not the intent of Amendment No. 179. The proposed change will clarify LCO 3.5.D.4 to resolve this concern. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: Operation of the FitzPatrick plant in accordance with the proposed Amendment would not involve a significant hazards consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, since it would not: 1. involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The plant accident analyses are not affected by the proposed Technical Specification change. Prior to implementation of Amendment 179, hydrostatic and leakage testing of the RCS was performed with reactor coolant temperatures below 212 ○F while the ADS was inoperable. Amendment 179 revised the Technical Specifications in anticipation of increased pressure temperature limits requiring hydrostatic and leakage testing at or above 212 ○F. Requiring the ADS to be operable during hydrostatic or leakage testing with temperatures below 212 ○F was clearly not the intent of Amendment 179. The change will not increase the probability or consequences of previously evaluated accidents. 2. create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated. The proposed change involves no modifications to hardware, analyses, operations or procedures. The change clarifies LCO 3.5.D.4 to allow hydrostatic and leakage testing of the RCS below 300 ○F without requiring the ADS to be operable. The change is administrative in nature since it only clarifies the intent of the Technical Specifications as agreed to with the NRC and cannot create a new or different kind of accident. 3. involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed change will not affect any plant safety margins. The existing plant accident analyses are not affected by the proposed change. This revision of LCO 3.5.D.4 is intended to clarify that the ADS is not required to be operable during hydrostatic or leakage testing of the RCS. This position is substantiated by the NRC safety evaluation for Amendment 179 which acknowledges that hydrostatic and leakage testing can not be performed without making the ADS, and other systems, inoperable.

Pratt, 1633 Broadway, New York, New York 10019. NRC Project Director: Robert A. Capra Power Authority of the State of New York, Docket No. 50-333, James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant, Oswego County, New York Date of amendment request: January 31, 1994 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment to the James A. FitzPatrick Technical Specifications would revise the limiting conditions for operation (LCO), surveillance requirements, and Bases section for the main condenser steam jet air ejectors (SJAE). The proposed changes correct a typographical error, clarify the modes of operation during which the SJAE LCOs and surveillance requirements are applicable, revise the action required upon entering a SJAE LCO, and establish a threshold level below which there will be no requirement to perform grab samples and isotopic analyses of SJAE effluent. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: Operation of the FitzPatrick plant in accordance with the proposed Amendment would not involve a significant hazards consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, since it would not: 1. involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed amendment revision involves no hardware changes, no changes to the operation of any systems or components and no changes to structures. The changes clarify the Technical Specifications by specifying the modes of operation during which the LCOs and Surveillance Requirements of Specification 3.5 are applicable. The changes also include specific guidance for the operators to prevent or minimize the release of radioactive gases to the environment. These changes can not cause an increase in the probability of, nor alter the consequences of, an accident previously evaluated. The establishment of a threshold below which grab samples are not required will alter procedures by allowing SJAE operation without grab samples to determine effluent content at low levels of radioactivity (i.e., less than 5,000 micro Ci/sec). This will not affect the monitoring system's ability to detect, alarm, and isolate the offgas system if the concentration of radioactive material in the effluence reaches the appropriate setpoint. The surveillance requirement for taking a grab sample after a greater than 50% increase in release rate is intended to assist operators in determining if there is any increase in fuel failure during steady state operations. This would assure that routine operational limits are maintained. The grab samples do not provide any automatic protective function (e.g., MSIV [main steam isolation valve] or Offgas System isolation) for mitigating an accident but provide radionuclide concentration data. The performance of SJAE effluent grab samples is not credited towards detecting nor mitigating any design basis accidents since spontaneous fuel failure is not a FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report] accident initiator but a consequence of an accident. Therefore, the use of a 5,000 micro Ci/sec threshold, which is approximately 1% of the trip setpoint, would not alter the consequences or probabilities of established accident scenarios. 2. create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated. The proposed changes provide improved clarity concerning applicability of the specifications and specific guidance for preventing/mitigating the release of radioactive gases to the environment. The proposed changes also provide guidance for limiting the number of unnecessary grab samples. These changes do not affect the manner in which the main condenser steam jet air ejector is operated. The proposed changes to the Technical Specifications reflect either established plant practice (i.e., applicable modes or mitigation procedures) or new surveillance guidelines to minimize unnecessary grab samples. In all cases, the proposed changes have no affect on any parameters which would be considered or used in an accident analysis. The changes, therefore, do not pose a safety issue different from those analyzed previously for the FSAR. 3. involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed changes to the Technical Specifications will not alter the intent of the surveillance requirement to monitor for the possibility of fuel failure. Considering the difference between the proposed threshold value and the current alarm setpoint, a reduction in grab samples during plant operation with low concentrations of radioactivity in the primary coolant will not affect any plant safety margins. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Pratt, 1633 Broadway, New York, New York 10019. NRC Project Director: Robert A. Capra Power Authority of the State of New York, Docket No. 50-333, James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant, Oswego County, New York Date of amendment request: January 31, 1994 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment to the James A. FitzPatrick Technical Specifications would revise Specification 3.8 to adopt the Limiting Conditions for Operation (LCO) of Section 3/4.7.6, ``Sealed Source Contamination,'' as stated in NUREG-0123, ``Standard Technical Specifications for General Electric Boiling Water Reactors (BWR/5)'' (STS). In addition, the proposed change reformats Specifications 3.8 and 4.8 to make them consistent with the remainder of the FitzPatrick Technical Specifications. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: Operation of the FitzPatrick plant in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant hazards consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, since it would not: 1. involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Adopting the LCO described in the ``Sealed Source Contamination'' section of NUREG-0123 (STS) does not increase the probability or the consequences of an accident or malfunction of a safety-related structure, system, or component previously reviewed in the FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report]. The proposed changes do not increase the probability of causing, either directly or indirectly an uncontrolled release of significant amounts of radiation. Deleting 10 CFR 30.71 as the basis for exempting sealed sources for the leak testing requirements removes a requirement that is redundant to other federal regulations requirements. The proposed changes to reformat Specifications 3.8 and 4.8 are administrative in nature and do not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated in the FSAR. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes do not alter the radioactive materials controls established at the restricted area boundaries and do not increase the amount of radioactive materials on site. There are no modifications to safety systems as a result of the proposed changes. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated in the FSAR. 3. involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Adopting the wording of the STS regarding the sealed sources limiting conditions for operations will not reduce the ability of the operators to detect a leaking sealed radioactive source. Established radiological controls (i.e., handling techniques and good health physics practices) implemented through plant procedures will ensure that the sealed sources will continue to be tested as required by the Technical Specifications and applicable regulations. The proposed changes do not alter the radioactive materials controls established at the restricted area boundary and do not increase the amount of radioactive materials on site. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Capra Sacramento Municipal Utility District, Docket No. 50-312, Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station, Sacramento County, California Date of amendment request: December 9, 1993 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would change the Rancho Seco Permanently Defueled Technical Specifications (PDTS) to implement and ensure consistency with the revisions in 10 CFR Part 20. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: A significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated in the SAR (Safety Analysis Report) will not be created, because the proposed changes are editorial in nature, are designed to implement the 10 CFR Part 20 regulations, and have no affect on any accidents evaluated in the Rancho Seco Defueled Safety Analysis Report (DSAR), i.e., the dropped fuel assembly accident, the loss of offsite power condition, or a radwaste tank rupture. PA-187 (Proposed Amendment) will not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident evaluated in the SAR, because the changes are editorial in nature, implement the new 10 CFR Part 20 radiation protection regulations, and do not provide any new mechanisms by which an accident can occur. The proposed PDTS amendment will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety, because the District will continue to maintain the appropriate radiation protection controls, through implementation of the new 10 CFR Part 20 regulations, that are necessary to ensure Rancho Seco continues to be operated safely from a personnel radiation exposure standpoint during the Permanently Defueled Mode. The NRC staff has reviewed the analysis of the licensee and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Attorney for licensee: Dana Appling, Esquire, Sacramento Municipal Utility District, P.O. Box 15830, Sacramento, California 95852-1830 NRC Project Director: Seymour H. Weiss Tennessee Valley Authority, Docket No. 50-328, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, Unit 2, Hamilton County, Tennessee Date of amendment request: February 8, 1994 (TS 94-02) Description of amendment request: The proposed change would revise Operating License Condition 2.C.(17) to temporarily extend the surveillance interval for certain specified instruments from the normal 18-month interval to a maximum of 28 months for 18-month surveillances and 46 months for the 3-year Containment fire hose hydrostatic surveillance test in order to prevent exceeding the allowable testing frequency prior to the refueling outage that has been rescheduled to start in July 1994. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: TVA has evaluated the proposed technical specification (TS) change and has determined that it does not represent a significant hazards consideration based on criteria established in 10 CFR 50.92(c). Operation of Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) in accordance with the proposed amendment will not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed change is temporary and allows a one-time extension of specific surveillance requirements (SRs) for Cycle 6 to allow surveillance testing to coincide with the sixth refueling outage. The proposed surveillance interval extension is short and will not cause a significant reduction in system reliability nor affect the ability of the systems to perform their design function. Current monitoring of plant conditions and continuation of the surveillance testing required during normal plant operation will continue to be performed to ensure conformance with TS operability requirements. Therefore, this change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. Extending the surveillance interval for the performance of specific testing will not create the possibility of any new or different kind of accidents. No changes are required to any system configurations, plant equipment, or analyses. Therefore, this change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Surveillance interval extensions will not impact any plant safety analyses since the assumptions used will remain unchanged. The safety limits assumed in the accident analyses and the design function of the equipment required to mitigate the consequences of any postulated accidents will not be changed since only the surveillance test interval is being extended. Historical performance generally indicates a high degree of reliability, and surveillance testing performed during normal plant operation will continue to be performed to verify proper performance. Therefore, the plant will be maintained within the analyzed limits, and the proposed extension will not significantly reduce the margin of safety. The NRC has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Hebdon Toledo Edison Company, Centerior Service Company, and The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, Docket No. 50-346, Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 1, Ottawa County, Ohio Date of amendment request: December 23, 1992 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would revise TS 3/4 3.3.5 and its Bases adding testing requirements for transfer switches used to meet 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix R (Fire Protection) requirements and specifies a new special report requirement for TS 6.9.2. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below, indicating that the proposed changes would: 1a. Not involve a significant increase in the probability of an accident previously evaluated because none of the proposed changes are associated with the initiation of any design bases accident. The addition of Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.3.3.5.2 and Surveillance Requirement (SR) 4.3.3.5.2 to the Technical Specifications will require each control circuit and transfer switch that is required for a serious control room or cable spreading room fire to be operable during Modes 1, 2 and 3 and to be verified at least once per 18 months as capable of performing the intended function. New Action b will require restoration of an inoperable control circuit or transfer switch (required for a serious control room or cable spreading room fire) within 30 days or a Special Report submitted to the NRC pursuant to Specification 6.9.2 within the next 30 days. Surveillance testing procedures will be prepared, reviewed and approved in accordance with Technical Specification (TS) 6.5.3, Technical Review and Control, which will ensure an unreviewed safety question is not created. To support the addition of the new LCO, Action and SR, the existing LCO, Action and SR are proposed to be administratively re-numbered or re-lettered. The new Special Report requirement is proposed to be administratively added to TS 6.9.2. 1b. Not involve a significant increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated because no equipment, accident conditions, or assumptions are affected which could lead to significant increases in radiological consequences. The addition of LCO 3.3.3.5.2 and SR 4.3.3.5.2 to the Technical Specifications will require each control circuit and transfer switch that is required for a serious control room or cable spreading room fire to be operable during Modes 1, 2 and 3 and to be verified at least once per 18 months as capable of performing the intended function. New Action b will require restoration of an inoperable control circuit or transfer switch (required for a serious control room or cable spreading room fire) within 30 days or a Special Report submitted to the NRC pursuant to Specification 6.9.2 within the next 30 days.

To support the addition of a new LCO, Action and SR, the existing LCO, Action and SR are proposed to be administratively re-numbered or re-lettered. The new Special Report requirement is proposed to be administratively added to TS 6.9.2. 2a. Not create the possibility of a new kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because no new accident initiators are introduced by the proposed changes. The addition of LCO 3.3.3.5.2 and SR 4.3.3.5.2 to the Technical Specifications will require each control circuit and transfer switch that is required for a serious control room or cable spreading room fire to be operable during Modes 1, 2 and 3 and to be verified at least once per 18 months as capable of performing the intended function. New Action b will require restoration of an inoperable control circuit or transfer switch (required for a serious control room or cable spreading room fire) within 30 days or a Special Report submitted to the NRC pursuant to Specification 6.9.2 within the next 30 days.

To support the addition of the new LCO, Action and SR, the existing LCO, Action and SR are proposed to be administratively re-numbered or re-lettered. The new Special Report requirement is proposed to be administratively added to TS 6.9.2. 2b. Not create the possibility of a different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because no different accident initiators are introduced by the proposed changes. The addition of LCO 3.3.3.5.2 and SR 4.3.3.5.2 to the Technical Specifications will require each control circuit and transfer switch that is required for a serious control room or cable spreading room fire to be operable during Modes 1, 2, and 3 and to be verified at least once per 18 months as capable of performing the intended function. New Action b will require restoration of an inoperable control circuit or transfer switch (required for a serious control room or cable spreading room fire) within 30 days or a Special Report submitted to the NRC pursuant to Specification 6.9.2 within the next 30 days.

To support the addition of the new LCO, Action and SR, the existing LCO, Action and SR are proposed to be administratively re-numbered or re-lettered. The new Special Report requirement is proposed to be administratively added to TS 6.9.2. 3. Not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because these are not new or significant changes to the initial conditions contributing to accident severity or consequences, therefore, there are no significant reductions in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.

Silberg, Esquire, Shaw, Pittman, Potts and Trowbridge, 2300 N Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20037 NRC Project Director: John N. Hannon Union Electric Company, Docket No. 50-483, Callaway Plant, Unit 1, Callaway County, Missouri Date of amendment request: September 24, 1993 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specifications to extend the reporting period of the Semiannual Radioactive Effluent Release Report from semiannually to annually. Additionally, the report submission date would change from 60 days after January 1 and July 1 of each year to before May 1 of each year. The changes to the reporting period and report date are being made to implement the August 31, 1992, amendment to 10 CFR 50.36a. The affected Technical Specifications Sections are 1.18, 3.11.1.4, 3.11.2.6, 6.9.1.7, 6.14c, and the Index. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: The proposed changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration because operation of Callaway Plant with these changes would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes do not affect accident initiators or assumptions. The radiological consequences of any accident previously evaluated remain unchanged. (2)Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. These changes do not impact any administrative controls nor do they involve physical alterations to the plant with respect to radioactive effluent. There is no new type of accident or malfunction created and the method and manner of plant operation will not change. (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The margin of safety remains unaffected since no design change is made and plant operation remains the same. The proposed changes do not affect any safety limits or boundary or system performance. As discussed above, the proposed changes are strictly administrative in nature and have no affect on plant operations. They do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated or create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. These changes do not result in a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Therefore, it has been determined that the proposed changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Attorney for licensee: Gerald Charnoff, Esq., Shaw, Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge, 2300 N Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20037. NRC Project Director: John N. Hannon Union Electric Company, Docket No. 50-483, Callaway Plant, Unit 1, Callaway County, Missouri Date of amendment request: October 6, 1993 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specifications Section 3.8.3, Electrical Power Systems - Onsite Power Distribution, to make the limiting conditions for operation for four emergency busses (NG05E, NG06E, NG07, and NG08) consistent with other technical specifications. The proposed revision would make the allowed outage time (AOT) for any of these emergency busses 72 hours. This is equivalent to the AOT for one train of the ESW per Technical Specification 3.7.4 and equivalent to the AOT for one train of the UHS cooling tower per Technical Specification 3.7.5. This amendment request also proposes an editorial change by removing the number sign (#) before each electrical bus, battery, and battery charger listed in Technical Specifications Section 3.8.3 in order to clarify the specifications and make the nomenclature consistent with other sections. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: The proposed changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration because operation of the Callaway Plant with these changes would not: (1)Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The implementation of the proposed technical specification changes does not involve any modifications to the physical plant. Even though the MCCs themselves will have an allowed outage time of 72 hours instead of 8 hours, the operability requirements of the ESW system itself have not been lessened. The addition of LCs NG07 and NG08 to the technical specifications and surveillances serves to clarify the 480-volt power supply requirements in the technical specifications. The proposed changes do not affect accident initiators or assumptions. The radiological consequences of any accident previously evaluated remain unchanged. (2)Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. As noted above, the proposed change eliminates inconsistent requirements from the technical specifications, but overall does not lessen the requirements on ESW system operability imposed by the technical specifications. The implementation of the proposed technical specification changes do not involve any modifications to the physical plant or any significant change to the methods of operation of plant systems. The proposed changes do not create any new accident initiators. (3)Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The requirements of Technical Specification 3.7.4, Plant Systems - Essential Service Water System, provide specific limiting conditions for operation applicable to the ESW System. In accordance with the definition of operability contained in the technical specifications, the operability of the ESW MCCs has always been included within these requirements. The existing technical specification requirements for onsite A.C. power distribution systems are intended to assure the availability of A.C. power sources supplying multiple safety systems. The NG05E and NG06E MCCs identified by this proposed change provide power for a single safety system (ESW) and associated equipment. The use of the 72 hour limit for the ESW MCCs is consistent with the requirements of Regulatory Guide 1.93, ``Availability of Electrical Power Sources'' and has an insignificant impact on the Callaway Probabilistic Risk Analysis. LCs NG07 and NG08 also only provide power for a single safety system (ESW) and associated equipment (UHS cooling tower). Since the technical specification requirements relative to the ESW system operability are not lessened by this change, there will be no reduction in the margin of safety as defined in the basis for the technical specifications. As discussed, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated or create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. These changes do not result in a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Therefore, it has been determined that the proposed changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Hannon Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, Docket No. 50-305, Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant, Kewaunee County, Wisconsin Date of amendment request: February 1, 1994 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would revise Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) Technical Specifications (TS) by removing the review of the Emergency Plan and its implementing procedures from the list of responsibilities of the Plant Operations Review Committee (PORC). Guidance for this change was provided in Generic Letter 93-07, ``Modification of the Technical Specification Administrative Control Requirements for Emergency and Security Plans,'' dated December 28, 1993. Several other administrative TS changes are proposed including removing specific titles from the list of PORC members in TS 6.5.a.2 and deleting TS 6.5.b which describes the Corporate Support Staff. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration which is presented below: The proposed changes were revised in accordance with the provision of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist. The proposed changes will not: 1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The likelihood that an accident will occur is neither increased or decreased by these TS changes. These TS changes will not impact the function or method of operation of plant equipment. Thus, there is not a significant increase in the probability of a previously analyzed accident due to these changes. No systems, equipment, or components are affected by the proposed changes. Thus, the consequences of the malfunction of equipment important to safety previously evaluated in the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR) are not increased by these changes. The proposed changes are administrative in nature and, therefore, have no impact on accident initiators or plant equipment, and thus, do not affect the probabilities or consequences of an accident. 2)create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed TS changes would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes do not involve changes to the physical plant or operations. Since these administrative changes do not contribute to accident initiation, they do not produce a new accident scenario or produce a new type of equipment malfunction. Also, these changes do not alter any existing accident scenarios; they do not affect equipment or its operation, and thus, do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. 3)involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed TS would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed changes do not affect the plant equipment or operation. The requirements previously contained in the TS's that are being deleted are redundant and are contained in other controlled documents. Safety limits and limiting safety system settings are not affected by these proposed changes. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
