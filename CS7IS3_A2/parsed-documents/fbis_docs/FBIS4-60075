'Arafat's almost 30 years of experience in control of Fatah and the PLO attest not only to his talent for survival but also to the guilefulness that renders him untrustworthy. He has not undergone the necessary and hoped-for metamorphosis from the leader of a national liberation movement, operating partially in exile and even clandestinely, to a statesman. He has failed to rise to the greatness of the hour and is returning not to the Gaza Strip and Jericho, but back to his old tricks. 'Arafat, however, is not the PLO or the Palestinian people. It was he who signed the Cairo agreement with Yitzhaq Rabin but the relations between the two peoples and their respective political entities cannot depend on the nature of changing leaders, who are mere mortals subject to political transitions. 'Arafat's inflammatory sermon in Johannesburg is a serious matter not because it addressed the question of Jerusalem -- Israel is indeed obligated to discuss all the issues, including East Jerusalem and the settlements, in the negotiations over the permanent arrangement, even if the Palestinian yarn spinner made up a "letter from Rabin" for the benefit of his audience -- but because the hallowed words of peace can no longer be voiced by a person who calls for jihad. If the sermon was some kind of tactical move designed to mobilize support for 'Arafat's policies then it is a mistake because there are also skeptics among the Israeli public and these kinds of tricks discourage them from supporting the political process. If it is an indication of 'Arafat's substantive position, along the lines of the "phased" doctrine, then it proves that 'Arafat is deluding himself that Israel is so weakened that its withdrawal will not stop at the Green Line. Whichever way, 'Arafat, personally, is no longer a credible partner for negotiations. In the Declaration of Principles, Israel pledged to hold elections in the territories within three months of implementing the first stage of withdrawal in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. This stage has now been completed and the countdown for elections should begin. Contrary to his earlier eagerness to incorporate this clause into the agreement (in order to use it to include East Jerusalem), 'Arafat now seeks to rule the territories without elections. Israel shares this interest to the extent that it is a partner to 'Arafat's concern over the rise of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and similar organizations; however, Israel's partnership with 'Arafat does not involve supporting him against the PLO's middle generation, which is poised to fight for its inclusion in the territories' leadership. Israel must insist on the implementation of the clause on elections in the territories following sufficient preparations that should last not three but six months. Israel should make the continuation of the process conditional on the holding of elections with the participation of all parties whose declared goal is to make peace with Israel, without the threat of any jihads. In other words, not Hamas, not the Islamic Jihad, not the rejectionist fronts, and perhaps not even 'Arafat. Israel must negotiate with the authorized representatives of the Palestinian people but not with those who stick the agreement in their pocket and then threaten a ruthless war to achieve the rest of their objectives, a war over everything.
