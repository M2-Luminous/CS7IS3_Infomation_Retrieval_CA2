FBIS4-5767 "dreas072__a94011" FBIS-EAS-94-072-A Daily Report 31 Mar 1994 ANNEX Japan FTC Warns Banks on Government Bond Share FTC Warns Banks on Government Bond Share 942A0103A Tokyo NIKKEI KINYU SHIMBUN in Japanese 31 Mar 94 p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0103A Tokyo NIKKEI KINYU SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] It has been learned that the Fair Trade Commission has issued a warning that an agreement--between the banking and securities industries which provided that the share allotted to a bank and its subsidiary will not exceed that previously allotted to a single firm--in managing a government bond underwriting syndicate among bank-affiliated securities firms "runs the risk of violating the Antimonopoly Law." The reason cited is that, in order to hold down the total shares within an upper limit, such agreements require participating firms to engage in a voluntary arrangement which in turn obstructs fair competition. Because of the potential increase in agreements among securities firms to alleviate the effects of changes under deregulation measures, the commission will maintain strict surveillance over the situation in addition to exerting efforts to promote free competition. Bank-affiliated securities firms will begin participating in government bond underwriting syndicates beginning with bonds issued in April. The upper limit of a share to be controlled by one securities firm has been set at "18 percent of the issue," in order to avoid the situation in which one firm wins in a bidding for a large portion of the issue and distorts the price formation process. The securities industry had warned that entry of bank-affiliated securities firms in the market place "could lead to similar abuses if parent banks and subsidiary securities firms joined and won in bidding for a large portion of issues." In response, coordination between the banking and securities industries resulted in an agreement whereby, "as a matter of principle, the share of parent bank and subsidiary securities firm will not exceed 18 percent of any given issue," and bank-affiliated securities firms had informed the securities industry that "they and their parent banking firms would not be in a position to win bids for large portions of an issue." The commission has stated relative to the one-firm limit that, "The Ministry of Finance can mechanically reduce any bids won beyond the one-firm limit and sees no problem in this respect." However, relative to the combined bidding by parent bank and subsidiary securities firm, it decided, "There is no way we can mechanically combine figures and effect an adjustment, and there is no way we can avoid a prior agreement. Rates and underwriting shares should be determined on a competitive basis." The commission takes the position that excessive competition and distortions in price formation should be handled under other procedures such as the Securities Transactions Law. The Fair Trade Commission recently submitted these ideas to the Ministry of Finance, which is responsible for issuing government bonds. In response, the banking and securities industries decided to cancel such agreements and notified the bank-affiliated securities firms of the decision. The banking and securities industries now think it will be difficult to arrive at such agreements in the future. Banks intend to actively engage in the bidding for new government bond issues to provide for management in investment accounts, even after having established securities subsidiaries. Bond trading departments provide for the primary source of revenues and profits for subsidiary securities firms and many of them will be actively bidding for government bonds beginning with the April issue. Now that the decision has been made to forbid combined bidding ceilings, the potential shares of government bond issues for banks and their securities subsidiaries could rise and the possibility has increased for a stronger role to be played by banks. Not only have business operations been deregulated through the full-scale removal of market barriers between banks and securities firms but we have now entered into the final phase of deregulating interest rates. Some sources point to the potential for moves to limit competition because of aversion to disintegration of the existing order as a result of such deregulation.
