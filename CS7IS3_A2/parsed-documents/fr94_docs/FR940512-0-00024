Any of that land not conveyed to the State will be subject to the terms and conditions of the Chugach National Forest reservation or any other withdrawal of record. 4. At 10 a.m. on June 13, 1994, that land not selected by the State under the provisions of the Statehood Act will be opened to such forms of disposition as may be law be made of National Forest System land, including location and entry under the United States mining laws.

The Bureau of Land Management will not intervene in disputes between rival locators over possessory rights since Congress has provided for such determinations in local courts. 5. A portion of the area affected by this order is public land, and has been and will remain subject to overlapping Public Land Order Nos. 396, 587, 2667, or 2791, and the terms and conditions of those Public Land Orders remain otherwise unchanged by this order.
