The change, recently decided by the Chinese Communist Party's leadership, is to avert social unrest in the face of increasing inflationary and unemployment pressures following sweeping reforms. The ruling party's Politburo made the decision last month in an emergency meeting after price hikes for grain and staple food in major cities and an expected "largest-ever" flow of migrants this month. The strategic amendment in socio-economic development and reform policies received blessing from paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, Chinese sources said yesterday. The change was made to include "guaranteeing social stability" as development priority and play down the emphasis on pace of economic growth and reform. The decision has sharply contrasted the policy and remarks made by senior leaders last year when they were working on an overall development, economic sources told THE HONGKONG STANDARD. At that time, the Politburo had formulated a three-point directive outlining the development strategy for 1994, which says "to seize opportunities, deepen reforms and speed up development". But now, the Politburo has changed it to "seize opportunities, deepen reforms, boost development and guarantee stability" a well-informed source said. The inclusion of guaranteeing social stability indicates that the authorities are to postpone many of its radical reforms and take a more cautious step in the endeavour. The substitution of "speeding up development" by "boosting development" also underlines a change of mind by the leadership. Only last year senior leaders frequently quoted an instruction of the reclusive Mr Deng to justify a fast pace development. The patriarch was reported to have said then that "development is hard truth" and "slow development is not socialism." The remark was interpreted as advocacy for a higher development speed. The decision will allow China to cut its growth rate to rein in spiralling inflation. The government will suspend some reform packages that may have fuelled price soaring for basic products and staples and lead to large-scale unemployment. It will re-impose price capping over the floor and grip in economic activities, including renewing austerity program, sources said.
