The average 7.9 percent annual industrial growth recorded during the six-year period was due to increased productivity and competitiveness fueled by a move to raise value-added production, the official added. The statistics also revealed that Taiwan's economy, after many years of fast growth, has moved from a labor-intensive to a technology-intensive one, the official eaid. He attributed the transformation to a recent mass relocation of labor-intensive industries overseas. As the low-cost labor-intensive industries shifted to newly- emerging economies such as Mainland China and Southeast Asian countries, Taiwan's dependence on such industries also decreased, the DGOAS official said.
