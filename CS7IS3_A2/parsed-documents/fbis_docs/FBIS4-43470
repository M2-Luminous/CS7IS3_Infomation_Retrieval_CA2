The Greeks are not expecting any postponement in the appointment or a veto from one or more countries against specific candidacies. Pangalos, Greek minister for European affairs, spoke of Greece's position in The Hague on Wednesday [15 June], after a discussion with outgoing Prime Minister Lubbers and other cabinet members. Pangalos said that "the decision could not be postponed because of agreements with the European Parliament (EP), which has to ratify the European Council's choice." He added that "a long discussion about individuals would be fruitless and would have a negative effect on public opinion." Pangalos said nothing about any Greek preference for one of the candidates. In any case, Greece will not put anyone forward at Corfu. Pangalos, who is traveling round the EU capitals in preparation of the EU summit, admitted there was a problem for the council of government leaders. "We do not know which is the best choice among three excellent possibilities," he said. He referred to the candidacies of Lubbers, British European Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan and Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene. Although the latter has not put himself forward as a candidate, he can count on the support of Bonn and Paris. In The Hague, Pangalos emphasized the neutrality of the presidency, which will be taken over by Germany on 1 July. For now, there is no consensus among members states on who should succeed Delors. There is little chance that the Christian Democrats, whose "turn" it now is, will make a choice between Lubbers and Dehaene before Corfu. An attempt to mediate at the Benelux level by Martens, Belgian president of the European People's Party (EPP), seems doomed to failure at present. The EPP, which gathers together the European Christian Democrats, will meet in Brussels next Wednesday. Unless Lubbers or Dehaene withdraws, then the battle between the Netherlands and Belgian candidates will be decided at Corfu. Despite the Greek aversion to any postponement, diplomatic circles in The Hague are taking real account of this possibility. In their opinion, postponement would become virtually inevitable if the Lubbers-Dehaene duel were to end in a narrow victory for one of them. To avoid loss of face for either camp, Germany, which will assume the presidency, could then decide to hold an extra summit in September. Pangalos said that Greece and the Netherlands agreed that the decision of the EC presidency was not linked with "other international institutions or activities." But it was on Wednesday that rumors about the European jobs issue increased. The names of former Netherlands Finance Minister Ruding and Van Rooy, Netherlands state secretary for economic affairs, suddenly appeared in the rumor mill. They were said to be candidates respectively for the secretary general position of the OECD and the WTO [World Trade Organization], which on 1 January 1995 will take over from GATT. The rumors are strongly denied in government circles. Ruding reportedly refuses to give up his job as second in command at the powerful American Bank Citycorp in New York. Van Rooy, who was second on the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] list of candidates in the parliamentary elections on 3 May, wants to deepen her experience in national politics. The Netherlands supports Lawson, former British chancellor of the exchequer, for the OECD position and Mexican President Salinas for the WTO position. But The Hague is putting forward a top civil servant for a second-rank position in the WTO: Engering, director general of the Foreign Economic Relations Department of the Economic Affairs Ministry.
