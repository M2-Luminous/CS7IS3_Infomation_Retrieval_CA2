Ms Keane was the 41st candidate on the regional election list. Another regional executive member and regional candidate, Joan Fubbs, who was with Miss Keane, survived unhurt.

Speaking at a press briefing at the ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] regional offices, PWV premier candidate Tokyo Sexwale described this as a cowardly action designed to disrupt the elections. Mr Sexwale confirmed an earlier report from a man claiming to be an eye witnesses, who saw a white person fleeing from a white car just before the explosion. According to ANC information at least seven people were killed and 45 injured. However, police have put the injury toll at 92. Mr Sexwale called on all people to remain calm. "There must be maximum restraint here and there must be no retaliation because we don't know what is involved. Police were "co-operating extremely well", he said. "This type of action in Johannesburg is intended to send indications of negativity through the country and abroad." He said the election would go ahead "full steam". "The election must proceed. This (blast) was intended to frighten away voters." He said the security forces and police would be out to protect voters and to ensure elections went ahead. Mr Sexwale said it was not possible to identify a specific target so far but believed the ANC offices were the intended target.
