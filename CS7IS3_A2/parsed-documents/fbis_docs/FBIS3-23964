According to the current data, it looks as if the decline of production in January will be more substantial than had been presented in our January forecast. There will be 20 work days in February 1994--the same number that there was in February 1993. A sharp decline in production will continue in an absolute majority of industrial sectors in all regions of Russia. Output of more than 85 percent of varieties of products produced will decline. The output will decline by more than 20 percent in most machine-building sectors, the chemical industry, a number of sectors in the construction materials industry, production of home appliances, and the light industry. The value of the physical volume index of the output will measure in February in Russia as whole at 0.802 (in December it was to 0.839 as compared to the forecasted value of 0.854--see DELOVOY MIR, 10 December 1993), that is, production will decline by 19.8 percent. The average daily output of industrial production will decline in February also by 19.8 percent as compared to 1993. (In December, the average daily output declined by 14.1 percent as compared to the forecasted value of 14.6 percent--see DELOVOY MIR, 10 December 1993). The financial situation of most enterprises is unstable. To a large extent, this is associated with the exacerbating solvency crisis. According to the Russian Goskomstat [State Committee for Statistics] data, as of 1 December past due payments owed to suppliers by consumer enterprises amounted to 8.304 trillion rubles [R] and increased over the month by 30.3 percent. Past due indebtedness will continue to increase in February. The situation in the fuel and power generation complex sectors in February will change only insignificantly as compared to the preceding winter months. Production of oil will decline over the month by 3 million tonnes (11 percent) and will amount to 26.8 million tonnes. Oil production in Tyumen Oblast, which accounts for two-thirds of all oil production in Russia, will decline in approximately the same proportion. The drop in the output results in cutbacks in primary processing of oil, which will reach 10 percent in February. This in turn will cause a decline in the production of automotive gasoline by 9 percent, diesel fuel by 12 percent, and boiler oil by 9 percent. Gas production will decline somewhat in February--by 1 percent (0.5 billion cubic meters). The decline in production is the result of the difficult economic situation in the industry and the strained circumstances of consumers of its output. The problem is that the current level of production lately on the whole corresponded to domestic needs in gas. At the same time, consumers' insolvency in near-abroad countries results in cutbacks of its deliveries there and, as a consequence, cutbacks in production. Electric power generation at public utilities will decline over February by 2.6 billion kWt/hr (3 percent), which will be brought about mainly by a decline in power generation at heat and power plants (by 4 percent) and hydroelectric stations (also by 4 percent). Production decline in power engineering results to a large extent from disruption in fuel deliveries (especially coal), as well as cutbacks in deliveries of electric power to consumers with whom the utilities have outstanding unpaid bills for many months. The structure of fuel consumption by heat and power plants in the beginning of 1993 was as follows. The share of gas in all fuels used equals 64 percent, coal--24 percent, and petroleum products--12 percent. Production of coal in February as a whole will drop off by 1.2 million tonnes (4 percent), including coal for coking--by 2 percent. A number of mines have declared a prestrike condition. Many of them are delaying shipments of coal to consumers because of considerable past due payments to coal producers. In ferrous metallurgy, the decline in operations of iron ore enterprises continues to accelerate. In February iron ore mining will drop by 8 percent as compared to last year. Deliveries of scrap metal, whose collection will fall off by almost 40 percent, also will diminish. The result will be that the proportion of more expensive pig iron used in steel smelting will increase and that the less expensive scrap metal will decrease. These negative processes will take place against the background of a declining supply of fuel to the industry: Coke burning will decrease over the month by 9 percent. In addition to an insufficient supply of raw materials to the industry, its development is substantially affected by a problem common for the entire of industrial production--considerable insolvency on the part of consumers. As of 1 December 1993, past due arrears on the part of buyers for the products shipped by metallurgical enterprises amounted to R1.547 trillion. All of this is seriously undermining ferrous metallurgy, which is already in a critical condition even without this. As a result, the output of pig iron in February will decline by 18 percent, steel smelting--by 24 percent, and that of finished rolled metal--by 23 percent. There is a continuing decline in the production of steel pipe, which will reach 50 percent in February. To a considerable extent this is related to the declining demand for the sector's output. The situation in machine building continues to worsen dramatically. The output of more than 85 percent of categories of products counted in periodic reports will decline in February. With respect to a considerable share of items, the output will decline by 30 or more percent. Among them are forge-press machines, whose output will drop off by 73 percent; metal-cutting machine tools--by 49 percent; bulldozers--by 50 percent; and excavators--by 30 percent. The situation in transportation machine building will worsen substantially. The output of diesel locomotives will fall off by 50 percent, electric locomotives--by 90 percent, railroad cargo cars--by 30 percent, railroad passenger cars--by 20 percent, and trolleys--by 33 percent. Production of agricultural machinery also will continue to decline: The output of tractors will drop off by 90 percent, tractor hitches--by 93 percent, and grain harvesting combines--by 67 percent. While the volume of production in automotive machine building had been increasing until recently, in February the picture will change. The output of trucks will decline by 47 percent, passenger automobiles--by 17 percent, and buses--by 5 percent. The output of equipment for light industry also will decline: production of spinning machines will decline by 11 percent, and weaving looms--by 20 percent. Production of ball bearings will drop off by 45 percent. The situation in the chemical industry will worsen in February. A considerable decline in production will take place first and foremost with respect to the output of the sector's raw materials. For instance, the output of synthetic ammonia will decline by 17 percent, sulphuric acid--by 31 percent, soda ash--by 40 percent, and caustic soda--by 19 percent. The decline in production of mineral fertilizer will exacerbate considerably. In February it will reach 32 percent. This is related first and foremost to the shortage of mineral-chemical raw materials, which has developed as a result of depletion of mineral reserves, as well as the lack of modern equipment and technologies for more complete extraction of minerals used in production of mineral fertilizer. As a result, the structure of mineral fertilizer production has changed. In 1993 the share of nitrogen fertilizer amounted to 52 percent, while the proportional share of a more effective phosphorus fertilizer, whose production is more labor-intensive, amounted to only 24 percent. The share of potassium fertilizer also amounted to 24 percent. Second, the exacerbating insolvency crisis put the sector's enterprises in an extremely difficult financial situation. As a result, serious difficulties arise with respect to purchases of raw materials and components, which leads in turn to lesser utilization of capacities. Even more considerable will be the decline in production of microbiological feed protein--by 41 percent; production of chemical fiber and filament will drop off by 32 percent. In the timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper industry in February the decline in production will increase as compared to the preceding winter months. This is associated first and foremost with a disruption in the operations of the timber-logging sector, which serves as a base for timber-processing productions. For instance, the outtake of round timber declined over the month by 22 percent, which will be the main factor in the expected 38 percent decline in the production of commercial timber. The technical base of the sector is extremely backward. The equipment is extremely obsolete, while the financing for accumulation of between-seasons reserves of timber are allocated belatedly and in insufficient volume. The sharp increase in railroad tariffs creates difficulties in transporting timber from Siberia and the Far East to the European part of Russia, where the greatest number of timber-processing enterprises are located. The limited supply of timber material to enterprises will lead, in turn, to a decline in the output of lumber by 29 percent, plywood laminate--by 22 percent, and wood particleboard--by 8 percent. Serious deficiencies in deliveries of wood materials and the extremely poor technical condition of equipment are the main causes of the declining output of paper and cardboard, which will fall in February by 21 percent and 30 percent, respectively. In the construction materials industry, the decline slowed down somewhat in the fourth quarter of 1993, which was caused by a pick-up in housing construction (individual, as well as construction done by joint-stock companies and other nonstate organizations). However, at the beginning of 1994 this trend will change. Production of cement will decline in February by 12 percent, of asbestos-cement sheeting by 62 percent, asbestos-cement pipe and couplers by 43 percent, construction brick by 8 percent, prefabricated ferroconcrete by 14 percent, soft roofing materials by 30 percent, and window glass by 34 percent. In the beginning of 1994, the trend toward a decline in the production of most varieties of complex home appliances, which emerged in the fourth quarter of 1993, has settled in. Only the output of refrigerators and freezers will increase by 2 percent in February of 1994. Production of most other categories of complex home appliances will be declining: washing machines by 45 percent, electric vacuum cleaners by 55 percent, tape recorders by 40 percent, radio receivers by 36 percent, television sets by 23 percent, sewing machines by 66 percent, and bicycles by 66 percent. The reasons, which have already become habitual for many industrial sectors, are the shortage of material and financial resources and the declining demand because of a substantial increase in prices. The output of synthetic detergents will drop off by 37 percent. In light industry in February, as during the preceding months, the output of cotton fabrics will be increasing and will reach 222 million square meters (133 percent). Production of other most important categories of the industry's output, however, will be falling: woolen fabrics by 42 percent, silk fabrics by 40 percent, knitwear by 28 percent, hosiery by 26 percent, and footwear by 51 percent.
