Jerzy Milewski currently holds in his hands three functions: deputy minister of national defense; chief of the National Security Office (BBN), which comes under the Belweder's jurisdiction; and secretary of the National Defense Committee. Defense Minister Kolodziejczyk's expansion of Milewski's duties in MON [Ministry of National Defense] is seen by the coalition government as an attempt to prevent the coalition from gaining access and influence in that ministry. Jerzy Szmajdzinski of the SLD (Democratic Left Alliance), chairman of the Sejm Commission on National Defense, is demanding that the prime minister explicitly state the scope of Milewski's authority. Lech Falandysz, the Belweder secretary of state, does not think that Milewski's being dismissed from his position comes into play because "the prime minister would have to take into account that, following Milewski's dismissal, the MON chief does not intend to propose anyone else, and, without his recommendation, the prime minister cannot appoint anyone else." Jerzy Milewski was born in 1935 in Lopuchowek. He completed his studies at the Gdansk Polytechnic [Institute of Technology], followed by a doctorate in 1966. He continued his scientific career at the Institute of Flow Mechanics Machinery of PAN (State Academy of Sciences) in Gdansk, at the University of Illinois in Chicago, at Stanford University in California, and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was in charge of the Coordination Office of NSZZ Solidarity [Independent Self-Governing Trade Union "Solidarity"] in Brussels. Following his return to Poland, he aligned himself with the presidential center of power--he has headed the BBN since January 1991. Milewski is divorced and has two children. In his free time, he enjoys mountain climbing.
