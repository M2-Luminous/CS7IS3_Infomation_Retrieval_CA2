In a report on the debates by German Minister Theo Waigel, the Seven affirmed "with insistence that energetic economic reform is the only path to guarantee the advantages of a market economy." They stressed their "concern over the lack of progress in stabilizing the Russian economy." According to Mr. Waigel's text, the Russian delegation assured them that the budgetary deficit would be limited to around 5 percent of GNP in 1994 and that the monthly price rises would be would be brought down to between 7 and 9 percent by the end of the year. The Seven said that they were ready to unblock parts of the financial package of around $45 billion adopted last year but that the money which had not yet been paid out could only be so "when all the conditions had been met." The Seven however made some concessions to the Russians, saying that they agreed with them in saying that special attention had to be given to the consequences of the transformation process. They believed that a credible social accompanying program was required. The Seven are ready for a "new wide recycling agreement" of the Russian debt "on the basis of a program supported by the International Monetary Fund." They recall that Russia's public creditors had granted it further respite by extending by four months, until the end of April, the recycling accord negotiated with the former USSR in April 1993. After the meeting, Mr. Waigel told the press: "It was a realistic discussion." British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke added: "We applied pressure on them over monetary policy." Mr. Christophersen declared that the IMF which always called for very strict reforms before releasing credits, could not make an exemption for Russia. For his part, Mr. Alexander Chikhine, Russian Minister for the Economy, said that the meeting with the G-7 was a "specific moment", as it was the first one since the Russian elections and the reshuffle of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's Government. The Kronberg meeting also served the G-7 to make a relatively optimistic observation over the situation in the world economy. This part of the talks was not the subject of a communique. Italian Finance Minister Piero Barucci said that the end of the recession was in sight, except possibly in Germany. The Japanese ministers denied any isolation of their country within the G-7. "Even if we did not say so in the Communique, there was common agreement in considering that fluctuations in parities are not desirable. We confirmed that the G-7 would continue to cooperate," said Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii. According to Mr. Hans Tietemeyer, Bundesbank president, the monetary issues had not led "controversy." Recognizing that there "had practically been no discussion on currencies," Mr. Yasushi Mieno, Governor of the Bank of Japan, considered that Japan's partners "understood that the strong appreciation of the yen undermined the efforts the archipelago is undertaking to assure economic recovery."
