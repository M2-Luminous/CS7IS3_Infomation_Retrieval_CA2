The practice has enabled the public security department to have a tight grip on public order and help create a sense of safety throughout society. Implementation of the patrol system has in the past two years been one of the important measures adopted in various cities for the restructuring of public security work and for the strengthening of public order. The police patrol practice has been adopted in certain areas in Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Wuhan, Fuzhou, Xian and Shenyang and such patrols are supported by advanced communications systems enabling a rapid response to emergencies. The patrol practice provides a convenience for the public to report crime to the police and in turn boosts the ability of a rapid response by the police. Shanghai has a police force of 2,800 specially for patrols, and patrol posts have been erected in certain areas in the municipality and cover a wide area. The police can rush to the scene of a problem within three to five minutes after receiving a report. Police on patrol arrested a total of 1,986 suspected criminals in Tianjin last year and 5836 criminals were dealt with. Patrolling police helped solve 6,589 cases concerning social order and 1,947 criminal cases while they settled 15,900 civil disputes and some 100,000 cases where the public was faced with various kinds of difficulties and problems. Police patrols in cars were employed last year in Wuhan, Xian, Hangzhou and Shenzhen with striking success in the handling of crime reports and showing a rapid response in combatting various kinds of crime.
