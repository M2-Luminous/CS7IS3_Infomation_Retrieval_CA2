Engelen Commentary: "Waigel's Home Match"] [Text] The contrast could hardly have been any sharper: In Kronberg last Saturday [26 February], the finance ministers and central bank heads of the seven leading industrial nations were discussing the state of the reform process in the center of the former Soviet Union with a high-level Russian government delegation. At the same time, in Moscow, prominent coup leaders were leaving prison, cheered by old communists and ultranationalists. The release of the coup leaders and the expected further strengthening of Russian forces opposed to reforms following therefrom are making it increasingly doubtful whether the concept of help for self-help that was developed at the Munich 1992 summit and further detailed at the Tokyo 1993 summit, can remain valid. The meeting of the Group of Seven finance ministers that was chaired by Finance Minister Theo Waigel and focused on Russia -- quite expectedly -- did not find an answer to this question, either for Russia or for the world. The promises by the ministers flown in from Moscow saying that monthly inflation will remain below 10 percent this year and the budget deficit will be cut to 5 percent of the GNP, did not make any change to that. But by publishing its nine-item declaration the Group of Seven -- plus the head of the International Monetary Fund and the Deputy Heads of the World Bank and the European Union -- once again made it clear: The Western industrial nations will continue supporting the economic reform process in Russia as long as the necessary preconditions are met. Since only a fraction of the billion-dollar aid packages granted so far has actually been effected to date as a result of the out-of-control inflation rate and public finances, the providing of additional financial means could not be a topic at Kronberg. But the Round of Seven -- after comprehensive consultations with the Russian Government -- emphasized a new line at Kronberg: to help develop a credible program for social support of the reform process. In fact, the West could do very much in this respect, not only through international institutions such as the World Bank, but also in the form of bilateral aid. Although Russia's reform crisis was at the center of the Kronberg meeting, the German hosts had to make a considerable effort to contain -- at least for the conference weekend -- the tensions between Washington and Tokyo that were triggered by better access to the Japanese market. An open confrontation between Japanese and Americans would have made the Germans look bad. But as chief coordinator of the West's aid for Russia and as proclaimer of a brightening world economy -- including a better economic outlook in Germany -- the strained Bonn treasurer Theo Waigel, at the beginning of the super election year, managed to enter the small Kronberg G-7 summit in his books as a successful home match.
