The republic has been lately swept by rumours about an upcoming money reform in Russia. Having learnt the bitter lesson of previous money reforms, workers and employees of state organisations and enterprises also refuse to take their salaries in 50,000 rouble notes. Earlier such rumours rattled the neighbouring Chechen Republic. Meanwhile, black marketeers and shadow economy dealers are buying up the rejected bills for 45,000 roubles in banknotes of 10,000 and 5,000 rouble denomination. abdul-Khamid Aushev, a Russian Central Bank representative in Ingushetia, said that "such rumours are being spread by mafia-like structures and hard currency dealers for their own benefit." Aushev said he had contacted the Central Bank which had denied these rumours as groundless.
