It notes the clear discussions regarding Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights and the possibilities of normalizing Syrian-Israeli relations in the future. AL-AHRAM's editorial for tomorrow, Saturday 21 May, says that the current talk on the many differences between the stands of the two sides is only natural with such complex and intricate negotiations. It notes that on the other hand, this means negotiations now address many of the detailed issues and are not merely confined to generalities and principles that govern the negotiations process. AL-AHRAM affirms that Egyptian-U.S. efforts will continue to provide hope for moving the Syrian-Israeli course along and clearly pushing it forward despite all appearances to the contrary.
