In his unofficial visit to Subic Bay, the first leg of the trip, Li will meet Philippine President Fidel Ramos over a luncheon and visit the bay area, where a major industrial processing zone exclusively for Taiwan investors will soon be developed. Li and his entourage, which includes Foreign Affairs Minister Fredrick Chien [Chien Fu], chief economic planner Hsiao Wan-chang, and some business leaders, will arrive Wednesday evening in Bali, Indonesia where they will stay for a five-day vacation. An unofficial meeting with President Suharto is part of Li's itinerary in Indonesia. Li will also meet with Indonesian Research and Technology Minister Jusuf Bacharuddin Habibie for talks focusing on the development of Batam, an island south of Singapore which Jakarta is developing as an industrial zone. Li, his wife and party are scheduled to leave Bali and travel to Phuket in Thailand on Feb. 14 for a two-day visit. The president's economically significant vacation trip is scheduled to end on Feb. 16. The presidential office has given low-key treatment to Li's "southern trip", apparently to shield the three Southeast Asian countries from any diplomatic embarrassment they might suffer because of their official links with Beijing.
