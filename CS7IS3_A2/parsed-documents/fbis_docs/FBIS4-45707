In many cases there is no suitable procedure, more often there is a lack of money, but usually the real inhibiting factor is the lack of clear standards for the evaluation and cleansing of contaminated soils. The planned Federal soil protection law is intended to help. At least in East Germany toxic waste cleanup is not failing for lack of money: the Union has provided funds of DM1 billion annually for cleansing the soil of privatized companies over the next 10 years. There are also billions for toxic waste cleanup for large-scale chemical firms, for lignite and shipyards. According to the Federal Environmental Agency in Berlin (UBA) a total of DM15 billion is available through the end of the 90's. But experiences in the new Federal Laender show that full coffers do not necessarily set off cleanup activities: "What is still missing," explains UBA expert Dr. Karin Freier, "are uniform bases and standards for investigation, evaluation and cleanup." So far toxic waste cleanup has been the business of the Laender. The result is that the danger from a particular piece of ground is evaluated in quite different ways. In practice it is quite routine for toxic waste to be eliminated in one Federal Land at great expense, while the neighboring Land would hardly have noticed it. "In Germany we have 16 different methodologies for toxic waste cleanup," agreed Freier at the Technical University in Berlin at the end of February. An investigation of the Hygiene Institute of the Ruhr Area in Gelsenkirchen supports this lack of uniformity with some statistics. It says that so far there are 37 different lists of toxic materials, and 24 of them contain quite different values for testing, cleanup and threshold values for certain pollutants. In addition there are about two dozen different EDP models for risk evaluation on the market. Legislators are hving a hard time with regulatory efforts for toxic waste cleanup: The Federal Environmental Agency has been working on Technical Guidelines on Toxic Waste for four years--so far without results. The draft of the Federal Soil Protection Law proposed last summer now offers a concrete legal starting point. Freier says, "For the first time there is the possibility of establishing unified Federal standards for dealing with toxic soil changes and toxic wastes." The alpha and omega of such unified Federal standards are the establishment of "use-dependent testing and response," i.e. threshold values for toxins which both give information about how great the risk from a polluted piece of ground is and also determine whether a surface must be cleaned up or not. At a technical discussion in April experts from the Laender will discuss the derivation of such values for testing and response. At what level does a material begin to be harmful to health? Socalled TRD values (TRD stands for tolerable resorbable dosage rate in micrograms per kilogram and day) give information about this question. A TRD value determines the highest level of absorption at which no deleterious effects on health are to be expected, or, in the case of carcinogens, at which there is a low risk of becoming ill. Last year the UBA published TRD values for 82 materials and groups of materials relevant to toxic waste. "Still," according to Freier, "there continues to be a great need for research on toxicological effects." And the question of how different toxins work in combination is not yet answerable in most cases. According to the UBA, a research project now in progress is to produce the first findings on such combined effects by fall. Test values also depend essentially on the later use of the decontaminated area. Thus Dr. Ulrich Ewers of the Hygiene Instititute of the Ruhr Area distinguishes three groups: children's playgrounds, residential areas and park facilities on the one hand, areas in horticultural and agricultural use on the other, and in addition commercial and industrial areas. The values suggested by the Institute for residential areas are twice as high as those for children's playgrounds; the factor for park and recreational facilities is five, for commercial and industrial areas 10 (see table). Objectivity and professionalism are rarities in the public discussion of toxic waste, but they are the basis on which the new soil protection law is built. "The goal of the investigation of dubious areas is not knowledge of the potential for contamination, but of the potential risk arising from it," as Karin Freier at the Technical University put it. In other words, if a soil is contaminated, but the toxins are so tightly bound that they cannot escape into the air or into the subsoil water, the dubious area does not necessarily have to be declared a toxic waste site. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Recommendation for Establishing Soil Test Values (Data in mg/kg dry soil | |weight) | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Children's Pl-|Residential A-|Park and Recr-|Commercial an-| | |aygrounds |reas |eational Faci-|d Industrial | | | | |lities |Areas | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Metals/Metal | | | | | |oxides | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Arsenic |20 |40 |100 |200 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Lead |200 |400 |1,000 |2,000 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cadmium |6 |12 |30 |60 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Copper |300 |600 |1,500 |3,000 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Nickel |60 |120 |300 |600 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Mercury |4 |8 |20 |40 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Selenium |40 |80 |200 |400 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Thallium |0.5 |1 |2.5 |5 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Hydrocarbons | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Benzo(a)pyrene|1 |2 |5 |10 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Halogen Carbo-| | | | | |hydrates | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Hexachlorocyc-|0.2 |0.4 |1 |2 | |lohexane (mix-| | | | | |ture) | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1,2,4-trichlo-|5 |10 |25 |50 | |robenzene | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Hexachloroben-|0.3 |0.6 |1.5 |3 | |zene | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |DDT |0.4 |0.8 |2 |4 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |PCB |6 |12 |30 |60 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Dioxins/Flura-|60 |120 |300 |600 | |ns (ng TE/kg) | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Phenols | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Phenol |20 |40 |100 |200 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cresols |30 |60 |150 |300 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Monochlorophe-|3 |6 |15 |30 | |nol | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |2,4-dichlorop-|2 |1 |10 |20 | |henol | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |2,4,5-trichlo-|30 |60 |150 |300 | |rophenol | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |2,4,6-trichlo-|2 |4 |10 |20 | |rophenol | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tetrachloroph-|15 |30 |75 |150 | |enol | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Pentachloroph-|3 |6 |15 |30 | |enol | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Nitroaromatics| | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Nitrobenzene |0.6 |1.2 |3 |6 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |2,4-dinitroto-|1.2 |2.4 |6 |12 | |luene | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |2,6-dinitroto-|0.4 |0.8 |2 |4 | |luene | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |2,4-dinitroph-|1 |2 |5 |10 | |enol | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Source: Hygiene Institute of the Ruhr Area | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
