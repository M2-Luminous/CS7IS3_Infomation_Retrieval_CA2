He was addressing students at the University of the Western Cape today. [Begin recording] [SABC correspondent Gary Alfonso] Gen. Holomisa told a cheering crowd of about 3,000 students that more people have died of violence in the period before the election than during the liberation struggle. He said there is an urgent need to restore law and order in the contry, something which, he said, the National Party is unable to do. He said the ANC envisages a two-phased process of disarmament. [Holomisa, in English] We will refer the matter to the constituent assembly and it is debated there, so that all those weapons which the right-wingers are carrying all over the streets of South Africa can be returned back to the stores where they belong. [Alfonso] Gen. Holomisa said the second phase will involve cooperation with South Africa's neighbors to prevent illegal weapons from being brought into the country. [end recording]
