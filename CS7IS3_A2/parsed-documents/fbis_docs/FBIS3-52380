The vote was 196 to 160, with two abstentions. The Turkish National Security Council [NSC] recommended the extension of that force's mandate on 20 December. The NSC's decision had to be supported by the Council of Ministers and the parliament in order to be legalized. Poised Hammer, which was originally deployed in Turkey for a period of three months after the Gulf War, has been in that country for nearly two years. Obviously, the Turkish parliament's approval will enable that force to remain in Turkey for another six months. Recalling the deployment of Poised Hammer in Turkey, several political experts believe that it has a rather wide-ranging sphere of activity. They also believe that Poised Hammer can be used to strengthen Washington's regional security plan and oppose any move that might threaten Western interests in the region. The Turkish Government has allowed the deployment of an allied military force on its territory to defend certain parts of its border and protect the Kurds against possible attacks by the Baghdad regime. But how can the Turkish Government claim that the country's sovereignty extends right up to its border? Is Poised Hammer's task limited to what has been disclosed thus far, or does this force have an undisclosed mission in the region? The Turkish people are in the dark about this, and opposition by a significant number of people in Turkey to the presence of the allied military unit in this country can be viewed from this perspective. Some 69.37 percent of the respondents in a public opinion poll carried out by the TURKISH DAILY NEWS in Ankara last year said that they wanted the Western military units to withdraw from Turkey. Considering that nothing has been mentioned in connection with the duration of the Poised Hammer mandate and when this force's task will end, it is believed that setting a date for the withdrawal of this force will take a long time.
