Unan said during his meetings with officials from the British Foreign Ministry that he was told the British Government would help Turkey in its economic problems. "Britain has realized the importance of the issue for Turkey, specially economically. British officials have told us `we shall help the Turkish economy as much as we can,'" he said. Inan stressed that Turkey is looking for a solution to the problem that would not violate the UN embargo on Iraq. "We are asking our allies who are in the UN Security Council to help us in solving this issue and understanding our problem. Our trade relations with Iraq have ceased because of the embargo and our losses following the closure of the pipeline have already reached 5 billion dollars," he said. He said his contacts face-to-face with officials of the British Foreign Ministry were very useful, adding the flushing operation of the pipeline will allow for 12 million barrels of oil and the sale of this will bring a modest contribution to Turkey's economy while it will bring some humanitarian help products to Iraq.
