Dispatch of the inspectors is conditioned on North Korea delaying the removal of fuel rods from its 5-megawatt reactor, according to a letter from IAEA Director-General Hans Blix addressed to North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam. The agency invited North Korea to send a delegation of experts to Vienna to discuss the inspection timetable. Blix said he hopes the IAEA and the delegation can negotiate the necessary inspection process for the changing of the fuel rods. The director-general emphasized in the letter that the rods must remain closed under IAEA seals after they are randomly selected, and various measurements of the rods should be conducted late this year, officials said. The letter offers hope of a breakthrough in the nuclear impasse since the IAEA proposal, although it carries a condition, leaves aside for now the biggest stumbling block to an inspection agreement.
