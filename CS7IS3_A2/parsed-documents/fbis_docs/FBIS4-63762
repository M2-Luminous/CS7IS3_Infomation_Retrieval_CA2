He Is Always Right"] [Text] How difficult is Russia finding it to become a democratic state! This is what comes to mind when analyzing the results of the elections to the local representative organs of power. Failure by the bulk of citizens to appear at the polling places, fairly frequent violations of electoral rights, and flaws in the mechanisms for collaboration between the various participants in the electoral process -- all this was not the exception but the rule. It is expedient to explore two routes simultaneously in the quest for solutions to the problems which have arisen -- elaborating an integrated concept of the Russian electoral system and analyzing constructively the practical experience gained so far. Unfortunately, the new Russian Constitution does not contain a chapter on the electoral system which is traditionally in a country's Fundamental Law. Constitutional norms concerning elections are scattered among other chapters. This weakness is to some extent compensated for by the presidential edict "On Measures To Improve the Electoral System in the Russian Federation." But even this document needs to be further developed. A number of laws need to be elaborated and adopted, such as a law on electing the president and deputies to the State Duma, a law on referendums, and so on. In order to improve the electoral system in Russia, it is important to thoroughly consider both the negative and the positive aspects of its practice. Quite a bit has already been written about the negative aspects. I would like to concentrate on the positive. Let us take Stavropol Kray as an example. The results of the voting speak for themselves. Some 39.76 percent of the voters voted for candidates for deputies to the Stavropol Kray State Duma in all the 25 electoral districts. The region's new legislative organ was formed at the first attempt. It cannot be said that the election campaign in Stavropol Kray went off without any conflicts. On the contrary, there were, for example, some tense moments over the kray duma's numerical composition, the electoral districts' boundaries, and the statute on the elections. In short, the degree of conflict was fairly high. The voters' attitude during the run-up to the elections was also typical of many of the country's regions. Interest in the elections was lower than average. But nevertheless, the negative aspects did not influence the final result. Why? This can, in my view, be attributed first and foremost to the flexible and active stance of the local executive branch of power. The organizational measures for preparing and conducting the elections were distinguished by their lack of orthodoxy. Representatives of the executive organs of power also made a contribution to boosting the voters' activeness. On the eve of the elections, STAVROPOLSKAYA PRAVDA published an appeal by Kray Administration Head Yevgeniy Kuznetsov to the voters. Calling on citizens to come to the polling places, the administration head appealed not only to their civic consciences but also to their sense of thrift. After all, many millions of rubles had been spent on organizing the elections in the kray, as, incidentally, has been the case in other regions. The people should know how to dispose of their property prudently. Last but not least. Let us recall the days of voting in pre-perestroyka times. For all their fundamental faults (lack of choice, mandatory participation, and so on), their form was attractive. There is nothing to be ashamed about here. What is more, the Russian electoral system will become genuinely democratic precisely at the moment when elections become a responsible demonstration of civic-mindedness, a real festival of people's power.
