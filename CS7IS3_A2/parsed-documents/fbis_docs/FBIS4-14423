Moreover, the document preserves the points on which the Russian side in particular was insisting: a lease period of 20 years with a further 10-year extension, and agreement for Russian citizens -- servicemen of the Russian Federation Military Space Forces -- to stay at the cosmodrome and service it. The only change is that the rent payments are $115 million a year [as published]. The problems over Baykonur's status in fact started last summer, when Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev put forward the idea of turning Baykonur into an international spaceport. Both sides win from the Baykonur lease arrangement. Kazakhstan cannot maintain Baykonur on its own: It has neither the money nor the specialists for this at present. And Russia would be deprived of a base for launching heavy carrier rockets over the next few years while it establishes a new cosmodrome. [Konorov] Now that all the worries are over, we can look back and recall the circumstances under which the negotiations took place. The politicians, economists, and legal specialists spent a long time preparing for them; and, to give them credit, they prepared well: Every figure was checked down to the last cent (given that the cost of the rent is in dollars -- 115 million a month) [as published]. It emerges that the Russian specialists, basing themselves on international experience and Kazakhstan legislation, insisted that the real cost of the lease should be $80 million. The Kazakh side took no account of these arguments. The essence of their claims boiled down to the statement: "But we need 150 million." The negotiations were going badly until a "judgment of Solomon" was found. The two sums would be added together and then divided in half. The so-called "arithmetic mean" came to 115 million. In addition, an understanding was reached that a significant proportion of this sum would be paid "by barter" in the form of all kinds of services. How firm is this understanding? Like Russia, Kazakhstan now has certain obligations to foreign partners to carry out international space programs. The influence of international public opinion and the prestige of space powers are arguments of considerable weight in this protracted dispute.
