Hungary would like to see rapid progress, following changes caused by the Gabcikovo hydroelectric dam in Slovakia, over sharing Danube water, which looks particularly urgent in light of the imminent growing period in Szigetkoz, when water is vital to plant growth. (While Hungary has already accepted the European Union's recommendation on water sharing, Slovakia has not yet done so.) Also important to Budapest is the implementation of Council of Europe recommendations. (When Slovakia was admitted to the Council of Europe, it was asked to permit use of Hungarian town and village name-plates and registration of Hungarian family names.)
