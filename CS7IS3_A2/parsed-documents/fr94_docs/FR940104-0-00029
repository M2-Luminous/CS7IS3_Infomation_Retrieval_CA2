FR940104-0-00029 FR940104-0-00007 50 CFR Part 663 [Docket No. 931244&hyph;3344; ID. No. 121493A] Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Final rule; suspension of effectiveness. SUMMARY: On November 16, 1992, NMFS promulgated regulations, effective January 1, 1993, establishing a license-limitation-limited-entry system for the Pacific Coast commercial groundfish fishery. The regulations, among other things, require that an owner of a vessel wishing to participate in the limited-entry fishery have a Federally issued limited-entry permit endorsed with an appropriate vessel size endorsement. In view of a delay in issuing certain other regulations necessary to fully implement this system, this action suspends until April 1, 1994, the effectiveness of the vessel size endorsement requirement, which limits variances in vessel length from the length specified in a permit. The intent of this action is to allow vessel owners to participate in the limited-entry fishery who would otherwise be barred from the fishery by the size endorsement requirement. EFFECTIVE DATE: Effective December 29, 1993, the effectiveness of 50 CFR 633.33(f)(2) is suspended until April 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William L. Robinson at 206&hyph;526&hyph;6140. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On November 16, 1992, NMFS promulgated regulations codified at 50 CFR 663.30&hyph;663.43, and effective January 1, 1993, establishing a license-limitation-limited-entry system for the Pacific Coast commercial groundfish fishery. The regulations, among other things, require that an owner of a vessel wishing to participate in the limited-entry fishery, have a Federally issued limited-entry permit endorsed with an appropriate vessel size endorsement. In general, each limited-entry permit is endorsed with the overall length of the vessel with which it initially qualified for a permit. Under 50 CFR 663.33(f)(2), a limited-entry permit endorsed for gear other than trawl gear may be registered for use with a vessel up to 5 feet (1.52 m) longer than, the same length as, or any length shorter than, the size endorsed on the existing permit. A limited-entry permit endorsed for trawl gear may be registered for use with a vessel between 5 feet (1.52 m) shorter, and 5 feet (1.52 m) longer, than the size endorsed on the existing permit. Where the owner would like to use a limited entry permit with a vessel of a length that exceeds the variance, ยง663.33(g) allows the owner to combine two or more limited-entry permits from smaller vessels, in order to ``step-up'' to a permit for the larger vessel. However, before any permits may be combined, ยง663.33(g) also requires the Director, Northwest Region, NMFS (Regional Director), with the professional advice of marine architects and other qualified individuals, and after consultation with the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council), to develop and implement, through amendment of the regulations, a standardized measure of harvest capacity for the purpose of determining the appropriate endorsed lengths for limited-entry permits created by combining two or more permits with smaller size endorsements.
