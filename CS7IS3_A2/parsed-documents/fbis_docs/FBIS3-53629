Four of the arrested were released after preliminary interrogations, Colonel Reza Mohammadi, a law enforcement officer based in central Tehran told IRNA. Some ofthe detainees have confessed to having links with the Iraq-based terrorist Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization (MKO), the colonel said. Shortly after the bomb blast at Ferdowsi Square an unidentified caller who introduced herself as MKO spokesman in Paris claimed responsibility for the bombing which injured three passers-by, one critically. The officer disclosed that some arms and ammunition have also been seized from those arrested. He said because of the ongoing interrogation it was not possible for him to identify the arrested people by name. But he said they had acknowledged to have received instructions from Baghdad and Paris to carry out sabotage activities throughout Tehran. MKO members, better known in Iran as monafeqin (hypocrites) have launched a string of terrorist attacks since the fleeing to Paris of Maryam Qajar Azadanlou, the third wife of MKO ringleader Masoud Rajavi. Among the terrorist attacks launched by MKO members were hijacking of a passenger plane to Iraq, attacks on the French Embassy and Air France office in Tehran, shooting at the British Embassy and two bomb explosions in Tehran. Commenting on the connection between the bomb blast at Ferdowsi Square and the MKO, Mahmud Javadi, a political expert, said: "At present, MKO terrorists cannot leave Iraq without getting permission from the Baghdad regime and that Western countries are reluctant to admit members of this criminal grouplet. So the MKO seems to have decided to perpetrate such actions out of helplessness." Javadi said that the aim of the MKO in committing such crimes was to convince the Baghdad regime that it was still able to involve in sabotage actions inside Iran.
