Speaking to Renascenca, Adriano Moreira said his decision to stand down did not mean the end of the parliamentary committee: [Begin recording] [Moreira] What this is about is the fact that the way circumstances have evolved turns the issue, as far as Portugal is concerned, into the issue of Portugal's policy in the Pacific region. Both Macao, which is extremely important, and Timor, the most serious of challenges in view of the adverse conditions surrounding the cause of recognizing the rights of the Timorese, are components of the question. With circumstances having, in my opinion, evolved in this direction, it seems necessary to me not only to have the matter discussed by the House, but also to propose that the instruments for intervention in this area be changed. [Unidentified correspondent] What instruments do you advocate? [Moreira] They concern, first, the definition of the government's responsibilities vis-a-vis Macao, and, second, the intervention of the assembly itself in the general question of Portugal's interests in the Pacific, which includes the Timorese question. The president of the Portuguese Assembly has shown the greatest interest in this manner of posing the question, and said he will be raising it at the meeting of parliamentary party leaders.
