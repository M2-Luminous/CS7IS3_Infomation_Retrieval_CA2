Maragay] [Text] President Ramos inaugurated yesterday the $128 million diesel power plant at the Subic Bay Free Port which will boost power reserves by 116 megawatts and further minimize the possibility of brownouts during the summer months. The opening of the plant, the chief executive said, disproves the apprehensions of some quarters that Luzon and other parts of the country may be hit by power outages lasting about five hours daily during the dry months. "Today, we also deliver a strong message to our people that there will be enough electric power this summer to meet the needs of households and large industrial users alike, and debunk, through action and accomplishment, the delusions and fears of some doubting Thomases in our midst that power sufficiency will not be possible at this time," Mr. Ramos said. This is the fifth power plant to be inaugurated by the chief executive in three weeks. Earlier, Mr. Ramos opened four power facilities with a combined generating capacity of 285 MW -- three plants for Luzon and one for Mindanao. The three power projects in Luzon with a combined capacity of 240.73 MW which the President had switched on were the Kalayaan Pump Storage Power Plant Unit II in Laguna de Bay (150 MW), the Macban Binary Power Plant between Mt. Makiling and Mt. Banahaw in Laguna (15.73 MW) and the Bacman I Unit II and Bacman II Unit I geothermal plant (75 MW) in the boundary of Albay and Sorsogon. The Subic Power Plant was built by Enron Power Philippines Corp. in partnership with the Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. headed by Chairman Alfonso Yuchengco, House of Investments, and Pan Malayan Investment and Management Corp. under the build-operate-transfer (BOT) scheme. The president said it was propitious that the Enron power plant was inaugurated on Palm Sunday, marking the "light-filled entry" of Jesus Christ into Jerusalem. "This power plant comes as a fitting reminder that from suffering comes redemption and that we can triumph if we have the will, and call upon God's help to achieve," he said. Mr. Ramos recalled that he had vowed last year to end power outages by December. He said he had also promised that in the following months, his administration will take further steps to strengthen the power sector and build up the power reserves to cope with the peak demands of summer. "We have made good on that promise," the president said. "And beyond that, continue to reinforce that commitment by augmenting our power reserves -- because the people deserve nothing less. "The full operation of the Enron plant will make the Subic Free Port self-sufficient in power and therefore more attractive to investors. "We moved closer to our vision of transforming the Subic Bay Free Port into one of the major launching pads of our economic take-off with every company and facility getting established," the president said. This is the second power project of Enron in the country. The first was the 105-MW power plant built for the Batangas Power Corp. in Pinamucan, Batangas. Mr. Ramos noted that the United States-based Enron Corp., the parent firm of Enron Power Philippines, Corp., operates the longest pipeline in North America, and has constructed and is operating many power plants in four continents of the world. The president said it is "heartening to know" that Enron has seen fit to strike a partnership with the Yuchengco Group, which he described as a "very stable, well respected group of Filipino companies." "The Enron-Yuchengco partnership speaks well of Enron's commitment to a long-term presence in the Philippines and of the Yuchengco Group's willingness to venture into the promising area of power generation," he said. Under the agreement signed by the National Power Corp. [Napocor] and Enron, the 116-MW plant, with a life span of 40 years will be operated by Enron for 15 years after which it shall be turned over to Napocor without cost. Present during the inauguration were Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority [SBMA] Chairman Richard Gordon, and his wife Catherine, Enron officials led by its president and Chief Operating Officer Kenneth Lay, SBMA personnel and volunteers, and other government officials.
