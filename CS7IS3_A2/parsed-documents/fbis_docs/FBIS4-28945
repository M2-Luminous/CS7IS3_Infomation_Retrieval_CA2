The Russian committee for the promotion of the repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan to the North and the release of An Hak-sop held an emergency meeting recently and sent a letter to Kim Yong-sam. Noting that the South Korean authorities have kept old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan from returning to their hometowns where their families and relatives are waiting for them for more than 40 years, the letter urged Kim Yong-sam to return them to the DPRK, stop persecuting old man An Hak-sop at once and take a necessary measure so that he may live and work as he wishes. Franco Akame, former chairman of the National Defence Committee of the Chamber of Deputies of Italy, in a letter to the South Korean puppet ambassador to Italy demanded that the South Korean authorities immediately repatriate old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan to North Korea. If the South Korean authorities persist in their inhumane treatment and tortures against unconverted long-term prisoners, not repatriating them, they would have to pay dearly for it, he warned in the letter.
