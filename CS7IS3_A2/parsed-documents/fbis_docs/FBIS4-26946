Departments in charge of foreign trade and economic cooperation under the ministries and commissions of the State Council, and the foreign trade and economic commissions (departments and bureaus) (hereinafter called departments in charge) of provinces, autonomous regions, cities directly under the central authorities, and cities on separate listing, are responsible for organizing and guiding the training of laborers in their departments (localities) who will serve abroad. Article 3 The establishment of training centers: The departments in charge or the companies entitled to send laborers abroad (hereinafter called entitled companies) must establish training centers according to their specific conditions. They may establish training centers according to different professions and trades -- depending on their different conditions -- or they may establish comprehensive training centers. These training centers must possess the necessary educational conditions, teachers, mathematical equipment, and teaching programs, and must submit all these to MOFTEC for approval. Article 4 People to be trained: All kinds of laborers (including ordinary or senior laborers and postgraduates) who will be sent abroad (or outside the borders) by the entitled companies must be given training. Article 5 What to be taught: 1) The relevant state laws, regulations, principles, and policies; patriotism; and foreign-related discipline. 2) Courses on foreign languages, adaptability, and the relevant countries' (regions') basic situations, to be provided according to the countries' (regions') characteristics and requirements. 3) The relevant countries' laws, regulations, financial knowledge, customs, habits, and manners. 4) Education on transforming concepts, on establishing a correct concept of labor and professional ethics, on abiding by the relevant countries' labor system, on studying advanced foreign production technology and managerial experience, on obeying management, and on seriously fulfilling contracts. Article 6 Teaching material: 1) State laws, regulations, principles, and policies; foreign-related discipline and rules; the relevant countries' laws, regulations, customs, habits, and manners (hereinafter called the general material); the general training program to be worked out by MOFTEC. 2) Language-teaching material will be compiled by training centers in accordance with the relevant countries' requirements. 3) Professional and technical teaching material will be compiled by different departments in strict accordance with state criteria. To cope with the technical requirements of the relevant countries or foreign employers, MOFTEC can invite some experts to provide additions to professional and technical teaching material. Article 7 Training methods: Chinese laborers who will serve abroad must be given examinations or assessments on their qualifications before attending training courses. Relevant training methods must be adopted in accordance with laborers' different levels and with different countries' requirements concerning foreign laborers: 1) Technical laborers with junior title or above who have mastered the relevant skills and the expressions for daily use in the official languages of the relevant countries (regions) will be exempted from technical and foreign language courses, provided they can produce technical position title certificates and foreign language examination certificates (school reports). They need to attend only training on common subjects at an appointed time. 2) Ordinary technical laborers must be given assessments before being recruited. They must attend appropriate technical training, courses on simple expressions for daily use and work, and courses on common subjects. 3) The professional and technical assessments of laborers (including managerial personnel) sent abroad under a project contract system (usually involving 15 people or more) must be supervised by the contract-performing unit or by the unit that sends these personnel; their training and examination on common subjects will be carried out by appointed training centers. Article 8 Training period: The course on the general material should be conducted for not less than a week; the period for language training must be arranged according to the requirements of the relevant countries to which the laborers will be sent, but at least a week of intensified training must be provided on simple expressions for daily use and work, as well as on professional skills. Training centers must give examinations in accordance with international practice and the technical requirements of the relevant countries, or they may arrange training courses on appropriate skills in light of the actual situation. Article 9 Training fee: In principle, either the participants or the units that will send laborers abroad are responsible for paying the training fee. The arbitrary collection of charges is strictly prohibited. MOFTEC will adjust the training fee. Article 10 Examination and end of training: Examination must be conducted before training ends. Examination questions must be set according to the general program and detailed criteria must be provided so as to ensure training quality. Upon fulfillment of training targets and being proved qualified through examination, a "certificate of qualification for laborers who will serve abroad" will be issued by MOFTEC or an authorized training center. Article 11 Dispatching procedures: From now on, a "certificate of qualification for laborers who will serve abroad" gradually will be introduced when laborers submit procedures for exits to foreign countries (regions). Without this certificate, no laborer can be sent abroad. The foreign countries (regions) to which Chinese laborers can be sent will be determined by MOFTEC after consulting with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Public Security. Article 12 Punishment: MOFTEC will conduct regular inspections of training centers. If a training center provides poor quality training, resorts to deception, or arbitrarily issues "certificates of qualification," and depending on the merits of each case, it will be criticized, given an economic punishment, suspended from business for three to six months, ordered to correct its mistakes, or disqualified from the status of being a training center. Article 13 By-Regulations: These methods will come into force on 1 October 1994, and MOFTEC is responsible for explaining the relevant provisions.
