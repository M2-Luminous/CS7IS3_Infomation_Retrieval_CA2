The sides stressed the need to have bilateral relations further improved and described the level of existing relations between Turkey and Iran as good and constructive. During his three-day visit, Hashemi is expected to hold talks with the Turkish officials on important regional issues, the situation in the Islamic world, and the crisis in Bosnia- Herzegovina. The relations between Turkey and Iran, which have many common historical and cultural ties, have been placed on a sound basis. The factor that requires the two countries to further strengthen their relations is the question of safeguarding their common interests in ECO [Economic Cooperation Organization]. Political and economic experts are convinced that the relations between Iran and Turkey should be viewed from three angles. Compared with the past, the economic relations between the two countries within ECO's framework are rather important for them. That is why they are maintained at a favorable level. The trade and economic cooperation between the two countries in ECO's committees has significantly contributed toward the improvement of their relations. As far as the political aspect of their relations is concerned, Iran and Turkey need to take measures to defend their common border more effectively than in the past. In view of the fact that that matter has to be carefully followed, the two countries concluded important agreements on terrorism and border security during the past one and a half years. They have done so in accordance with the principle of noninterference in each other's internal affairs. Regarding regional issues, Turkey, Iran, and Syria have held several summits on the question of northern Iraq. The outcome of the summits and the bilateral relations between Iran and Turkey show the importance they attach to the establishment of peace and security in the region. Iran and Turkey are two important ECO and ICO [Islamic Conference Organization] members. As such, they have many opportunities and resources to further improve their bilateral relations. In view of that, Hashemi's visit to Turkey should be assessed as the outcome of the effort the Turkish and Iranian officials have made to further improve and strengthen the relations between the two countries as much as possible.
