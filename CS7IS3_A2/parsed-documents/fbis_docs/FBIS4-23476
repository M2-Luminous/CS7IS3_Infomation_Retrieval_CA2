Finance Minister Dr. Eneas Comiche, representing the Mozambican Government, signed an agreement with the Maharishi Heaven on Earth Development Corporation BV (Mahedco) [company's name in English] based in Holland on 6 July 1993. The agreement was signed one day after President Joaquim Chissano's departure from Holland where he received in Vlodrop, Mahedco's headquarters, a Honoris Causa Doctorate Degree from Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the oriental guru who is behind "paradises on earth" projects. [passage omitted] The Terms of the Agreement Terms and Conditions of the Agreement for the Establishment of an Integrated Project in Mozambique called "Paradise on Earth Project": The main aim of this agreement is to promote the implementation of the project...through the following programs: 1. To improve the quality of life, including health care and education, as well as significantly improve the per capita income of Mozambican citizens and the whole country's economic growth; 2. To optimize the development of agriculture, horticulture, floriculture, etc., in order to increase foreign exchange revenue and achieve self-sufficiency in domestic production; 3. To create agricultural and industrial enterprises to produce different kinds of products, including dairy products for domestic and foreign markets; 4. To establish industries that would offer high quality alternative products to replace imports, as well as establish alternative nonpollutant industries. 5. To establish mining enterprises in the country for greater mining production and exploration. 6. To promote integrated agricultural and forest projects in a responsible manner so as to protect the environment; 7. To develop basic social infrastructure, housing, roads, schools, hospitals, power supply, communications, cities, and villages. 8. To develop other areas of mutual interest. The agreement's preamble refers to the government's duty to guarantee "quick development without increasing foreign debt and dependence from abroad" as well as the company's commitment to obtain financing "avoiding as much as possible using substantial funds coming from the international financing market in order not to expose the country to unnecessary economic pressures." The Allocation of Areas and Operation Rights for the Project To implement the Paradise on Earth Project...the government will allocate unutilized land in the Provinces of Niassa, Cabo Delgado, Tete, Gaza, Inhambane for agriculture, silviculture, and reforestation. For the continued development of the project, the company will apply for necessary licenses in accordance with the specific legislation in force governing economic activities in Mozambique, particularly the Land and Mineral Resources Law. The government grants the company all operation rights for a period of 50 years, which will be renewable. Relevant regulations will also apply to all other kinds of activity. General Responsibilities of the Parties The company undertakes to organize and supply all "know how", train local staff, provide basic social infrastructure and promotion and export services, as well as all other activities needed in the project. The company will organize foreign financing needed to implement the project. The servicing of the debt used in financial undertakings of the project will be covered by the money obtained from the exports and the sale in Mozambique of products generated by the project. The company will organize the supply of necessary tractors and other equipment which does not exist in the country for agriculture and mining exploration, and technicians specializing in the building of infrastructure needed for the project. The company will have the right to contract technicians from anywhere in the world to develop the project and guarantee the training of local farmers. The company is responsible for the implementation of the project. The government must guarantee that land is available for the project as well as all the relevant information required for the project. The Center for Investment Promotion (CPI) will make available services to facilitate the company's negotiations with the government. Training, Education, and Health All the education and training of people taking part in the project at all levels will be provided by and in accordance with the principles and regulations of national and international institutions under Mahedco. The company will establish in Mozambique educational institutions at different levels to educate Mozambicans at all levels, including primary, secondary, and professional levels. Within the framework of the national health policy, the company will implement a system of health care, based on the traditional system of natural medicine (on the basis of herbs and medicinal plants), the Maharishi Ayur-Ved system. Incentives The government will grant the following rights and incentives to the company: - all export incentives, as well as the exemption of taxes on export and import of equipment, imported material for investment in the project, and raw materials to produce exports. - exemption of circulation tax and excise duty for the equipment and material imported for investment in the project. - reduction by 50 percent of industrial tax (CI) and supplementary tax, not exceeding 10 years after the beginning of production in each one of the operations. - at the expiry of 10 years, the investments in Niassa, Cabo Delgado, and Tete will benefit from an additional reduction of 50 percent in industrial tax for a period of six years (Niassa) and three years (Cabo Delgado and Tete). The investments in Gaza and Inhambane will benefit from a reduction of 25 percent in industrial tax for an additional period of two years. - costs incurred by the company in the development of infrastructure in the country will be reduced from taxes to be paid. - costs incurred in the training of Mozambican workers may be deducted from the amount subject to industrial tax up to a maximum limit of 5 percent of that taxable amount. - capital, loans, and interests will be tax-exempt. Cessation of the Agreement If the agreement is terminated by the relevant authorities, or in case of expropriation, revocation, or suspension, the company has the right to commercial compensation, as defined by just market criteria. The text of the agreement, also signed by Mahedco's Executive Director Dr. Jacques Uijen, does not define the investment sum for the implementation of the Paradise on Earth in Mozambique. A Paradise With 20 Million Hectares For a country with 80 million hectares of land, 20 million hectares signify a quarter of the national territory, simple arithmetic. Twenty million hectares is the size of land that Mahedco intends to explore in Mozambique. [passage omitted] Projects Reconverted In the midst of silence and embarrassment from a number of government officials, the Investment Promotion Center assured SAVANA that the agreement signed with Mahedco is not being implemented. "The project is being renegotiated at present," an official from the Investment Promotion Center told us. Without providing details, he said the present philosophy is to impel Mahedco to support "people with land rights." [passage omitted]
