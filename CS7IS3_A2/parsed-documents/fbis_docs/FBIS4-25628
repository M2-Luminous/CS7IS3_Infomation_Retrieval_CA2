FBIS4-25628 "drchi113_v_94003" FBIS-CHI-94-113 Daily Report 11 Jun 1994 TAIWAN SEF Official Terms Qiandao Lake Trial `Seriously Flawed' SEF Official Terms Qiandao Lake Trial `Seriously Flawed' OW1106134094 Taipei CNA in English 1324 GMT 11 Jun 94 OW1106134094 Taipei CNA English BFN [By Lilian Wu] [Text] Taipei, June 11 (CNA) -- A Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) official on Saturday [11 June] said the trial of the three suspects charged with robbing and murdering 24 Taiwan tourists and eight mainland crewmen and guides aboard a pleasure boat on Qiandao Lake was like a "play acted according to a prepared script." Hsu Hui-you, SEF's vice secretary-general, said that he regretted that the trial, which ended with final prosecution and defense statements on Saturday, was seriously flawed, and that it only revealed Beijing's intention to summarily close the case. He said that the complexity of the case meant it should have been handled in a careful and thorough manner. The court will announce the verdict Sunday. Hsu said that key witnesses to the crime were not allowed to testify, and that many of the questions raised by Taiwan concerning the case remained unanswered. The prosecutor asked the court to mete out the death penalty to the three men because of the heinousness of their crime. The defendants' lawyers asked for leniency, saying their clients had shown deep regret for their crimes. The defendants, Wu Lihong, Hu Zhihan and Yu Aijun, all pleaded guilty, and did not defend themselves when testifying. Yu did say, however, that he hoped cross-strait relations would improve after sentencing is carried out on him and the other two defendants. Hsu was not as optimistic that the cross-strait relationship would resume as it had been before the incident, saying that scars would be left on the hearts of Taiwanese because of the way Beijing handled the case.
