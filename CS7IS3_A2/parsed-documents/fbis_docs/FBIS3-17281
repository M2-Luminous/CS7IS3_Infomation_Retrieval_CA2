Yerin. What did you discuss? [Kramarev] The minister announced his decision to send me into retirement. I will not discuss this and I do not intend to do anything to oppose this intention in any way. [Potapenko] What reasons did the minister give for retiring you? [Kramarev] The discussion was mainly about the high level of crime in St. Petersburg and the fact that the measures taken by the GUVD [City Administration of Internal Affairs] were inadequate. A number of other complaints were made as well. For example, we discussed a letter sent by the city's mayor, A. Sobchak, to the president in which he insisted on my retirement and referred to the exceptionally grave crime situation in the city. In passing, the minister mentioned that I had had difficult relations with the mayor's office. And he thinks that these relations sometimes do harm to the cause. [Potapenko] Expressing his complaints, the mayor recently spoke also of the notion that the GUVD chief was too politicized. [Kramarev] Yes, and as an example he referred to the fact that I was nominated by three electoral blocs in the elections to the City Assembly. But they did not coordinate this with me. Moreover, after the well known directive from Sobchak I rejected these proposals. Nor was the mayor pleased by the fact that a number of individuals who are friends of our high-ranking bureaucrats were arrested recently. But, obviously, if we arrest someone, we do not think about whose friend they are but about whether there is serious evidence of their guilt. Moreover, if Kharchenko, Aleksandrov, or Kisilev were on the mayor's team, that cannot be said, for example, about Bondarenko. [Potapenko] At the meeting with the minister, did you discuss your future? [Kramarev] Viktor Fedorovich behaved like a gentleman. In the first place, he promised me that the documentation on my retirement would not mention any failures in my work. So I am leaving without disgrace. Second, I was offered a chance to remain in the ministry and do teaching work. He mentioned the Higher School of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Legal Institute. Incidentally, I have had other offers as well. For example, to be in charge of a Cossack squadron. So maybe I will be a squadron leader. But, seriously, I have not thought about the future yet--it is difficult to shift gears so quickly. [Potapenko] There has been a lot of discussion about your possible successor. [Kramarev] One of the candidates mentioned to me was Yuriy Nikolayevich Loskutov, the chief of the fire safety school. I do not know him well enough. At one time he was in the main administration in charge of the work of the state automotive inspection, and then he left us. I think he would have a difficult time in this post since here every day it is necessary to resolve a multitude of problems related to operational investigative work, and he has no experience in that. I do not know why he in particular was mentioned as a possible candidate, and I do not want to guess. [Potapenko] A couple of days ago on the program "Fakt" we heard that the citywide operation "Signal" is nothing but show for the purpose of making General Kramarev look good. [Kramarev] It was a planned measure for which we prepared for several months. The Good Will Games will begin soon and we will be gradually increasing our efforts to make sure that everything is peaceful on the streets of St. Petersburg. And the fact that about 1,000 people have been assigned to us from other regions--this is an absolutely normal phenomenon. When similar measures were conducted in Vorkuta or Syktyvkar, we sent people there. So there is nothing showy here. [end Kramarev] P.S. Another brief commentary on Arkadiy Kramarev's retirement was given to the NEVSKOYE VREMYA correspondent by the deputy minister of internal affairs of Russia, Colonel General A.N. Kulikov, who is in St. Petersburg in connection with the "Signal" operation: "It is difficult to give a direct evaluation to the work of General Kramarev. He has more than 20,000 people under him and he is responsible for the peace and quiet of an immense megalopolis. And it happens that the leader is responsible for shortcomings in the subdivisions. I have normal business relations with Arkadiy Grigoryevich, but we have the minister over us, and in this case the mayor as well. And there is nothing that can be done here.
