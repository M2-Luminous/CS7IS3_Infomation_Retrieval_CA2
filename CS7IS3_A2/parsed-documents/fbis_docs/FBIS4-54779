The Free Democrats are not prepared to play "second fiddle" in the government. They hope that the new government to be formed after the May parliamentary elections will rely more on expertise, Peto said. In his view, the governing coalition can be dismissed not only by the Socialist Party but also by the liberal bloc composed of the SZDSZ, the Federation of Young Democrats, the Entrepreneurs' Party, and the Agrarian Association. Campaign manager Balint Magyar said that the election campaign is harsher now than it was four years ago. This harshness is reflected mainly by certain programmes aired by the state radio and television. In reply to a question, Peto said that, should the Free Democrats come to power, they would not intervene in the internal affairs of the two media. The deputy presidents of the state radio and television would be dismissed, not for political reasons, but because they have proved themselves unfit for managing the public service media in an unbiased way.
