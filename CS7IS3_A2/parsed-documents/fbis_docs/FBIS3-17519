He admitted at an earlier meeting with Turkmen foreign ministry officials that each CIS session had been a headache for him, especially hearing calls for Turkmenistan's more active role in efforts to settle conflicts in Tajikistan and Abkhazia or invitations to military or economic alliances. Many leaders "advocate unions because they fail to cope with the difficulties that have cropped up after their country became independent," he said.
