It is a region bedeviled by ethnic clashes. A government mediating team has been touring the north for some weeks trying to cool things down, but, at Bimbila, local people turned on police after a truck carrying ammunition was seized. From Tamale, our reporter Adama Eliasu telexed this report: [read by announcer] Last Tuesday [25 January], a group of people at Bimbila in the northern region attacked and wounded security personnel and burned down the police station, as well as the residence of the assistant superintendent of police. The trouble broke out after a vehicle carrying ammunition was intercepted by security personnel. It is illegal to carry arms and ammunition in the area because of the longstanding tribal tensions there. Tuesday's attack resulted in six policemen and two soldiers being seriously injured. A police source told me the injuries happened when a mob forcibly freed the vehicle after it was seized and took away the ammunition. The mob then also stole four rifles and a pistol from the police. According to the police source, when the vehicle carrying the ammunition was impounded, the local Ghana Private Road Transport Union [GPRTU] chairman, Mr. Pantina Dawuni, intervened and insisted that the vehicle and its ammunition be released or else there would be trouble. The GPRTU chairman then mobilized people armed with cudgels and offensive weapons, who attacked the police at the (Pandi)-Bimbila barrier, where the vehicle was intercepted. The chairman then mobilized another group to attack the police station and burn it down. The crowd then invaded the police superintendent's residence and seized about 200 guns, which the police had taken over the last 10 years. A detachment of 76 policemen from Tamale, Sunyani, and Kumasi -- dispatched to Bimbila to maintain law and order -- have now been refused entry. Pantina Dawuni has sent a message to the divisional headquarters at Yendi, 43 miles from Bimbila, warning of an inevitable confrontation if the police dare to enter the town. A police source said that to avoid a bloodbath, they were temporarily staying away to allow members of the Northern Regional Security Committee and parliamentarians of the area to go as peacebrokers. Meanwhile, the 6th Battalion of Infantry, stationed at Tamale, have been put on the alert and they will move in if the situation demands it.
