Nick Driver, of the US news agency UPI, and Matthew Forney, a correspondent with Newsweek magazine, were stopped by six uniformed police at 8 p.m. (1200 GMT) Friday as they left the home of the wife of dissident Liu Nianchun, 46, in the west of the capital. Police said their car had collided with a telegraph pole when they parked their vehicle, bringing down telephone lines. The journalists did not deny this. But then about 30 police took turns interrogating them separately about their connection with the dissident and their conversation with his wife. Before the Americans' release early Saturday at about 2 a.m. (1800 GMT Friday), police made them sign a document in which they agreed not to report what occurred during the course of the night. The incident took place as US Secretary of State Warren Christopher was on an official visit to Beijing for talks on human rights. It also coincided with a crackdown by police against dissidents and activists which began at the start of the month. According to a Human Rights Watch/Asia report Friday, Liu, who was jailed for three years in the 1980s, was one of those briefly detained and "may be in imminent danger of arrest." Liu, a longtime pro-democracy activist, called at the start of the week for the formation of an independent trade union, The League for the Protection of Working People. The union's charter focuses on some of the negative consequences of rapid economic growth and calls, among other things, for the restoration of the right to strike and for the legalisation of independent workers' and peasant labour unions. Liu is also a signatory of the Peace Charter issued by several dissidents in October 1993.
