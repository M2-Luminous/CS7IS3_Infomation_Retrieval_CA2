FBIS4-54848 "dreeu087_d_94002" FBIS-EEU-94-087 Daily Report 30 Apr 1994 SLOVAKIA HZDS Protests Austrian Election `Interference' HZDS Protests Austrian Election `Interference' AU0405152294 Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak 30 Apr 94 p 2 AU0405152294 Bratislava PRAVDA Slovak BFN [TA SR report: "Allegedly Mendacious Defamations"] [Text] Bratislava--Referring to the Slovak press, the Austrian APA agency yesterday reported that Anna Nagyova, former director of the Slovak prime minister's secretariat, was expecting a baby by former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar. In addition to this information, the APA report also contains several invectives regarding their "supposedly not merely official business relations" and marital problems in both families. A statement made available to TA SR yesterday by Ondrej Hanko, spokesman for the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], notes in this context that, "by its vulgar, unsubstantiated, and mendacious contents, the APA report defames HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar and Anna Nagyova, head of his secretariat." In the name of the HZDS, Hanko openly asked Austrian President Thomas Klestil, Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, and Parliament Chairman Heinz Fischer how they assess the fact that, "before the early elections, Austrian media are interfering grossly and in the dirtiest possible way in the election campaign by their unfounded scandalization of a leading politician, the chairman of the largest political entity in neighboring Slovakia." He asks whether this does not constitute interference in the internal affairs of a neighboring country and in the hitherto exemplary friendly relations, which have been successfully developed by Meciar personally. HZDS representatives also sent a similar statement to leading Austrian dailies.
