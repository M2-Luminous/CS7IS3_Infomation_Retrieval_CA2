Li Zemin, Wan Xueyuan, Liu Feng, Chai Songyue, Lu Zhangong, Xu Yongqing, Liu Xirong, Liang Pingbo, Si Daxiao, Xu Xingguan, Long Anding, Zhang Qimei, Xu Zhichun, Sun Jiaxian, and other provincial leaders attended yesterday's meeting. Li Zemin spoke and Chai Songyue gave a summing-up of the conference, expressing his opinions on the reform of the fiscal and taxation system as well as enterprise and agricultural problems, which were matters of great interest. In the reform of five major systems, reform of the fiscal and taxation system is the one with great difficulties and encompassing a wide range of issues. Practicing the financial system of separated taxes and gradually bringing the "contract system" to an end is not only a significant reform in fiscal and taxation work, but will also lead to crucial changes in the behavior of the government and enterprises. The current reform of the taxation system, which has introduced the value-added tax and unified income tax rates, is extremely indispensable to bringing about a system of fair taxation and thus creating a market environment for fair competition among enterprises. Although the reform of the fiscal and taxation system has caused some problems that cannot be ignored in the economic work in the near term, what is more important is that it has offered a rare opportunity to step up Zhejiang's economic growth and improve its economic quality. We should all the more be aware of its beneficial effect on long-term development, and stand on a higher point and take a longer view. We should often approach the issue of reforming the fiscal and taxation system with a positive view and thus grasp its significance, use our brains frequently, and think of a way to practice it; whoever grasps this issue and takes the earlier initiative will benefit sooner. The fundamental way out for running enterprises well under the new situation still lies in deepening reform. From a long-term point of view, we should strive to attain the goal and fulfill the requirement of establishing a modern enterprise system. At the moment, we should run existing enterprises well as the preparatory and fundamental work for the establishment of a modern enterprise system in the future. In light of the fact that Zhejiang's enterprises increased their losses last year and some of them have failed to reverse their loss-making situation for a long time, in proceeding with reform this year we should firmly follow the principle of the circulation of equities in a market economy to promote reform bravely and strive for a new breakthrough this year. Enterprise reform is the microeconomic basis of economic reform as well as the key to the success or failure of this year's reform. In approaching the issue of enterprise reform, we should further emancipate our minds and feel freer in taking action. To put agriculture on the course of a market economy, we still have to keep exploring in the course of practice. Developing high-yield, high-efficiency, and fine-quality agriculture as well as developing "large-scale agriculture" which incorporates the distribution system is the direction we should adhere to. Since Zhejiang deregulated prices of farm produce, the problem of ignoring the government's guidance and administration has existed in the past few years. This year, we must redress abnormal phenomenon in agriculture, such as large area of uncultivated land and unattended fertile farmland. We should reverse some cadres' view that the government is of no help to agricultural production, particularly grain production, and thus let it drift. We should also study and improve ways to guide peasants' work and must not further increase their burden. We should strengthen management over the supplies of the means of agricultural production to cut the cost and increase the returns of growing grain. The tasks in this year's economic work and reform are arduous. We should look to the following: The organization and establishment of local financial institutions is of important significance to local economic development in the future, all localities and departments in charge of financing should do more preparatory work for the organization and establishment of cooperative banks in urban and rural areas -- making plans first and strive to take a significant step towards this goal this year. We should make good arrangements to ensure supplies on the market, strive to control commodity prices, and forestall manmade abrupt price hikes. Meanwhile, we should ensure industrial production, transport services, traffic safety, public security, and others around the spring festival in a down-to-earth manner. The special meetings on financing, taxation, economic restructuring, planning, and foreign trade, which were held simultaneously with the provincial economic work conference, have also successfully completed their respective major agendas. Some 1,500 comrades in charge of prefectural, city, and county governments and departments around the province attended this conference.
