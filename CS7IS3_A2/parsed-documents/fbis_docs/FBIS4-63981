The agenda covered aspects of political, trade, economic, scientific, and military technical interaction of the two countries. Before the two delegations sat down at the negotiating table, Chernomyrdin and Li Peng had a one-to-one conversation. "Russia and China -- for all the differences of their internal conditions -- have identical purposes of creating full fledged social-market economies and integrating in the world economy," the Russian prime minister said. Chernomyrdin praised the results of cooperation between Moscow and Beijing last year when the value of bilateral commodity turnover reached a record-high amount of 7.68 billion dollars, but admitted that problems still existed which impeded the free development of mutually beneficial Russo-Chinese ties. He pointed to certain economic difficulties, the shortfalls in agreements and the backwardness of transport communications and infrastructures. We think it advisable to strengthen the role of the centre in our trade and economic relations. We should also think about upgrading the level of cooperation," he said. The Russian prime minister recalled that more than one half of trade exchanges between Russia and China is carried out as a simple commodity exchange. "This form is exhausting itself ever more," he stressed. According to Viktor Chernomyrdin, the economic ties between Russia and China can be made more effective by investments of entrepreneurial capital. A case in point is the use of Russian natural resources and the building of agricultural projects. Another promising direction, according to Chernomyrdin, is the creation of a flexible banking infrastructure and interaction in the field of civil aviation, nuclear power engineering and peaceful uses of space. As concerns border issues, the chairman of the government of the Russian Federation pointed to the significance of their resolution in the interests of the further strengthening of bilateral relations. This work continues, he said. The head of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Russian Federation assured the Chinese premier that Moscow's position with regard to Taiwan is immutable. "We proceed from the assumption that only one China exists, and Taiwan is its inalienable part. Russia does not maintain official interstate relations with the island," he stressed. Chernomyrdin invited Li Peng to pay an official visit to Russia. In his opening address to the two delegations, the Chinese premier said good mutual understanding relating to many problems had been achieved during his one-to-one conversation with Chernomyrdin. He expressed the hope that Sino-Russian cooperation would develop, particularly in the economic sphere. "China and Russia are great powers. The Chinese and Russian peoples are great nations. The two countries have a common border. China is interested in a steady expansion of comprehensive relations with Russia," Li Peng stressed. He emphasized in particular the significance of the inter- governmental agreement, the signing of which will become "a big step" forward towards the turning of the Russo-Chinese frontier in an area of peace and friendship." The head of the Chinese Government also expressed the hope that friendly relations between the Chinese people's republic and the Russian Federation would strengthen peace in the whole world. As concerns trade and economic cooperation, the two sides agreed that the economies of China and Russia are "largely complementary" and expressed the desire to further expand this interaction, Li Peng said. Russo-Chinese inter-governmental agreements were signed as a result of the talks.
