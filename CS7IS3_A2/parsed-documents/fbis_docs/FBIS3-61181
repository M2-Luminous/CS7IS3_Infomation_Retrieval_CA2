He explained that it is much more important to define the set of qualities that a contender for this job must possess. Popov put at the top of this list experience of running an individual region. It is hard to argue with this. In the United States, too, in most cases the president is a politician who has sat in a governor's chair. How many such people do we have, with names familiar to most? Boris Nemtsov, Yuriy Luzhkov, Anatoliy Sobchak.... It is true that the image of the latter has faded somewhat since we saw him first at the USSR Congress of People's Deputies. But, as they say, it is not over yet. Society's moods are changeable.... [Yablonskiy] Anatoliy Aleksandrovich, to what extent were you aware of the preparations for the president's Edict No. 1400 of 21 September? [Sobchak] I anticipated it, although the precise date was a surprise for me. I learned of this edict from television, just like everybody else. Such decisions had to be made sooner or later. Not long before this edict, the Supreme Soviet handed the president another set of amendments to the Constitution. For all practical purposes, they abolished the office of the president, and there was no doubt that the Congress would pass these amendments to the Constitution. This way, they would have dealt with the president without any impeachment. [Yablonskiy] Have you ever advised the president to take this step? [Sobchak] This issue has never been discussed directly. At the presidential council we always discuss the situation and propose some or other way to resolve it. Immediately after the Constitutional Conference, when three-quarters of its participants approved the draft Basic Law, I proposed immediately to move toward holding a referendum or to attempt to bring the question of approving the new Constitution at the Congress of People's Deputies, putting only this one issue on the agenda. Otherwise, the president himself would have to make a decision on calling for early elections. [Yablonskiy] As a jurist, however, do you see here some things that are incorrect from the standpoint of law? [Sobchak] During a period of transition, things that are incorrect from the standpoint of law happen all the time. In 1991 the Congress practically unanimously voted to strip USSR people's deputies of their powers, although it had no power to make such a decision.... People's deputies voted not only for themselves, but sometimes for up to 10 people, which makes any decision ever passed by the parliament, or even the existence of this body, questionable. We have a lot of things that are not legitimate. This is inevitable, because we live by a mixed law, 90 percent of which is still a holdover from the communist era. [Yablonskiy] Were you against the disintegration of the Soviet Union? [Sobchak] Yes. [Yablonskiy] In your opinion, does Russia face the same problem now? [Sobchak] The situation in the Soviet Union was different. Russia is not facing a problem of disintegration today. Here is why. All the former republics of the Soviet Union have had a taste of independence and now want to unite. They understand that even such a strong power as Ukraine cannot survive alone. [Yablonskiy] But purely Russian regions now are talking about seceding from Russia. Are you not concerned that.... [Sobchak] A trend is developing of disintegrating into individual fiefdoms? This process does present, of course, a certain danger. But if the federal government acts firmly and decisively, this will not happen. I think it would suffice simply to stop allocating money from the federal budget to any region, and it will immediately collapse financially. [Yablonskiy] Anatoliy Aleksandrovich, what is Russia? What kind of country is it--neither a Soviet republic nor the sovereign RSFSR? [Sobchak] I believe that Russia ceased to exist as a state in October 1917. And did not exist until October 1991; it had been completely integrated into the structures of the unitary Soviet Union, just like all the other republics. Such system existed only for administrative convenience, keeping track of CPSU members, and organizing party committees. Here are two examples that show that in essence the Russian state did not exist. In 1922 the Politburo of the Russian Communist (Bolshevik) Party's Central Committee makes a decision to transfer to Ukraine Russian territories with centers in Kharkov, Odessa, Yuzovka (Donetsk), and Kherson. With this wording: "For the purpose of strengthening the proletarian stratum and influence in Ukraine, to make these Russian provinces part of Ukraine." The second decision: in 1954, under Khrushchev--on transferring the Crimea to Ukraine. Again, it is the party leadership that makes the decision--not other bodies, even though they exist for the sake of formality. What kind of state is it? There was no Russian state. This period is a black hole in its history. The Russian state was restored only in 1991.... [Yablonskiy] But this time within the borders of some Russian SFSR [Soviet Federated Socialist Republic].... [Sobchak] Yes, but on a different basis. I believe that today Russia cannot raise the issue of border revisions, because it will inevitably lead to a war. It is in the interests of Russia today to ensure normal development within the RSFSR's borders. I do not preclude the possibility, however, that in time many Russian territories that have been transferred to Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus will return to Russia. The historic trend in this respect is very clear. [Yablonskiy] You had said that it is necessary to close the borders with the Baltics. One gets the impression, however, that you want to preserve this unstable equilibrium, with the Russian border seemingly being here, and at the same time not here.... So what do we do about the border? [Sobchak] I believe that the border should be closed. We can use for this purpose the troops being withdrawn from the Baltics and Europe--deploy them along the border and shut off uncontrolled exports of material valuables from Russia. We need to establish normal customs ties and movement of goods between Russia and the countries of the former USSR. A considerable number of crimes here--between 60 and 80 percent--are committed by persons from the Caucasus region, most of whom are citizens of other countries. They come here, commit crimes, and then go back to their republics, and you cannot initiate criminal proceedings against them. This by itself is a good reason to close the borders. If we have economic agreements with our neighbors on the freedom of movement of goods, we have to put in place such customs and border controls that would check the legality of movement of people from one republic to another. [Yablonskiy] Speaking of economic cooperation between countries of "a different caliber," can one say seriously that Russia has lost political influence after the disintegration of the COMECON and the USSR? [Sobchak] It depends how you define "political influence." There is influence that is exerted purposefully, crudely, visibly.... Such crude influence is becoming a thing of the past. But there also is another kind. When people cooperate, communicate well, and know one another, it is a completely different kind of influence. One should not be afraid of it. And one should exert influence. For instance, the conflict in Yugoslavia could have been stopped had influential arbiters, with whom the country had traditional and very strong ties, been brought in in time. It was Yugoslavia's back luck that Russia, and others among its traditional friends, were at the time busy with their own affairs. [Yablonskiy] Do you intend to run for president? [Sobchak] I do not intend to answer that question until the presidential election campaign begins. When it is announced, I will make my decision. I do think that today being the president of Russia is a kamikaze job. And it is not easy to decide for yourself whether it is worth it to be a kamikaze.
