['Arafat] I went to console my brother President Hafiz al-Asad after the martyrdom of his son, hero Basil al-Asad. I stopped over in Cairo on my way here. [Al-Shahri] What will you say to the custodian of the Two Holy Mosques? ['Arafat] I will say a lot of things. I will ask him to shoulder the responsibility for al-Aqsa Mosque, and I am certain he is capable of shouldering this responsibility. [Al-Shahri] What will you say to the Saudi people? ['Arafat] We will continue to move together until we pray in al-Aqsa Mosque. [Al-Shahri] But you were not with this people during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait? ['Arafat] I hope that issue will be brought to a close. I said that we will pray together in al-Aqsa Mosque. [Al-Shahri] Fine. You met with Peres in Oslo. Did your talks with him achieve any progress? ['Arafat] There has been no progress. However, we agreed to continue the talks this week in order to bridge the gaps between us. [Al-Shahri] Opposition to your policy continues to increase inside and outside the PLO. ['Arafat] We are a democratic state, and every person is entitled to say whatever he likes. We respect others' views. [Al-Shahri] Kuwaitis say that they have recently discovered weapons and skulls inside the Palestinian embassy. What is your opinion? ['Arafat] Brother, it was a machine gun and a pistol belonging to the ambassador. They must not say that. [Al-Shahri] What about the skulls? ['Arafat] They must not say that. They are dummies made out of plaster for first aid training. [Al-Shahri] What will you tell them if they insist these corpses exist? ['Arafat] Let them prove it. [Al-Shahri] Will your Gulf tour be limited to the Kingdom, or are you going to visit other states like Kuwait, for example? ['Arafat] If I am invited, I will visit them. [Al-Shahri] You did not tell me what you are going to say to the Saudi people? ['Arafat] Respected brother, I answered your question. I said we will head for al-Aqsa Mosque together. By the way, why are you interrogating me? Good-bye.
