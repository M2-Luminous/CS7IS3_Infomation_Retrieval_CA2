According to the telephone conference, marked progress was achieved in antipornography work last year thanks to leaders of various localities who personally attended to the work. In addition to deploying concentrated forces according to requirements set by the central committee, many provinces and cities also made corresponding arrangements to deal with book, newspaper, magazine, video, and audio product markets in their areas. Antipornography work last year focused attention on key areas and important links. As a result, breakthroughs were made in the investigation and handling of major cases involving the manufacture and sale of pornography, and a number of criminals were dealt with. According to incomplete statistics, in 1993 the country confiscated 332.18 million copies of banned books and publications, of which 288,000 were pornographic; 499,700 banned videotapes, of which 11,300 were pornographic; destroyed 170 pornography-manufacturing and retail bases, including some illegal publishing houses; investigated and handled 1,675 cases involving the manufacture and sale of pornography and illegal publishing activities; and investigated and punished 5,991 offenders. The conference noted: Despite the marked achievements made in antipornography work throughout the country, we must be fully aware of the chaotic condition of the publication market and realize everyone shoulders heavy responsibility in the struggle to combat pornography. The conference analyzed the reasons for the resurgence of the "poison of pornography." It also mapped out a specific plan to deal with antipornography work in 1994 in accordance with requirements set by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. The conference called on all localities to further promote understanding of antipornography work among cadres and the masses, to unify their thinking with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and to make unremitting efforts to grasp the work. The conference said: We must continue to make the handling of major cases the priority in antipornography work. In 1994 we must focus on raising the number of cases handled. It is also necessary to further enact and improve relevant laws and administrative regulations to manage book, newspaper, publication, audio, and video product markets according to the law. The conference was presided ver by Yu Youxian, deputy head of the National Leading Group for the Rectification of Book, Newspaper, Publication, Audio, and Video Product Markets. Liu Zhongde delivered a speech and Gui Xiaofeng presented a work report to the conference. Responsible people from various departments under the central committee also took part in the telephone conference.
