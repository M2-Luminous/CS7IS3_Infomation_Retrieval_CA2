Mr. Mangope is on the line now confirming the arrest, which he says is preventing him from taking part in the democratic process in South Africa. [Mangope] That's correct, yes. [Daniels] In terms of what provisions or what law have they done that? [Mangope] I don't know really. That is what baffles me. My own children are not to see me. My own children, my own family, immediate family, are not allowed to see me. I just cannot accept that. I'm not allowed, my wife is not allowed, my children with me here, are not allowed to go to my son's house. And I feel that is not right. [Daniels] Have you been specifically told that you are not allowed to campaign in the election? [Mangope] Yes, Dr. Tjaart van der Walt said that. [Daniels] Said that you will not be permitted to canvas? [Mangope] Well, he said they are restricting me in the interest of free political activity, whatever that means. In the interest of free political activity they are imposing this house arrest on me. [Daniels] And would you have liked to have taken part in the election? Were you planning to do so? [Mangope] My people were meeting today to discuss that. I have informed them what the position is, I mean, as it is, it is impossible. In any case there are parties who have not registered and who are therefore not going to take part in the election. I was going to put the matter of registration to my parliament yesterday. And if yesterday my parliament had adopted the recommendation, I'd definitely take part in the elections, but I was denied that.
