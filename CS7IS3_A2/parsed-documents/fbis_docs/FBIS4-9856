Garten [title as published] launched torpedoes at the Brazilian law that regulates the purchase of telecommunications products by calling it protectionist and bureaucratic. Thus, he echoed the words of U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown, who at the beginning of the month sent a letter to Brazilian Science and Technology Minister Israel Vargas condemning the protectionist attitude in government purchases of technological products. The Brazilian telecommunications market has tremendous growth potential. Brazilian Telecommunications, Inc. cannot meet the demand for expansion and it would be great if telecommunications prices dropped. The U.S. accusations are somewhat irresponsible. The recently edited Brazilian law is strictly inspired by American law. Here, exactly like in the United States, it has been established that a public bid can be won by a national company with up to 6 percent overpricing or even 12 percent overpricing if it comes from a high unemployment area. The point of view of Garten and Brown is more backward if we analyze a public bid published a little more than a month ago by the National Renewable Energy Laboratories, a U.S. public institution that looks after renewable energy sources. The bid will choose a solar energy system for Brazilian Electric Power Company, Inc. in a joint research program. The bid establishes that offers from foreign manufacturers will have a 50 percent overpricing. And if the offer is the same as that of an American company, the American company wins the bid. It is the typical case of do as I say and not as I do.
