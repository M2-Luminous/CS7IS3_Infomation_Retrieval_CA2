FR940725-1-00075 FR940725-1-00010 (c) For commuter category airplanes, the reference landing approach speed, V REF , must not be less than the greater of 1.05 V MC , determined in §23.149(c), and 1.3 V SO. 21. Section 23.75 is amended by revising the section heading, introductory text for the section; the introductory text of paragraph (a); and paragraphs (b), (d), (e), and (f), and by removing paragraph (h), to read as follows: §23.75 Landing distance. The horizontal distance necessary to land and come to a complete stop from a point 50 feet above the landing surface must be determined, for standard temperatures at each weight and altitude within the operational limits established for landing, as follows: (a) A steady approach at not less than V REF , determined in accordance with §23.73 (a), (b), or (c), as appropriate, must be maintained down to the 50 foot height and_ * * * * * (b) A constant configuration must be maintained throughout the maneuver. * * * * * (d) It must be shown that a safe transition to the balked landing conditions of §23.77 can be made from the conditions that exist at the 50 foot height, at maximum landing weight, or at the maximum landing weight for altitude and temperature of §23.63(c)(2) or (d)(2), as appropriate. (e) The brakes must be used so as to not cause excessive wear of brakes or tires. (f) Retardation means other than wheel brakes may be used if that means_ (1) Is safe and reliable; and (2) Is used so that consistent results can be expected in service. * * * * * 22. Section 23.77 is revised to read as follows: §23.77 Balked landing. (a) Each normal, utility, and acrobatic category reciprocating engine-powered airplane of 6,000 pounds or less maximum weight must be able to maintain a steady gradient of climb at sea level of at least 3.3 percent with_ (1) Takeoff power on each engine; (2) The landing gear extended; (3) The wing flaps in the landing position, except that if the flaps may safely be retracted in two seconds or less without loss of altitude and without sudden changes of angle of attack, they may be retracted; and (4) A climb speed equal to V REF , as defined in §23.73(a). (b) Each normal, utility, and acrobatic category reciprocating engine-powered airplane of more than 6,000 pounds maximum weight and each normal, utility, and acrobatic category turbine engine-powered airplane must be able to maintain a steady gradient of climb of at least 2.5 percent with_ (1) Not more than the power that is available on each engine eight seconds after initiation of movement of the power controls from minimum flight-idle position; (2) The landing gear extended; (3) The wing flaps in the landing position; and (4) A climb speed equal to V REF , as defined in §23.73(b). (c) Each commuter category airplane must be able to maintain a steady gradient of climb of at least 3.2 percent with_ (1) Not more than the power that is available on each engine eight seconds after initiation of movement of the power controls from the minimum flight idle position; (2) Landing gear extended; (3) Wing flaps in the landing position; and (4) A climb speed equal to V REF , as defined in §23.73(c). 23. Section 23.143 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (c) to read as follows: §23.143 General. (a) The airplane must be safely controllable and maneuverable during all flight phases including_ (1) Takeoff; (2) Climb; (3) Level flight; (4) Descent; (5) Go-around; and (6) Landing (power on and power off) with the wing flaps extended and retracted. * * * * * (c) If marginal conditions exist with regard to required pilot strength, the control forces required must be determined by quantitative tests. In no case may the control forces under the conditions specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section exceed those prescribed in the following table: ␣ 1Values in pounds force applied to the relevant control 1Pitch 1Roll 1Yaw (a) For temporary application: Stick 60 30 Wheel (Two hands on rim) 75 50 Wheel (One hand on rim) 50 25 Rudder Pedal 150 (b) For prolonged application 10 5 20 24. Section 23.145 is amended by revising paragraph (b) introductory text, paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(5); adding a new paragraph (b)(6); and revising paragraphs (c) and (d) to read as follows: §23.145 Longitudinal control. * * * * * (b) Unless otherwise required, it must be possible to carry out the following maneuvers without requiring the application of single-handed control forces exceeding those specified in §23.143(c). The trimming controls must not be adjusted during the maneuvers:
