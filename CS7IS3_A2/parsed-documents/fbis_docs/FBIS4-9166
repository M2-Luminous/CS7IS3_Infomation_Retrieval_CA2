The council will next week issue a decree that says news programs will be the place for presentation of politicians' current activities. Television heads will be able to grant time slots to the government, the president, or the Sejm, but they will not be obliged to do so. [Begin recording] [Correspondent Lukasz Perzyna] In news programs, television ought to maintain balance in the presentation of the main political forces. Yesterday, the draft decree was commented on by the Polish Television Program Council. Its members wished the formulations contained therein be made more precise, but, in the view of the KRRiT, general principles ought to suffice. [Lech Dymarski for KRRiT] It was proposed that this balance be substituted by a formulation as to political parties that have real significance in political life. But someone immediately asked how real significance can be measured. Further, can this be limited to the political parties that exist in parliament? Well, it cannot be. A party that is in parliament will, perhaps, after some election or other, function outside of parliament. [Perzyna] Those who make programs will be responsible for them; that means the board of television, the editors of particular programs, the journalists themselves. Everyone ought to be directed by the principles of professional ethics. [Dymarski] The journalist has an obligation to know a lot and to be responsible. So this decree does not contain any such formulation as to what a journalist may not do. [Perzyna] The National Council will next week specify the principles in force in radio and television for the campaign before the June self-government elections. [end recording]
