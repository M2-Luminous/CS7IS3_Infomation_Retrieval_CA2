But First They Must `Scare Up' 1 Billion Rubles and Eight Meters of Heavy-Weight Concrete"] [Text] Details "The Russian side will provide for financing and performance of the entire complex of work for dismantling the nuclear device and the material part of the physics experiment FO-100-SZhR in adit 108-k at the Semipalatinsk Testing Ground according to a schedule agreed upon by the parties." So goes the first article of the "Agreement Between the Russian Federation Government and the Republic of Kazakhstan Government for Dismantling the Nuclear Device Placed at the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Testing Ground Before It Was Closed," signed in Moscow on 28 March 1994. Effective 25 October 1990, a year's moratorium was unilaterally introduced on nuclear testing. This step was undertaken by the country's top leaders without serious consultation with members of parliament and specialists. As a result, a nuclear device with a capacity of 0.4 kilotons (equivalent to 400 tonnes of trotyl charge) was left prepared for underground testing in adit 108-k. The time period of the moratorium had not even expired when on 29 August 1991, Nursultan Nazarayev, by an order to close the Semipalatinsk Testing Ground, ruled out the possibility of using it further for conducting underground tests. This situation applied fully to the physics experiment OF-100-SRZh that had been prepared at site 108-k. Thus this nuclear charge, small by today's standards, lay in the adit cut in the granite monolith of Degelen at a depth of 126 meters. Incidentally, the verb "lay" does not quite fit the real state of affairs. Without careful continuous technical service this unintentional unique experiment--never before in world practice has a nuclear charge remained so long, four years, outside warehouse premises--threatened to end with an uncontrollable nuclear explosion at any moment. With the collapse of the USSR the situation at the Semipalatinsk test site, which had become a constituent part of Kazakhstan's national nuclear center, evoked constantly growing alarm. Last winter, as a result of a series of accidents in municipal utility networks, the system for maintaining the normal vital activity of the city of Kurchatov--the capital of the test site, as they called it--was put almost completely out of commission. Consideration was also given to the question of emergency evacuation from it of the Russian military unit that served, among other things, the nuclear charge in adit 108-k (see NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA for 24 November 1993). (Before that 27,000 people had already left the city, mainly military and civilian specialists providing support for nuclear research.) Work on the present agreement began in the autumn of 1992. But in reality up until the last moment it was not completely certain that it would be signed during President Nazarbayev's official visit to Russia. The fact is that at the end of January 1994 Kazakhstan made a proposal to include in the text an additional article making it incumbent on the Russian side to do "special work to clean up after the activity related to the nuclear device." The Russian Federation Ministry of Atomic Energy would not agree to this proposal and was able to convince the Kazakh side to withdraw it. Be that as it may, by the end of 1994 the nuclear charge was to have been dismantled and removed from the adit, and all the material part of the experiment was to have been moved unimpeded to the Russian Federal Nuclear Center (All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Technical Physics--VNIITF) in Chelyabinsk-70. Specialists of the VNIITF in conjunction with the All-Russian Scientific Research and Planning Institute of Industrial Technology carried out the project entitled "Opening and Eliminating Object 108-k." It is possible to judge the seriousness of the task facing them if only from the fact that as of the first half of 1993 the estimated cost of the work was R650 million. In the opinion of certain of the experts at the Ministry of Atomic Energy of the Russian Federation, the real cost would exceed a billion. Incidentally, there is nothing surprising here: After all, adit 108-k is essentially an extremely complex engineering and technical structure. It is 592 meters long. The nuclear device is housed in the so-called end box (KB). The protective shock-absorbing complex, which is actually supposed to guarantee maximum safety when conducting the nuclear explosion, consists of several load-bearing elements: the first section--a concrete ring 49 meters long, and 19.5 meters--from especially heavy-weight concrete with a metal filler; the protective sealing element seven meters in length made of concrete, and several other sealing elements. The project envisions opening the adit and drilling a bypass. This working should provide access to the end box from the rear side through an eight-meter concrete wall. The opening of concrete protective elements and drilling the bypass were to have been done by the blast-hole drilling method. The concrete wall in the immediate area of the end box was to have been opened with mechanical picks. The overall volume of mining work will amount to about 1,233 cubic meters, and the volume of work for dismantling cable lines and metal elements--about 114 tonnes. The agreement also envisions a scenario if for one reason or another it is impossible to extract the nuclear device. In this case it is to be destroyed right in the end part of adit 108-k with an applied charge of chemical explosive that will completely preclude the release of nuclear energy. On 12 April of this year the deputy prime minister of the Russian Government, Oleg Soskovets, signed an order to the Ministry of Atomic Energy of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Economics, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Russian Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety: "Request that you take measures to implement the agreement." From NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA Files Since 1961 at the Semipalatinsk Testing Ground 348 underground nuclear explosions have been conducted, of which five were under the program for working on the application of nuclear explosive technologies for industrial purposes. Underground explosions were conducted with nuclear explosive devices placed in both horizontal (215 explosions) and vertical (133 explosions) workings.
