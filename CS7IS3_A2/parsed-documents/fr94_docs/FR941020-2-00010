FR941020-2-00010 FR941020-2-00008 [C&hyph;583&hyph;604] Certain Stainless Steel Cooking Ware from Taiwan; Determination Not to Revoke Countervailing Duty Order AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice of determination not to revoke countervailing duty order. SUMMARY: The Department of Commerce (the Department) is notifying the public of its determination not to revoke the countervailing duty order on certain stainless steel cooking ware from Taiwan. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 20, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Brian Albright or Alex Braier, Office of Countervailing Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;2786. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On December 30, 1993, the Department published in the Federal Register (58 FR 69343) its intent to revoke the countervailing duty order on certain stainless steel cooking ware from Taiwan (52 FR 2141; January 20, 1987). Under 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii), the Secretary of Commerce will conclude that an order is no longer of interest to interested parties and will revoke the order if no domestic interested party objects to revocation and no interested party requests an administrative review by the last day of the fifth anniversary month. The Department received timely objections to our intent to revoke the countervailing duty order from the Fair Trade Committee of the Cookware Manufacturers Association, a not-for-profit trade association representing the interests of a majority of U.S. stainless steel cookware producers, and from Farberware, Inc., Vita Craft Corporation, and Mirro Company, U.S. producers of the subject merchandise, interested parties within the meaning of 19 CFR 355.2(i)(3). Because the requirements of 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii) have not been met, we will not revoke the order. This determination is in accordance with 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4). Dated: October 13, 1994. Joseph A. Spetrini, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Compliance. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26052 Filed 10&hyph;19&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P
