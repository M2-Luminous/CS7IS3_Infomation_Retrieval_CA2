Persons wishing to comment on this information collection should contact Timothy Fain, Office of Management and Budget, Room 10236 NEOB, Washington, DC 20503, (202) 395&hyph;3561. OMB Number: 3060&hyph;0292 Title: Part 69, Access Charges Action: Extension of a currently approved collection Respondents: State or local governments and businesses or other for-profit Frequency of Response: Monthly, semi-annually reporting requirements and one-time requirement Estimated Annual Burden: 5,832 responses; 5.8 hours average burden per response; 33,825 hours total annual burden Needs and Uses: Part 69 of the Commission's rules and regulations establishes the rules for access charges for interstate or foreign access provided by telephone companies on or after January 1, 1984. Part 69 essentially consists of rules or the procedures for the computation of access charges which are not information collections as defined by 5 CFR 1320. Any reporting or disclosure requirements occurs in connection with particular tariff filings with the FCC or other state commissions or with records maintained in accordance to the Uniform Systems of Accounts (USOA). Section 69.3 requires the annual submission of access charge tariffs. Section 69.116(c) and 69.117(c) requires LECs to file information with NECA semi-annually pertaining to the number of lines in their study areas and interexchange carriers to which such lines are presubscribed. This information will be used by NECA to assess revenue requirements needed to fund the Universal Service Fund and Lifeline Assistance Programs. Section 69.104(k)(1) requires that a state or local telephone company wishing to implement an end user common line reduction or waiver for its subscribers file information with the FCC demonstrating that its state lifeline assistance plan meets certain criteria. This is a one-time filing requirement. Section 69.104(l) requires local telephone carriers to calculate for NECA their projected revenue requirements for the lifeline assistance programs. Section 69.605 requires carriers who are participating in the pool to report access revenues and cost data so that NECA may compute monthly pool revenues distributions. The information is used by FCC staff to compute charges in tariffs for access service (or origination and termination) and to compute revenue pool distributions. Neither process could be implemented without the information. Federal Communications Commission. LaVera F. Marshall, Acting Secretary.
