She has information that many political prisoners are still being detained in many provinces and that there has been torture especially of members of FUNCINPEC. The deputy minister stated that these authorities -- who are carrying on the system of the old regime -- are exceeding their legal authority and are a major problem for the Ministry of Justice. She emphasized that, "If we cannot solve this problem now the `sickness' will be as grave as it was before." Up until now, the Ministry of Justice has been limited in seeking a solution to these violations because the constitution which regulates the power of the government is not yet set up. Mrs. Sam Kanitha said that, "At the present time disorder cannot be avoided." But, in spite of this, in accordance with special royal authorization from Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the Ministry of Justice is dispatching government attorneys to the various detention centers where they suspect that there are violations. Mrs. Kanitha explained that, "This does not mean that we are separating ourselves from the government. We are following the orders of the chief of state because we cannot yet operate according to the constitution." What she termed, "those old laws" still seem to be widely carried out. There is something unusual and slow about the courts. Recently we approved a memorandum for all judges to inform them of recent legal errors. And we began to investigate every legal case. We are trying to resolve every pending case before the new laws go into effect. We are also establishing a court of appeals. Up until now in Cambodia the judicial branch has not been independent. The laws had been made according to the wishes of the government and no one has dared to object. In the beginning the Ministry of Justice had no role, but was responsible for approving the judgments of various government organizations such as the Council of Ministers, the Ministry of Security, or provincial governors. These three authorities can detain a prisoner in jail as they wish. The Ministry of Security, according to research by the Ministry of Justice, has said that the use of torture is a technical matter of its own. She added that the various decisions have been made in accordance with party policies and the judges have not been appointed by them for their ability but rather for their loyalty. One of the many current problems which the Ministry of Justice must solve is the lack of healthy and independent judges in Cambodia to go back to work when there are new laws. The Ministry of Justice is now asking retired lawyers to return to work even those who live abroad. But Mrs. Sam Kanitha is perfectly aware that the government's pay will not attract many specialists. At present, monthly salaries at the Ministry of Justice range from 30,000 to 60,000 riels. Since the Ministry of Justice does not have enough new people to change the old regime, it has tried to explain the new system by teaching its own personnel. In close cooperation with United Nations agencies and human rights organizations, they have given many seminars to raise the level of education. Mrs. Sam Kanitha believes strongly that education is one of the ways to combat corruption. Beginning when she was in the Ministry of Education, she conducted experiments in order to combat corruption. From the beginning, in the schools and universities, since [they] had created an independent committee to monitor examinations and provide a secret number for the examinees, she observed that the students who have the ability to get good grades are not the students who have wealthy or powerful parents.
