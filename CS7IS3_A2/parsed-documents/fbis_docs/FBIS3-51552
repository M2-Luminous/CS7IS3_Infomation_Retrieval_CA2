In accordance with Article 11 of the Asuncion Treaty, the Fifth Summit of the Mercosur Council was held on 17 January 1994 in Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay, with the participation of Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem, Brazilian President Itamar Franco, Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy, and Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle. 2. The presidents express satisfaction over the participation of Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada at the meeting. 3. They emphasize that the results of the Mercosur negotiations are an exceptional experience in the region and represent an important asset and the basis for the permanent development of the integration process. 4. The presidents reaffirm the principles, objectives, and timetables established in the Asuncion Treaty to progress in a coordinated, balanced, and sustained manner toward the standardization of the customs procedures which will set the basis for the structure of the Common Market. They reaffirm their conviction that integration can strengthen and consolidate the democratic process in the four countries if it strongly contributes to the promotion of economic development and social justice. 5. Recognizing that the prosperity of their people and the achievement of a high standards of living is their main challenge, the presidents express special satisfaction over the substantial increase in intra-Mercosur trade, which has risen from $3.6 billion in 1990 -- before the signing of the Asuncion Treaty -- to more than $8 billion in 1993. This accelerated trade growth is the result, among other factors, of the fulfillment of the commercial liberation program which currently has a tariff preference of 82 percent between the states, the gradual elimination of non-tariff barriers, and the impulse given to commercial and productive initiatives jointly implemented by businessmen of the four countries. 6. They express satisfaction over the technical progress on the common external tariff. They confirm their determination to define the common external tariff by 30 June 1994 as a vital instrument for structuring customs tariffs, which is a significant stage in the establishment of Mercosur. 7. They stress that the coordination of macroeconomic policies is essential for the success of the integration process and emphasize that the fulfillment of the timetable established in Las Lenas [Argentina] and the implementation of the decision by the Mrecosur Council on the common external tariff -- which are measures and instruments for structuring Mercosur -- represents a firm commitment by the four country members. They agree that the progress on the different priority areas must be balanced and simultaneous. They reaffirm the important role of the Mercosur group to reach such objectives and resolve issues of priority interest for the four countries and recognize the need to coordinate more frequent meetings of the group. 8. The presidents highlight the importance of the special meeting to be held this year to establish the institutional structure of Mercosur which will in turn draw up the permanent institutions that will become operational on 1 January 1995. They note the importance of granting legal status to Mercosur as of 1 January 1995 to strengthen the permanence of the association established between the country members. 9. The presidents recognize the importance of physical integration for the complete implementation of Mercosur and reiterate their support for the many works of infrastructure that are being projected or implemented, particularly bridges, roads, river interconnections, and waterways. The presidents express their willingness to enhance these projects. 10. The presidents recognize that the integration process does not mean progress in the economic field alone and emphasize the achievements of the specialized meeting of the education ministers, particularly the commitment to sign an agreement to recognize certificates, titles, and primary and secondary non-technical studies before 30 June. They express satisfaction over the results of the specialized meetings on science, technology, and the environment. 11. The presidents stress the progress made in terms of enhancing employment, migration, workers' protection, and the process of harmonizing the labor legislations of member countries. 12. Within the context of Latin American integration, the presidents recognize the importance of strengthening the Latin American Integration Association and emphasize the need to maintain the integrity of the 1980 Montevideo Treaty which paved the way for a important number of achievements. The presidents stress that the protocol interpreting Article 44 of the 1980 Montevideo Treaty -- which will be formalized at the Eighth Ministers Council -- is an important instrument that guarantees the integrity and juridical security of the treaty in face of integration processes involving member countries and developed countries from outside the region. To further promote the trade that Mercosur member countries maintain with other South American countries, they will negotiate with their regional partners, as of this year, new agreements to ensure continuity and expansion of their economic relations and to increase the liberalization of trade. 13. The presidents stress that the integration momentum of the past few years has facilitated the creation of new subregional structures that need to be contemplated in order to promote their gradual convergence and to achieve better trade relations of Mercosur members with other brotherly countries. Within this context, the presidents studied the Brazilian Government proposal that was submitted at the Rio Group meeting in Santiago de Chile to form a South American free trade area. The presidents proposed convening a conference during 1994 to define the mechanisms and instruments needed to conform such an area. 14. The presidents reiterate their satisfaction over the desire of the Bolivian Government to strengthen and enlarge its links with Mercosur. They believe it is necessary to meet the request of the Bolivian Government and invite its representatives to attend meetings of the subgroups as observers. Priority will be given to an agreement to be signed with Bolivia in accordance with the proposal mentioned in Paragraph 13. 15. The presidents express satisfaction over the enforcement of NAFTA and hope that this agreement will effectively contribute to create new trade and investment in the hemisphere, considering the need to encourage the talks that started within the "four plus one" agreement. 16. Evaluating the international economic situation, the presidents endorse the recent conclusion of the Uruguay Round of the GATT which reinforced the multilateral trade system and the creation of the World Trade Organization to implement the agreements reached. They express satisfaction over the coordination of actions between Mercosur countries and highlight the need to strengthen this in the immediate future to help eliminate the distortions and protectionist barriers affecting world trade. 17. The presidents express satisfaction with the important progress in the cooperation with the EC, especially through the CEFIR [expansion unknown] and developments within the framework of the inter-institutional agreement with the European communities, specifically on issues related to customs, technical regulations, agriculture, and support for the Mercosur Administrative Secretariat and Special Funds. They emphasize the results obtained since the launch of the first six-month program of the non-reimbursable technical cooperation agreement signed with the Inter-American Development Bank, and the importance of continuing to cooperate with that organization. 18. They express interest in the activities to support the progress of regional integration within the framework of the United Nations Development Program and suggest that all developing countries that are members of the system should benefit from the different mechanism of cooperation.
