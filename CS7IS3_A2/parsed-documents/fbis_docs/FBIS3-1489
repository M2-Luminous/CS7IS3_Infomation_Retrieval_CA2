The violence throughout Natal/kwaZulu escalates, while the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] fans the flames. While Chief Minister Buthelezi prattles on about "principles," "sovereignty" and "federalism," his supporters are receiving the hidden sub-text of his message: prevent by all possible means a free and fair election! Venues for publicly advertised election rallies are being denied to the ANC by gangs of armed Inkatha intruders. Throughout the province, homes of known supporters of Inkatha's opponents are being torched, and their occupants driven to flight by armed IFP gangs. Men, women and children are being gunned down in orchestrated gang attacks and in terrorist 'drive-by' shootings. Buthelezi, the kwaZulu government and kwaZulu Police wash their hands of any responsibility of complicity. This situation cannot be allowed to continue, it is bringing the province to a state of low-intensity civil war, which is broadening out beyond the provincial borders - vice todays IFP-inspired terror on the Witwatersrand. Here citizens going about their business in central Johannesburg have been terrorised by roaming bands of armed Inkatha gunmen, shooting at random, ANC headquarters at Shell House have come under attack with firearms, and our leaders and administrators besieged; and forced to return fire in self defence. Unknown numbers of people are dead and wounded in this bloody aftermath to what the IFP claimed was a "demonstration of loyalty" to Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. Unrestrained IFP gangsterism is destroying the hopes of the majority of our people for our first-ever free vote to determine the nature of our own next government. It is allowing the gangs and bully-boys to disrupt the course of democratic change, and to elevate the rule of the armed mob above the majority will of the whole South African population. Buthelezi claims to be motivated by high principles of "federalism" and Zulu "sovereignty." Such `principles' were never in evidence during the years when his power in kwaZulu derived from patronage from the apartheid state. They only emerge now to sanitise his efforts to prevent government power passing finally from the minority NP [National Party] government which installed, upheld and subsidised him in power. Buthelezi's frenzied opposition to the whole electoral process is not based on principle. It is based purely on expediency and fear. Every public opinion poll taken in the province points conclusively to a decisive election-day defeat for the IFP. That is a verdict substantiated by the hundreds of thousands of Zulus who turned out at last weekend's rallies and marches in Durban and Pietermaritzburg, in support both of the ANC and of the right to vote on April 27th. Buthelezi and the IFP dare not face the verdict of the voters. On his part, De Klerk claims to be inhibited from action to stabilise the Natal/kwaZulu turmoil, by considerations of caution, and fear of creating worse disorder. His motives too are suspect. He purports to be acting as a responsible head of state. But he also has one eye to advancing the NP election campaign whose main electoral plank is that it can "stop the ANC". Buthelezi's ambitions and De Klerk's run parallel. The vicious IFP campaign of murder and mayhem in Natal is also designed to "stop the ANC". It is time to call a halt to this conspiracy against the people of Natal and kwaZulu. There are only four weeks to the election. Neither the thuggery of the IFP nor the indecision and lack of leadership from the government can be allowed to dictate the outcome. If the government will not act, the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] must. It must act firmly and without delay. The SADF [South African Defense Force] must now be deployed throughout Natal/kwaZulu in sufficient strength to bring the bandit gangs under control. All members of the kwaZulu Police [KZP] who have been implicated in or trained in the secret "3rd force" camps identified by the Goldstone Commission, must be immediately disarmed and stood down. The remaining members of the KZP must be brought under SADF command and control. All units of the SA Police Internal Stability Units must be withdrawn from the province, and their duties taken on by the SADF and deployed members of the National Peace Keeping Force. The financial subsidies to the kwaZulu administration should be suspended immediately, until full compliance by the kwaZulu administration with the requirements of the Independent Election Commission [IEC] for free campaigning and voting. Conditions must now be created to enable the IEC to commence setting up polling stations throughout Natal/kwaZulu, under full protection of the national security forces. The IFP attempt to frustrate the will of the overwhelming majority of South Africans can not be allowed to continue. The IFP can not be allowed a veto over the rights of all others. The TEC must step in without further delay.
