While introducing the experiment of establishing a modern enterprise system in light of the "Company Law," there is the additional sentence "to spread the system, we should vigorously sum up experience and gradually develop standard measures for implementation." 6. On the part of running a clean administration and fighting corruption, the passages: "They also constitute a damage to reform, opening up, and the modernization program"; "are absolutely impermissible"; and "we oppose a proneness to boast and exaggerate" have been added after: "The introduction of the principle of commodity exchange to political activities by state organs and the exchange of power for money seriously distort the principle of a socialist market economy." 7. The passage: "Oppose and resist bad activities which disrupt unity among the people, hinder social progress, and harm the healthy growth of young people" has been added after: "Strengthen management over the cultural market according to law and use rich, varied, and healthy spiritual products to allow the cultural market to flourish." 8.

Discussing diplomatic work, the following has been temporarily added in light of the new circumstances: "I would like to tell our deputies a piece of news just received. In the vote by the UN Human Rights Committee yesterday, the motion on using human rights to oppose China submitted by some countries encountered another setback. This fully shows that the anti-China trend finds little support. On behalf of the Chinese Government and the people, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all countries which uphold justice." In the amendment, this passage has been included in the report. 13. There is an additional passage: "Vigorously blaze new trails, rely on our own strength, and build our country through arduous efforts" at the end of the report. In addition, some amendments have been made in wording. After the finalized "Government Work Report" has been adopted tomorrow afternoon (22 March), the full text will be issued on 23 March.
