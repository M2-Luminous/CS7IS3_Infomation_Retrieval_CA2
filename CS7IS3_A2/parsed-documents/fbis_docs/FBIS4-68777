Representatives of the community and scientific circles were invited to these seminars. As a participant in this measure, I can bear witness to the fact that, at the general conference summarizing these seminars, the words "Latin America" were never once pronounced. They generally appear in the speeches of our country's politicians and leading officials only for comparison with the situation in Russia. Either these are examples of the fruits of authoritarianism, which are so attractive to certain proponents of "Democratic Russia," or they are passionate assurances of the fact that our country is not some kind of "banana" republic. This image is especially popular among the national-patriots and communists. For the sake of fairness, I will note that similar motifs slip through from time to time also in the speeches of rather highly placed officials, evoking puzzlement among Latin American diplomats. Recalling all the official actions of the Russian Federation in regard to Latin America for the period since August of 1991, it is easy to note that they have in fact been disavowed by life itself. I am referring to the visits by Vice President A. V. Rutskoy to a number of South American countries, and the trip of the MVES [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations] delegates along the same route. As well as the Supreme Soviet's creation of groups for developing policy in regard to several of the leading Latin American states. Rutskoy is currently in Lefortov. Former MVES Minister S. A. Glazev has fallen into disgrace. The Supreme Soviet has been disbanded. As for Russian-Latin American relations, they have never gotten off the ground. We might add, how many months has Russia not had an ambassador to Mexico? And how long have our ambassadors to Equador and Argentina not been appointed? It seems that they do not give much thought to this in the "heights" on Smolensk Square. The foreign political course of its masters rests on two supports, one of which is the strategic cooperation with the USA, and the other--the geopolitical position of Russia with the "nuances" (Europe? Asia? Eurasia? Of, perhaps, Asiope?) We are being pulled into the "common European house." We long to become the eighth in the "big seven." We are bewitched by the Asia-Pacific region. And we cannot avoid the problems of the "near abroad." However, Realpolitik dictates to Russia its place in the current world. It is not so much that we are going to the "common European house" as Eastern Europe is drifting toward NATO. The Soviet legacy in Asia and Africa is confidently being picked up by the PCR [People's Republic of China], assuming the role of patron of the belittled and the insulted. Especially in the Arab East. In general, the collapse of the Soviet Union as a super power has created an unfavorable moral climate for Russia everywhere in the Old World. The reasons for this are varied. In some places they are happy about the removal of a potentially powerful competitor. There is also an abundance of small predators, ready to grab from us anything that is not nailed down. There are also those who accuse the "Russians" of traitorship. Today only in Latin America the word "Russian," which was always synonymous with "Soviet," does not evoke the reaction of detachment either in the mass consciousness or among the local ruling circles. The fact is that, first of all, in the political culture of the countries in this region, the role of the "bad boy" has historically belonged to Washington. Secondly, the Soviet period of our country's history gave Moscow the image of an antagonist of the United States, which we are shedding with such difficulty. We might add that many countries do not want us to depart from it. No myths, nor, we might add, the realities of the times of the Comintern [Communist International], the Cold War, the arms race, etc., can hide the fact that the Latin American establishment has always been ready to cooperate with the Kremlin over the ideological barriers, even the infamous Pinochet's Chile. With the beginning of perestroyka, the de-ideologization of Soviet foreign policy has only strengthened this tendency. An unpleasant surprise, and not only for the local communists, was Gorbachev's implementation of the little-understood course in regard to Latin America. This was particularly manifested in the course of his official visit to Cuba in 1988 (Mikhail Sergeyevich personally reaped the fruits of such a policy during his scandalously failed lecture visit to Argentina and Chile and 1993). The Latin Americans certainly did not write off our hasty "divorce" from Havana as a trait of the famous unfathomable nature of the Russian soul. And Shevardnadze's anti-Sandinista passes had zero success, since the masters of Managua at that time knew perfectly well about the content of the Soviet-American talks in London on the Nicaragua problem. They bravely undertook the fulfillment of all that we had promised the U.S. State Department, since... they intended to do nothing. And that is just what they did. It was 1989, and the international department of the CPSU Central Committee had grown tired of explaining to our "friends" that the "lean times" had arrived... However, despite all this, the reserve of good deeds accumulated during the Soviet era was so great that even Gorbachev and Shevardnadze, these two great dilettantes, could not exhaust them. Many thousands of Latin Americans, who had received their education in our country in their better youthful years, had taken with them forever in their hearts not only their love for their first Russian girl, but also similar, although more complex, feelings for our homeland. In the last 30 years, these former students became the backbone of the local elite, became leading millionaire-entrepreneurs, well-known leaders in science and culture, ministers and ambassadors. And they are returning to us, sent by their governments or guided by business interests, but never having lost their deep personal sympathies for our country. This is but one of the factors favoring Russian Latin-American policy which cannot be overlooked. Naturally, there are also other, more material factors. They are well known. Latin America remains a solvent market for our industrial production. Many light industry goods from the Latin American countries are quite suitable for the Russian consumer, not to mention the so-called colonial goods (coffee, cocoa, citrus fruits, etc.). Russia as a resource donor has not only competitive relations with the states of Latin America in this sphere, but also common interests. In general, we must admit that in the "North-South" dialogue the place of Russian hyperboreans is next to the Latin Americans. On one hand, they identify themselves with the values of Christian civilization. On the other, they clearly feel like outsiders in the world arena and strive to overcome this. But they do not have that colonial experience of Asia and Africa which presupposes the non-acceptance of the "white man" as such. Even the Cuban soldiers and specialists in Angola, Ethiopia and other African countries (not to mention Asia, and specifically South Yemen), despite the racial closeness, were considered by the local population to be kind people, but nevertheless outsiders, "colonialists." It is rather characteristic that the former clientele of the CPSU in Latin America is more successfully being "picked up" not by the Chinese, but by the Arabs from the Near East (for example, Iraq and Libya--through the Palestinian movement--in Central America, Columbia and Peru). The Levantine ethno-cultural amalgam, like any other, is functional. The foreign policy of any state depends not only on its material capacities and needs, but also on the presence of domestic decisiveness, as well as a favorable moral climate in that country or region where it intends to implement its political line. So far, I have tried to prove that it is specifically Latin America which is of particular interest to Russia, since there is clearly a mutual material interest and a favorable moral climate for our country's diplomacy. As for domestic decisiveness, here things are somewhat more complex. We must say, it is quite significant that we possess a great intellectual potential as specialists in Latin American studies. First of all, there is the Latin America Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, which after a short period of vegetation and fruitless efforts to "enter the market" changed over to the study of the region from the point of view of Russian interests. The journal, LATINSKAYA AMERIKA, has also been retained--almost the only one of the academic analogs, and has become standard reference reading in many foreign embassies in Moscow. The RAS Institute of General History has an operating Latin American Center, whose works are better known abroad than they are in our country. Latin America specialists from the academic Institute of Archeology are world renowned. And now I would like to explain what relation our Latin American studies have to Russian foreign policy. At one time long ago, toward the end of the middle ages, first the merchant and missionary went to open new horizons for their homeland, and then the warrior. In our time, the state, which must once again open up the world for itself, needs a different triad. First must come the highly skilled scientist, whose in-depth knowledge of the country where he is sent is one form of respect shown toward it, as well as an invitation to dialogue. Then it is the diplomat's turn, who gives the dialogue a constant character and facilitates the creation of a favorable climate, without which business people would have to break through thousands of obstacles. Obviously, there is no need to explain all this to the Russian Latin America specialists. But if suddenly this article falls into the hands of those who make the decisions, it would be useful for them to learn how this is already today being done in France. For Paris, Latin America today, when there is a struggle going on for supremacy in the European union, is a new horizon, representing a desire to strengthen its positions in the Old World by means of extending the Latin American "shoulder" of French diplomacy. The first step toward this was made in France by increasing the financing of the appropriate research centers and by attracting young people to them. In our country, as we know, it is almost impossible to retain already trained cadres. Therefore, we must especially value the heroic efforts of MGIMO [Moscow State Institute of International Relations], which developed its Latin America Center for the training of new generations of professionals. A good initiative has been the allocation by the International Fund "New World--500" (whose president is Moscow Mayor Yu. M. Luzhkov) of a prize in the form of an increased 6-month stipend for the best MGIMO student engaged in the study of Latin American problematics. We would like to believe that certain changes are also taking place in our MFA in its approach to Latin America. In any case, the recently held meeting of Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs G. S. Mamedov with Russian entrepreneurs and representatives of public organizations operating in the Latin American direction instills some hope. The high-ranking Russian official asked his fellow citizens, simply and openly, how his department can help their endeavors in the more distant abroad. You must agree, we do not often hear this from the authorities. The only thing that jarred us a bit was the reference to U.S. President Bill Clinton as some kind of standard: He too, protects "his own," they said. And once again we recalled the two pillars of our foreign policy... And also about those Latin American entrepreneurs who begin business negotiations with statements to the effect that they want to force out of their markets the North American goods which enslave them, and therefore are ready to buy Russian products of the same quality, but... for next to nothing. Moreover, they are sure that we, as before, will take the ideological bait. But while we can understand these Latin American merchants who have not yet recognized the changes in the direction of common sense which have taken place in our country, some of their fellow countrymen I simply refuse to understand. First one of them writes that Washington has turned its back on Latin America. And this at a moment when, thanks to the signing of the Free Trade Agreement, the words "United States of America" first begin to take on real content. Then another places his signature under the development of the "Gorbachev Fund" on the prospects of Russian policy in the Asia-Pacific region, where Latin America has been long forgotten. True, this forgetfulness is explained in the footnotes. But why is it that neither Japan, nor South Korea, nor Taiwan, nor the PRC suffer from it. Instead, they become ever more stubbornly involved in that very same Mexico, even as it is pulled ever more strongly into and ground up by the integration within the framework of the North American free trade zone. Not to mention Chile and the other Latin American countries bordering on the Pacific Ocean. Or even those not bordering it. Those who have been to Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Venezuela can tell us much about this. It is even more difficult to understand such opinions expressed by our country's specialists when we familiarize ourselves with the speeches of the U.S. President, filled with the pathos of unification, during his meeting with the heads of state and governments of Central America and the Caribbean, or those of Vice President Gore in Mexico. We would like to conclude these somewhat confused notes with some general arguments. The author is not so naive that he does not notice the real state of affairs in our homeland. "No money," the British said at one time, and tried to forget that they do not have the power for a policy not only "to the east of Suez," but much more west of that. There does not exist in nature that main link which, if we pull it, we can pull out from the quagmire the entire load of Russian problems, either in the economy, or in domestic policy, or in foreign. And if someone has decided that an active Latin American course pursued by Moscow can be such a link, then he has wasted precious time in reading this article. However, complete elimination of the Latin American component from Russian foreign policy would mean the creation of an initially detrimental foreign political facade of the Russian Federation.
