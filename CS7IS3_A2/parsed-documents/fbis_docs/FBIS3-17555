During his stay in the Netherlands, a memorandum was signed on ecologic cooperation between the Ukrainian Ministry of Environmental Protection, and the Ministry of Construction, Territorial Planning and Environment, the Ministry of Transportation, Public Works and Water Management, and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fishing and Nature of the Netherlands. This memorandum provides for cooperation in the sphere of ecologic management and the protection of air, water, and wildlife. It was agreed that a working cooperation program for 1994-95 will be approved in early April. In the United States, where Yuriy Kostenko was invited to visit the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, he met with officials from this agency, the World Bank, the Agency for International Development, the Department of Energy, and the U.S. Congress. The U.S. officials displayed a deep interest in cooperation between Ukraine and the United States in the sphere of ecology, and examined a package of proposals about urgent environmental protection measures, such as the creation of modern laboratories monitoring radiation levels and water quality, recycling of toxic waste, launching educational television programs, and finally establishing an informational and educational center. The American side is planning to allocate $6 million to implement the above projects. This will be an addition to the $500,000 that the World Bank granted the Environmental Ministry last year to carry out a project called "Preservation of Biological Diversity of Carpathians." The American colleagues are ready to continue to share with us their experience and technologies, and want to train our specialists and provide financial assistance.
