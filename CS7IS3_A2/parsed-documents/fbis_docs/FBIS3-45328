"It will be an uphill battle for China to yield a balanced foreign trade, unless the government hits upon extraordinary ideas," said Wang Huaian, an economist with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation. China posted a trade deficit of $12.2 billion last year, the first since 1989. Wang said positive factors to boost the country's exports this year will be undercut by negative ones. Sustained economic growth, exports of more high-value-added goods, and a uniform foreign exchange rate for renminbi yuan, as well as the establishment of more Sino-foreign joint ventures, all help to keep exports buoyant. "But inflation and money shortages are still biting and pushing up export costs," Wang pointed out. Analysts believe an upward price spiral is possible this year, although the government has pledged to stabilize or even lower prices before China's Lunar New Year, which falls early next month. And despite the central government's imposition of a credit-tightening policy last July, Wang said a brisk domestic market will revive and squeeze exports. "The convergence of renminbi foreign exchange rates is a coin of two sides," he said, suggesting that the move could hardly yield a much-needed boost to exports. "This is because most Chinese enterprises, including foreign-funded ones, had already done the bulk of their exports according to the swap market rate, which is close to the current uniform one of $1 to 8.7 yuan," he explained. Similarly, China should not be under the delusion that higher import costs resulting from the unification could sharply reduce imports. A considerable part of China's trade in hard currency had been carried out at the swap market rate before the uniform one took effect on January 1. "In short, the positive effect of the single-rate system, which formally devalues the yuan, has been watered down," Wang said. In the meantime, Wang expects China to maintain high growth this year even though the government has lowered its estimate of expansion to 8 percent to 9 percent, compared with the 13.2 percent of last year. "It would be good enough if China caps the growth rate for 1994 under 10 percent," he said. Even with 10 percent, China's economy will grow more rapidly than most of other nations and regions. Hence the sustained high demand for imports, at least for state key projects designed to improve infrastructure. "As a developing nation, China can hardly cut all these imports and totally rely on its own resources," Wang said. "China will face a tougher economic scenario if it chops imports abruptly." This is especially true as China moves toward rejoining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). "We have to open our markets wider for foreign products after our re-entry into Gatt, which demands free and fair trade," he said.
