FBIS4-64299 "drweu084_p_94003" FBIS-WEU-94-084 Daily Report 30 Apr 1994 GREECE Tirana Decides To Allow Easter Mass Tirana Decides To Allow Easter Mass NC3004172594 Athens Elliniki Radhiofonia Radio Network in Greek 1500 GMT 30 Apr 94 NC3004172594 Athens Elliniki Radhiofonia Radio Network Greek BFN [Text] To allow the Greek and Albanian foreign ministers to meet, the Greek Government has asked the Albanian side to adequately explain why last night it banned the procession for Christ's burial in Tirana and other Greek minority areas. The meeting was canceled at Greece's initiative after the Albanian authorities refused to allow Christians to carry out their religious obligations. Greece also stipulated as a condition for the meeting that the Albanian Government allows resurrection celebrations. Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said today in Thessaloniki that the meeting would be meaningless if Albania does not respect international law, the Greek minority's human rights, and a just state. The spokesman said: The foreign ministers' meeting depends on the Albanian side. Yesterday, we had an aggravation by the Albanian authorities: The banning of the procession for the Orthodox Easter Mass. We will see whether this will remain in effect until tonight. It is a terrible insult to the freedom of religion and human rights. We definitely want Greek-Albanian relations to improve, but this depends on respect for international law. Greek-Albanian relations cannot improve without these conditions and the foreign ministers' meeting would be meaningless. Asked about the government's reaction to criticism of a passive stance to the Albanian provocations, Venizelos said: The Greek Government's stance is one of continuing vigilance and diplomatic demarches. I believe the entire international community respects this stance and has confronted Albania's [words indistinct] campaign in the past two weeks. Commenting on a statement made by Political Spring Chairman Andonios Samaras that this situation would not have happened if a Greek parliamentary delegation had gone to Albania, the spokesman said: I would ask Political Spring and Samaras to consider past responsibility for the situation of the Greek minority in Albania. Albanian President Sali Berisha verbally decided to allow the Mass to be held outdoors in the Greek Orthodox churches in Albania. According to diplomatic circles in Tirana, Berisha's decision was conveyed to Archbishop Anastasios of Tirana and all Albania last night, immediately after the conclusion of Mass at Evangelismos Cathedral. The decision was expected to be submitted in writing within the day. Greek [words indistinct] circles in Albania said they believe Berisha's decision may contribute to improving the atmosphere between Greece and Albania and holding the meeting of the two foreign ministers scheduled for 3 May in Zurich. The Greek Government decided to cancel the meeting of the two ministers after the Albanian Government banned the procession for the Easter Mass. Thousands of Orthodox people in Tirana were informed about the banning when they arrived at the churches. In a resolution to Albanian President Berisha, the Greek Orthodox people asked him to intervene personally and restore the unjustified limitation of their freedom of religion. Churches in Gjirokaster held their Mass normally. They also held a procession for Christ's burial without any interference from the Albanian authorities.
