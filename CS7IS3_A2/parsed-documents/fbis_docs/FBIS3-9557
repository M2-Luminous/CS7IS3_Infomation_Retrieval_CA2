The coalition for the local elections is a first step for an agreement on cooperation in the general elections, Weiss told journalists. The coalition should offer citizens a "clear political alternative" and will receive support from partner parties in Western Europe, Weiss said. The parties of the left coalition are the Social Democratic Party in Slovakia (SDSS), headed by Jaroslav Volf, and the Agricultural Movement (HZ), led by Jozef Klein. The SDL has offered coalition membership also to the newly founded Slovak Entrepreneurs Association (ZPS), which however has decided to enter the elections independently. Polls show the ZPS to be Slovakia's fourth strongest party. With 4.8 percent support among voters it would represent a significant boost to SDL popularity, currently rated at 11 percent.
