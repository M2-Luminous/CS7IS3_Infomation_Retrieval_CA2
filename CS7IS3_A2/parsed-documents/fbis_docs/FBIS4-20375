In the first three quarters of this year, the total export value of foreign-funded enterprises as a percentage of China's total export value has increased to 26.4 percent from 19.8 percent of the same period of the year before. In China's foreign trade area, foreign-funded enterprises now play an increasingly important role, leading to calls for relaxing the current foreign trade policy controls and enlarging the foreign trade policy sphere to include foreign investment activities, particularly in terms of effectively using the mechanism for coordinating the two closely related production models utilizing foreign capital, namely, import substitution and foreign exchange earning exports. I. Theoretical Inquiry Into Coordination of Foreign Investment and Foreign Trade Policies In terms of China's foreign trade objectives and choice of methods in the utilization of foreign capital, we should use as foundation the best macroeconomic approaches for raising capital and handling returns on investment. Generally speaking, in the process of attracting foreign investment, the macroeconomic approaches to capitalization and returns on investment involves the creation and outflow of national income. The main factors which influence this process include: 1) the basic structure and changes in enterprises as a function of the production; 2) determination of the points of competition; 3) the risk of imbalance in foreign exchange receipts and expenditures accounts. We should consider the composite effect of the above-mentioned three main factors in deciding how foreign investment policy should be coordinated within the foreign trade policy area. 1. Foreign investment policy and the objective of an export-oriented foreign trade policy The exports of China's foreign-funded enterprises are geared to markets of developed countries, and some products are even exported directly back to the investors' home countries; because of fierce competition in developed countries and in order to remain reasonably competitive in their marketing environment, foreign investors in China must fully exploit the two major advantages in establishing and operating any enterprises, namely, host country's low costs and investors' own relatively superior managerial standards. In considering the various ways for utilizing foreign capital, direct foreign investment which transfers a series of key components of capital, technology, management and operating procedures, particularly the "surplus" managerial component of multinational companies, can help our enterprises expand their exports and rapidly realize the goal of earning foreign exchange via exports. This year, China's external trade has shown a sharp decline, but exports are booming for the export-oriented foreign-funded enterprises or processing enterprises in which foreign capital plays a leading role, which clearly demonstrates the stable relationship or linkage between direct foreign investment and the scale of exports. On the other hand, indirect foreign investment which uses a resource-matching method and transfers only needed single components can hardly help our enterprises increase their overall competitiveness for exports in terms of their marketing, technology and domestic channels, and can only serve the single function of raising capital, replenishing domestic savings or filling foreign exchange gaps. For foreign investment policy to serve the objective of an export-oriented foreign trade policy, foreign capital should be used in ways which are compatible with foreign exchange earning exports; various foreign investment policy measures should be used to attract and guide foreign investors to correctly utilize production factors of low costs and labor supply which are clearly in China's advantage, and to promote these variables in enterprise production function to achieve maximum effect in terms of production quantity and exports. If China's foreign investment policy seeks to attract foreign capital only on the basis that China offers relatively advantageous conditions, the result will not only prevent China from realizing maximum trade benefits but also easily lead to national income loss and, through theoretical projections of the nonfarm production cycle, to a quagmire in which any long term improvements of trade conditions will be difficult to achieve and China prevented from competing and winning in the evolving system of international division of labor by rationalizing and upgrading our export enterprise structure. Therefore, mindful of China's foreign trade policy goals within the international arena, China's foreign investment policy must vigorously and quickly upgrade the export product structure of foreign-funded enterprises, conclude the third stage of the nonfarm production cycle, encourage foreign investment in the second stage of this cycle and, through enterprises with competitive export advantage, quickly take a commanding lead in the first stage of a new nonfarm production cycle by seizing the rare opportunity early on where the supply-demand price elasticity has not yet escalated, improve the export trading conditions faced by China's foreign-funded enterprises, and through an open economy model vigorously strive to open up abroad new directions in the nonfarm production cycle which match the "win through quality" export strategy now being pursued and implemented by China. Otherwise, in the competitive export production of foreign-funded enterprises, the foreign investors' ability to accumulate and retain earnings will be hamstrung by the current export structure. Furthermore, since China's naturally endowed production advantages are in flux and evolving, and once the labor cost advantage becomes less decisive or even disappears entirely, the simple processing-for-export model of foreign-funded enterprises will face a dim future. At present, many foreign investors already consider China's labor intensive model to be less attractive and therefore are giving up their plans to invest further in China. 2. Foreign investment policy and the objective of an import-substitution foreign trade policy Import substitution involves confining foreign capital utilization and the market it generates to within the host country, even though the host country's economic conditions are backward and the competitive standards set by the foreign-funded enterprises cannot match those in the investors' home countries. Because monopolistic enterprises control the supply-demand curve in making decisions regarding production quantity, they can lead to improper allocation of resources; China's utilization of foreign capital in practice also clearly demonstrates that without adequate competition, the managerial factor brought in by foreign investors is minimally utilized in the host country. A typical factual example which provides a basis for observation and judgment is the fact that China, through joint domestic and foreign funding, has established several automobile production lines, but their scale of production is considerably below not only that in the investors' home country but also the competitive standard recognized internationally. Aside from the joint funding of research and development costs and their separate usage, it hardly reflects the quality of an effective economic model. It can conclusively be stated that in the early stages of China's import substitution policy, the growth of foreign-funded enterprises in this area was mainly due to increased inputs of single component of labor or capital, and productivity based on a composite of important managerial and economic factors was still very low. In many localities, the so-called foreign investment was in reality investment of personal savings, not corporate investment, to say nothing of investment of the surplus managerial factor. Because China as host country has a vast potential market, unless the foreign investment was clearly irrational, any foreign investment in short-term joint venture projects invariably involved no risk at all. To prevent any long-term imbalance in international balance of payments, foreign investors should not be allowed to earn an excessively high rate of investment return; at the same time, because of relatively low competitive level of enterprises in the import substitution area, and the fact that re-establishing these enterprises is uneconomical, the managerial factor introduced by multinational companies is only partly effective and the economy of scale only partially realized. Therefore, in attracting foreign capital to the import substitution area, China's reliance on investment in single, separate production in effect is using indirect foreign investment to fill the technological gaps created by the process of upgrading China's enterprise structure. In the 1980s, China initially approved bringing in some 2,000 technology projects which vigorously supported the development of China's electronic industry, basically satisfied the consumption demands of our domestic market and enabled our enterprises to begin developing the ability to penetrate the world market. In calling for more indirect investment in the import substitution area or for using foreign capital in stages, it does not mean that foreign- funded enterprises are excluded. In this regard, we should take note of two kinds of situations: First, promoting basic reform in state-owned enterprises by bringing in new management factors through direct foreign investment is essentially going outside of the reform sphere and does not relate to any foreign trade and investment policies; second, to develop technologically advanced enterprises which will maintain a leading edge for a relatively long period of time, we should allow direct foreign investment in those domestic enterprises which have developed the basic competitive capacity, especially those producing high-grade capital goods in the import substitution area. II. Contradiction in Carrying Out Coordination of Foreign Trade and Foreign Investment Policies and Possible Remedies The boom of foreign investments in China has revealed numerous contradictions between China's foreign trade and foreign investment policies, and maintaining appropriate coordination of the two policy goals is an urgent task if continued healthy development of foreign- funded enterprises is to be assured. 1. Based on foreign trade objectives, implement structural adjustment and quantitative control in foreign capital utilization In terms of China's current utilization of foreign capital, aside from controlling indirect foreign investment by monitoring debt repayments and rates of interest payment, which reflect the extent to which exports are being restrained by foreign debt regulations making the latter serve the implementation of foreign trade policy objectives, the types of structural adjustment in foreign investment utilization and the scope of direct foreign investment are still not well coordinated within the foreign trade policy area. Last year, direct foreign investment in China for the first time exceeded China's borrowing from abroad. But what is a cause of concern is that, lacking any clear-cut foreign trade policy guidance, the percentage of foreign-funded enterprises oriented toward exports and their rate of exports are both very low. Among jointly-funded enterprises, these two indices have long been kept at around 20 percent; the fact that only 5-8 percent of the high-tech enterprises produce foreign exchange earning exports or products which can reasonably be used for import substitution and the above-mentioned percentage indicate that a total of 70-80 percent of such enterprises utilize only run-of-the-mill technology and produce for domestic sales and consumption; even in Shanghai which sets the national standard in this area, the sum of the two indices this year is only 53 percent. As a result, the foreign exchange transactions of foreign-funded enterprises have exerted a negative effect on China's international balance of payment, and reduced the efficacy of using foreign trade policy to encourage exports. Therefore, we should clearly spell out our foreign trade policy objectives on import substitution and foreign exchange earning exports, and positively encourage direct foreign investment in the foreign exchange earning exports area; in the import substitution area, we should attract direct foreign investment to those high-tech enterprises whose products can clearly substitute for imports of technology and can also effectively be used to disseminate the technology to all domestic enterprises through their internal structural changes. In the broad import substitution area, however, we should as appropriate attract indirect foreign investment to activities which bear on import substitution, and promote multifaceted indirect investment by taking advantage of opportunities made possible by the current trend of increased credit use in international capital transactions. We should, therefore, develop a major structure in which more and more indirect foreign investment will be drawn to the import substitution area, and more and more direct foreign investment to the foreign exchange earning exports area. 2. Using foreign trade policy measures, sweep away restrictions on foreign capital transactions in the import substitution and foreign exchange earning exports areas Using different foreign trade policy objectives to determine methods of foreign capital utilization, because of numerous factors, would result in superficial implementation. In reality, China has already extended numerous preferential treatments to foreign-funded enterprises, with China herself enduring the pain of reducing prices to the lowest possible point (such as land prices) to encourage foreign investors to establish high-tech and exports producing enterprises. Despite the restriction on the enterprise financial budget, the government has allowed foreign-funded enterprises to maintain foreign exchange receipts and expenditures accounts and use various channels including the foreign exchange swap centers to remit foreign exchange earnings and consolidate compensations for purchasing domestic products for exports. The restrictions on enterprise foreign exchange budgets are clearly being relaxed, which in the longer term will lead to exports falling below the contractually specified export ratios. In the past, we have relied on the enterprises themselves to find their own ways to maintain foreign exchange equilibrium, and we have successfully encouraged foreign-funded enterprises, particularly the sole-source investment enterprises, to maintain a rather high export ratio in direct contrast with other developing countries' experiences with sole- source foreign investments. Because of this, we should use our foreign trade policy objectives to lead and guide investment decisions on production quantity made by foreign-funded enterprises. First, we should change the policy of granting preferential treatments based on locality, enterprise and even the type of enterprise to a policy based on end-results and, guided by our foreign trade policy objectives, extend preferential treatments to high-tech enterprises and the foreign exchange earning exports area. At present, an important adjustment in our foreign investment policy is to change the focus from locality to enterprise in foreign capital utilization, but in practice implementation is still held up by the static protocol of policy. In this respect, we have overlooked one basic fact, namely the opportunities for promoting economic growth and developing export potentials exist not only in certain localities or enterprises, but in various types of enterprises in the broad context of the economy. An end-result oriented policy should give equal rewards and encouragements to all localities, departments and enterprises operating within the scope of this policy so that they will strive for incremental gains consistent with the policy's macroeconomic intent. In giving preferential treatments to foreign investment based on an end-result oriented foreign trade policy, we should continue to incrementally reward any transactions which promote foreign exchange earning exports or which increase the technological content of import substitution enterprises. In using this concept to guide the reform of China's foreign capital taxation system, we should request that all localities or departments change from giving preferential treatment on income taxes and adopt a new system of reducing or rebating indirect taxes and customs duties in the export-import cycle in conformance with customary international practices to arrive at an indirect tax rate which effectively encourages exports. In the past, we have made a priori determinations of the export ratio for exporting enterprises and the technological standard for import substitution enterprises, and these in different degrees reflected the directions of our foreign trade policy, but this system was ultimately based on an objective of encouraging particular enterprises rather than an objective of giving even-handed encouragement to increasing the quantitative flow of foreign trade. This demonstrates that our foreign trade policy was incomplete and lacking in thoroughness. For example, in 1988 among China's foreign-funded enterprises, the proportion of export-oriented enterprises and their export ratio were almost identical, at 20.92 percent and 20.75 percent respectively. This means that non-exporting enterprises were not given any preferential treatments such as the reducing or waiving of income taxes enjoyed by export-producing enterprises, and they could not achieve the goal of maximizing the export potentials of foreign-funded enterprises. Second, change the past policy of keeping trading activities of foreign-funded enterprises separate and apart from those of domestic enterprises, and implement the foreign trade policy goal of encouraging and assisting foreign investors to develop strategic export enterprises which enjoy competitive advantage internationally. An important external factor in the mushrooming growth of foreign-funded enterprises in China is traceable to the pressures of currency devaluation and rising costs in developed countries and newly industrialized Asian countries that force enterprises there which have lost their production advantages to relocate abroad. Whether China can seize this historic opportunity and carry out its externally oriented economic development policy, not only in terms of the extent to which foreign investors are attracted to use China's labor resource advantage to lower their production costs, but more importantly to see, with foreign investment in labor-intensive enterprises and their exports replacing exports of resource-intensive enterprises, whether foreign investment can quickly enter into the stage of developing competitive strategic exports, and whether products of foreign-funded enterprises produced with benefits of all the advantageous factors will make a good start in a new cycle unhampered by low-grade products which will avoid pitfalls in the nonfarm production cycle. Last year, the export ratio of China's foreign-funded enterprises rose to 20.5 percent, much higher than their industrial production value of 8.5 percent, and judging by their export ratio and their share of the total production value in terms of international competitiveness, China's foreign-funded enterprises scored 41.46 percent on a comparative index of international competitiveness, which is better than even the highest standard reached in the 1980s by the Republic of Korea. What is astonishing to us is that examining the competitiveness index in terms of imports, the 1992 index is a negative value of minus 20.64 percent, and even after eliminating foreign investment in import facilities, the index still shows a negative number. Going one step further in the analysis, because we treat foreign investment in our enterprises as an independent externally oriented activity, and strictly insist that these enterprises maintain balanced foreign exchange accounts, this has forced foreign investors to resort to utilizing the processing-for-export production method on a large scale, resulting in a 1992 ratio of as high as 88.8 percent. Since China relies on the low labor cost advantage in its exports, this production method which adds minimal value and requires only a limited processing cycle makes it difficult for China to attract foreign investment and to gain maximum export benefits. Therefore, we should follow a strategic foreign trade policy and attract or match up foreign investors through a series of developmental steps to establish export processing areas, export production bases, special plants and factories, and bring foreign-funded enterprises on to the track of developing China's strategic foreign trade. 3. Correct the operations of foreign-funded enterprises in accordance with foreign trade policy objectives First, controlling transfer pricing control. China's foreign-funded enterprise rely on transfer pricing which leads to shocking and painful foreign exchange losses and national income outflows. Transfer pricing in essence is the result of market internal operations, and eliminating transfer pricing will have a negative effect on the host country; we need to externalize our domestic market and let enterprises follow the principle of basing transfer pricing on market price and not on cost of capital in production. Therefore, through a system of open competitive bidding (and foreign partners in any enterprise may be given limited preferential treatment and priority in bidding) and pricing based on customs estimates which approximate open market pricing to promote enterprises in the import cycle, we can help strengthen the supply- demand pricing elasticity of open market and control the tendency of quoting high prices for imports and holding down prices for exports. In this way, the customs authorities using their own information network can supervise and control any unreasonable export transfer prices quoted by foreign-funded enterprises by comparing these prices with those of China's specialized companies and industrial-commercial firms; in the import cycle, a system of open competitive bidding can in varying degrees spell out the open market conditions, control foreign businesses from cutting into the capital base and profits of jointly- funded enterprises through reckless tactics of investment in infrastructure facilities, and help establish a strategic, alliance type of cooperative enterprises to gain sale outlets and channels and speed up product developments. As for the structural advantages of multinational companies or allied enterprises in lowering their transactional costs in the domestic markets, these would not be diminished as a result. This is because that permission given to any reasonable internal transfer pricing is limited to enterprises determined by research as having difficulties to adopt to market conditions or to enterprises which nevertheless incur relatively high trading costs after searching for reasonable pricing in an open market; these technical factors affecting transfer pricing also apply to any new or original products or projects, i.e. even though open market exposure will not lead to unnecessary increase in transaction costs, but precisely because of filtering and screening by the open market, they are found to be worthy of support because they are well suited to trading in the domestic market. In this way, the supervision and control of transfer pricing will play an important role in terms of our foreign trade policy objectives. Second, estimating the scale of exports. Foreign capital utilized in foreign-funded enterprises and exports processing enterprises is an effective way to make reasonable use of the domestic market, lower transaction costs and search for the most advantageous structure among the wide range of international productive enterprises. Nevertheless, it is difficult to prevent or control foreign-funded enterprises' exports and their subsequent re-exports from being included in other countries' foreign trade accounts and estimates within the scope of international trading activities. We should consult the practices in other countries -- particularly regarding regulations governing the country of origin for imports, the percentage of added value, the percentage of native resources used, and what proofs of place of production are required for different products of the exporting countries -- and accordingly add the exports to the quota of concerned countries trading with China, and thereby bring foreign-funded enterprises and export processing enterprises within the scope and control of China's foreign trade policy.
