Dr. Herbst was reacting to a report in the WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN in which it was alleged that General Meiring had asked Mr. Modise to request and interdict against the newspaper. General Meiring apparently warned Mr. Modise that the government could be harmed if the names of spies in the ANC were revealed. The newspaper says it has forced the army to confirm the names of 47 former and current employees of the Directorate of Covert Intelligence.
