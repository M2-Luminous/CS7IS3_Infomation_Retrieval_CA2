The mammoth task involves welding departments of now-defunct tricameral administrations, homelands, self-governing territories and provincial administrations into new central and provincial departments. Each department will be handled by a three-member team, which will be empowered to redeploy staff. One tough challenge will be to rationalise into single entities those departments where functions were duplicated in the apartheid era -- and then choose a head. ANC MP Salie Manie, long involved in think-tanks on restructuring the civil service, disclosed details of the plan. The teams will work along guidelines meant to ensure democratisation and deracialisation of the civil service, while ending inefficiency and an "autocratic" approach. Among the reforms proposed by the ANC think-tank is the introduction of a performance appraisal system "to avoid the civil service being a retirement village". A key goal of the plan will be the implementation of an affirmative action policy. Implementation of the plan will have to begin in the wake of tension among civil servants elsewhere in the country, especially in former homelands. While restructuring will be far-reaching, a key goal in the process will be to ensure continuity. Decisions on redeployment of staff, and even whether early retirement should be allowed in some cases, would depend on implications for service delivery and budgetary impact. Manie said pre-election promises that civil servants would not lose jobs or be prejudiced by change would be honoured. There are more than a million public servants.
