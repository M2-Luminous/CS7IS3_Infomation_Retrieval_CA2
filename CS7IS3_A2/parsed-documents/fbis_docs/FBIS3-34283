These designs aim to prepare for wide-scale military operations under the pretext of defending Zionist security, which is being threatened by the continuing resistance operations. Needless to say, the Zionist enemy has not and will not give up its expansionist designs and aggressive policy. The Zionist officials' talk about peace is only an overt maneuver to conceal the terrorist plans being carried out against the south, the Western al-Biqa', and the occupied Palestinian land. The Zionist enemy leaders are searching for excuses to escalate the situation and drive matters toward the brink of war. The Zionist leaders believe that the threats could twist the arm of the mujahidin and those resisting the policy of aggression. They also think that their threats could prompt the international community to make efforts to pacify the situation by taking into consideration the Zionist security concerns. However, we believe that this Zionist method has been exposed and that the enemy should never talk about security concerns as long as it continues its occupation and attacks. Occupation cannot provide the enemy with security. This is possibly what the enemy wants so that the occupation might become a fait accompli recognized, even implicitly, through the destruction of the resistance role. Resistance is a continuous embodiment of our people's rejection of this occupation and its results, like the fait accompli and the arrangements, which are indeed a recognition of this occupation. Hence, we call on everyone, particularly those who hope that peace is imminent, not to wager on the enemy's claims and designs. We also call on them to be more truthful with their people and citizens. We tell them that before talking about Lebanon's readiness to join the peace, if it ever happens, they should talk about full preparations to confront the possibilities of a new war that might be launched by the Zionist enemy so that no one will be surprised. We ask about the preparations for confrontation and steadfastness. What has the Lebanese Government done on this serious task? Where has the talk about the support for the south and southerners gone? Does the way to prosperity in Lebanon come through the purchase of shares in Solidaire or through steadfastness in the south and the confrontation of the continuous threats against the people, land, and waters? Prosperity can only come through strong faith and full readiness to offer sacrifices for the sake of regaining every iota of cherished soil that is being occupied by the Zionists.
