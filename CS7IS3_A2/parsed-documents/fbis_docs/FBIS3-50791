According to the newspapers, in the interview Justice Minister Correa reportedly said that between October and November of last year a group of civilians and soldiers reportedly urged President Itamar Franco to carry out a coup similar to the one carried out by Alberto Fujimori in Peru, and to impose strong measures against Congress and the Judicial Branch. According to presidential adviser Fernando Costa, President Franco said: First, he did not attend the meeting. Second, the justice minister informed the president early this morning that he never talked about a coup during the interview. And last, the interview with the justice minister is the justice minister's responsibility. Justice Minister Mauricio Correa said today that he did not talk about a coup during the interview with Manchete Television Network. Correa explained that he talked about the government's projects, and reporter Carlos Chagas asked during the interview if there was an environment of tension in the country at any time that could obstruct the constitutional order. The minister said that between October and November of last year the country was experiencing a period of extreme concern due to low salaries, a high inflation rate, and the impasse in the Federal Supreme Court over the decision on former President Fernando Collor's political future. In addition to that, said the minister, the people saw images of the corruption in the country everyday. Mauricio Correa said that as justice minister he gave an interpretation in the interview of what he felt, but that at no time did he say President Itamar Franco was under pressure: [Begin recording] In case you saw the interview, I never talked about a coup that was being hatched inside the government. I only gave an interpretation of what I felt as minister; that was my duty. [end recording] Minister Correa also said that if he is summoned, he will go to Congress to repeat what he said in the Manchete Television Network interview. Correa added that the country is going through a time when things should not be hidden, that this can even serve as therapy for the future.
