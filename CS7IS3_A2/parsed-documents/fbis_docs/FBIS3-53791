Arabs, led by the Iraqis, have, since the formation of the first human civilization on earth, looked at the universe and creation as a whole. They have examined both comprehensively and have discharged their task with responsibility and honor. If Arabs are preoccupied with any part the universe or creation, it is in the interest of a more comprehensive outlook and responsibility. Arabs have never separated life and their outlook on creation and the universe from any of their fundamental rules. They never became obsessed with the part at the expense of the whole. In none of their awakenings have they relied on the material to the exclusion of the spirit. Indeed, Arabs have never achieved any state of awakening based on the material laws of life. Whenever any of the Arabs swung to the material side, that period was labeled an age of degradation or intellectual backwardness. In any case, this has never been a characteristic in which Arabs have taken pride. They have never taken such a state of affairs as their ideal or set it as an example. Nor did they call on others to follow that route. From this perspective and stand, Arabs played the role they set for themselves or the role chosen for them by God. Every elevation of the intellect and duty of principle was inspired by a universal outlook in which there was a balance between the spiritual and the material, with the spiritual indeed taking precedence over the material. The legitimacy and intrinsic value of all material things is reinforced by the degree to which it is tempered with spiritualism. On such foundations of the spirit and thought was built the historical, psychological, and ideological edifice and our perspective on things. With the help of the God of heaven and earth, and his wise choice, Arabs were chosen as messengers of humanity to humanity and their land the cradle of prophets, bolstering the role of the Arab nation as the gateway for the world's first civilization. When idelogy, values, and attitudes are shaped by this concept of spirit as an attitude and civilization as an entity, and when people on this blessed earth play their role according to what crystallizes in their thoughts and accumulates in their consciences then, the people of this earth will be the first to understand the relationship between what is material and what is spiritual. They will also understand the balance between this relationship and the priority given to spiritual elements in the course of life. It is necessary to understand the detrimental effect of material objects on life when they get the upper hand. We must always be extremely aware of the essential difference between those who drown in spirit and those who drown in other considerations throughout history. Those who drown in the latter will appear dry or possibly hollow and will repeat the past. Consequently, they will be tossed about by the wind and the laws of life, like a dry bush that cannot resist the winds or extend its roots deep into the earth to grow and reach the pure air and the useful sun. Everyone should realize the difference between the world of considerations and spirit, from which man can proceed to establish a civilization in which the laws of life prosper, in which man corrects himself, and in which the laws of the period develop in the areas of culture, industry, agriculture, art, and science in light of justice, fairness, and what satisfies God and the people; and the mere adoption of what has been done by others without playing any role in the development of what has been intrusted to man to establish his civilization by absorbing the accepted laws of his age and interacting with what requires interaction, and creating what should be created. All this comes after seeking to win the satisfaction of Almighty God, to achieve man's happiness, and not to deprive him of the foundation of his personality in terms of position, decision, thought, and behavior in light of his history and heritage in the deepest and most comprehensive way. He should also create the values of the society of that age and not imitate what contradicts the pan-Arab and national characteristics, but imitate that society which has a memorable, influential role in human life. While this society affects other nations, it will keep an open mind to the experiences of those nations with which it interacts. The actions of this society will be based on its past intellectual, cultural, and historical bases and its present ideology and creativity. Breaking away from what is spiritual and moving toward what is material on the pretext that this is the law of this age will also lead to one's drowning in what is material. Instead of being the pillar used by spiritual laws as an influencial means befitting its time to flourish under suitable civilized circumstances when possible, according to the laws of this age, and to balance life and help straighten it up on the basis of spiritual laws, this trend will lead to to one's drowning in materialism if it is used as an absolute basis in thought and action. For it will then becomes an end rather than a means which, if used properly, will make life and the spirit progress, and will realize man's happiness through self-satisfaction that is immersed in faith and through the others' perception of how to tackle the basics of the laws of life and man's relationship with his fellow man. It has been historically proven that Arabs have been the pioneers in the realm of the spirit, that the realm of the spirit has chosen Arabs to introduce itself to the world, and that Arabs were the ones who introduced the world to the realm of the spirit. They constituted the first human civilization which shows that they were the first to create the basics of what elevates life to a level that distinguishes man. The edge Arabs enjoyed over others in their approach to the realm of the spirit becomes evident in their ability to put things within their proper perspective, be it when they tackle the material world, or through their approach and evaluation of what is or os not ethical, what is or is not just, particularly when it concerns their present and future, as well as their past and all the other human affairs. To clarify things, we say: Can the United States, or India, for example, be taken as a standard of measure in the modern world for what is advanced or not, or of what is more advanced? Why is it that the United State, Japan, France, or Britain continue to be viewed as the basic standards of measure by all those who had an edge in production and invention in the field of technology in a general manner, and on the basis of the general criteria of a phase such as the one we have mentioned? We are certain that the basis for this is that they were pioneers in the field of invention which gave them an edge in the field of production. Even on the basis of this incomplete example from life, those who contemplate life and mankind in accordance with a sound concept would realize and understand the pioneering role Arabs have played for themselves and others. Invention, usage of an invention, and accumulated experiences, are considered a criteria by which others will judge any stage. Such a stage may be long or short. Why aren't Arabs, including Iraqis, entitled to clearly view things in terms of their sources which have a pure spirit, civilization, ideology, and everything else that measures what is spiritual and what is materialistic, favoring what is spiritual over what materialistic whenever it conflicts with and obstructs the prosperity of what is spiritual? This clearly shows that one who controls the movement in the materialistic world is not suitable as an example, or as a model, or as a judge of others unless he balances his approach and behavior according to what is spiritual, just, and fair, and respects the considerations of other nations, and unless he recalls the requirements of a fair position and not ambitions or egomania. From these concepts, and from an understanding of divine wisdom we can see that mankind has not singled out any prophet, messenger, heavenly or unheavenly religion. Therefore, in Amman, in February 1990 we had to face those who called both covertly and overtly for surrendering to the U.S. unilateral political control of the world, after the collapse of the Soviet Union. We wondered whether the United States would act in a responsible and wise manner toward the world, or whether it would fall into the abyss of rashness. Thus, it would not control the world, but would fall from the peak after losing much of its means to perpetuate its brute force. Today, this is the world of which we are a part, and you are also part of it. With a simple look, anyone will see a blazing world in which the most sacred of sanctities are violated, and also the highest values of peoples and nations, states, and international relations are violated. Moreover, he will see blood flowing like rivers, and injustice climbing up to the world of evil so that it is almost drowned in it, and hunger overwhelming a great portion of world peoples. He will also see that the United States, which is practicing hegemony from its apex, has quickly found itself--thanks to the desire for domination and its accompanying mistakes and also due to others' resistance--displaced from the apex of the material world and the world of domination and unilateral control which it wished for in the new world order. The United States has even begun to decline, even according to the standards of supremacy over others in the United States' own world. Every reasonable and mature person has realized that the world order called for by the former president of the United States is a call to realize an unruly imperialist wish to give the United States control over the gates of a big prison for the entire world. This order was not meant to uphold justice and fairness, nor to cherish the peoples' sovereignty, independence, peculiarities, values, spiritual legacy, and right to choose their own way of life. The United States has been removed from the zenith. There are no longer any peaks for the United States to climb. Material peaks cannot be called peaks that promote humanity. However, the United States might soon start to climb the mountain to either reach the highest material capability in terms of influencing the course of events, if it rids itself of the complex of hubris and the temptation of immersion in material standards of measurement, which we do not think to be most likely, or to fall into the final abyss that stands below it, which we believe to be most likely, based on what we know of today's world and its deep-rooted history. Well-known factors, some of which are similar to what we currently criticize in U.S. policy, caused France and Britain to climb down to the foot of the mountain in the aftermath of World War II, leaving the peak to the United States and the former Soviet Union. When the United States climbs down from the peak to the foot of the mountain, it will not remain on the foot of the mountain. Most likely, it will continue its move downward. And because the material world is not amenable to absolutism, no one has any guarantees of survival on the peak indefinitely, by any standards, particularly since the United States did not reach the peak by incremental and firm steps, nor by fair entitlement. It reached the peak when a vacuum presented itself. Hence, it seized the opportunity to fill this vacuum. Given the terms we have used in our characterization of the United States, Zionism, their ambitions, the nature of their alliance, as well its objectives; Given the fact that all this conflicts with the terms we have used to characterize Iraq and the Arab nation, regarding the disparity in goals, character, positions, and the nature of the faith embraced by our nation and its eternal message throughout all ages; In view of United States' efforts to dominate the world militarily, politically, and economically; In view of Zionism's efforts to exploit the world, in cooperation with the United States at present, and, at other times, with other powers, in pursuit of the policy of the convergence of interests and proportionateness of capabilities to realize joint ambitions, contradiction reached the point of clashes after the United States found, or, as a matter of fact, deluded itself into believing that the time was right to crush the epitome of values the Arabs see as an example to be emulated in terms of national and pan-Arab dignity, faith, integrity, and development. Consequently, the conspiracy was unleashed. After many had given up the duty of rejecting what ought to be rejected and of accepting what is right and appropriate for peoples' interests and states' sovereignty, the United States, Zionism, and those who went into temporary alliances with them under certain circumstances, miscalculating the seriousness of such alliances, were encouraged to be dragged to an ill-omened aggression against the Iraq of the Mother of Battles. Brothers, international relations cannot be rectified and stability cannot be achieved through certain parties' desire for hegemony and control. For, control destroys international relations and destroys the party that wishes to control. This has always been the outcome of every attempt in this regard by all those who established and created leadership on the basis of the world of belongings and things and their standards, and on the basis of strength. The international community now needs the wisdom of the group and collective leadership. Everyone, especially those who are known to have the balance in their favor in the material world, should remember that the capability and wisdom that satisfy God are not exclusively possessed by the big countries or the big powers. Perhaps wisdom is the last thing they consider. It does not become part of their lives until there appear powers that are bigger and more evil and aggressive than they are. Such new powers may even appear in their own world, the world they have opted for and through which they chose to be different from others--the world of material belongings. In fact, history teaches us that power has not been a constant asset for big states or big populations. Power does not indefinitely settle with large armies or states. History can help us recall further examples that tell us that fatal strikes against the largest armies and states have not been made by equal or superior powers, in accordance with traditional yardsticks of the meaning of power. Rather, such strikes have been made by powers that possess new yardsticks of power. A view of the results of what had been originally sought to be achieved in accordance with the plans and hopes of the states of aggression against Iraq, and against Somalia later on, will help provide a sound vision and clear piece of evidence about a major event which had a profound and comprehensive meaning and results. On the eve of the 30-state aggression against Iraq, there were in Iraq targets that suit the capability of the advanced Western military technology. There were large hospitals for children and women, and others for the entire people. There were sophisticated plants, large buildings, water and electricity facilities, oil refining installations, everything that is related to oil products, and historical sites. Among the targets were even residential buildings that loftily tell of a prosperous age. For the means of destruction, all those constituted visual targets by firing from a distance. The aggressors thought that these targets -- as well as civic and military airports, mosques, churches, academic and cultural centers, and even radar sites, which attract a familiar type of their weapons and guide them to their targets -- are suitable targets according to the standards of an appropriate target. A target is deemed appropriate in line with the technical considerations of their weapons, which are computer-fed. The aggressors thought that the very fact that Iraq has such targets, which are appropriate for their weapons which they fire from a distance -- and the fact that each of these targets is, of material value, equal or superior to the material value of the shell they fire at it -- they thought this was enough to make Iraq bow down to their will. They sought to impose this evil will on Iraq and terrorize the world through Iraq. However, when the confrontation took place and consisted, on their part, of firing from a distance, and considering that the brunt of it came from the air -- it was the heaviest known in the history of aggression and war -- the harvest was in line with what Almighty God had decreed. Certainly, the results were contrary to their frustrated wishes and contrary to computer calculations, which were fed by the will of evil minds which have never entertained good thoughts. Preparations for the aggression against Iraq lasted more than six months, before the frustrated people dared to attack beautiful Baghdad two and a half hours after midnight on 16 January and early in the morning on 17 January 1991. This period gave them a chance to collect much information about Iraq. Thus, the politicians and military found out a basic part of the information they were interested in, in terms of Iraq's size, population, the nature of its resources, its development, and even more private information in geopolitics and military and economic affairs. They found out, among other things, that Iraq, regardless of everything, has a small population, small size, and is a Third World nation according to the standards of technological and economic development. Those concerned also knew, through the information disseminated by the West about Iraq's capabilities and weapons -- portraying Iraq's capabilities in legendary terms as very destructive -- that the weapons they had amassed would be enough not only to achieve the declared and undeclared objectives which the villains made public or hid in their malicious, senile minds, but also enough to change the face of the earth and mankind. This is what military officials and politicians used to say about the effect of their weapons once they would be used against Iraq. These included the U.S. secretary of state, who contributed to the aggression decision. Some of their political and military officials made statements to the same effect, not to mention the false and deceptive news blared out by their media. When they ceased fire upon the orders of the U.S. President, his allies or the greater part of them learned of the cease-fire decision from his famous speech in which he announced a unilateral cease-fire. The decision was made after they had collided with the Republican Guards southwest of al-Basrah and after facing watchful resistance whenever they came in contact with the army and people of great Iraq and with the roaring magnanimous thunder of our air and defense forces, the missile forces, the army helicopter gunship cavaliers, and all the troops and corps of our great army and valiant Armed forces. Despite the concentration of aircraft of all types and purposes, which covered the skies of the battle against the Republican Guards, the failed aggressors realized they would enter a new stage as a result of that resistance and would face consequences for which they had not made plans, therefore, the U.S. President announced the unconditional cease-fire, except for actions to protect their armies in case they were exposed to Iraqi fire. The dust of the first chapter of the conflict with the regular armies settled down, but the aggression continued afterward in the form of air attacks on the Republican Guards in a treacherous breach of the cease-fire--a breach which is usually noted in the history of the invaders. The aggressors then stirred their Iran--sponsored chapter of aggression, which was not less evil or barbaric than their regular aggression against Iraq, but was in some ways tougher. This was followed by two more aggressions on 13 and 17 January 1993 and 26 June 1993, a series of occasional attacks on our air defenses, aircraft, and other targets were carried out between and after the two aggressions. Briefly, the world of regimes and rulers in general, with few known exceptions, was divided into either keen participants or indifferent observers. However, after all that has happened, including the chapter of the severe and continued blockade, those regimes are now standing astonished, finding no sufficient explanation in their minds for the Iraqi people's great and legendary steadfastness. These people and the valiant army of the Mother of Battles are rightfully worthy of this great and honorable record. Thus, with the help of God, the militant Iraqis have managed to bring closer to the minds of those who went astray or temporarily deviated from the path of guidance and faith the extent of God's capability. The militant Iraqis have placed the entire world at the beginning of the road which will lead it to overcoming the complex of fear that the U.S. unilateral leadership of the material world has implanted in its soul. This fear has been so great that they dropped their weapons, or rather the weapons of infidelity, the moment this dreadful name was ever mentioned. The first wound that pained the soul and body of dear Baghdad with the first bomb that hit its land or any target in it on 17 January 1991 was the actual beginning of the weakness that has crept into limbs of those bragging about their strength and looking down on others. With the first bomb that hit Baghdad, pain and illness afflicted the bodies and souls of the treacherous tyrants of the 20th Century and their followers who disregard others, only to be disregarded by God and their own and other peoples. Thus, in the name of God, the souls of many states and peoples were healed. Afterward, there came a supporting experience which revealed the traits of the free peoples. In view of the subsequent effects of the atmosphere of the immortal Mother of Battles that we have already described, and in view of the results that it had produced, the tyrants belittled the will of peoples and ignored the will of God. Nay, they ignored all that would remind them of wisdom. As ever, they discredit the poor and enslave human beings. The people of Somalia were starving. Hunger, disease, and lack of clothing were apparent. They had only God to shelter them. They had no targets which are appropriate for the weapons and shells that are fired from a distance, some from thousands of kilometers. Not a single house in Somalia was equal in material value to their guided missiles. Also, the Somalis do not have many public facilities that prompt one to destroy them. Because the pockets of the treacherous -- who gave the aggressors the price for the shells with which they struck Iraqi cities and other targets and Baghdad, the city which preserved the values of the civilization of the Arabs and the heritage of humanity which believed in God -- were emptied and could no longer support or finance a destructive aggression for a long period with expensive weapons, the devil thought once again of trying its luck in Somalia. The penetration of the skin and flesh of Somali children and women, and even men, requires only light hardware to be fired at a starving people who were exhausted by hunger and thrown away on sidewalks. Bearing this description in mind, they thought that they could horribly insult not only to the people of Somalia but also to all nations of the world. Perhaps foremost among the people they had in mind to once again try to influence were the people of Iraq. This is why they once again belittled other nations. And God humiliated and disgraced them again and glorified the people of Somalia, who are starving and without clothes, save the clothes of dignity. The villains thought that a people whom they think are powerless and who do not have an army like that of Iraq would quickly bargain over their leaders. Perhaps, they thought that the Somali people would save them the trouble of using their bullets of death and that some of them would quickly assassinate their resistance leaders. Damn their ideas, which will only lead them to further miscalculations and will throw them out of the realm of honor and respect. Having been exhausted by their sick ideas, and after their plans fail to achieve their malicious goals, the Americans left a country which is not for them. What is worse still in describing the level of their moral deterioration is that America, which unfairly and aggressively advocated certain ideas in Somalia and mobilized others for this purpose, was not content, in its moral deterioration, by involving its allies. Its deterioration exceeded all possible limits and previous actions when it withdrew its troops and asked others publicly to remain in Somalia. It is strange for some Third World nations to accept this, while some of them say their regimes represent Islamic states. Do they not ask themselves about the legitimacy of staying in Somalia in the form of occupation of aggression, or in a manner that conflicts with the will of the Somali people? Do they think that the will of a people that rejects the presence of an occupying foreigner on its territory indicates that such a people are in need of foreign protection? Brothers and friends the world over and in our greater Arab nation: This is an important aspect of the meanings of the suffering, bloodshed, and the record of jihad and struggle of the great Iraqi people in the Mother of Battles. Those who take a profound look at these meanings can reach conclusions which please and satisfy a suffering humanity, telling it that the beginning to the road of human guidance, after a long period of forgetting its meanings, has appeared. Also, the beginning of the road to deterioration and collapse of the tyrant has also appeared. The experience acquires greater richness, becomes a catalyst for forward movement, and gains greater significance when we recall the role of our Palestinian Arab people, who dwell in our hearts and consciences, as well as each and every act of resistance and steadfastness throughout the world. The Palestinian people have taught all mankind that the weapons of resistance can be found on the ground as well as in hearts, consciences, and faithful minds. Wherever there is soil, there are weapons -- namely stones. Whoever loses control of his territory is bound to get it back. He is bound to find stones on it to use in resisting tyrants, the occupiers of the territory and the usurpers of its history and orchards, who have been humiliating all Arabs and Muslims. We salute the struggle of the Palestinian people, the stone- throwing people, the people who have an abundance of inexpensive weapons, and who are using them in resisting tyrants. These weapons are of great significance. Compared to arms depots all over the world, stones are sacred. We salute the Somali people, and all peoples who have chosen to resist the evil will, to confront falsehood with right, to uphold the rights of the poor by the vindication of right, and to resist their exploitation by those who seek to rob them of their dignity, resources, and freedom. O brothers and friends: Given what we are speaking of on this occasion; the other things that took place in the eternal Mother of Battles; the great faith-inspired resistance and gracious patience demonstrated by the great Iraqi people; and the examples they have set for mankind in general, and Third World nations in particular; you can now provide a better answer to the question posed by some regarding the objective the allies sought by attacking the Iraqi people, while ignoring others, in their savage aggression of 17 January 1991. In the same vein, you can also provide a better answer as to why their demons have failed to enable them to undermine the spirit of Iraq, and why their evil exasperation has been aggravated further, prompting them to engage in successive acts of ceaseless aggression, including the aggression they are mounting on our airspace and soil in northern Iraq, the aggression they are mounting on our airspace in southern Iraq, as well as their continued control of persons whose records are disgraceful and whose minds are evil, not to mention the unfair embargo they are maintaining against us. This has been the fate of their acts despite the blows they have dealt to Iraq. The answer, brothers, lies in all that we have said, and also in the example set by the Iraqi people in terms of the significance of their resistance to tyrants, and also in terms of the significance of the indispensable gracious patience they have demonstrated so that they may mark for themselves, for their nation, and for mankind a juncture for moving toward a better life along the path of genuine and selfless interaction that is free of greed, tyrannical inclinations, injustice, and totalitarianism. O Arabs: Sound beginnings help achieve sound results. Although we realize that this alone is not enough to achieve the necessary results of our nation's struggle and jihad under circumstances similar to ours, the right description of the state of affairs in any domain that is viewed from a leadership perspective and determination is something essential and cannot be done away with in search of suitable solutions and accomplishments. It is not enough to embark on an analysis to explain the background of part of our role as Arabs and the background of our culture, heritage, and constant position as handed down throughout history. Accordingly, what we said about the present stage of development in international and human life and its negative phenomena, will genuinely help us as Arabs and help our struggle and jihad and even our pan-Arab action, each according to the description befitting him whether the concerned Arabs are mujahidin and strugglers or mere workers in the political fields, and regardless of the titles under which any of them was listed when the nation advanced in its role, position, and results of what was achieved in terms of civilized description and offer when Baghdad represented the entire Arab nation through its influence, role, history, and outlook. This continued until the eye, soul, strength, and consciousness of Baghdad stopped playing that role or having that influence when it collapsed after weakness penetrated the trunk of its tree. That tree became dry and broke into pieces at the hands of Hulegu in 1258. Before that date, and right from the beginning of its representation of the modern Arab age, Baghdad was a splendid example of balance between the spiritual values and requisites of development on the one hand, and outlook for a new life replete with virtue, prosperity, justice, and fairness in a state far more advanced than all others in the world on the other. Baghdad had thus based itself on the spirit of new faith and values of noble Islam. It used Islam's superiority to nourish the material pillar of life, giving no prominence to material considerations over spiritual or moral values. This was the case especially when a serious contradiction was visible and when the wise men of the nation and those mainly responsible for its banners and soundness of its direction agreed that it had this negative description. However, Baghdad maintained its positive description and role, as we have said. It was not implicated itself in what past empires did nor in what subsequent empires continue to do. It has not replaced the role of a leader, guide, rescuer, and instructor in its relations with the other nations with the role of a dominator or subjugator. It has not replaced the role God has ordained for it in the koranic phrase "But give them preference over themselves, even though poverty was their own lot" by a role turning its wise leaders into monopolizers. The concern of its leaders was how to feed the hungry people, help the poor, and protect virtue even when those to whom care was extended were preparing to harm Baghdad. Subsequently, our Arab civilization has not changed or developed in a manner that would lead it to produce a community governed and enslaved by material things. Rather, it exploited material things in the service of higher values. The spiritual factor remained the cornerstone of the new civilization and human values. This state of affairs continued until the Arab empire collapsed. Despite the weakness that preceded its existence, and despite the flaws that had been recorded against it and against its leaders, this empire did not develop into a materialistic state and society. Almighty and all-powerful God may have ordained that material development be transferred to the West so that the Arabs would not bear its consequences and so that they would not deviate from the sound human track, as did the Westerners for this and other reasons, in terms of their relations with other nations and peoples and with their own selves. The Arabs have not created a materialistic society following the example of Western development and the exploitation and tyranny that this development has created. Yet, the Arabs remained in a state of temporary inertia, looking indecisively for a role and seeking to revive their past role. At that stage, the Ottomans tried to play this role and to obliterate the role of the Arabs. The Arabs did not score any accomplishment of historic value, and remained this way until the beginning of the formation of the regional, so-called nation states. When 'Abd-al-Nasir launched his revolution of 23 July 1952 in Egypt, many of these states were under foreign control and basically run as part of foreigners' strategies. Even when national regimes came to power in some Arab countries, confusion continued among national rulers, despite Arab thinkers' efforts. Those rulers either relied on irrelevant parts of history and heritage, or reviewed history and heritage only to cite verbal examples that are void of any content and never meant to be put into practice. Rulers did not play any effective intellectual role to develop parts of our heritage to support our present requirements. Many, both rulers and ruled, remained unable to find the sound formula to strike a balance between the materialistic and the spiritual, between the past and the present, between leading a religious life and living under acceptable contemporary laws, between the contemporary life copied from the West's trivialities and the nature of the required life, and between the heritage it values and the requirements of our age to achieve a spiritual and material civilization. They remained undecided between the rigid texts on the recorded history of rule and what we should decide theoretically and practically after absorbing and learning from the past. They also remained undecided between the importance of nationalism and the necessity of pan-Arabism. This state of affairs continued until most of the people, led by most of the rulers, were divided into either followers and copiers of the West's trivialities, which left the people without a spirit and without a role, or into parrot-like copiers of pieces of history and heritage, without putting their methods to the test or molding them to conform with the age in which they live. As for the process of creating by building on tradition, as an intellectual and practical stand, we find virtually no examples of this in the policies of any ruler, nor do we find its application in a serious, comprehensive, and profound manner. The sons of the nation have, throughout this period, continued jihad, struggle, and work. Some of them have brought us other ideas and views on humanity and the experience of other nations. Some of the sons of this nation, which God chose as a nation justly balanced, that ye might be witness over the nations, and the messenger a witness over you [part of Koranic verse] -- since it is the source of the first regiment that upheld the banner of Islam until the banners of faith spread outside the Arab nation -- have adopted communism, notwithstanding its atheism, under the pressure of social injustice and intellectual loss. Regardless of how close or divergent views are between the sons of the one nation, following the example of other nations will not achieve progress for our nation. What will do this is a process of creation that rests on great faith in God and the higher values of our spiritual heritage. The foremost of these values are justice, fairness, creating an appropriate atmosphere for virtue, fighting vice, and making the poor of the nation the center of the attention of the ruler, since they have a right to the wealth of the nation, just as they have duties in the efforts and jihad of the nation. Also, we must provide the requirements for the cultural progress of the nation, based on pan-Arab thought and the structure of the pan-Arab society and faithful pan-Arab state. Brothers, friends, believers, free people of the world and bearers of the banner of dignity. You tyrants, covetous, and disappointed criminals as well: God decreed our liberation after our suffering, thus he increased our patience and capabilities, which are protected by his power. God also gave us wisdom that enabled the people of Iraq to follow the right path. Let all villains know, however, that the people and leadership of Iraq, from a position of responsibility and patience, will not turn wisdom into a prelude for weakness and despair. If we were patient over the continuation of the blockade, which was imposed by the will of the evildoers, despite all the actions of the tamperers and evildoers; and were also patient over the continuation of their flights in the southern part of our dear, deep-rooted Iraq, that violate its airspace and have been preventing our planes from flying south of the 32d parallel for some time with the help of some evildoers from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait; and the continuation of absurdity in the northern part of our beloved homeland and in the life of our dear people north of 36th parallel, despite the fact that the nature of their intentions and weak pretexts were exposed--we will not relinquish our people in the northern part of the homeland. Nor will we stand idle toward the continuation of the blockade and the violation of our sovereignty in southern Iraq. For all evildoers, masters and satellites, we reiterate that they must not be deluded once again or miscalculate things. They should learn from the lessons of the recent past and comprehend their meanings on bases free of their evil intentions. Let them fear God and remember that his will is above theirs and that of their devils. Otherwise, the punishment of the criminals is an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. God is great. For all those concerned among the Arab rulers, we say: All that you have done against the people of Iraq is something that angers God, his prophet, the believers, all free Arabs, those who keep their pledges before God, and all those who work for the nation's glory, loftiness, and happiness, and for the sake of triumphing for the poor ones and for supporting the wronged people against the positions of injustice, corruption, and hunger. I also say that there is still some way out of this. I tell the wise believers: Will you do so? I have conveyed the message, and may God be my witness. O glorious Iraqi women; O zealous and glorious Iraqi men: You have endured a great deal. You are worthy of the honorable endurance you have experienced, and of the rewards of such endurance. But, you still have to demonstrate the endurance usually required of believers during the last 10 days of the blessed month of Ramadan. Of course, there are rewards for fasting during this period in Ramadan. Patience and fasting during this period further cleanses the mind while the body is relieved of additional burdens to obtain the satisfaction of the merciful and compassionate God. Afterward, people celebrate the great feast, and mark a great victory of the mind, as well as a great victory over enemies, God willing. May God answer our prayers, ease our burdens, strengthen our patience, and grant us great victory. May God protect our people, Army, and nation from adversity and mischief. May God grant us victory over the infidels. Amen. You are the cherisher and sustainer of the world. We beseech God to bestow his mercy on the souls of the martyrs who fell in the Mother of Battles and the al-Qadisiyah battle, and on all of our righteous martyrs, who fell to uphold honor, the national cause, and principles. We beseech God to bestow his mercy on the Arab nation's martyrs, who fell along the path of struggle, jihad, and fateful battles. Long live our glorious Arab nation. May its message remain eternal. Long live Palestine as a free Arab country. Long live Palestine. Long live Iraq. Long live Iraq. God is great. God is great. God is great. And may the lowly be accursed. May God's peace, mercy, and blessings be upon you, brothers and friends.
