In connection with this, which one of them has proved to be the most harmful? This is how Leonid Kravchuk answered: [Kravchuk] Our greatest delusion was the euphoria of a quick resolution of any problems posed by life. It seems to me that euphoria is a product of little or insufficient knowledge of the situation: The less one knows about this or that subject -- this, incidentally, is a philosophical interpretation --the simpler and (?very much clearer) everything seems to one. So, I would like to repeat this, the euphoria of the possibility to resolve any problems quickly due to insufficient knowledge or information of a distorted nature, is the greatest danger. [Kuzmenko] Quite acute, I think, was a question asking the president whether he was not ashamed at Ukrainian Acting Prime Minister Yefim Zvyahilskiy's actions. The journalist's opinion was that these actions were antimarket. [Kravchuk] I would like to specify one detail. The Zvyahilskiy government as such is nonexistent. This is the government which was left by Prime Minister Kuchma. This government, in its full composition, was not reshuffled. Taking into account the situation which took shape on the eve of the new elections, we considered it to be inexpedient [to change the government]. In other words, as the president, it seemed to me that the majority of deputies at first agreed to the fact that it would just be inexpedient to form a new government for six months, because it is clear that the new parliament would form a new government. And this is only natural. I cannot say that I am ashamed of the Zvyahilskiy government because, despite the situation, it is exactly now, although with difficulty, that the reform began to make its first steps and we began to earn some currency to pay Russia for the power sources. But the real fact is that the first steps toward reforms, toward privatization, toward... [pauses] We are on the eve of possible... [pauses] preparation of the monetary reform. This is a reality. This is why now one cannot blame the government that works... [pauses] that we must be ashamed of it. I would not like to discuss and use such categories altogether. Every government is doing what it can. It cannot do more than that. The next government will probably do more, I am convinced of this. [Kuzmenko] Answering the question on a concept of economic independence for Ukraine's separate regions, President Kravchuk said: [Kravchuk] I adhere to the idea that regions should have the broadest possible economic independence. This refers to the mobilization of incomes, the administration of incomes, budgetary relations, the use of property, if this is the state property, the management of the property. Everything which has to do with production and social relations... [pauses] and they should have appropriate legally approved sources of receipts and they should work without the center. As far as political federalization is concerned, I believe that this issue is premature. I do not rule out a possibility of working out political institutions, too, in future, on the basis of working out mechanisms of economic independence. But to raise the issue on complete federalization of our, for example, state today, immediately... [pauses] Well, first, this is objectively impracticable and, second, this could certainly affect both the reforms and all other political and economic processes, even to endanger the possibility of preserving the integrity of the state as such. [Kuzmenko] In the context of this, the Market Reforms Press Club's sitting did not abstain from topical questions on the subject of Crimea. Explaining his position on this issue, the Ukrainian president said: [Kravchuk] I favor the idea of granting the broadest possible economic powers to Crimea. I had a talk with the president, with [word indistinct] Saburov on these issues. I understand that it would not be easy to coordinate their economic independence with the legislation currently in force in Ukraine. However, there is the president's decree on granting relevant economic status to Crimea. Such a decree does exist, and proceeding from this decree and the law on the delimitation of plenary powers between Ukraine and Crimea, I believe that it is necessary to conduct a flexible policy here. One can even say that we could consider Crimea as a testing ground for economic reforms, if they would have been carried out there. As far as other issues are concerned, now noneconomic issues are being aggravated. Not a single economic decree has been issued in Crimea so far, and no economic decisions have been made either. There is a decree on a referendum, we had to revoke it; a decree on changing over to Moscow time; and a groundless dismissal of Astakhov from the post of the chairman of the TV and radio company [of Crimea]. By the way, today I rescinded this decree by Meshkov. That is to say, excuse me for saying this, there is a political intrigue. There is a gross violation of the legislation by the president of Crimea, and not only the legislation of Ukraine, but his own legislation, according to the principle: There is the president, the people, and God. This is a dangerous stand, a dangerous policy. I believe that this is just some kind of misunderstanding. Maybe, these are the first steps of euphoria. I am waiting for this to stop. This cannot last forever. As far as economy is concerned, I am ready, and I again say we and the government are all ready to consider the issue so that the economy of Crimea would work in the interests of the people. [Kuzmenko] Among the questions asked at the meeting, was the following: What importance and significance does the president attach to private capital in Ukraine's market reforms, and what is the role this capital can play in the sphere of the economy in the very near future? Here is how Mr. Kravchuk explained it: [Kravchuk] There cannot be a real, civilized market without private ownership, without private capital and accordingly without banks and without financial structures. I am in favor of resolutely going in this direction. Resolutely! What needs to be done, let us say, in terms of privatization in the broad sense of the word is the Supreme Council should adopt a provision that land together with the facilities can be an object of purchase and sale. This is the one thing that needs to be done. I issued a directive stating that we were to sell incomplete- construction together with the land. Immediately, the land code was amended stopping it. That is, this is unrealistic until there is clarity on this issue, in parliament and executive power and at local authorities, that land is an object of purchase and sale together with the facilities built on it. [Kuzmenko] The Ukrainian president said that inconsistent, irregular progress along the path of reforms was primarily caused by the government's ineffective actions. A correspondent asked the president a question about the idea of cancelling the early presidential election [on 26 June]. This is how Leonid Kravchuk commented on this situation: [Kravchuk] I do not wish to alter my point of view. I expressed myself in favor of both early parliamentary and presidential elections. I am not altering this position. I only repeat that one cannot do the electing without knowing who to elect. This is why my view is this: The new parliament, I once again emphasize, cannot stand aside. It is simply impossible to imagine that there already is a new parliament. The election is drawing nearer and parliament is not voicing its view. It must express itself prior to the election on principle. This purely is a parliamentary prerogative. People are (?demanding this). The status of the president is to be determined. The main parameters of executive power, its plenary and functional powers, and cooperation, are to be determined at constitutional level. This has to be a constitutional law. It cannot be otherwise. And only then, an election is to be appointed. That is all. If they manage to have it done by 26 June, the presidential election will go ahead on 26 June. But what if not? The new parliament all of sudden says: Let the president be elected on the basis of the powers that exist today under the old law. Well, there will be an election then. What else can be done? One should, however, forecast the situation that there will be tomorrow. What can this lead to? One can take a purely legal stand and say: We adopted and signed [a decree on the presidential election], so let us execute it and not a step backwards. Can this be done? Yes, it can. But the situation has changed in time. Look at what difficulties have arisen in the economy and what processes have begun regionally, for instance, in Crimea and all. Not to see all this and not to take all this into consideration and just to say there should be elections for the sake of elections, I cannot. I do not decide. As president, however, I cannot be silent and not tell the people what has happened and what can happen. I have my personal view, but I do not decide it. The election must take place, but with the powers and functions expressly determined at constitutional level with the participation of the new parliament. Nobody will make me change my mind. If this is to be without me, let them decide. After all, I am not blocking these processes. [Kuzmenko] It is known that Ukraine is preparing to introduce its own currency unit. In this connection, the president said the transition to the hryvnya would be open and would take account of the interests of all Ukrainian citizens. [Kravchuk] There is another problem which is that of the hryvnya's stabilization fund. When we settle all the issues with the International Monetary Fund [IMF] and manage to clarify all those budgetary and other matters, the IMF will grant us a stabilization credit. This is very important and it will be hard to work without this. I would still like to return to commodity bonds. The Supreme Council vetoed them. There were opportune remarks. We now have worked this document over and its character now is entirely different. We have set up Ukraine's Credit Fund, which will specifically deal with attracting credit, including through commodity bonds of Ukraine's material resources rather than its national ones. It will be entities engaging in economic activity that will be responsible for the credit granted, rather than the whole of Ukraine, who was granted responsibility for it. That is, a clearer and more understandable mechanism has been worked out and it should be put into practice because credits have to be attracted. This money will primarily be invested, because it will have to be returned at a relatively low interest rate of up to around 7 percent, which is a normal international interest rate.
