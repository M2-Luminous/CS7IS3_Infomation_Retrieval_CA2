[Begin recording] [Ben-David] Now that the meeting with President Clinton is over, have the Syrians let the reins loose again in Lebanon? [Mordekhay] It was anticipated that on the day the talks open in Washington they will escalate the situation and try to make Hizballah and the confrontation in Lebanon the top news item, since this has usually been the way they have acted when talks begin. I believe we have the necessary answers and the confrontation continues in the security zone. [Ben-David] Do you think that as long as the negotiations continue and no progress is made there the Syrians will continue to conduct the war in Lebanon? [Mordekhay] We believed in the past and still believe that if the Syrians want, they can significantly restrain Hizballah activities in south Lebanon against the security zone, the SLA [South Lebanese Army] and against Israel. [end recording] [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1900 GMT on 24 January reports that "SLA soldiers managed to foil a terrorist attempt to overtake an SLA outpost in the 'Alman al-Shumariyah area in the security zone. Our correspondent Yo'av Aviv reports that Hizballah fired mortars and katyushas at the outpost, and under cover of the shelling tried to capture the post, but were warded off. An SLA soldier was killed, and two were wounded in the attack. IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and SLA troops pursued the terrorists."]
