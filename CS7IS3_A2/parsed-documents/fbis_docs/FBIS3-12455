This House has witnessed the birth pangs of the State of Israel, its struggle for survival, its dreams of peace. In my capacity as defense minister and prime minister, I have stood on this podium dozens of times. At times I imparted bitter news, and on occasion I announced good tidings. Today I stand before you, members of the Knesset, and before the citizens of the State of Israel and the entire world, and as a Jew, as an Israeli, and as a human being, I feel shamed and disgraced by the infamy wrought upon us by a base murderer. Members of the Knesset, perhaps more than any other people and nation in the world today, Israel has been waging a bloody fight for its survival for more than a generation. We have been hit by Arab terror, which continues to strike us. From time to time, too frequently, we bury our dead, grit our teeth, and go on. We fight, lose our best friends -- both civilians and soldiers, cherish the memory of the victims, and go on. Throughout this long time, we have tried to maintain our image as the nation that imparted moral and cultural values to the world. It is not easy for a country engaged in an endless war to maintain its human image and moral standing. Although we have experienced anomalies and tragedies, we have earned our good reputation with blood, with the blood of the members of the prestate underground organizations, with the blood of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers who lost their lives when a woman hid a terrorist behind her back as she breast-fed her baby and when enemy soldiers raised their arms in surrender while concealing a hand grenade that was about to explode. We fight, and when there is no other choice, we kill those who come to kill us. We are not murderers. This is the time and place to extend our gratitude to thousands of IDF soldiers, to the Shin Bet, to the Israel Police and Border Police personnel, whose hard work is the insurance policy of the State of Israel. Thank you, from the bottom of our hearts. Members of the Knesset, early on the morning of Friday, 25 February, a tragedy befell the families of the murdered victims, the residents of Hebron, the Palestinians, the State of Israel, and the Jewish people. In the city where the father of both Israel and Ishmael lived -- the city that experienced coexistence, as well as the abhorrent pogrom against the Jews -- in Hebron, a Jew desecrated the holiness of the Cave of the Patriarchs. At a time when hundreds of Muslim worshipers were praying to their God in the middle of the Ramadan fast, a villainous Jew opened fire, killing dozens of Muslim worshipers and wounding dozens more. To date, we do not know the exact number of dead and wounded. We know this much, however: This is a great tragedy, a terrible disaster. The Israeli Government, and I believe and hope the entire Knesset, sends its condolences to the families whose dear ones were killed in cold blood and wishes a speedy recovery to the wounded. Members of the Knesset, even before the cabinet decided to set up a state commission of inquiry, we began our own investigations, which are still under way. We are leaving no stone unturned in our search for the truth. Nevertheless, at this point we can already state with almost total certainty the following facts: The wicked murderer acted alone, and he had no partners in the firing inside the Cave of the Patriarchs. As far as we know at this stage, the murderer managed to shoot from his rifle alone at least 111 bullets at the innocent worshipers who were praying to their God and did not notice the villain laying in ambush. I would like to add that 111 cartridges were found and, according to the investigation conducted by the Israel Police Department of Investigation and Forensic Science, all were fired from his rifle. Not a single cartridge fired from a different weapon was found. In the riots that broke out in several locations in the territories after the massacre, there were several instances in which IDF soldiers were forced to fire to defend themselves because their lives were endangered. As a result of that fire, some residents of the territories were killed or wounded. The investigation into that is still going on. When it is concluded, we will make all the findings public and hide nothing. Any attempt to present IDF soldiers as partners to the massacre in the Cave of the Patriarchs, however, is absurd. Could the massacre have been avoided? We are living in a difficult situation in which Jews and Arabs live side by side, rubbing shoulders daily and hourly. Thousands of Jews and Arabs live in one area and mix in hothouses, markets, fields and citrus groves, in buses and taxis, in cafes and restaurants, at building sites and in factories. Thus Jews and Arabs have been praying side by side in the Cave of the Patriarchs, a holy site for both religions, since 1967. We -- Arabs and Jews -- have been destined to live together in Israel and the territories, and there is no possibility of completely preventing lunatics from both sides from exploiting that situation in order to carry out attacks. The truth must be told, even at this hour. We Israelis have suffered far more from terrorist attacks, but we are also mindful of the suffering of the Palestinians and of any human pain. We feel for all grief. Members of the Knesset, this is a difficult time for the citizens of the State of Israel, the Jewish people, and anybody in whom a human heart beats. This despicable act is so foreign to us, so un-Jewish, so abhorrent, that the quote from the Bible, which we gave to all people of cultures everywhere, is apt: Simeon and Levi are brothers; weapons of violence are their swords. O my soul, come not into their council; O my spirit, be not joined to their company; for in their anger they slay men, and in their wantonness they hamstring oxen. Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce; and their wrath, for it is cruel! I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel. [Genesis 49:5] Members of the Knesset, the villain from Hebron put a mark on all of us, even though we are not to blame. That despicable man may not have been deranged in the clinical sense of the term when he pulled the murderous trigger, but the ghastly act was that of a mentally ill person, and in our hearts we feel only deep contempt for his vile deed. That murderer surfaced from within a small, limited political framework. He grew up in a morass whose sources exist here and overseas. They are foreign to Judaism; they do not belong to us. To him and those like him, we say today: You are not part of the people of Israel; you are not part of the national democratic camp in which all in this House are partners. Many among us despise you. You are not partners to the Zionist effort. You are an alien element; you are wild weeds. Sane Judaism vomits you out from its midst. You have alienated yourselves from the community, according to the Halakah. You are a shame to Zionism and a disgrace to Judaism. One direct line links all the lunatics and racists of the world, a single line of blood and terror from the Islamic Jihad that shot at Jewish worshipers at prayer in synagogues in Istanbul, Paris, and Amsterdam and including the Jewish Hamas member who shot at Ramadan worshipers. Yesterday the government made the following decision: a. In view of the extraordinary circumstances and under the Commission of Inquiry Law, 1968, it was decided to set up a commission of inquiry into the massacre at the Cave of the Patriarchs on 25 February 1994; b. After hearing a report by the security services and after being presented the attorney general's opinion, the government decided on a series of individual measures against extremists among the Israeli residents of Judaea and Samaria, as follows: 1. Carrying out administrative detentions; 2. Imposing restrictive and supervisory orders governing the entry of certain people to Judaea and Samaria and to Hebron; and 3. Revoking gun permits for certain people and disarming them; c. Tasking the attorney general with investigating the possibility of outlawing Kakh and Kahana Hay; d. Registering the statement by the prime minister and defense minister on the release of some 800 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, with the aim of reaching the release of up to 1,000 detainees and prisoners within the coming week; e. Reopening the Cave of the Patriarchs after determining new security and prayer arrangements. Members of the Knesset, we are proud of our democracy; there are few like it in the world. Each citizen of Israel has the right to express his opinion in a democratic manner, to oppose or support government policy. There are those who claim that the democratic system is weak in the face of other systems of government in the world. I say to you that even the weakest democracy must defend itself and its values, and that we will do. We will not permit anybody in the State of Israel or the territories under its control, regardless of his name or position, to determine or change the policy of the government -- any government -- by trying to extort at gunpoint or through false messianic claims. No political movement or power group -- secular or religious -- will dare to raise its hand against democracy here. We, as a government, will stand like a fortified wall and without mercy, and we will use all legal measures, even if force is required, to quash any such attempt in the bud. Members of the Knesset, we know today that the murderer from Hebron fired at innocent people but planned to kill the peace. His aim was political. To all those who still have doubts about the State of Israel's commitment to peace, I say with a clear voice: Do not be mistaken. We will continue to work for peace on the basis of the Declaration of Principles, signed in Washington, and the Cairo document. We will accelerate the talks, the contacts, and the negotiations. Even if it tarries, peace will come. Nevertheless, I must make clear to our Palestinian partners at the negotiating table: The vile murder in Hebron and the mourning and grief will not move us from our positions of principle regarding Israel's security and the security of its citizens, including the Jewish settlers in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. We have no intention of compromising, even one iota, on security matters which affect each one of us. Our security is also your security and the supreme guarantee of the success of peace. I will tell you today: No knife, no firebomb, no stone will deter us from upholding our principles concerning security while continuing to hound the perpetrators of terror. We will not let them rest. I wish to say something else to the Palestinians, our partners at the negotiating table in Taba, Paris, Cairo, and Washington: We understand you and grieve with you over the terrible tragedy. We identify with the deep grief, sorrow, and the tears, and we know that even when peace comes, both of us will lick the wounds from the wars. We invite you to return to the negotiations table, to resume the talks. We will return to continue the negotiations because after the blood and tears, the near future may bring what we have sought and dreamed of for so long: to put an end to 100 years of war and terrorism and to start to live like all other nations. We are close to the target in the next stage of the peace negotiations. We see the finishing line. More effort, more readiness, more goodwill by you Palestinians and by us, and we will succeed. We will bring peace to our homes and our children. We have no other way -- only peace, and nothing but peace. I want to make several remarks to the Israeli Arabs. For a generation, you have been part of us for good and for bad. You were with us for dozens of years during hard times for you and us, and despite all the difficulties, you have been loyal partners. We managed to achieve coexistence, and we want it to continue. We understand your grieving hearts at this hour, but we believe that we must not let momentary crises affect the glorious times that we can expect. We will not permit difficult crises, no matter how many there are, to destroy the fabric of relations we have built over dozens of years. Members of the Knesset, in my worst dreams I did not believe that I would stand here today in front of you under such difficult circumstances. I would like to hope and believe that this nightmare will pass, but not before all of us on both sides of the border understand that there is hope for a solution to this unending bloodbath, and it is peace. I believe and hope that this house is united in denouncing the crime and in expressing condolences, just as it is united in the aspiration for peace, even if there are differences of opinion between us on how to achieve it. I will conclude with the words of the Hebrew poet Bialik: How great the pain, and how great the shame, and what is the greater of the two? Man, you tell me.
