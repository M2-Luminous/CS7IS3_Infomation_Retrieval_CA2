FR940926-1-00012 FR940926-1-00006 13. Should a minimum size be specified for the labels? 14. Should a minimum height or depth be specified for the letters and numbers embossed on the labels? 15. Should any information be added to or deleted from that currently required to appear on the label? 16. Should trailers with a GVWR of 4,536 kg (10,000 lb) or less also meet the requirements being proposed for large trailers? 17. Should the agency require some different approach, other than the proposed metal label requirement, for preserving VIN labels? V. Agency Proposal Based on the assertions by Mr. Robinson in his petition and the analysis discussed above, NHTSA proposes to amend 49 CFR 567.4 to require that, for vehicles with GVWR greater than 4,536 kg (10,000 lb), the manufacturer's certification label required by that part be made of metal. The agency also proposes that the letters and numbers on the label be raised or recessed, and that the label be riveted or otherwise permanently affixed to each vehicle in the locations suggested by the petitioner. The agency believes that by requiring permanent metal labels, commercial vehicle safety would be enhanced by ensuring that commercial vehicles are being driven by drivers who are duly qualified and licensed to operate them. This would have the effect of identifying and removing unfit and unqualified drivers from the nation's highways, thereby enhancing the safety of the motoring public. In addition, a permanent metal label on which the GVWR and VIN remain legible throughout all or the greater part of the service life of a commercial vehicle would help to ensure that the information supplied to the SAFETYNET system would be more accurate, thus contributing directly to the enforcement efforts discussed above. Further, to reflect rulemaking conducted by the agency pursuant to the Imported Vehicles Safety Compliance Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100&hyph;562, 102 Stat. 2818 (49 U.S.C. 30141, 30146), NHTSA proposes to amend existing ยง567.4(k) to substitute ``49 CFR 591.5(f)'' in place of the current ``19 CFR 12.80(b)(1).'' VI. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices A. EO 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures This notice was not reviewed under E.O. 12866. NHTSA has considered the impact associated with this rulemaking action and has concluded that it is not significant under the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. As explained above, this action merely would require that the motor vehicle manufacturer's label, which is already required for all motor vehicles, be made of metal and be permanently affixed to those vehicles with a GVWR greater than 4,536 kg (10,000 lb). The costs would range from $0.25 to $2.50 per vehicle, for a total incremental annual cost of between $106,482 and $1,064,820. NHTSA has concluded, therefore, that the effect of this proposed action would be so minimal as not to warrant preparation of a full regulatory evaluation. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act NHTSA has considered the impacts of this rulemaking action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify that the proposed amendments would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, the agency has not prepared a preliminary regulatory flexibility analysis. The agency believes that few, if any, motor vehicle manufacturers qualify as small businesses, although some label manufacturers might so qualify. Those small businesses would be affected only to the extent that they may be required to purchase equipment to emboss information on metal labels, if they do not already have such equipment, at a one-time cost of between $300 and $1,500. Such cost could be amortized over the life of the equipment, and/or passed on to customers and, eventually, to consumers. Small organizations and small governmental units would be affected by the proposed amendment only to the extent of having to pay an additional $0.25 to $2.50 per large vehicle. C. National Environmental Policy Act NHTSA has analyzed this rulemaking action for purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act and has determined that implementation of this action would have no significant impact on the quality of the human environment. D. EO 12612 (Federalism) NHTSA has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment. E. Civil Justice Reform The proposed rule would not have any retroactive effect. Under 49 U.S.C. 30103(b), whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a state or political subdivision may prescribe or continue in effect a standard applicable to the same aspect of performance of a motor vehicle only if the standard is identical to the Federal standard. However, the United States Government, a state, or a political subdivision of a state may prescribe a standard for a motor vehicle or item of motor vehicle equipment obtained for its own use that imposes a higher performance requirement than that required by the Federal standard. 49 U.S.C. 30161 sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. A petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings is not required before parties may file suit in court.
