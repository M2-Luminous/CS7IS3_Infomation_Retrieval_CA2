Ailton Kroda, who coordinated the land occupation operation at Lagoa Vermelha (RS) [Rio Grande do Sul State], is a veteran in this sort of activity. Kroda already has participated in six land occupation operations. He admitted to this newspaper that he already has received a lot of land but continues "to help the movement." The MST leaders receive political training. The MST has linked up with CUT [Sole Workers Center] and Catholic Church groups to create a training center at Braga (RS). Officially, this center is an agricultural technical school -- the Foundation for Educational Development and Research [Fundacao para o Desenvolvimento Educacional e Pesquisa -- Fundep]. The 80 students enrolled at Fundep per year are recommended by the MST and CUT. Their ages range from 14 to 18. In the morning they have normal classes. In the afternoon they till the land. At night they receive political training. The MST "indoctrination copy books" are supposedly didactic material, but they contain biographies of revolutionary figures such as Che Guevara and a "calendar of people's struggles." Jose Adelmar Batista, one of three Fundep coordinators, says the political training's objective "is to teach the students to question unfairness and get organized to fight it."
