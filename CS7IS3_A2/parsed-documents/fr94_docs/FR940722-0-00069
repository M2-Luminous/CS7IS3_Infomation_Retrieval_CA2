ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: With the restructuring of the Federal-aid highway program due to enactment of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) of 1991 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;240, 105 Stat. 1914), regulations for the administration and management of activities undertaken with FHWA planning and research funds are updated to reflect the revised sources of, and activities eligible for, such funds. In addition, the ISTEA allows the States more flexibility in managing and directing federally funded research, development, and technology transfer (RD&T) activities. This final rule includes the ISTEA revisions and grants States this greater responsibility and flexibility for the management and oversight of their RD&T initiatives funded with FHWA planning and research funds. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule is effective on August 22, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Tony Solury (202&hyph;366&hyph;5003), Office of Environment and Planning, Federal Highway Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, D.C. 20590, for 23 CFR part 420, subpart A; Mr. Charles W. Niessner (703&hyph;285&hyph;2100), Office of Research and Development, Federal Highway Administration, Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center, 6300 Georgetown Pike, McLean, VA 22101&hyph;2296, for 23 CFR part 420, subpart B; or Mr. Wilbert Baccus (202&hyph;366&hyph;0780), Office of the Chief Counsel, Federal Highway Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, D.C. 20590. Office hours are from 7:45 a.m. to 4:15 p.m., e.t., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On December 21, 1993, a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) was published by the FHWA in the Federal Register (58 FR 67510) to obtain comments from interested persons on proposed revisions to regulations for program approval and authorization; conduct; and reporting of planning, research, development, and technology transfer activities undertaken by States and their subrecipients, including metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), with FHWA planning and research funds. The proposed revisions were necessary to reflect changes to Title 23, United States Code, Highways, that resulted from enactment of the ISTEA. In addition, the FHWA proposed that States establish a process for management of RD&T activities undertaken with FHWA planning and research funds that would enable States to exercise greater authority over such activities. With respect to administration of FHWA planning and research funded RD&T activities, the final rule reflects the FHWA's belief that its stewardship role should be one of concentrating more on the policies and procedures by which States implement such activities than on project-specific approvals and oversight. This philosophy parallels the administrative oversight procedures adopted for FHWA planning and research funded transportation planning activities in earlier revisions to 23 CFR part 420, subpart A in 1985 and 1990. The ISTEA instituted a number of substantive changes pertinent to transportation planning and RD&T programs. In addition to retitling it from Highway Planning and Research to State Planning and Research (SPR), the ISTEA: (1) increased the set-aside of funds apportioned to States for SPR activities from 1.5 percent to 2 percent; (2) included planning and RD&T as eligible activities under the National Highway System (NHS) program and Surface Transportation Program (STP); (3) permitted the use of certain funds made available under title 23, U.S.C., for intermodal transportation planning and RD&T; and (4) required the expenditure of 25 percent of a State's annual SPR funds for RD&T activities, unless the State certifies that it will use more than 75 percent for planning and the Secretary of Transportation (the Secretary) accepts the certification. These legislative provisions are reflected in this rule. Thirty-one sets of comments were submitted to the docket in response to the NPRM; 28 from State transportation departments/agencies, 1 from a regional planning agency, 1 from a professional association, and 1 from a Federal agency. The overwhelming majority of comments were in support of the proposed revisions and the increased flexibility for State management of RD&T activities. However, there were some concerns regarding some of the specific revisions and the short deadline for compliance. Many of these concerns were due to misunderstandings about existing requirements and not the proposed revisions. A summary of the comments, their disposition, and the changes made to the rule follow.
