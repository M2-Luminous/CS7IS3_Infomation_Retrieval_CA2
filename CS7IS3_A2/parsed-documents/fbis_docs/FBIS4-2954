The departments under party committees should work in line with the requirements for the development of the situation and upgrade their awareness of being submitted to and serving the work of the party as a whole. Of all the fronts and departments under the leadership of the party, propaganda, organizational, discipline inspection, and united front work departments occupy extremely important positions. Since the implementation of the important talks made by Comrade Deng Xiaoping during his inspection of south China in 1992 and the guidelines of the 14th party congress, the propaganda, organizational, discipline inspection, and united front work departments under the provincial party committee have done a lot of work and made good achievements in comprehensively implementing the basic line of the party and accelerating the pace of reform, opening up, and modernization. There is an extremely important experience. That is, so long as the departments suit the changes of the situation and are submitted to and serve the general task of the party will they be able to ceaselessly enhance vitality, upgrade their work quality, and make contributions. This has become a basic principle to arrange the work of all fronts and all departments. According to the current international and domestic situations, the party Central Committee defined the overall work situation as follows: Grasp favorable opportunities, deepen reform, expand the scale of opening up, promote development, and maintain stability. Being submitted to, serving, and realizing this overall situation is high above everything and more important than any other things. The work in all aspects of the province, including the propaganda, organizational, discipline inspection, and united front work, should unconditionally, highly, and consciously be submitted to and serve the overall situation of the whole party. Thus, we should strive to make contributions to promoting and realizing this overall situation. The key to realizing the overall situation of the party is to well handle the relationship between reform, development, and stability. In the aspect of economic restructuring, our country has entered a new stage of linking package reform with breakthroughs in key areas. A series of major reforms as defined by the central authorities this year can be regarded as a battle to tackle the most difficult problems. The reforms that should be carried out this year touch on the readjustment of the deep-layered contradictions, the interest pattern, and the interest relations. So, it is considerably difficult to carry out the reforms. If we dare not tackle or tide over these difficulties, we will lose historical favorable opportunities. Under such circumstances, it will be difficult to maintain the current sustained, rapid, and sound development of the national economy and the stagnation of reform will possibly bring about a strained circumstance characterized by slow economic growth rate and high inflation. There are great difficulties in reform. If we do not carry out reform, the difficulties will be more serious. We should rely on deepening reform in order to make development. Only when we unswervingly deepen reform will we be able to extricate ourselves from the strained circumstances and to create new productive forces. Development is our fundamental purpose. Only through development, will we be able to make the country strong and the people rich. Therefore, development is always an essential criterion. By no means does development have no contradictions. The failure to regulate and control the macroeconomy or to enliven the microeconomy will affect not only the sustained and sound development of the economy but also social stability. There are many contradictions in development. But, the contradictions are even more serious if we do not make development. Fundamentally speaking, so long as we conduct reform we will be able to maintain stability and ensure a long-term order and stability of the country. However, the difficulties in reform and the contradictions cropping up through development will add new unstable factors. Therefore, we must pay full attention to maintaining stability, do a good job in maintaining stability and eliminate all unstable factors in the bud. Otherwise, nothing will be accomplished. In short, reform, development, and stability are related to and promote one another. We must organically combine reform with development and stability, persistently promote development with reform, promote stability with reform and development, and use stability to ensure the smooth progress of reform and development. The key to enable departments to submit consciously to their work and to serve the overall situation of the whole party's work is to cultivate a strong sense of the overall situation and a firm concept of entirety, rationalize their relationship with the overall situation and entirety from the high plane of implementing the party's basic line on one central task and two basic points, be good at accurately finding out their own positions in the overall situation, actively and appropriately give play to their own role in line with their own functions, and make due contributions to realizing the overall situation of the whole party's work. It is hoped that all departments of the party committees at all levels across the province will enhance common understanding, work together with one heart in times of difficulty, and raise the work of various departments to a new height in the course of caring for, supporting, and participating in deepening reform, expanding opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability. 2. We should further implement the task of using the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm the whole party by organizing the people to study focusing on Volume No. 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping." Using Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm the whole party is one of the most important and fundamental ideologies of the whole party and an important ideological guarantee for realizing the overall situation of the whole party's work this year. Since the 14th party congress, particularly after the publication of Volume no.3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" and the issuance of the central decision on study, party and government top leaders at all levels have taken the lead in the study, personally attended to it, and created a study upsurge in the whole province. The present issue is that we must conscientiously study how to deeply and continuously carry out this study, realistically regard the study of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics as one of the fundamental tasks of party committees at all levels and of all departments, and study it well. It is necessary to continuously integrate the study of Volume No.3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" with the study and implementation of the "decision" of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and at the same time, study new skills and have a good command of new knowledge. The study tasks in face of our cadres at all levels are very arduous. Without study, one cannot become a powerful leader with a sober mind, and cannot successfully carry out reform and development under the market economic conditions. Without study, one will become backward and be eliminated during the rapidly developed era. To successfully carry out study on Volume No.3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the "decision" of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and the socialist market economic knowledge among cadres at all levels, particularly cadres at and above the county level, chiefly, first of all, cadres at all levels, particularly the leading cadres, should enhance their awareness in study, try their best to reduce social intercourse at their own work posts, and set aside more time for strengthening study; second, party committees at all levels and leading party groups of all departments should resolutely adopt the method of concentrating some time for grasping the study of their central groups; and third, adopt the methods of sharing the study tasks to all levels and strive to rotationally train cadres at and above the section (township) level across the province during this year with the study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, "theory," and "decision" as the main substance. We should uphold the principle of combining theory with reality and exert efforts to apply the study to practical use. It is necessary to integrate the study with the summing up of experience of reform and development in one's own locality, department, and unit, and combine the ideology and concept with the problems in work in the course of studying how to deepen the current reform so as to provide a powerful ideological guarantee for accelerating reform and promoting development. In seeking unity of thinking, we should, through study, emphatically resolve the following several issues: First, we should firmly embrace the idea of dialectical unity among reform, development, and stability, break with the erroneous understanding of setting these three things against one another and separating them from one another, discover and resolve in a timely manner the new problems emerging in the work concerning reform, development, and stability, and make these three things coordinate and promote one another. Second, we should firmly embrace the new concepts commensurate with new circumstances, break with the outmoded ideas formed under the planned economic structure in the past, make great efforts to master the knowledge concerning the socialist market economic law, and enhance our ability of promoting the economic structural reform and accelerate the development of the socialist market economy. Third, we should firmly embrace the concept that the development of the socialist market economy is in agreement with the party's ideals, purpose, and noble moral sentiment, overcome the influence caused by money worship, hedonism, and extreme individualism, continuously temper ourselves through party spirit, and enhance our ability to resist corruption and prevent evolution. Fourth, we should firmly embrace the pioneering spirit of improving ourselves through unremitting efforts and struggling arduously, overcome such erroneous ideas as being content with small progress, maintaining what has been achieved by predecessors, fearing difficulties, and blaming everyone and everything but oneself, enhance the courage to face up with the challenges of all sorts in the course of reform and development, and serve as enthusiastic pioneers who share a common fate with reform and make contributions to reform and development. 3. We should give full play to the party's advantages in propaganda and ideological work and provide effective support by media and ideological guarantee for reform, opening up, and modernization. With the theory of building a socialism with Chinese characteristics as the fundamental principle, the party's propaganda and ideological work should be devoted to arming the people with scientific theory, to guiding the people with correct public opinions, to modeling the people with noble spirit, and to inspiring the people with excellent works. This is the overall disposition and strategic idea for strengthening propaganda and ideological work in the process of building the socialist market economic structure. It is a huge systems engineering to attain these four goals. The provincial party committee should make overall planning and work out measures to attain these four goals step by step. Party committees at all levels and the propaganda and ideological fronts should exert positive efforts in arming the people with theory, guiding the people through mass media, conducting ideological education among the people, and making culture flourishing in line with these four goals. In addition, new experiences should be summarized and created to make contributions to attaining these four goals. Now, we are precisely at the key period of building the socialist market economic structure and carrying out the four modernizations. Party committees at all levels and all propaganda and mass media departments should pay special attention to guiding the public opinion under the guidance of the overall task of "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, expanding reform, promoting development, and maintaining stability." Mass media departments should comprehensively and accurately propagate the party's basic line, principles, and policies, propagate the "decision" of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and propagate the good methods, good examples, and good experiences concerning reform, development, and stability. The people should be guided to show concern for, support, and plunge into reform, correctly handle the relations between the overall interest and the partial interest and between the long-term interest and the immediate interest, and resolutely implement the arrangements of the central authorities with a view to winning the hardest battle of reform. We should vividly and specifically propagate the province's strategy of developing the export-oriented economy to promote the overall development and the province's principles and favorable policies concerning opening up in a bid to create a good environment of media for expanding the opening up of the province. For such sensitive issues as anticorruption, commodity prices, and public security, with which the masses are concerned, press and mass media departments should show positive concern, check what is evil and advocate what is good, and treat them prudently in order to help create a good environment of mass media characterized by political and social stability. We should pay high attention to strengthening the investigation and analysis of the public opinions in society and the mental state of the masses in various fields, and then give correct guidance to and help the masses enhance understanding, unite ideas, and resolve contradictions. The party committees at various levels and their propaganda departments should further supervise, manage, and guide the press work. The mass propaganda should persistently implement the principle that literary and artistic workers should serve socialism and the people and the principle of letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend, carry forward the main melody, and advocate a variety of styles. We should concentrate main energy on upgrading quality; make the press and radio and television programs further conform to the party's line, principles, and policies; put the central link of economic construction in a prominent position; loudly play the main melody of reform; press close to the reality, the masses, and the livelihood; and make our works loved by the people. In regard to the aspect of rejuvenating socialist culture, we should pay attention to grasping the creation of literary and artistic works, the mass cultural activities, and the management of cultural markets. We should take the creation and improvement of the art of Hebei as a general target; take the implementation of the "project for ranking first in five aspects," and the launching of the campaigns of "learning from Chengde modern drama troupe, creating first-grade works, and striving for the first class" as motivation; and create a group of outstanding skilled persons and a number of artistic works reflecting the main melody of the times. The provincial party committee and the provincial government will give handsome awards to the spiritual products that produce great impacts at home and abroad. The cultural and sports activities for the masses should be regarded as an important matter and should be held annually in a well-arranged and well-planned manner so as to enhance the physical quality of the people and have the people enjoy a high level of spiritual satisfaction while resting after tense labor. The confused management of cultural markets is a prominent problem that the broad masses of the cadres and the people complain strongly about. We must be determined and exert great efforts to straighten out the cultural markets. The propaganda departments under the party committees should coordinate with the work in this regard. The cultural, radio, and press and publication departments should assume responsibilities for the management of the cultural markets. Simultaneously, the procuratorial, judicial, and security departments should make concerted and positive efforts to coordinate with the management of cultural markets. Wiping out pornography, dealing blows to unlawful activities, and straightening out cultural markets should be brought into line with the plan for comprehensively improving social order and be carried out on a responsibility basis. The party and government leaders of the localities with serious problems and the leaders of the departments in charge of the trades should first be called to account. Those who violate laws should strictly be punished according to regulations and rules but never be treated leniently. 4. We should further grasp the improvement of the ideology and work style of the party and government leading bodies and set up leading cadres' encouragement and restriction mechanisms. Through the shift of the terms of office, the readjustment of leading bodies, and the amalgamation of prefectures with cities made last year, the party and government leading bodies at various levels have effectively been strengthened. The majority of the leading bodies have a strong enterprising spirit, are able to work together with one heart, and are full of vitality. However, we must notice that some comrades lack the sense of enterprising and the sense of responsibility, are satisfied at the current situation, and lack lofty aspirations and ideals of constantly forging ahead, doing undertakings, and creating achievements. With floating work styles, some comrades are ideologically lazy and lack the spirit of working hard and solidly. In line with the actual conditions of the current leading bodies, we should take the improvement of ideology and work style as a focal point, continue to strengthen the construction of the leading bodies at various levels, pay particular attention to improving the mental outlook and unity of the leading bodies. The key to improving the mental outlook of the leading bodies hinges on accurately understanding the situation; comprehensively treating challenges and favorable opportunities; resolutely preventing and overcoming the state of being weak, fearing difficulties, and shrinking back; further mobilizing the revolutionary spirit of constantly forging ahead; and further carrying out the practice of making concerted efforts for undertakings. The key to solving the lack of coordination and unity among leading bodies is to establish and improve all systems and rules of procedure on democratic centralism, overcome arbitrariness, strictly use systems to standardize the acts of each and every member of the leading bodies, and do a good job in resolving the issue on building a party to serve the interests of the people and relying on party spirit to hold powers. With these starting and resting points, we will become selfless, open, and aboveboard, and will support and understand each other, and live in harmony. Particularly, party and government top leaders should set examples with their own conduct, serve as models for safeguarding unity among leading bodies, resolutely attend to the goal of not speaking and doing things that are disadvantageous to unity, dare to and be good at dissolving all contradictions affecting the unity of leading bodies, and enable the "leading bodies" to realistically become united leading collectives with militancy. To strengthen leading bodies and enhance their fighting capacity, we must enhance their ideology and rely on systems to guarantee the accomplishment of this work. It is necessary to establish the mechanisms of incentive and restraints for leading bodies and leading cadres. In this connection, we must establish a system and method to scientifically evaluate the performance of cadres, clarify the substance, tasks, and priorities of the evaluation work, make the evaluation work practical, and at the same time, rely on all departments, and the masses of grass-roots cadres, and make the work procedures public and democratic. Through one year of efforts, we should establish an evaluation system and the mechanisms of incentive and restraints at all levels across the province, instill a powerful impetus that "it is not realistic not to work, not to do a good job, and to do shoddy work" among leading bodies and leading cadres so that those who do well feel proud and elated and those who do a bad job feel the pressure. In the recruitment of cadres, under the premise of strictly upholding the principle on party spirit, we should give priority to promoting and placing in an important post those cadres whose achievements are proved outstanding through evaluation, or give them appropriate political treatment and material awards; regarding those cadres whose work achievements are not obvious and the achievements are average, we should give them a yellow-card warning and urge them to rectify and improve themselves with a set time limit; regarding those cadres who fail to fulfill the work targets, accomplish nothing, and have a very poor work record, we should resolutely make readjustment; and regarding those who are actually incompetent, we should demote or dismiss them. Thus, through equal competition, we may select the superior and eliminate the inferior, stimulate the broad masses of cadres to the forefront of reform, opening up, and economic construction to struggle and fight at their own work posts in the course of practice, and to participate in competition. On the issue of cadres, if a party committee fails to work this way, its cadres will not be happy, the common practice of the ranks of cadres will not be healthy, and their work will not be able to forge ahead. At present, the problems on treating cadres with a factionalist viewpoint and recruiting cadres through personal relationship and the feeling of gratitude and resentment; the problems on offering official posts, making lavish promises, and cultivating personal power; the problems on recommending cadres to the organizations in name but in fact rigidly demanding money for promotion or job arrangements for some cadres; and some unhealthy trends in the selection and recruitment of cadres, such as establishing ties and getting in by the back door to ask for an official post, have still existed in some localities and units at varying degrees. Party committees and the organization and personnel departments at all levels should resolutely resist and oppose these unhealthy trends, consciously uphold the principle of judging cadres by their party spirit and recruiting cadres according to their actual achievements, be just and upright, not sticking to one pattern, select the wise and use the competent, and boldly promote and recruit cadres who have ability and political integrity. It is necessary to expose and criticize those who appoint people by favoritism and for the sake of getting profits, and get by the back door to ask for a post, and punish in line with party and administrative discipline those who fail to correct themselves after repeated education and whose cases are serious. Meanwhile, through deepening reform of the cadre personnel system, we should accelerate the establishment of a set of mechanisms and systems for evaluating and recruiting cadres that fit the socialist market economic structure and effectively prevent unhealthy trends in the selection and recruitment of personnel. 5. Guidance should differ according to different cases, give prominence to priorities, and conscientiously build the party's grass-roots organizations well. Implementation of the party's line, principles, policies, and tasks, ultimately, depends on the party's grass-roots organizations which should play their role as political cores and fighting bastions and depends on the more than 3 million communist party members in Hebei who should play their leading and exemplary role so that they can lead the vast number of cadres and the masses to work indomitably. However, many grass-roots organizations of the party, especially those in rural areas, have failed to successfully perform their role, which has seriously affected the implementation of the party's principles, policies, and various tasks. Party committees at all levels should have firm determination and exert great efforts to realistically improve and strengthen the party's grass-roots organizations and build them into a good and solid foundation. Improvement of the party organizations in rural areas and those in enterprises are two major tasks, and great efforts should be exerted to make them successful. In rural areas, we should give different guidance according to different cases, with the focus on achieving a fairly comfortable life. First, we should successfully consolidate and improve advanced party branches and enable them to lead the masses to achieve a fairly comfortable life ahead of others. We should also earnestly summarize their experiences and use their typical cases as examples. Localities where conditions permit may also adopt the method of mergence, allowing advanced villages to merge some backward villages. Second, we should do a good job in transforming backward party branches and make particular efforts to tackle the problems of those whose work is stagnant or partly stagnant. In some cases, we may assign leading cadres to hold the responsibility for guiding some villages or assign relevant departments or advanced villages to provide assistance and support to help backward party branches improve their own quality, develop their collective economy, and enhance their unity and combat strength. In others, counties and townships may send work teams to villages to help them select party branch secretaries, establish party branch leading bodies, accurately select the roads to affluence, and start the steps of development. In still others, counties and townships may directly send cadres to assume posts in villages, who will organize the leading bodies, select the road of development, and leave after the villages achieve a fairly comfortable life and village cadres are selected. Town and township are the foundation and the county party committee is the key to conscientiously carrying out rural party building. County and township party committees should regard the above-mentioned work as the most important task in party building, work out specific plans for it, and clarify the targets and measures so that this big, difficult, and long-standing problem can be solved well. The establishment of the modern enterprise system and the rapid development of shareholding enterprises, enterprise groups, foreign-funded enterprises, private enterprises, and urban and rural collective enterprises have put forward many new questions and new demands on improvement of grass-roots party organizations. We should have the courage to probe into the new ideas for enterprises' party building to conform to this situation in line with the criterion of "three advantages" and with the spirit of reform. Organization departments, together with other relevant departments, should actively participate in state-owned enterprises' experiment with the establishment of the modern enterprise system and explore the position, functions, role, and styles and methods of activities of enterprise party organizations under the modern enterprise system. They should also conduct in-depth investigation and study and put forward specific opinions on how the various types of nonstate-owned enterprises establish party organizations, carry out activities, and play their role. The general demand is that all economic organizations should strengthen party building boldly, those without party organizations should actively create favorable conditions to build party organizations, and those which have already established party organizations should standardize their position and functions, actively carry out the party's work, and give play to the party organizations' due role. When building new enterprises in the future, party organizations should be established simultaneously; when the enterprises' administrative bodies are established, the bodies for party affairs should also be established simultaneously; and when production and operation start, the party's activities should also start simultaneously. Leading party groups of institutions of higher learning should fully understand the historical duties they shoulder, actually strengthen the ideological and political work among college students and teachers, young teachers in particular, strengthen the building of party branches of departments of colleges, and continue to develop and expand the ranks of party members. The vast numbers of teachers, students, and administrative staff of colleges should be educated and guided to foster correct outlook on life and outlook on value and to combine their personal fates with the destiny and future of the motherland. These leading party groups should also correctly approach the current situation and the series of major policy decisions of the CPC Central Committee in an effort to make positive contributions to safeguarding social stability, maintaining the campus stability, and promoting reform and development. 6. We should profoundly and persistently launch the anticorruption campaign, closely integrate the building of party style and the improvement of administrative honesty with reform and development, and make them promote each other. In accelerating the establishment of the socialist market economic structure, party committees and governments at all levels should all the more attach importance to building party style and improving administrative honesty and should oppose all sorts of corrupt phenomena in a sustained, resolute, and unremitting manner by regarding the opposition as the basic condition for ensuring the smooth progress of reform and development and as a basic task on party building and on the building of political power. Practice has incontrovertibly proved that the opposition to corruption has not hampered the development of reform, opening up, and economic development but has vigorously promoted the constant development of economic construction and enabled the province to set a record high in all major economic targets last year. It is wrong to set the anticorruption campaign against reform, opening up, and economic development. We should clearly notice, however, that corrupt phenomena have not yet been resolved and the anticorruption tasks remain very arduous. Therefore, we should on no account lower our guard and become careless. In line with the guidelines of the third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, in close combination with the realities of Hebei, and based on the already scored achievements, we should launch the anticorruption campaign in a profound, sustained, and more effective manner in order to make new progress continuously. Party committees and governments at all levels should, like they did in the second half of last year, make their principal party and government leaders personally take a hand in anticorruption work, make party and government organs grasp the work in coordination by proceeding from their own units. This work should be grasped level by level, with each assuming responsibility for its own work. All fields from higher to lower levels should act together in line with the unified arrangements and dispositions of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, the provincial party committee, and the provincial government in order to win the general war. This year's anticorruption campaign should be continuously focused on the three tasks, as defined by the central authorities, of making leading cadres honest, clean, and self-disciplined in performing official duties, investigating and dealing with major and appalling cases, and correcting unhealthy trends. To truly achieving success in these three tasks and to truly and profoundly launching the anticorruption campaign until results are achieved, the key lies in the administrative honesty and self-discipline of leading cadres. "The rain is leaking in the ground of the house, but the leaking must be plugged in the ceiling." If a leading cadre fails in maintaining administrative honesty and in being strict with himself, he will lose the basic condition for organizing and guiding his locality and unit to oppose corruption. Being dishonest and even corrupt, a leading cadre will seriously deviate from the masses, lose the support of the people, lose the right of leadership, and, finally, ruin himself. Being honest and self- disciplined, a leading cadre will talk with perfect assurance and have the cohesive force in opposing corruption and advocating administrative honesty. Therefore, party committees at all levels and leading party groups of all departments should actually pay attention to the administrative honesty and self-discipline of leading cadres and resolve and correct problems in a timely manner whenever they are found. This year, in encouraging leading cadres to maintain administrative honesty and to be self-disciplined, we should conduct comparison, examination, and correction in line with the "five regulations" defined by the third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission and with the problem of infringing upon the interests of enterprises. In addition, we should look back on the implementation of the "five regulations" set forth by the central authorities at the preceding stage and the "ten forbiddens" set forth by the provincial party committee, and then make continued efforts to resolve problems. Leading cadres of enterprises and institutions should also be honest in performing official duties and being self-disciplined, abide by disciplines and laws, oppose all sorts of negative and corrupt phenomena, such as abusing powers to seek personal gain, embezzling public funds, accepting bribes, and spending without restraint. Leading bodies at all levels should hold democratic activity meetings to conduct conscientious self-examination and self-correction based on sufficient preparations and on a unified time limit. Principal responsible comrades of the party committees at various levels should have the daring to make strict checks. The discipline inspection and supervisory departments at various levels should achieve supervision and examination and avoid doing their work perfunctorily. The practice and activities that are forbidden in the five new regulations of the central authorities and those violating the interests of the enterprises should stop immediately. The problems with clear lines of demarcation should be corrected in the course of examinations according to the five new regulations. We should examine the problems without clear lines of demarcation before handling them. The functional departments under the party committees and governments at various levels should assume dual responsibilities in the struggle against corruption. On the one hand, they should be administratively honest and self-disciplined and consciously correct their dishonest activities; on the other hand, they should realistically grasp the correction of the unhealthy practice within their departments. Most of the problems within trades are connected with the business activities of the trade departments. All departments at the provincial level should actually assume responsibility, guide the improvement of the contingents of the trades, and improve the work style of the trades. As for the departments and trades with serious unhealthy practice, that the people have strong complaints, and with failure to correct their unhealthy practice, their leaders should first be called to account. By the end of the year, we should mobilize the cadres and the masses across the province to make a general assessment of the work styles of the trades, select the best and the worst through the assessment, commend those with achievements, and investigate and affix the responsibility of the worst. In opposing corruption, we should persistently treat the problems by looking into both the root causes and symptoms and pay attention to both penalty and prevention. We should not only resolutely investigate and handle unlawful and undisciplined cases but also solve the deep-layered problems relating to systems and policies. We should attend to both "opposition" and "construction" so as to gradually set up a mechanism of ending corruption that is suitable to the market economic system. All levels and all departments, particularly law enforcement departments and the personnel at the posts directly in charge of personnel, financial, and material affairs should set up a mechanism to effectively restrict and guard against the activities of abusing power for selfish ends, set up and perfect a system that the people from higher levels downward supervise one another, and bring into play the supervisory functions of the laws, the party discipline, the administrative procedures, and the masses. We should strengthen the study of policies; pay attention to discovering the imperfect aspects and existing problems in the course of implementing specific policies, management systems, and regulations and methods; sum up experiences; draw lessons; and set forth opinions on solving problems. It is necessary to resolutely implement the central regulations on separating administrative charges from the income from fines and confiscations. The provincial financial department should firmly attend to working out methods for implementing the regulations and strive to thoroughly solve the problems in this regard by the end of this year. 7. We should realistically strengthen the work of the united front work department of the party, unite with all the forces that can be united, and serve the safeguarding of social and political stability and the promoting of modernization. Along with the deepening of reform and opening up, the gradual setup of the socialist market economic system, and the readjustment and changes of the social economic structure, the united front work department of the party has expanded its work from the political sphere to various social spheres, including the economic, cultural, and scientific and technological spheres; from large cities to small ones; from higher layers to the grass roots; and from the province to the places at home and abroad. This grand united front worker contingent has the advantages of having intensive knowledge, higher layers, wide contacts, many domestic and overseas friends. So, it is an extremely precious force in the province's modernization. In front of the new situation where the scale of the united front is ceaselessly expanded, the number of its targets continues to increase, and its tasks continue to become heavier, the party committees at various levels should further upgrade their understanding about the important positions and functions of the united front in the new age, enhance the ideas about the united front, grasp and apply this magic weapon, and have it become a powerful motivation to safeguard and develop the political situation characterized by stability and unity and to promote the economic construction and all social undertakings. The party committees and governments at various levels should positively encourage and support members of the organizations of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, members of the democratic parties, and non-party personages to conduct activities of investigating and studying the major issues of reform, opening up, spiritual and material civilizations, and the people's livelihood to achieve the inspection and motions work and to have them realistically participate in and discuss political affairs; should conscientiously and fully consult with personages of democratic parties and nonparty personages before the promulgation of major policy decisions; and should accurately treat their opinions and suggestions to make the policy decisions more suitable to the objective reality and to avoid making mistakes. We should pay attention to arranging jobs, particularly real jobs, for the personages outside the party, including democratic party personages, and ensure that they have both jobs and rights. Simultaneously, we should continue to encourage the personages who have contacts with democratic parties and the united front to bring into play their role as a go-between in bringing in foreign capital; to establish close contacts with overseas large financial groups, large enterprises, large monetary organizations, and well-known personages; to do more concrete deeds in the aspect of bringing in foreign capital; and to make more contributions to implementing the provincial strategy of promoting the development of the export- oriented economy and expanding the scale of opening up. We should strengthen the work toward the intellectuals, be concerned about and improve the working and living conditions of the intellectuals, and vigorously encourage and support a part of intellectuals to work at civilian-run enterprises, civilian-run educational organizations, and civilian-run scientific research institutions or to take the lead in running civilian-run enterprises and institutions so as to bring into full play their wisdom, intelligence, and sacrificing spirit. We should bring into full play the united front's peculiar functions for coordination and alleviating contradictions and create a stable and united political environment for reform, opening up, and economic construction. We should pay attention to having the personages on the united front to disseminate reform among the masses whom they are able to contact with, to help get rid of their doubts about the new contradictions and new problems cropping up in the course of reform, and to have the personages of all circles understand and support various reform measures. Our province has comparatively more minority nationalities and heavier religious tasks. So, we should guide and unite with both believers and the masses without beliefs to develop production and to take the path of seeking common wealth. We should comprehensively and accurately implement the party's policies toward religions. We should not only respect the freedom of religions and beliefs and protect normal religious activities but also strengthen the management of religious affairs and ban and deal blows to various activities of committing crimes in the name of religions so as to mobilize the broad masses of believers' patriotic enthusiasm and to make contributions to safeguarding social stability and promoting economic development. 8. We should realistically strengthen the leadership over propaganda, organizational, discipline inspection, and united front work and create a new situation in the work in various aspects. Propaganda, organizational, discipline inspection, and united front work are great matters that should be attended to by the party committees. Strengthening the leadership of the party committees is the key deciding the fact that whether or not the work in these aspects can form a new momentum in the new age and whether or not a new situation can be created. The party committees at various levels should take the overall situation into consideration, be sure that the party should administer party affairs, and persist in the principle of taking a two-hand approach and be sure that both hands are tough. At the time of continuously strengthening the leadership over the economic work, we should realistically grasp the propaganda, organizational, discipline inspection, and united front work; and have these fronts accurately and positively bring their functions into play in the course of implementing the basic line of the party, realizing the work of the party, and building Hebei into an economically powerful province. As they attend to economic work, party committees should also strictly apply the system of responsibility for management by objective to these aspects of work. Party committees at all levels should consider and plan for economic development, reform, opening up, and propaganda, organizational, discipline inspection, and united front work in an all-around manner. After collective study, they should also specify the tasks of propaganda, organizational, discipline inspection, and united front work as they do economic tasks, quantify the tasks as much as possible, and then clarify the responsibilities and assign tasks for every member of leading bodies and all relevant departments to fulfill within a definite time. Fulfillment of these tasks should be included in the annual targets for which pertinent leaders and departments are responsible and be appraised at the end of the year. The results of the appraisal should become an important criterion for judging the performance of leading cadres and the work level of the entire leading bodies. Efforts should be made to improve the work departments and cadres' contingents of party committees to upgrade their overall quality. Contingents of cadres who are politically strong, professionally competent, and honest and upright in work styles should be established. We should intensify ideological education. We should educate cadres to correctly treat fame and gain under the condition of the market economy based on party spirit and the spirit of respect for work characterized by selfless devotion and faithfulness to duties so as to enhance their awareness of the mission and sense of responsibility. We should make active efforts to create favorable conditions and adopt various measures, such as selecting cadres to conduct advanced study and sending cadres to other localities for observation activities or conduct investigation and study, to help the contingents of cadres further emancipate their minds, update their ideas, broaden their field of vision, enrich their knowledge, correct their thinking and work that are incompatible with the new situation and new tasks, and increase their skills for their own work. These contingents should be improved organizationally. For the leading posts in the departments, we should select a number of comrades who have both political integrity and abilities, are in the prime of life, have undergone the training of grass-roots work, know both politics and economy, and have pioneering and realistic spirit. Cadres of propaganda, organization, discipline inspection, and united front work departments, on the premise that they are kept relatively stable, may also be exchanged with the cadres in charge of economic work so that they can learn from each other's strong points to offset their weaknesses and enhance their vigor. We should change work styles, go deep into grass-roots levels, and summarize new experiences and work out new ideas in the process to continuously understand new conditions and address new problems. Following the in-depth development of the reform designed to establish the socialist market economy system, the party will encounter many new conditions in its own building and various work and need to step up efforts and devote time to study, explore, and address them. Party committees at all levels and leaders of propaganda, organization, discipline inspection, and united front work departments should organize personnel, devote time, and go down to grass-roots levels to conduct investigation and study of the new conditions and new issued that have cropped up and map out methods to address them. We should enable the various work of party committees to suit the needs of reform and development in a more timely and effective manner and enable party committees to make greater contributions to the grand cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the endeavor of building an economically strong province.
