FR940512-1-00039 FR940512-1-00010 The proposed limitations on the use of restricted contributions to meet a State's matching requirement would ensure that the services and benefits that are provided under a program funded with 90 percent Federal money would be available to an eligible individual without regard to the individual's relationship to the donor. The proposed limitations also would ensure that an eligible applicant that is unable to contribute the State's share of expenditures for the program would not be disqualified from receiving a grant, subgrant, or contract under the program. To allow a State to condition the award of a grant, subgrant, or contract on the recipient's contribution of the State's matching requirement would be tantamount to allowing the State to impose additional eligibility requirements to participate in the program. This action would contradict 34 CFR 76.770(g), which prohibits a State from acting in any manner that prevents eligible applicants from applying under the program. Finally, the proposed limitations on the use of restricted contributions to meet a State's matching requirement also are intended to prevent the sale of grants, subgrants, or contracts by the States to the highest bidder. ED has always required, unless directed by law to do otherwise, that the award of grants, subgrants, or contracts by States be made under a fair competitive process that is free from favoritism on the assumption that fair competition will result in the best qualified applicant receiving the grant, subgrant, or contract. To allow a State to award a grant, subgrant, or contract on the basis of the amount that the eligible applicant can contribute to the State's matching requirement would be inconsistent with the advantages that ED has always presumed result from fair competition. Proposed ยง365.16 would implement the requirements in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars A&hyph;87 and A&hyph;122 that the following must be treated as a reduction of expenditures charged to the grant, subgrant, or contract awarded under part 365 and may not be used for meeting the State's matching requirement: Rebates, deductions, refunds, discounts, or reductions to the price of goods, products, equipment, rental property, real property, or services; and premiums, bonuses, gifts, and any other payments related to the purchase of goods, products, equipment, rental property, real property, or services.
