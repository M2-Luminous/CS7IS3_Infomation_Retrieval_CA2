We are a nation of 900 million people, living in an age where unprecedented changes have taken place and like other large populated countries such as China we have to find the "Indian remedy" to play a more meaningful part in global affairs. The last few years have been traumatic and the changes, both political and economic, in the global order mean a realistic change in our political and economic thinking. It would be fatal to delink the two or to think that we can take an isolated stand on global issues. There are no simplistic solutions, no magic formulae; hard assessments and firm decisions will be necessary. The break-up of the Soviet Union, the winds of change in Eastern Europe to a democratic system, the growing problems and the great economic hardship in Cuba and North Korea, the emergence of the United States as the sole superpower, must necessarily mean new political alignments. There are no premiums on conflicts, and it should be no surprise that peace, economic development and prosperity will be the challenges of the future. We have peace in South Africa. Both Mr. de Klerk and Mr. Nelson Mandela richly deserve the Nobel Peace Prize. We have peace in West Asia, the PLO and Israel, North and South Korea are talking; the British Government is looking towards the end of the conflict in Ireland. On the economic front we have witnessed the emergence of large trading blocs. The United States, Canada and Mexico have taken a significant step forward on NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement). The European concept of a single entity is slowly but surely becoming a reality. Japan and the Pacific rim are becoming areas of high growth and prosperity. China has emerged as a major economic power. At the same time cyclic changes and a "peaceful environment" have created a recession in the developed nations. The economic chaos in Russia and the new States, the monetary crisis in Eastern Europe, the perilous situation in Africa, and the Third World living on borrowed funds, are all looking for better days. All economic indicators are showing that the future lies in Asia--the Chinese economy is booming, so is Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. Japan despite a recession continues to generate record surpluses. In a difficult situation it is only natural that economic reform and the dismantling of controls will be the objective of the developing reforms. Investigation in the current recession will only flow to high growth areas. The U.S. President, Mr. Clinton's success on NAFTA made it almost certain that the agreement on GATT would follow and despite the usual brinkmanship to satisfy local political pressures, the agreement was signed. The Third World will sadly suffer and suffer because its economic clout is minimal. In the future there will be furious competition to draw investments from financial institutions and countries. India will compete with the others for its share and it will not be easy. India's relevance as a political power and an economic entity is being closely monitored by the global community and future success and failure will largely be determined by our own internal strength and achievement. Self-reliance was the slogan and the driving point of Panditji's policy and it is with gratitude that we must acknowledge that the cumulative wisdom of our past leaders has provided us with the infrastructure to deal with the future not only in terms of industrial capacity but also in the creation of the world's third largest technical manpower. Comparisons are unfair, but perhaps it would be relevant to mention that China has never indulged in vilification of its past. The reform process did not follow the World Bank manual but rather relied on a "local formula" for implementation. The world today is seeking China both for investment and trading. China with its population and industrial growth will be one of the largest consuming countries for a variety of products. The key factor in its success was that reforms benefited the vast majority of its population. The world and the business community look towards India for political stability for its existing Government and more important for a continuation of its democratic structure. Military dictatorships and totalitarian regimes have a tendency to give an impression of firmness and stability, but in the long term tend to degenerate into a chaotic and uncertain future. The past decade in India has not been an easy one. We have witnessed two tragic assassinations. We have seen the forces of caste and religion dominate our electoral stage. We have witnessed serious law and order situations. We have seen four Governments come and go. We have survived all these traumas and it is to the credit of our people that they have continuously reaffirmed their adherence to democratic institutions and to a secular future. To predict national trends for the general elections on the basis of current election results will require the services of an eminent astrologer. The possibility of mid-term elections is now no longer a reality after the recent events. The Congress(I), generally expected to do little, won handsomely in Madhya Pradesh and Himachal. The BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] after the dismissal of its Government was expected to retain the States where it was in power and it was tactically natural for it to fight a high profile election and advance its claims for the general elections. The loss in Madhya Pradesh and Himachal was a disaster, but the failure to form a Government in Uttar Pradesh, was calamitous. In Rajasthan it barely won. The Delhi victory was spectacular. The Janata Dal predictably simply ceased to exist. On the surface the Congress(I) and the Prime Minister are the big winners. The BJP has suffered a serious setback, and the Janata Dal is hurting towards self destruction. The regional forces gaining firm roots in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, the North-East, Bihar and Orissa have made a historic gain with Uttar Pradesh and Mr. Mulayam Singh. Between 1994 and the general elections there will be State elections in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Bihar. To predict winners and losers at this stage would be presumptuous. The policy initiatives however cannot be put off as a strategy for the future must evolve. The Congress(I) and the Prime Minister will have to determine if the party is strong enough to emerge with a simple majority. Both in 1989 and 1991 the dismal results in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar denied the party the success it sought and the position there now is perilous. An alliance with Mr. Mulayam Singh or Mr. Lallu Yadav may work in the short term but the future implications could be catastrophic. Ram Manohar Lohia prevailing over the Nehruvian concept could have a snow-balling effect. The Congress traditionally looks to the future. The Congress(I) became the Congress(R) when Rajiv Gandhi became Prime Minister and now it is Congress (PVNR) [P.V. Narasimha Rao]. Sheer logic indicates that the Prime Minister would have to pursue an independent course of action if he is to lead the party in 1996 and avoid dissident activity in the immediate future. The failure in Uttar Pradesh cannot be attributed to the Prime Minister, but the coming Andhra Assembly elections will be a key factor in determining his capacity to lead. The Janata Dal will claim all-India status but is primarily confined to Orissa and Bihar, both States run by charismatic leaders who will now ponder over their future course of action. The party has ceased to exist in Uttar Pradesh and in the coming months the party or what is left of it will continue to splinter. Mr. Ajit Singh may once again decide to support the Congress(I) in a "principled" stand. The National Front has a bleak future but NTR [N.T. Rama Rao] in Andhra, Mr. Biju Patnaik in Orissa, Mr. Lallu Yadav in Bihar have a strong regional base and will naturally protect their interests. Fortunately the projected caste war has not come about and as the BJP may realise governance is the key issue. Caste and religion in their ugliest proportions have created a limited following. But the vast majority of the electorate have opted for governance and in Uttar Pradesh where the decline, almost total eclipse of the Congress(I) and the Janata Dal has given limited opportunities, the results have been splintered. The biggest State with 85 seats has gone into a state of uncertainty. The new year is coming and with it must come the optimism of a better and brighter future. The future rests with all of us. We are a nation of 900 millions. We have the ability. We have the talent. We have the determination and will to succeed. The cumulative wisdom of India does not lie in the Cabinet or in the hands of the few. Everyone has a single vote and it is this power that determines victory and defeat. Victory cannot lie in the twin evils of caste and religion. The lessons of history indicate that we were enslaved for a thousand years because of these contradictions. There can be no future for India unless there is economic prosperity and growth. These are the global issues and challenges and it is to this direction that we must channel our vast reservoirs of talent.
