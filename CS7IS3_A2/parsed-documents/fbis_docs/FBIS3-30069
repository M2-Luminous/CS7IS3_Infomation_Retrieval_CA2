Government spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa says the defense minister has explained the thinking behind the principle and ways and means to proceed in arms deals. Mr. Aphisit says only major arms purchases will be subject to barter trade policy. He says the government does not intend to interfere in regular operation of the Armed Forces and small purchases will not have to be negotiated. Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri says the Armed Forces' plan to buy transport planes from Italy has to be delayed until Italy has a new government. Deputy Minister of Commerce Chaiyot Sasomsap also says the armed forces should ask Italy to remain committed to the quota prices until April as there will be a trade meeting between the two countries next month. He expects the meeting to be beneficial to the arms deal as well. Deputy Minister Chaiyot says his ministry has invited the Thai Chamber of Commerce and the Federation of Thai Industries to consult on trade measures and cooperation with Italy on February 24.
