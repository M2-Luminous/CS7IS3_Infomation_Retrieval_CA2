[end editor's note] As a general rule, people go into business using as a basis their own experiences and what they have learned from others. With certain assurances, they then risk their own money or someone else's. Very few run their business according to what teachers have told them. Even fewer seek advice from politicians. This is because what teachers and politicians can offer in the way of advice is already taken for granted -- it is a constant factor in economic activity. Competent entrepreneurs are those who utilise their foresight and judgement in that domain of uncertainty, or who fall upon good luck (and achieve success). From a different point of view, the more fixed and guaranteed the economic and legal system, the smaller the domain of risk. Such an environment safeguards not only the income of employees but also the profits of entrepreneurs and traders. Since entrepreneurs can devote time and energy to a smaller area of changeability, their efficiency quota will be higher and their luck can improve, even though not everyone will strike it rich. The history of developed countries is a good example. Crosscountry comparisons do not easily give simple, clear and explanatory analysis because they are confused by many factors including different cultural backgrounds, historical geography, resource circumstances and even the number of people. Some academics prefer the most complex approach and the most dubious answer because that helps increase attention paid to their works and puts off critics (readers confused by the superfluous and boring works will find it just as hard to understand what the critics are saying). But businessmen and politicians tend to state and solve problems only in the simplest and clearest way in order to avoid missing an opportunity. I can sum up simply: By comparing people at different levels, the benefits of the people (businessmen included) will be secured and the competency of businessmen will be increased, since in any country, as the standard of the authority and the justice in the legal system of all countries is improved, the rights of the people will be better guaranteed, and their economic capabilities enhanced. I do believe that businessmen have different degrees of talent and this may have no relation to educational attainment, because the one who gets the highest grades will not necessarily be the winner in the world of business. Consider for a moment the developmental history of other countries, which makes it clear no country or society can dispense with legal protections or economic environment standards if it is to upgrade its economy. This is an important issue for investors to consider. Anyone who does not believe this, need only look back on their own country's development history or consult a veteran businessman who has experienced this history. Most of them would agree with my simple conclusion here. But in no circumstances should you consult the professor who has written many volumes of academic writings. If you do, I doubt you will ever reach the correct conclusion. Most people, unlike the professor, would find it difficult to avoid fainting under the weight of tedious and cliched conjecture. What I have been discussing here is directly relevant to the current investment environment in China. This explains why China -- a nation which has considerable business experience -- has not produced many successful businessmen or companies. The reason is that the economic environment in China lacks the constant factors that are so prevalent in the West, and it does not have an effective and fair legal environment. It has nothing to do with any supposed shortage of talent or lack of desire to get rich. Some Western businessmen arrogantly claim "China does not protect the property of its own people from encroachment, but it does protect property owned by foreigners". There are also some smooth talkers in the Chinese government who are offering guarantees to everyone, saying: "Although China's economic environment is not perfect, the Chinese government provides preferential conditions to foreigners," and so on. I think people who say things like this are tricksters, or at least they lack judgement and foresight. If you invest your own money or that of others on the basis of their poor judgement, it is certain the risks will be several times greater than for an investment in your own country: This is because most people make judgements conditioned by their experiences in their own countries. So it is certain that someone will be cheated. Just as some people accustomed to the affluent lifestyles in the West cannot imagine how Chinese people survive on an income of less than US$100 a year, managers and businessmen who are used to legal protection find it difficult to estimate risks in a society like China where there is no legal protection. In fact, if I were to make a list of the contingencies you would face, it would be as long as the writings of the professors. I can only tell you this: In a situation where you are protected, then it is easy for you to know what that protection is; but when you are not protected, you will find it very difficult to know what risks you may face. Logic would suggest that any government that fails to provide an adequate economic environment for its citizens while, at the same time, offering preferential treatment to foreigners is treating its citizens unfairly. The citizens of this country will not put up with such unfair treatment for long. They will use every means to change this situation. We know from history that at times of great social change, unfair phenomena can easily change to the opposite extreme. That is, while it is the Chinese citizens who are treated unfairly, in the future it may be the foreigner. There are numerous instances over the past century which illustrate this. This is particularly so in situations where foreigners have participated in the exploitation and oppression of local citizens, and more so when this oppression and exploitation drives the majority of people to anger past reason. Even a great and powerful politician would have no choice but to give way to this kind of deep, popular emotion of revenge. The Chinese people are a rational race, but other people must be rational as well. The Chinese, moreover, always look down on unscrupulous businessmen who are concerned only with profit. The main problem with investing in China, therefore is that what is needed first of all is a political investment. This would not only be helpful to the Chinese people, but would allow foreign businessmen to create a favorable economic environment for themselves, and contribute to protecting the economic interests of all. The potential of China's vast market is very seductive. But if investors fail to invest in helping the rational forces of democratic reform, and instead leave China's fate in the hands of reactionary autocrats or other unpredictable elements, then this is not merely harmful to the interests of the Chinese people. It is also harmful to the interests of the businessmen who have invested in the China market themselves. Because it doesn't matter what passport you hold; when you are operating in China you have become a part of the Chinese economic system -- a passport has no validity in the market. You may be thinking like many Chinese private entrepreneurs: "Take advantage of the situation while the communist party hasn't got on to me, make a bundle quick and then get out." If you do this you may be able to make a great deal of dirty money. But I warn you to make sure you get out at the right time. Don't get your feet so stuck in the mud that you can't pull them out.
