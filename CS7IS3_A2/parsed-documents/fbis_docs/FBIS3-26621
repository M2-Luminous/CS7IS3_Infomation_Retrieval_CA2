This shows that the authorities intend to turn into legal measures all the decisions concerning the property rights reform of state-owned enterprises, so as to enable state-owned enterprises to develop according to the rules of the market economy, and to incorporate themselves (relying mainly on the legal person property rights of the board of directors) together with collective enterprises, joint ventures, and solely owned enterprises. It has been learned that this "Company Law" was first drafted as early as 1983. However, the draft gave rise to many controversies and thus was difficult to fulfill. It was only after the CPC adopted a resolution on the property rights reform of state-owned enterprises and on shifting the country's economy into the orbit of the market economy at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee last year that this "Company Law," which had remained a draft for as long as 10 years, finally could make a public appearance and be put into effect. Although there is a total of more than 1.8 million state-owned enterprises on the mainland, they are all under one "boss," that is, the central government. All state-owned enterprises, large or small, are subject to the jurisdiction of different government departments or of different governments at the provincial and city levels. Despite previous efforts to delegate greater autonomy to the lower levels, make concessions of profit, and enliven enterprises, no fundamental improvements have been made to the essence of the mandatory planned economy. Only by dividing "large-scale state-owned enterprises" into thousands and thousands of economic units that rely mainly on independent legal person status and act according to the rules of the market economy can there be any possibility to set up a modern enterprise system. The "Company Law" is meant to suit the needs of such property rights reform. Under the modern enterprise system, enterprises are clear about property rights relations and can adopt the system of registered capital, separate themselves from administrative organs, and be independent and responsible for their own profits and losses. By so doing, these enterprises can enjoy the property rights of a legal person, and can divide, transfer, and reorganize an enterprise's property rights. Explicit stipulations have been set out in the "Company Law" on many issues, including the establishment and organizational structure of limited-liability companies and joint-stock limited companies, corporate financial and accounting systems, merger or division of companies, and the acquisition of bankrupt companies. According to the stipulations of the "Company Law," a registered company should have its own shareholders board, a Board of Directors, and a supervisory committee. All decisions on major issues should go through collective discussions. For example, a joint-stock enterprise needs its Board of Directors to act as a guarantee if it wants to obtain a loan by placing its total assets in mortgage. At times when controversies arise, the chairman of the Board of Directors has the power to rule on the matter and so avoid endless disputes. Candidates for senior managers will no longer be recommended by enterprise leaders and appointed by personnel departments; instead, open placement tests will be given and only the best will be recruited, thus ensuring that senior posts will not be offered or accepted privately, and that able personnel will not be left out in the cold. The "Company Law" also stipulates that evaluations must be made on the investment in kind of a registered company, and that the ownership and operational rights of the company should be separate. In addition, penalties also have been set out on law-breakers which will help check the growth of speculative and renamed companies. As a matter of fact, a large number of privately run speculative companies have emerged in recent years which are engaged in falsifying registered capital, investment, and investment acceptance; in reselling at a profit; as well as speculation in real estates and stocks through illegal means. Property rights relations in many renamed companies, which originally belonged to state-owned enterprises, are unclear, and their ownership and operational rights are mixed up. As a result, such companies "use official power when carrying out commercial activities," and thus can monopolize certain trades and industries. Some companies collect funds and issue stocks and bonds in an arbitrary manner, and their organizational structure and management system are so confused that they need to undergo a thorough rectification. The stipulations set out in the "Company Law" regarding the amount paid in by registered companies and on the evaluation of the assets, debts, and risks of registered companies will play a significant role in preventing the emergence of all the above-mentioned malpractices. According to expert analysis, unlike Russia's corporate legal system, which takes to the road of privatization, the corporate legal system being established on the mainland is aimed at turning state-owned enterprises into popularly run ones. This is because after enterprises are incorporated, more than 50 percent of the shares will remain in the hands of the "Share Holding Committee for State-Owned Assets," and the government still will be the biggest shareholder. At present, Mainland China is exploring the "marketization of the socialist economy" along the road of incorporating state-owned enterprises, and has avoided the road taken by Russia, which is based on the narrow sense of privatization. Without doubt, the mainland's practice of the "Company Law" inevitably will lead to a series of changes in both the personnel and management systems, and probably will encounter the obstruction of those with vested interests. This is because people are used to enjoying authority, and they will be at a loss or will act defiantly once they foresee the loss of their authority. Therefore, contradictions are unavoidable.
