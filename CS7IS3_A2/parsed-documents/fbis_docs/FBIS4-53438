The government understands that the banks decided to suspend the remittances for operational reasons, he said. The United States urged Japan last month to regulate the flow of hard currencies to North Korea, which is suspected of using the funds to promote a clandestine nuclear weapons program. It is not known how much money is remitted to North Korea from Japan, but trade and banking sources estimate the sum at 60 billion yen a year, including trade bills. Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito denied at a scheduled evening press meeting that his ministry gave any instructions to Ashikaga Bank to stop the remittances. Asked if he has confirmed that with the bank, Saito said the ministry's Banking Bureau had no idea about it when he contacted the bureau, and added that he has not heard anything further.
