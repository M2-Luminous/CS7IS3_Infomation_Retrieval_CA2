After four days of intensive talks in Washington, held under strong U.S. diplomatic pressure, especially on Croatia, the accord was signed by Foreign Minister Mate Granic for Croatia, Premier Haris Silajdzic for Bosnian Moslems and Bosnian Croat leader Kresimir Zubak for the Croats, in the presence of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Some questions, notably those in the military sphere, have been left open and are shortly to be put on the agenda. The former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina is being torn apart by a civil and ethnic war which broke out nearby two years ago among the local Moslems, Serbs and Croats. The accord guarantees repatriation and restoration of property to all refugees and displaced persons. The agreement between the Moslems and Croats envisages for a federation of cantons, to be formed on the principle of ethnic majority in individual regions. The document, the contents of which have not been disclosed, provides for equal rights of the Moslem and Croat cantons which should have their own police force and pursue an independent policy in education, culture, housing, (?public) works and radio and television. The accord envisages for a central government which should regulate the foreign, defence and foreign trade policies. The president and vice-president of the federation should be elected by a bicameral parliament, with the posts rotated between the nationalities annually. Apart from setting up a Moslem-Croat federation, the accord envisages for the new state's confederation with Croatia. It defines March 15 as the deadline for formulating a draft constitution of the new state and the modalities of its confederation with Croatia. After the signing ceremony, Christopher said that the United States and the Western allies would make every effort for the accord to be implemented in practice and promised to assist Bosnian reconstruction financially. Moslem Premier Silajdzic said he was "hoping and praying" this was the first step in the direction of peace and that the United States would remain actively involved in the peace process in the future. The U.S. Administration hopes as the next stage to put pressure on Bosnian Serbs to join the new bilateral federation, although government circles are less than optimistic as to the chances of this. Washington hopes that the concept of a dual state would make it possible for the Moslems to retain, at least partially, the integrity of Bosnia, enlarge the territory under their control, give them access to the sea and create a strong negotiating (and, possibly military) bloc against the Serbs in the next stage.
