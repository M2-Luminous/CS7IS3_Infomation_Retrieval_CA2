FBIS4-53681 "dreas099_a_94017" FBIS-EAS-94-099 Daily Report 20 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Monju Nuclear Reactor Fully Loaded With Fuel Monju Nuclear Reactor Fully Loaded With Fuel OW2005124994 Tokyo KYODO in English 1015 GMT 20 May 94 OW2005124994 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Fukui, May 20 KYODO -- Japan's prototype fast breeder reactor "Monju" is now fully loaded with fuel and ready for going "critical" throughout the entire core, the governmental Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. said Friday [20 May]. The last of the 198 fuel assemblies was installed in the core the same day, and the reactor is now set for full chain reactions of nuclear fission. Monju, located in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, is expected to reach critical state early Sunday. The controversial fast breeder reactor reached criticality for the first time on April 5, with 168 fuel assemblies installed. The reactor, which is fueled by a mixture of plutonium oxide and uranium oxide, is believed to have the potential to use fuel 60 times more efficiently than conventional uranium reactors. Criticality is the point at which the neutrons produced in the fission process are sufficient to sustain a chain reaction without outside stimulus. Since the reactor reached criticality, the governmental agency has been gradually installing the remaining fuel assemblies, while experimenting with the critical conditions by inserting and removing some of the 19 neutron-absorbing control rods. The 280,000-kilowatt prototype reactor will undergo further tests in this chain reaction stage before turbines are connected in April next year for generating electricity. Full operation is scheduled to start in December 1995.
