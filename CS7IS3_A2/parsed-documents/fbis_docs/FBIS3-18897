This was announced this afternoon by Foreign Minister Javier Solana, who met with his Portuguese counterpart. The Spanish and Portuguese foreign ministers spoke about the European Union enlargement and both defend the same interests. They hope that Norway will change its stance on fishing. Over to Pedro Fernandez Cespedes. [Fernandez Cespedes] Despite yesterday's attack on the Spanish Aviocar over Croatia, the government will not only keep up its commitment in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but is already studying the possibility of increasing our presence in the area, albeit symbolically. While waiting for the Army chief of staff's report, Minister Solana adds another company of soldiers to the technicians the defense minister promised yesterday. [Begin Solana recording] He was speaking about the possibility of sending some radar-type material along with technicians, that would be some 30 people or something like that. And the Ministry of Defense is considering the possibility of maybe sending a company of soldiers. That would be it. I have to repeat that Spain is fulfilling its obligations. It is doing so generously, efficiently. [end recording] [Fernandez Cespedes] Minister Solana is sure that yesterday's attack on the Spanish Aviocar will get an adequate answer from the international community. [passage omitted]
