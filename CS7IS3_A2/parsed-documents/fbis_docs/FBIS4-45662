This is especially true in cases of multiple contamination with hydrocarbons, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, and heavy metals on land rich in coarse clay, and of widespread pollution in industrial areas. Immobilization using a binding agent will also make it possible to recycle large expanses of the heavily polluted Bitterfeld industrial area, where an on-site hazardous waste incineration plant is to be built once safeguards are in place. In May last year, work began on digging out soil, backfill, and rubble containing heavy metals and dioxins on the 10.5-hectare [26- acre] Chemicals AG site. By the end of December 1993, the Nuernberg-based reclamation company, PBS, had dug out about 50,000 cubic meters of material and immobilized 32,000 cubic meters. The material is first homogenized then immobilized in a charge mixer. The soil and binding agent are weighed out electronically and precisely proportioned for this purpose. A mixing throughput of up to 1,000 cubic meters a day can be handled. The immobilized soil is reincorporated into a controllable system that is separated from the unpolluted soil by a dividing layer. Samples of both the untreated and the reincorporated soil are taken and analyzed during the reclamation work. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Criteria for Assessing Amenability to Immobilization | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Contamination |Soil Type |Intended Use |Extension | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |volatile halogena-|gravel |playing field |local accident | |ted hydrocarbons, | | | | |hydrocarbons | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |phenols, benzene, |sand |residential area |small area | |toluene, xylene | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |polynuclear aroma-|coarse clay |road, parking lot |limited residenti-| |tic hydrocarbons | | |al area | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |heavy metals |clay |industrial estate |large industrial | | | | |areas | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |multiple contamin-|In increasing order of amenability | |ation, e.g., hydr-| | |ocarbons, benzene,| | | toluene, xylene, | | |heavy metals | | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
