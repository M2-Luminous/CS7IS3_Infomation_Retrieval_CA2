This is one of the main conclusions reached by six major European research institutes, including the Italian institute "Prometeia," in a report on economic prospects in the Old World. The research centers -- part of the Ereco network -- surveyed over 120 businesses in the European Union and EFTA (European Free Trade Association) countries, employing 3.5 million people overall, and destined to be put up for sale on the market within the next few years. Over one-fifth of the workforce currently employed in these businesses will lose its jobs as a result of increased competition in Europe. The hardest-hit countries will be France (290,000 jobs lost), Italy (180,000 jobs lost), and Germany, where future job losses are estimated at 140,000.
