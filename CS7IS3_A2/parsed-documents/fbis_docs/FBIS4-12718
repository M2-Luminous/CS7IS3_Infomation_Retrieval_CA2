[passage omitted] In an exclusive statement to AL-DUSTUR before leaving Amman yesterday, Salim Salih Muhammad said: We were informed that a high-level Jordanian political delegation has been formed and will be led by al-Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir, chief of the Royal Court. The delegation is expected to leave for Yemen within the next few days to meet with the Yemeni leadership within the framework of the Jordanian role aimed at upgrading political dialogue. [passage omitted] Commenting on recent reports that Saudi forces had entered Yemeni territories in the Sa'dah Governorate, Muhammad said that this did occur and that joint committees were formed to discuss bilateral border issues. This is in addition to a message which President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih sent to King Fahd. He noted that all efforts are focused on solving these border problems as soon as possible. On the Iranian role to solve the crisis, Muhammad said: The Iranian president last week received Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Basindwah. We consider Iran a fraternal Islamic country and our relations with it are based on equality, mutual respect, and joint interests. According to Iranian confirmations, Iran is not biased toward any party in the Yemeni crisis. [passage omitted] The member of the Yemeni Presidential Council explained: Yemen has a huge amount of weapons. This negates reports that some Yemeni parties are receiving weapons from outside. In this regard, he referred to the Yemeni interior minister's statement the day before yesterday that there are 50 million weapon pieces in Yemen; that is, four for every person. The member of the Presidential Council considered this a modest figure compared with the actual number of weapons in the hands of the Yemeni people. [passage omitted]
