Its head is Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas. According to a report from the republic's media, presidential adviser Justas Paleckis told journalists that Lithuania's foreign policy blueprint has been drawn up and will shortly be submitted for discussion by the members of the Seimas. "Lithuania must more actively integrate itself into West European economic, political, and military structures, while maintaining good relations with all countries in the world, and primarily with its neighbors, purposefully play the part of an East-West `bridge' and become a country of international transit. That is, perhaps, the essence of Lithuania's foreign policy blueprint," he stated. It was also noted at the session that, at the meeting with the U.S. President, it will be necessary to seek a reinforcement of the moral support for independence by economic and social measures, by attracting U.S. investment and also through cooperation in the economic and scientific domain.
