He also indicated five fields that Japan believes should be considered important in providing the fourth yen loan. The five fields are: 1) preservation of environment; 2) economic infrastructure, such as transportation and communications; 3) city infrastructure, such as water supply and drainage; 4) agriculture; and 5) assistance to economically undeveloped areas in inland of China. The bureau chief expressed his hope to emphasize the northeast region among other regions in providing aid, saying: "We would like to place emphasis on the northeast region which is close to Japan." Moreover, because the fourth yen loan will be the major focal point during Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to China in March -- the visit is now under coordination between Japan and China, Hirabayashi called on China to include "projects that could become a symbol of friendship between Japan and China" in lists of China's requests for the yen loan. Hirabayashi said Japan "would like to decide on projects for aid, which will be provided in three years, as soon as possible." Minister Wu said: "China regards Japan as the largest partner in economic cooperation. We agree to the Japanese idea of emphasizing preservation of environment."
