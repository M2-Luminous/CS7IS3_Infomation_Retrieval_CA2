Yesterday alone, 11 civilians, six of them children under 10, were seriously wounded. They were wounded in attacks by portable rocket launchers and tanks from (Dilje) hill. These people cannot be helped, as the road to Vitkovici is completely cut off. They cannot be brought to the hospital or the medical center. The situation in the city center resembles the worst scene from a horror film. [passage omitted] We have also just received information from the official bodies that Maljutka guided missiles have hit the prison camp with 22 captured members of the fascist army. Six captured chetniks have been killed and eight seriously wounded in this barbaric attack.

Two of them, Milinkovic Dusan and his wife, have died, despite being given urgent aid.
