Speaking at the annual Lithuanian Science and Industry conference in Kaunas Tuesday [1 February], the president emphasized the need to preserve the remaining scientific nucleus and to train new specialists for the country. Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius admitted in his report that the state is unable to maintain all scientific personnel. The number of scientific personnel decreased by nearly 30 percent over the past three years, but, in the premier's view, the country's higher education institutions do not experience a shortage of specialists yet. The four-day conference in Kaunas will try to find solutions to problems of developing Lithuanian science and will search for a way out a crisis that was caused by the worsening economic situation. The conference is attended by members of the government, university rectors and scholars.
