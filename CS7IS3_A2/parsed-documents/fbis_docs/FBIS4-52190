FBIS4-52190 "dreas089_c_94011" FBIS-EAS-94-089 Daily Report 6 May 1994 North Korea Daily Demands Repatriation of Korean War POW's Daily Demands Repatriation of Korean War POW's SK0605125494 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1039 GMT 6 May 94 SK0605125494 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan Demanded"--KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- South Korean rulers must stop trying to use for insidious political purpose the issue of old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, who were taken prisoners during the war and had been kept in prison for many years, unconverted, and unconditionally send them back to the northern half of the country, says NODONG SINMUN in a signed article today. Recalling that the South side refused to send back Kim and Ham under an unreasonable pretext once again when the North side demanded their repatriation, the paper says: This is a gross violation of the international humanitarian law and an unpardonable crime contrary to morality. According to the provisions of the international humanitarian law, all of POWs are to be repatriated to their homeland immediately after the end of hostile acts. The South Korean authorities are only bound to send POWs Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan back to the North. However, the successive rulers of South Korea had kept Kim and Ham in prison respectively for 33 years and seven months and 34 years, cruelly torturing and persecuting for the mere reason that they refused to be converted ideologically. They are denied to have communication with their families and relatives. They, old valetudinarian men released from the prison, are maintaining the barest existence with toilsome physical labour in South Korea. Their hope is only to go back to the northern half of the country at an early date and live a quiet life for the rest of their days under the warm care of the thankful system and their families and relatives. Their repatriation to the North is a matter out of politics, a matter of human conscience and morality. "Human rights" and "unification" much touted by the South Korean rulers while persistently detaining and persecuting Kim and Ham, refusing to send them back, are nothing but a deceptive argument. If the South Korean authorities persistently block their repatriation, they will face a bitter condemnation at home and abroad, as a violator of the international humanitarian law and morality.
