FR940825-1-00123 FR940825-1-00009 5. 40 CFR Part 52_Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans Federal PSD Permitting. EPA has issued rules that provide for Federal implementation of the PSD permit program (preconstruction permit requirements applicable to major stationary sources or major modifications 20 in areas that currently meet the NAAQS). 40 CFR 52.21. In the same manner as States, Federal implementation of a PSD program on Tribal lands applies in any case where the Tribe does not have an approved PSD program. 20 Note that a proposed source in certain listed source categories is ``major'' for PSD purposes if it has the potential to emit 100 tons per year of any pollutant regulated under the Act. Other sources are ``major'' for PSD if their emissions may exceed 250 tons per year. The regulatory definitions of ``major stationary source'' and ``major modification'' for the PSD program are set out at 40 CFR 52.21(b) (1), (2). EPA is undertaking a comprehensive regulatory effort to revise its PSD rules (and its nonattainment NSR program, see below) consistent with some of the changes made to the substantive PSD program under the revised Act (and as a part of a broader reform initiative). Since these revised rules have not yet been promulgated, EPA has issued detailed guidance addressing transitional and interim implementation issues associated with the changes made by the 1990 Amendments. See 57 FR 18070 at 18074&hyph;77 (April 28, 1992) (Appendix D_``New Source Review (NSR) Program Transitional Guidance,'' March 11, 1991). At least until any further guidance is provided in EPA's NSR rulemaking, EPA's review and issuance of PSD permits for applicable sources proposing to locate on Tribal lands will be in accordance with the previously-issued PSD transitional permitting guidance, today's guidance, and 40 CFR 52.21, to the extent that the existing provisions of 40 CFR 52.21 are consistent with the amended Act. 21 See section 193 of the Act. 21 The 1977 Amendments to the CAA authorized Indian tribes to redesignate the classification of lands within the exterior boundaries of a reservation for PSD planning purposes. Section 164(a), 42 U.S.C. 7474(c); Nance v. EPA, 645 F.2d 701 (9th Cir. 1981), cert. den'd, 451 U.S. 1081 (1981). Area classifications for PSD determine the maximum increment of degradation that is permissible in a clean air area. Tribal authority to redesignate areas for this purpose is set forth in 40 CFR 52.21. Tribes continue to have this authority under the Act as amended in 1990. Federal NSR Permitting. 40 CFR 52.24(c) provides that 40 CFR part 51, Appendix S (``Offset Ruling'') governs the issuance of NSR permits (required for the construction and operation of new and modified major stationary sources in nonattainment areas) where approved State rules are not in place. The Offset Ruling sets out EPA's interpretation regarding the conditions that are designed to ensure that sources and source modifications subject to the NSR requirements will be controlled to the greatest degree possible and that more than equivalent offsetting emission reductions will be obtained from existing sources, thus ensuring progress toward achievement of the NAAQS. The 1990 Amendments to the CAA added new provisions to the Act addressing the substantive NSR permitting requirements. See, e.g., sections 173, 182 and 189(b)(3) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7503, 7511a and 7513a(b)(3). As with the new changes to the PSD program, EPA has issued guidance addressing the implementation of the revised nonattainment NSR requirements in the period before EPA's comprehensive regulations are adopted. See 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992); 57 FR 18070, 18075&hyph;77 (April 28, 1992) (Appendix D_``New Source Review (NSR) Program Transitional Guidance,'' March 11, 1991); ``New Source Review (NSR) Program Supplemental Transitional Guidance on Applicability of New Part D NSR Permit Requirements'' (Sept. 3, 1992). In the interim period before EPA issues further guidance through its Federal nonattainment NSR rulemaking to implement the amended Act, EPA intends to conduct nonattainment NSR permitting on Tribal lands consistent with the Offset Ruling and the transitional EPA guidance addressing the revisions to the Act. 6. 40 CFR Part 70_State [and Tribal] Operating Permit Programs This discussion explains how the regulations at 40 CFR Part 70 implementing the Title V operating permit program would be affected by today's proposed action. EPA is currently developing Federal rules to be codified in 40 CFR Part 71 that will authorize direct Federal implementation of Title V permit program requirements for States and Tribes that lack adequate program coverage. Program Submittal Deadlines and Processing. Program submittal deadlines are set out at 40 CFR 70.4(a). Tribes will not be compelled to develop and submit Title V permit programs to EPA for approval. 40 CFR 70.4(e) addresses the processing of Title V program submittals. Any Tribal submittal that is incomplete or disapproved will be returned to the Tribe following such determination. To the extent possible, EPA will work with the Tribe to remedy deficiencies in the Tribal program. However, the timeframes governing EPA's processing of Tribal submittals will be the same as those applicable to State submittals. Program Coverage. The regulations call for States to issue permits that assure compliance with ``each applicable requirement *␣*␣* by all part 70 sources''. 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(i); see also 40 CFR 70.6(a)(1) (``[e]ach permit issued under this part shall include *␣*␣* [e]mission limitations and standards *␣*␣* that assure compliance with all applicable requirements at the time of permit issuance''). Approvable Tribal programs must address all affected Part 70 sources within a Tribe's jurisdiction.
