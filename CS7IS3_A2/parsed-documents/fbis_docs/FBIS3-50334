Prime Minister Peter Boross also reacted to your statement in a television interview. Would you give us some details about your statement? [Peto] I would like to point out that I formulated my statement as an assessment of the situation, and not as a value judgment. I did not deal with the question of who was responsible for the situation and to what extent. Statistical data, analyses made by independent experts, and my experience accumulated during my various visits all over the country prove that Hungary's mood and economic situation are worse now. It is a fact that national income has decreased considerably, the agricultural sector has lost its former role of economic stabilizer, unemployment has become a massive problem, and insecurity has generally increased. I think that one of the greatest mistakes of this government was that it did not evaluate Hungary's situation when it came to power. It also belongs to the general picture that many people were not aware of the realities. In formulating its election program, the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] started from the real situation prevailing in Hungary, because this is the only realistic starting point. This is particularly important in the case of a party that has a good chance of participating in the next government. [Szereto] What will the SZDSZ deputies' meeting that starts tomorrow deal with? [Peto] It will be the task of group meetings to finalize the detailed program. While this will actually be a professional workshop activity, at the plenary meeting where Gabor Kuncze and I will give speeches we want to formulate our ideas to the broadest public possible. We would like to present a comprehensive picture about the SZDSZ to the broadest public possible. Ever since we elected Gabor Kuncze as our nominee for the position of prime minister, a special division of labor has emerged between us. According to this, Gabor Kuncze speaks mainly about parliamentary and government affairs, program formulation, and economic issues to be placed in the center of our election campaign. As the chairman of the party, I will speak mainly about the general political situation, including the situation of the SZDSZ. [Szereto] Under your leadership, the SZDSZ emerged as a uniform and organized party in the eyes of the public, and the arrival of the former members of the Federation of Young Democrats [FIDESZ] will obviously strengthen your position. However, opinion polls show that the SZDSZ does not enjoy the same level of support today as it enjoyed in 1990. In view of this, what is your opinion about the election prospects of the SZDSZ and generally of the liberal bloc? [Peto] Indeed, the SZDSZ is not yet in the position it wants to achieve during the elections, but this was the case months before the 1990 elections too. Opinion polls are multifaceted and we can have an idea about the election prospects of a party not only on the basis of primary support, but also on the basis of other factors. Some 40 percent of voters would welcome the SZDSZ in the next coalition, which is a pretty good percentage. Many people predict an SZDSZ victory, and we have strong secondary support, and very few people say that they would not vote for us in any case. Therefore, the SZDSZ has considerable resources and, based on all this, I am sure that we will give our supporters a pleasant surprise at the elections. We are striving to make sure that the liberal forces show a considerable presence in the new parliament, and this is why an SZDSZ-FIDESZ agreement was achieved. In harmony with this agreement, we are building relations with other liberal parties, like the Agrarian Federation and the Party of Entrepreneurs. With them, and with the Republic Party, we will nominate joint candidates. In my opinion, the liberal forces have good election chances and it seems that they will play a decisive role in the next parliament. I am also sure that it will be impossible to form a coalition without the liberal parties. [Szereto] On the basis of various statements, one can conclude that the positions of the two parliamentary liberal parties differ somewhat regarding coalition intentions. Your political rivals often accuse you of approaching the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. What are your relations with the MSZP like, and what kind of coalition ideas do you have? [Peto] It is useless to deny that the SZDSZ and the FIDESZ speak differently about coalition possibilities but, in my opinion, these differences can be bridged. When the coalition talks started, the SZDSZ started from the premise that we must preserve all the possibilities of a future coalition. We did not want, nor do we want now, to limit our available political scope with artificial means, political gestures, or unilateral declarations. We regard the statements of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] and Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] deputies as a fact, namely their slogan of "not with the SZDSZ." Indeed, we did not have too many chances of cooperating with these parties after the elections. The statements coming from the government side, statements that present the FIDESZ as a proper party as opposed to the SZDSZ, obviously aim at disbanding the liberal alliance. Although the FIDESZ leaders made a lot of unfriendly statements about the socialists, they did not exclude the possibility of a coalition in principle, and the MSZP did not clearly exclude any liberal party from a possible coalition either. I would characterize the relations between the SZDSZ and the MSZP as a correct coexistence: We do not join the so-called anticommunist campaign, we maintain our objective criticism of the MSZP policy, and we formulate our concerns. While the MSZP focuses on its social sensitivity, in my view, this party continues to be largely bound to the elite that also profited from the previous regime. The appearance of some socialist candidates and others also shows that many representatives of the old regime who have been in the background so far will become "reactivated" at the next elections. This could produce internal tensions within the MSZP, because those who played a role in this party so far and were active politically in the course of the past four years despite all the inconveniences involved will now be able to meet in their own party with people against whom they represented the concept of reform and democratic transformation. At the same time, one can see a contradiction between the written economic concepts of the MSZP and the declared goals presented at meetings. All this makes it difficult to evaluate the socialists' real political intentions. The possible coalition talks after the elections will actually show the extent to which the actual concepts and political practice of the MSZP are compatible with the liberal ideals. I regard the attempt of "connecting" the SZDSZ with the MSZP as part of the negative campaign. As part of this campaign, rumors have been spread lately of secret negotiations between the two parties on cooperation in the second round of the elections. There is no basis for all this, and it would also be useless, because it could happen that the two parties become the most serious rivals of each other in the second round.
