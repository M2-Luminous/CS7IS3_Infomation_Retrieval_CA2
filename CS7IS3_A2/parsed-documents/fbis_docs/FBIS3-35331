We need your assistance in finding our way in the maze of contradicting pieces of information. We hear there was a serious setback in Paris, where the Palestinians reneged on several earlier understandings. At the same time, very good progress was reportedly made in Cairo, and Qol Yisra'el even announced that 5 May has been set as the date for the beginning of the withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho and that Yasir 'Arafat has been notified of it and has accepted the date. Where do things really stand? [Peres] Look, first, Yasir 'Arafat has not been notified of any date; neither has a date been set. Therefore, although that report is full of goodwill, it is inaccurate. The real information is that progress was made in Taba. Important progress was made last week. Additional progress was made yesterday. If indeed this pace is kept up, there is a good chance that an agreement will be reached in the negotiations within a few weeks, and it could be implemented in a short time. We cannot yet provide a specific date because there are always surprises during negotiations. [Friedman] You have recently said that there are no sacred dates but only sacred time frames, allowing us to understand that the four-month span between the day the agreement with the PLO is signed and the beginning of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] withdrawal will be observed in any event. Do you still insist on those four months? [Peres] I said four months after the agreement is signed. It has not been signed yet. At the same time, I believe that if it is signed -- and I believe it will be in a few weeks -- we will not need four months; we may require only four weeks or even less. That is, I do not know whether it will take place in April; it could take another month, if everything works well. Still, the time span was properly set. As for the Paris talks, one must realize that negotiations include many surprises, tricks, changes of position, and setbacks. There is no need to get overly excited about this. We have experienced this in other negotiations. In general, however, I believe that the PLO today is more pragmatic and that, like us, it wants to end the negotiations as soon as possible. I do not underestimate the many details that have to be dealt with, but in general, very satisfactory progress has been made. [Friedman] It seems, however, that the PLO is trying to get in Paris what it failed to attain in the Cairo and Davos talks in which you participated: symbols of sovereignty, such as their own currency and customs, which is the source of the crisis in Paris. [Peres] I believe this is a mistake. The time of nationalist economics is over. Economy today is based on free markets not national markings, because you cannot feed children flags for breakfast. This is a bit old-fashioned. Everyone is making efforts today to have economy influence politics and not the other way around. We do not want to cater to the leaders' egos but to the people's needs. [Friedman] Finance Minister Shohat said, however, that if the Paris talks fail, we will opt for nationalist economies and separate the economies of the territories and Israel. [Peres] Look, the Palestinians will suffer from this, not us. Things must be kept in proportion. Israel's national income is $70 billion; the national income in the territories is $2-3 billion. The territories need Israeli jobs and markets. For example, where will they export their farming produce? You know that 50,000 Palestinians working in Israel make a very large income. I know that there are two schools of thought in the PLO: the national and the economic. That is, some of the PLO officials still believe that nationalism is more important than the market, but many of them are university graduates who are familiar with the modern world. They are aware of what would benefit both the Palestinians and Israel. I suggest that we do not present this issue as something Israel needs. The territories need a free economy, possibilities of finding work and selling goods, and a stable currency more than we do. Our economy is based on three or four agreements: the free trade agreement with the United States; associate membership in the EEC; and a free trade agreement with EFTA [European Free Trade Association]. Furthermore, we have bilateral agreements with the whole world. Israel exported $4.5-billion worth of high-tech, sophisticated electronic goods to the United States last year. We always present this as if someone is doing us a favor. We need no such favors, and no one is doing us any. We want the economic situation of the territories to be good. [Friedman] Mr. Peres, I would like you to comment about today's top story on the front page of DAVAR, which says that Israel planned to free 1,000 Palestinian prisoners as a holiday gesture and to mark the progress in the Cairo talks, but changed its mind in the wake of the killing of Tzipora Sason and the unrest in the territories. [Peres] There is no doubt that the killings significantly affect national morale. The report itself, I believe, is not accurate. We must wait and see about the date and scope of the prisoner release.
