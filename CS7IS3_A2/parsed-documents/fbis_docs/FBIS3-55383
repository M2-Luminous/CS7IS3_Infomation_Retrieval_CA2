This Is the Only Way of Reaching Agreement in East and West Europe": "While Politicians Argue, Czech Army Switches to NATO Regulations"] [Text] Prague -- "In the past Czechoslovakia played a key role in winding up the Warsaw Pact -- that instrument of Soviet hegemony," Czech President Vaclav Havel said recently. "Our efforts were not only designed to eliminate the last obstacle to participation in the system of collective defense of European democracy, but were also aimed at eliminating the last obstacle to the North Atlantic alliance's being turned into a European instead of a West European structure." Some politicians here were surprised that the president devoted the second speech to deputies during his presidency not to the republic's domestic political problems, but to joining NATO. This speech was most likely directed not at Czech parliamentarians but at Western politicians and Moscow. What arguments did the first president of the Czech Republic adduce in favor of NATO membership? First, the Czech Republic is at the very heart of Europe and is the traditional meeting point of geopolitical interests; many wars have begun or ended here. Incidentally, this was in the past one of the arguments for Czechoslovakia joining the Warsaw Pact. "Historical experience shows that we cannot worry only about ourselves, but for our own benefit we must show interest in the all-European process, which, whether we like it or not, concerns us more than other countries," Vaclav Havel believes. "Our endeavor to accede to the alliance is not merely a desire to receive international guarantees of our own security, but is also based on our wish to assume some responsibility for the situation on our continent...." Second, the Czech Republic shares all the main values of Euroamerican civilization, including a civil society, parliamentary democracy, political pluralism, a rule-of-law state, and respect for the individual. Since NATO's task is to defend these values, the Czech Republic cannot remain aloof. Third, based on historical experience, tragic experience included -- primarily Munich 1938 -- the Czech Republic feels the need to be included in a system of active collective security. In Vaclav Havel's opinion, Central Europe is currently in the foreground of the struggle for democracy and stability on the whole continent. "I therefore believe," he said, "that the Central European states should logically be prime candidates for NATO membership." The Czech president devoted a considerable portion of his speech to Russia: "To all appearances, NATO's relations with Russia and the other republics of the former Soviet Union will be far more complex. I think that there are just two options: Democratic forces win victory in Russia, forces aware that NATO is not Russia's enemy but an extremely promising partner and that NATO's drawing near Russia's border does not mean the approach of an enemy but a zone of democracy and prosperity, and that this process accords with Russia's vital interests. But there is also another option. Forces that are unable to give up the imperial ambitions of the former Soviet Union, chauvinist, great Russian forces...may gain the upper hand in Russia -- temporarily of course. They would undoubtedly protest NATO's being expanded by the admission of the former Soviet satellites and the alliance's drawing closer to Russia's borders.... I think that the West would be making a fatal error were it to succumb to their pressure. That would herald a return to Yalta and the `cold war' period...." It is hard to say whether Vaclav Havel convinced Western politicians, but Czech parliamentarians viewed with approval the -- albeit not that immediate -- prospect of acceding to the North Atlantic alliance. It was only J. Ortman, chairman of the Leftist Bloc deputies' club, who opposed the Czech Republic's joining any military alliance and proposed that the question of NATO membership not be resolved in parliament but by means of a national referendum. Premier Vaclav Klaus was somewhat more restrained than the others. In response to questions from TELEGRAF newspaper readers he said: "I think that the question of joining NATO is not on the agenda now. We are still not ready for this and no one is offering us membership at the moment. So, it is simply pointless and unfeasible at the moment to raise the question of a referendum. But I am convinced that NATO has played, is playing, and will play its role in Europe, that is, the region where the Czech Republic is situated. From this viewpoint it would of course be good for us to be members of NATO." Defense Minister Antonin Baudys believes that "the earlier we join NATO the better." Speaking about the October events in Russia in an interview with LIDOWE NOVINY he noted: "Personally they made me want to speed up the steps in NATO's direction. This was an example of the possible danger. Today NATO is the only functioning, well-organized military pact in the world. Our only chance is to get full membership thereof...." But FRG Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, during an official visit to Prague, recalled that the question of expanding NATO eastward cannot be decided without considering Russia's interests. "Russia is an extremely important factor for stability in Europe," he said during a meeting with journalists. "Stability can only be achieved `with' Russia but not under any circumstances by uniting `against' Russia." Nonetheless the problem of the Czech Republic's joining NATO is still featuring in the Czech press. "The question of our secure future is today closely linked with whether Russia joins the West or not," PRACE wrote. "But if that does not accord with Russia's wishes, we cannot abandon our intention of becoming full-fledged members of the North Atlantic alliance." A summit of all 16 NATO countries will be held in Brussels in a few days and important decisions on the bloc's future are expected. "If the January political decisions on the North Atlantic alliance's future strategy are extremely positive for us, that does not by any means signify that the Czech Republic will become a full-fledged member of this organization overnight," Vaclav Havel believes. "At best this will be just the start of a lengthy, fairly complex process...." But, before the verdict is in, there is every indication that the Czech Army has already joined in this process. According to Major General Pavel Jandacek, deputy chief of the General Staff of the Czech Army, steps are being taken "to close the gap between us and NATO armies and structures where possible in the near future." In particular linguistic and professional training is already under way, bearing in mind the Czech Army's future in NATO. Over 160 officers and men have been sent to military schools and courses in NATO, the United States, Canada, France, Britain, the FRG, and Holland. While the politicians are arguing, the military is acting.
