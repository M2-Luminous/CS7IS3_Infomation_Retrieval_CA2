Carneiro explained that the agreement "is a landmark in the history of international nuclear safeguards." He said that the agreement explains how the IAEA will inspect nuclear installations in Brazil. Carneiro is the speaker for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and was in charge of the negotiations between the Senate and the Brazilian administration. The timing of the visits was the most controversial aspect of the issue. Carneiro said the IAEA agreed to notify in advance its intention to inspect Brazilian nuclear installations and to make the inspection only after their construction is finished. "The IAEA wanted to inspect installations while construction was under way, but Brazil did not agree," Carneiro said. He also reported that from the diplomatic viewpoint the Brazilian negotiators gained status in the eyes of the international community. "Brazil tied its ratification of the accord to the fulfillment of certain conditions, unlike many other countries that did not follow suit," Carneiro stated. According to the senator, the IAEA was pressuring to gain control over nuclear energy in Brazil. The agency wanted, among other things, to visit Brazilian installations whenever it received a report that Brazil was using nuclear energy for nonpeaceful objectives. "Brazil did not accept this and demanded that unscheduled inspections comply with auxiliary regulations that clearly establish how this should be done, and the IAEA agreed," the senator explained. "This was the aspect that countries fear most, which is why Brazil has never signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), which will be reviewed in 1995." The senator also reported that the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Material (ABACC), not the IAEA, will control nuclear material in Brazil. "This will be done to make sure that the uranium enriched in Brazil using Brazilian technology will not be diverted to manufacturing arms in Brazil or abroad," Carneiro said. The Brazilian Senate will have to ratify the agreement signed with the IAEA early in 1994.
