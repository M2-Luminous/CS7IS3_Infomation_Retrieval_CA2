The admiral noted that "the incident in Odessa can be regarded as an anti-Russian action". One has to recognise that Ukrainian commandos forcibly took over Division 318 of the Black Sea Fleet, disbanded it and are now forcing Russian sailors at gunpoint to take an oath of allegiance to Ukraine. The general noted that a similar scenario can be used again. Ukraine has already appointed its own commanders for the fleet units stationed in Ismail, Nikolayev and Ochakov. But the situation in the Crimea as a whole is not in favour of Ukraine's nationalist forces, Kasatonov said. The inhabitants have already made their choice by voting for dual citizenship. The Black Sea Fleet remains Russia's and it is extremely illogical to try and divide it. The command of the Russian Navy cannot agree to such division, Admiral Kasatonov declared.
