Mr Shamuyarira said in an interview that if an application was made, the government would consider it. "We have not seen the application yet. The position is that we are still unhappy about statements made by (Mr) Mengistu. We expressed our displeasure about it to him," he said. However, he said he did not know of any statute that would compel Zimbabwe to hand over Mr Mengistu to Ethiopia. Ethiopian Ambassador to Zimbabwe Fantahum Michael on Monday said his government was processing a formal application to Zimbabwe to extradite Mr Mengistu. This has been sparked off by recent statements by Mr Mengistu in which he defended his rule in Ethiopia and blamed unnamed members of his ruling circle for his overthrow, claiming they had been paid by "imperialist circles".
