President Mircea Snegur said, among other things, that at the recent congress entitled Our Home, the Republic of Moldova, he mentioned, as he had done before, the same historical events and the need to preserve our brotherly ties, and, as he specified, to stick to our kin. At the same congress, he emphasized that the policy promoted by the Republic of Moldova is consistent in all areas and is linked to reality and the nation's desire to consolidate its statehood and to develop as an independent state. Speaking about the same policy, Snegur mentioned that the directions of economic and cultural integration between Moldova and Romania remain the same. In connection with the Ilascu case, the Moldovan president said that he prefers to act rather than talk and that his intentions remain the same, namely to have these political detainees transferred to the constitutional legal bodies of the Republic of Moldova. In connection with the meeting of the interministerial commission, recently held in Bucharest, Snegur affirmed that it has opened up very positive prospects for mutual economic cooperation. It is necessary to speed up and activate tangible relations between economic units; the meeting was assessed as encouraging for the future.
