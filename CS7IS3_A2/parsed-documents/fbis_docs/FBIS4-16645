In an interview with ITAR-TASS, Filatov said that the agreement will be signed by President Boris Yeltsin, the government, leaders of the State Duma and the Federation Council, and representatives of trade unions, the presidential public chamber, religious organisations and political movements. "The agreement will remain open to all who may wish to sign it," Filatov added. A special conciliatory commission which will comprise "representatives of the president, the government, political parties and public movements" will oversee the implementation of the agreement. Filatov believes that the commission should use the experience of the mass media court. He said there is no need to adopt the agreement on civic peace and accord as a federal law, but added that the parties to it may face possible consequences if they violate the agreement.
