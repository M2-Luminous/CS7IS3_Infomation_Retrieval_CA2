Yoshitomo Tanaka made the remarks in a speech at the U.N. headquaters at a meeting of the preliminary committee preparing for a 1995 international conference to discuss extension of the pact. As reasons for Japan's support, Tanaka noted the treaty calls for nuclear powers to reduce nuclear arms and promotes the prevention of nuclear proliferation, a major concern in the post-Cold War era. The NPT, which came into force in 1970, requires nuclear powers to sincerely promote disarmament talks and bans nonnuclear states from producing or possessing nuclear arms. Japan became party to the NPT in 1975. The preliminary committee was set up to promote working-level consultations before an international conference in 1995. So far, 60 countries have expressed support for unlimited extension of the treaty. But nonaligned nations, mostly Asian and African developing countries, have demanded that revisions be made in the treaty's clauses and that extension be set for a limited period, saying the treaty is discriminatory between nuclear powers and nonnuclear countries. A majority of support with 162 signatories is needed to extend the treaty.
