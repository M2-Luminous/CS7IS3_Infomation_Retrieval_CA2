FR940927-0-00023 FR940927-0-00002 (ii) All determinations of these deficiencies, substances, or conditions are made using samples of the production obtained by us or by a disinterested third party approved by us; and (iii) The samples are analyzed by a grader licensed under the authority of the United States Grain Standards Act or the United States Warehouse Act with regard to deficiencies in quality, or by a laboratory approved by us with regard to substances or conditions injurious to human or animal health. (Test weight for quality adjustment purposes may be determined by our loss adjuster.) (4) Coarse grain production that is eligible for quality adjustment, as specified in paragraphs 12.(e) (2) and (3), will be reduced by the quality adjustment factor contained in the Special Provisions. (f) For corn insured or harvested as silage: (1) Whenever our appraisal of grain content is less than 4.5 bushels of grain per ton of silage, the silage production will be reduced by 1 percentage point for each 0.1(1/10) of a bushel less than 4.5 bushels per ton (If we cannot make a grain appraisal before harvest and you do not leave a representative unharvested sample, in accordance with the policy no reduction for grain-deficient silage will be made.); and (2) If the normal silage harvesting period has ended, or for any acreage harvested as silage or appraised as silage prior to October 1, we may increase the silage production to count to 65 percent (65%) moisture equivalent to reflect the normal moisture content of silage harvested during the normal silage harvesting period. (g) Any production harvested from plants growing in the insured crop may be counted as production of the insured crop on a weight basis. 13. Late Planting and Preventing Planting (a) In lieu of paragraph 8.(b)(2) and subsection 1.(aa) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (ยง457.8), insurance will be provided for acreage planted to the insured crop during the late planting period (see subsection 13.(c)), and acreage you were prevented from planting (see subsection 13.(d)). These coverages provide reduced production guarantees. The reduced guarantees will be combined with the production guarantee for timely planted acreage for each unit. The premium amount for late planted acreage and eligible prevented planting acreage will be the same as that for timely planted acreage. If the amount of premium you are required to pay (gross premium less our subsidy) for late planted acreage or prevented planting acreage exceeds the liability on such acreage, coverage for those acres will not be provided (no premium will be due and no indemnity will be be paid for such acreage). (For example, assume you insure one unit in which you have a 100 percent (100%) share. The unit consists of 150 acres, of which 50 acres were planted timely, 50 acres were planted 7 days after the final planting date (late planted), and 50 acres are unplanted and eligible for prevented planting coverage. To calculate the amount of any indemnity which may be due to you, the production guarantee for the unit will be computed as follows: (1) For timely planted acreage, multiply the per acre production guarantee for timely planted acreage by the 50 acres planted timely; (2) For late planted acreage, multiply the per acre production guarantee for timely planted acreage by 93 percent (0.93) and multiply the result by the 50 acres planted late; and (3) For prevented planting acreage, multiply the per acre production guarantee for timely planted acreage by 50 percent (0.5) and multiply the result by the 50 acres eligible for prevented planting coverage. The total of the three calculations will be the production guarantee for the unit. Your premium will be based on the result of multiplying the per acre production guarantee for timely planted acreage by the 150 acres in the unit.) (b) You must provide written notice to us if you were prevented from planting (see subsection 1.(n)). This notice must be given not later than three (3) days after: (1) The final planting date for acreage you were prevented from planting by the final planting date if you have unplanted acreage that may be eligible for prevented planting coverage; and (2) The date you discover that planting will not be possible within the late planting period for acreage that may be eligible for prevented planting coverage if you were not prevented from planting such acreage by the final planting date, but were prevented from planting such acreage during the late planting period. (c) Life Planting (1) For acreage planted to the insured crop after the final planting date but on or before 25 days after the final planting date, the production guarantee for each acre will be reduced for each day planted after the final planting date by: (i) One percent (.01) for the first through the tenth day; and (ii) Two percent (.02) for the eleventh through the twenty-fifth day. (2) In addition to the requirements of section 6 (Report of Acreage) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (ยง457.8), you must report the dates the acreage is planted within the late planting period. (3) If planting of the insured crop continues after the final planting data, or you are prevented from planting during the late planting period, the acreage reporting date will be the later of: (i) The acreage reporting date contained in the Special Provisions for the insured crop; or (ii) Five (5) days after the end of the late planting period. (d) Prevented Planting (Including Planting After the Late Planting Period) (1) If you were prevented from planting the insured crop (see subsection 1.(n)), you may elect: (i) To plant the insured crop during the late planting period (the production guarantee for such acreage will be determined in accordance with paragraph 13.(c)(1)); (ii) Not to plant this acreage to any crop that is intended for harvest in the same crop year, (the production guarantee for such acreage will be fifty percent (0.5) of the production guarantee for timely planted acres, (For example, if your production guarantee for timely planted acreage is 30 bushels per acre, your prevented planting production guarantee would be equivalent to 15 bushels per acre (30 bushels multiplied by 0.5). This paragraph does not prohibit the preparation and care of the acreage for conservation practices, such as planting a cover crop, as long as such crop is not intended for harvest.); or (iii) To plant the insured crop after the late planting period, (the production guarantee for such acreage will be fifty percent (0.5) of the production guarantee for timely planted acres, (For example, if your production guarantee for timely planted acreage is 30 bushels per acre, your prevented planting production guarantee would be equivalent to 15 bushels per acre (30 bushels multiplied by 0.5). Production to count for such acreage will be determined in accordance with subsections 12.(c) through (g)). (2) In addition to the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (ยง457.8), the insurance period for prevented planting coverage begins on the sales closing date contained in the Special Provisions for the insured crop in the county. (3) The acreage to which prevented planting coverage applies will be limited as follows:
