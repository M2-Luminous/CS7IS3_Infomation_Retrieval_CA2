As set out by Skopje radio Thursday, the Albanian side refused to sign the memorandum on cooperation bearing the "constitutional name of Macedonia." The radio recalled that only a few days ago, during the meeting of the F.Y.R.M. and Albanian presidents -- Kiro Gligorov and Sali Berisha -- in Podgradec (Albania) and Ohrid (F.Y.R.M.), the name Macedonia was not disputed by either side. An Albanian Government delegation, headed by Agricultural Minister Hassan Halili, stayed on a three-day visit to F.Y.R.M. Macedonia was given a temporary name of F.Y.R.M. because of a dispute with Greece. Greece opposes most strongly the name Macedonia as it sees in it territorial pretensions of this state towards the northern Greek province of the same name.
