Cetin stated that the most appropriate route for the safe transportation of the oil from the Caucasus and Central Asia is an oil pipeline via Turkey. Cetin replied to questions by TRT correspondent Ersin Kucukbarak. [Begin recording] [Kucukbarak] Two foreign ships collided in the Bosporus last night and the population of Istanbul was again faced with great danger. Given the fact that there are requests to use the Istanbul strait as an oil route, how do you evaluate last night's incident? [Cetin] Istanbul, which has a population of 10 million, was really faced with great danger as a result of the collision of two ships last night. This shows that the passage of flammable and explosive substances, such as oil, from the Bosporus will create problems, especially from a safety viewpoint. For the past few years, we have been trying to explain to both our neighboring countries and to transporters using the route the safety problems entailed in this. Last night's incident demonstrated once again how justified we are in our sensitivity to the matter. Turkey believes that the passage from the straits should be regulated by certain rules. To this end, a statute was drawn up with the contribution of my ministry. This statue is due to come into effect on 1 July 1994. The arrangements stipulated in the statute comply with the Montreux Treaty. When the statue is implemented, such accidents will be reduced to a minimum, but I do not believe that this will constitute a total solution. The Istanbul strait is one the most dangerous sea routes in the world. At certain points, this strait becomes as narrow as 700 meters. Given the tonnage of today's ships, even their ordinary passage becomes highly dangerous. Transit traffic through the straits has become increasingly intense in recent years. More than 50,000 ships pass through Istanbul every year. Turkey cannot remain indifferent to such an important issue. This is unthinkable. The Bosporus is extremely important because of the people around it. The Istanbul strait cannot be utilized for long to serve such a purpose from the environmental, security, and technical viewpoints. In the future, dry cargo traffic will increase and the development of Ukraine and the Russian Federation will contribute to this increase. Therefore, we propose the following as an ultimate solution: The Istanbul strait should not used for the transportation of flammable and explosive materials such as oil. If at all, it should be used at a minimum. Therefore, for some time now, we have been explaining these problems, introducing new arrangements, and speaking to neighboring countries. We are seeking a definitive and lasting solution with a view to preventing the increasing traffic in the future. This solution consists of transporting crude oil to the Mediterranean via pipelines to pass through Turkey. Last night's incident has unfortunately once again demonstrated how justified we are on this matter. It seems that the world wishes to ignore such dangers as long as it does not witness or experience them. For a long time, we have been trying to explain that the Istanbul strait cannot be used to this end. Therefore, as an ultimate solution, the Bosporus should not be used to transport dangerous substances like oil and the oil should be transported to the Mediterranean via pipelines through Turkey. [Kucukbarak] Would this entail a change in the Montreux Treaty? [Cetin] Actually, there is no need to make an amendment to the Montreux Treaty for the oil pipeline. A change is also not necessary for the new statue. In other words, even if Turkey does not rediscuss the Montreux Treaty, it cannot allow this. It cannot endanger a city with 10 million people.
