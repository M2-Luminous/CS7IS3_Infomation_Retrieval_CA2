"It is an appropriate speed after the country's GDP has increased by 13 per cent for two consecutive years," he said. "It would be an outstanding achievement if we can keep the GDP growing at eight or nine per cent for a few more years." Delivering a government work report at the National People's Congress today, Premier Li stressed China will make its best to maintain a vigorous and steady growth rate. Local authorities should set reasonable growth rates for their respective economies in accordance with their own conditions and not vie with each other or concentrate exclusively on raising output value. On principles for economic work this year, Li Peng said, China will carry out reform in depth.
