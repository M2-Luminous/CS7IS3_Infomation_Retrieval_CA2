FBIS3-48785 "dreas019__a94001" FBIS-EAS-94-019-A Document Type:Daily Report 28 January 1994 ANNEX Japan Draft Accord Includes Promotion of Auto Imports OW2201043194 Tokyo TOKYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 19 Jan 94 Morning Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2201043194 Tokyo TOKYO SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] A draft agreement to be proposed by Japan during the auto and auto parts talks -- which has been the focus of attention of the deadlocked Japan-U.S. economic framework talks -- came to light on 18 January. In addition to such additional measures as promoting imports of finished automobiles, the draft agreement includes "the number of dealers selling imported autos" as an "objective criteria" to measure the openness of Japan's market. The draft agreement will be presented at vice ministerial talks set to begin in Washington on 21 January. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] plans to provide a breakthrough in the deadlocked negotiations by improving the condition for sales of finished imported autos in Japan, and by giving shape to an objective criteria -- designed to assess efforts by Japanese and American manufacturers -- as an index which will help promote access by foreign companies to Japan's market. However, according to MITI's International Trade Policy Bureau, Japan still maintains "it is impossible to compromise on such proposals as establishing an objective criteria, which Japan says leads to establishing numerical targets, and giving favorable treatment to non-Japanese-affiliated makers because these proposals run counter to the principle of a free trade system." For that reason, the talks seem to face rough sailing. As part of the measures to promote imports of finished autos, Japan plans to propose expanding the loan ceiling of the Export-Import Bank of Japan [EIBJ] and the Japan Development Bank [JDB] as well as improving tax incentives to promote imports of finished autos. In addition, to increase imports of U.S.-made auto parts, which is held in check due to the sluggish auto market, Japan plans to expand loans by the EIBJ and JDB and release a list of U.S.-made auto parts which meet the standards applied to auto repairs and inspections. As an objective criteria to measure the United States' efforts, the draft agreement proposes the United States should lower the prices of auto parts made by American companies and increase types of cars having the steering wheel on the right hand side. As Japan's objective criteria, the agreement proposes to promote research projects in the United States and increase the number of individual business talks.
