The figure represents a 14 per cent increase from the 1994 budget. Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said the balanced budget was possible because the country's economic growth during the past year had passed the government's target and because more efficient tax collection was expected. The 1995 Budget Bill will be forwarded to the House of Representatives for deliberation in June, he said. The 1995 fiscal year starts this October. Government spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa denied that discussion of the budget at the Cabinet meeting yesterday was linked to a possible dissolution of the House. Earlier rumours suggested that the government wanted to rush the 1995 Budget Bill through Parliament then dissolve the House before calling a snap general election. Aphisit dismissed the rumours, saying the government had to prepare the bill in advance so the budget could be approved in time for the beginning of the new fiscal year.
