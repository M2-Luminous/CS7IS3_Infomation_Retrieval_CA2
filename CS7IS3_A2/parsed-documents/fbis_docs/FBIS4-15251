In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday, Miroshnikov said that the number of such cases has grown lately. People offering "spy service" to foreigners justify their behaviour by their "desire to be paid according to their intellect." Miroshnikov expressed concern about the fact that foreign intelligence services have stepped up their activity in Russia under the cover of various foundations and joint ventures. Russian business people and industrialists seeking credits or equipment for their businesses sometimes sell secrets to foreign emissaries or those who act legally and openly under the cover of firms and companies, he said. Taking advantage of Russia's weakened administrative and legal system, foreign spies penetrate all spheres of activity. Their neutralisation forces Russia's counterintelligence to look for new ways and methods of intelligence warfare and to conduct systematic analytical work. The situation is compounded by the fact that foreign states have set up intelligence centres in some republics of the former Soviet Union and, in fact, have taken over the local intelligence services. They wage active intelligence work against Russia, using politically unstable areas, trouble spots, the Islamic factor and aggressive nationalism, Miroshnikov concluded.
