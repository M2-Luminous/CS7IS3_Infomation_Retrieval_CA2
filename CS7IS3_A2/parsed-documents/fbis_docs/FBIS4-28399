Together with the opening of the Danish Embassy in Hanoi and the Danish General Consulate in Ho Chi Minh City, the event opened up a new chapter in the Vietnam-Denmark relations. The Danish minister of cooperation and development, Ms. Helen Degn, remarked that the tango has started. A high-level trade delegation led by the minister herself visited Vietnam. She bought with her a significant gift from Denmark: a long-term development cooperation program for Vietnam. Under this program, Denmark will give Vietnam a $100-million grant from 1994 to 1997. The money will be invested in the expansion of Hoang Thach Cement Plant in its second stage, the upgrading of La Nga Sugar Mill, the upgrading of the water supply system for Dalat Town, research for the water supply system of Quang Ninh Province, and for the waste treatment plan in Ho Chi Minh City. Denmark also wiped $52 million off Vietnam's debt. In 1992, the two-way trade turnover between the two countries was about $13 million. Last year the figure raised about $29 million, and increase of 116 percent. At present, the two countries have signed an agreement on investment protection, and an agreement on avoidance of double taxation is under discussion. This will help promote trade and investment activities between the two countries. In the past years, Denmark was one of the European countries who had little economic relations with Vietnam. Evidently, the tide has changed. International observers state that Denmark was catching up with other countries in relations with Vietnam, and now the tango has started, it will continue.
