Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-11JAN94-KOREA Pyongyang Leaves Door Open for Talks with Seoul Pyongyang media treatment of ROK President Kim Yong-sam's New Year press conference suggests that the North is attempting to balance its desire to excoriate the South with a need to avoid foreclosing inter-Korean dialogue. Although Pyongyang media reacted sharply to Kim's remarks, which were carried live by Seoul KBS-1 television on 6 January, Pyongyang's comment was remarkable in its failure to address the key question of North- South talks--an omission seemingly calculated to allow for maneuvering room for the North Korean leadership. Thus, Pyongyang radio on 7 January, for instance, showed its disdain for the South Korean leader by calling him a "puppet traitor" and "vicious betrayer who does not care about the destiny of the nation," but focused its attention on Kim's domestic agenda and his remarks on the nuclear issue. Although the ROK president again claimed that inter-Korean dialogue must take place before U.S.-DPRK high-level talks could resume, hinted at the possibility of economic assistance to the North once the nuclear issue is resolved, and rejected any "concessions" to secure an inter-Korean summit, monitored Pyongyang media have so far steered clear of these topics. In another indication of Pyongyang's effort to leave the door open for talks with Seoul, the North Korean news agency KCNA on 8 January stopped short of rejecting inter-Korean dialogue while criticizing recent remarks on this subject by South Korean Unification Minister Yi Yong-tok. KCNA claimed that Yi had stated that the South "will not respond unconditionally even if the North proposes a North-South dialogue," and depicted his reported remarks as a "grave" and "base" attempt to "foil DPRK- U.S. talks." However, it merely contended that Seoul's insistence on making inter-Korean dialogue a "precondition" for the DPRK-U.S. talks is serving as a "brake" on dialogue between Pyongyang and Washington.
