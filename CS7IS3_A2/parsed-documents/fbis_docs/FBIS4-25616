We will give priority to developing teachers' training, and nurture a reserve pool of professionally competent and politically reliable teachers. We should firmly foster the concept that science and technology are the primary productive forces, and that the economy should be developed through scientific and technological advances. While paying attention to research and development, we will accelerate the conversion of scientific and technological findings into productive forces, so that Tibet's economy will progressively shift toward the path of development based on scientific and technological advances. We will take practical and feasible measures to keep the existing pool of qualified personnel stable by improving their living and working conditions, inspiring their initiative, and giving full scope to their intelligence and talent. We will encourage various qualified personnel to work at the grass-roots level and the forefront of production where they can display their abilities. We will implement preferential policies and adopt active measures to systematically or freely bring in all kinds of useful qualified personnel whom our region needs badly; to allow such personnel to work in one place or move freely from one place to another; and to employ them on a long-term or short-term basis with the goal of gradually expanding our pool of qualified personnel. On creating a good social environment to ensure smooth progress in reform and development, the report said: We should consistently follow the principle of moving on two fronts simultaneously to keep the situation even more stable. We must wage a thoroughgoing antisplittist campaign. In fighting against splittism, we must firmly show faith in and rely on the masses, carry out publicity and organizational efforts among them, thoroughly expose splittists' plots, and constantly heighten public awareness of the need to combat splittism. We should resolutely crack down on disturbances and trouble plotted by splittist forces, to whom we should never show leniency. We will bolster governments at the grass-roots level and conscientiously carry out mass work. Constantly improving the people's material and cultural standards is a fundamental goal of economic development, as well as the basis of government work. We should firmly foster the mass viewpoint, and go down to the grass roots and among the masses to carry out investigation and study, conduct business on the spot, solve problems, and provide work guidance to ensure smooth progress in reform and production.
