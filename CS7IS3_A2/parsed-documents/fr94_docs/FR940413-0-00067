FR940413-0-00067 FR940413-0-00024 Regulatory Flexibility Determination The final rule will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on small entities. Flight instructors, rather than small entities, will be affected by this final rule. Where a flight instructor is also the sole proprietor of a small business, and exercises the privileges of his or her certificate in operations that are incidental to that business, the final rule will have a negligible impact. Federalism Impact The regulations adopted herein will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this amendment does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Conclusion For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings in the Regulatory Flexibility Determination and the International Trade Impact Analysis, the FAA has determined that this final rule is not significant under Executive Order 12866. In addition, the FAA certifies that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This rule is not considered significant under Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). For this reason, it has been determined that the expected economic impact of this amendment is so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation is not warranted.
