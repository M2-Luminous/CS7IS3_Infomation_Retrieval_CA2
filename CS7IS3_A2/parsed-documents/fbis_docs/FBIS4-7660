Their mission here was to draft a resolution on recommunization trends in Bulgaria. At a news conference today they summarized the results of their meetings with MPs of the different parliamentary forces, Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev, Justice Minister Petar Kornazhev, Prosecutor General Ivan Tatarchev, Supreme Court Chairman Ivan Grigorov and members of the Supreme Lawyers' Council. Yesterday's schedule of the CE representatives proved too tight to squeeze in a meeting with the members of the Supreme Judicial Council. We are not in a position to pass judgement, but the differences between the executive and the judiciary will make it very difficult for us to make our report quickly, Mr. Columberg pointed out. He explained that several principled requirements should be reflected in the report: whether the prerogatives of the different state institutions are observed, whether they enjoy an absolute autonomy, and whether they are not subject to political influence. The reports should be presented to the Parliamentary Assembly by July. The CE representatives said that there are constitutional grounds for the building of the judiciary in Bulgaria but a series of important acts are yet to be passed.
