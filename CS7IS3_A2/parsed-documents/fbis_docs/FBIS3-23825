Pomelova; place and date not given: "Reform of Reform: Economic Change or Economic Revolution?"] [Text] Opinions regarding the recently declared new state policy priorities (easing the excessively tough monetarist methods, support of production, etc.) have divided basically into two irreconcilable directions. One unconditionally supports the strategy and tactics of the radicals who have just left the government, and the other just as energetically rejects them. The discussion is stimulating the emergence in the world of the most diverse projects, programs, and studies, of which the greatest prominence was received by the joint report of the economics department of the RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences] and the Reform International Fund under the title "Socioeconomic Reorganization in Russia: Current Situation and New Approaches." At the end of last week its authors--Academicians S. Shatalin, L. Abalkin, and N. Petrakov--presented their work for the consideration of their economist colleagues and also of deputies of the State Duma. Tatyana Zaslavskaya and Artem Tarasov and Sergey Baburin and Vadim Medvedev, a former member of the CPSU Central Committee, were among those who came to the presentation. Not all the guests decided to speak at this discussion, to which many probably came out of curiosity. But the positions of those who nonetheless expressed opinions with regard to the program were very contradictory. Just as, however, the program of the "three academicians" itself was contradictory. After the meeting we were able to interview one of the developers, Nikolay Petrakov, director of the RAN Institute of Market Problems. But first, here are several quotations from the draft "Socioeconomic Reorganization in Russia: Current Situation and New Approaches." "While favorably assessing the movement to a market economy that is under way, it is necessary to note the continuously increasing, and in many ways excessive, `price' that society has already paid and will be compelled to pay for the adopted strategy and tactics of the transition to the market. Just in the last two years the drop in production, according to the most important macro-indices, totaled about 30 percent. In addition, it is important to emphasize that the drop in production, first, has not a structural but a general character and, second, it hit the most progressive and highly technological branches and types of production in the greatest degree." "Under current conditions, the loss of volume of production is a market loss; moreover, not only of the world market (for example, in the aerospace industry, in the production of armaments, etc.), but of the domestic market as well. However, once having yielded a place on the market, it is extremely difficult to regain this niche." "The drop in investment activity is most profound and dangerous in its socioeconomic consequences." "It was still not possible after two years to normalize the budget system, despite enlisting huge credits of the Central Bank and the artificial withdrawal of resources from the Pension Fund. The result of unreasoned actions, the payments crisis, and the inability to guarantee normal tax receipts only undermined the income base of the budget and caused its chronic deficit." "The choice of strategy of socioeconomic reorganization is a very complicated process that demands not only detailed scientific study but also due regard for the popular will and the consent of the leading sociopolitical forces and movements." It is necessary: "to define and formulate the social indicators of reform: its aims and also boundaries and limits, whose traversal is impermissible under any circumstances or for any reason (guaranteed subsistence minimum, employment threshold, share of expenditures for education and health services in the GNP structure, and others)"; "to reject the naive belief in the automatism of improving the economy with the help of depersonalized monetarism and to restore state regulation in its natural and generally accepted functions"; "to switch to new principles of financial stabilization on the basis of combining a tough financial-credit policy with selective support of priority spheres and production, use of various forms of regulation of prices and incomes (including the help of establishing price parities, cartel agreements, etc.), and perfection of tax and budget policy." [Pomelova] Nikolay Yakovlevich, ex-minister Boris Fedorov in his last statement appealed to the president with the statement that an economic overturn is occurring in the country. Do you agree with such a categorical assertion? [Petrakov] In my opinion, the government is now in a certain rigidity: It either faces a change, or it faces a "revolution." But this is not the point. I do not entirely understand Fedorov's position, also Gaydar's and Chubays'--in a word, people of a reformist inclination who steered the economic ship of our country. What do the macroeconomic methods they employed represent? Two levers were engaged in the fight against inflation. First, a sharp reduction in the expenditure part of the budget. Second, the same kind of sharp increase in taxes. Everything is "transparent," as in school: In order to finance the budget, it is necessary to reduce expenditures and increase taxes. This is the essence of "shock therapy" in the Russian rendition. Moreover, it is proposed that we go further on this same simple path. Now, let us take a look at what happens with expenditures. Really, expenditures are compressed to all reasonable and unreasonable limits. Moreover, reasonableness in the reduction of expenditures already exhausted itself in the first half of 1992. Further, the reduction was already some kind of irrational number. As a result, all budgetary spheres fell into poverty. Education, culture, science, and health services--wages for workers there were lower by a factor of three to eight than in industry, not to mention commerce. Or let us take another method, which was used by Minister of Finance Fedorov in fighting inflation. This is nonpayment for purchased products. It became a tradition to rebuke agriculture for the fact that it made requests. But let us analyze this: People were told that products were being bought from them at a certain price. This was the state order and mandatory deliveries that the peasant could not avoid, and he sent all his grain to the market. So they set the price, and they received the grain. But they did not want to settle accounts. That is, they simply took it. Is it possible to consider such methods state economic policy? This is no better than the surplus appropriation system of the Bolsheviks. These are absolutely not economic methods, which for some reason are presented as a monetarist approach. [Pomelova] Can you mention some decisions of the ministers who have left that would meet with your approval? [Petrakov] Hardly. When they announced that it was necessary to continue, it was not clear just what to continue. We were already up against the wall. For example, we could raise tax rates more and more. But what will this lead to? After all, business activity is already almost stifled by taxes. Instead of broadening the tax base and stimulating production with normal taxes, they simply took a colossal part of the profits. Although this had its own defects, and taxes were simply appropriated. [Pomelova] But after all, there were periods of a real drop in inflation during 1993. [Petrakov] But at whose expense did this occur? From the standpoint of economists, the temporary successes were achieved in a very strange way. In autumn I was invited to an expanded meeting of the Council of Ministers, where I heard a report by Chernomyrdin. He talked about the fact that the country had harvested 100 million tonnes at a time when it was expected that 115 million tonnes would be harvested. The "full amount was not gathered," because agricultural enterprises lacked the financial resources, and this means because of an inability to pay for fuel and materials. Because the minister of finance delayed the allocation of credits for the harvest campaign. In the end he issued them nonetheless, but many rayons received the money with significant delays. Of course, this had a beneficial effect on the inflation indices. But multiply $120 per tonne of grain (this is approximately the world price) by 15 million, and you will see what the cost of the game came to in the economy. In October, when we also observed a reduction in inflation, the situation was somewhat different. At the end of 1993, as at the end of 1992, the payments that the government were supposed to conduct in November-December were carried over to January-February 1994. The total indebtedness was on the order of 7.6 trillion rubles [R]. Generally speaking, when a professional comes to the leadership of the economy of the country, having a specific program, he is obligated to take into account the degree of resistance of the "object" to which his program is addressed. And if anyone supposed that "shock therapy," which caused a lowering of the standard of living for an overwhelming number of people, would be favorably received by them, then they are naive or infantile. It is necessary to remember the reaction of a patient when he is operated on without an anesthetic. [Pomelova] Nikolay Yakovlevich, how can the policy you propose with your program be characterized? Is this a complete turnaround from the former direction of reform? "Healing the wound" after an unsuccessful economic operation? [Petrakov] I think that even if "wounded," we should crawl to the market. Obviously the 70-year experiment to create an alternative socialist economy failed. But today the movement toward a market is occurring under conditions that are absolutely different from those of two years ago. The present stage is distinguished by mass disappointment in market ideas. I am not talking, of course, about employers and the employees of their firms, but about a majority of the citizens. It is very difficult now to change their minds and get them to believe in the advantages of a market economy. In essence, good ideas are being discredited by unskilfull realization. Nothing has such an influence on the mass consciousness as very specific examples from everyday life. The examples speak of price increases, pay delays... Thus, on the one hand, it is necessary to overcome the skepticism of the people, and on the other, the criminalization of the Russian economy. After all, prices were demonopolized without destroying state monopolies. The latter were under the complete command of specific groups of persons who were closer to these monopolies. Moreover, they got the right to free price formation. These are "capitalists" who do not need a civilized market: They do not want competition, clear tax legislation, or a well-organized customs service. A semicriminal market suits them. But such a market does not give a boost to the economy. This means that it is necessary to create competition and develop clear-cut legislation so that our capital remains in Russia and foreign capital comes to Russia. [Pomelova] The main argument of your opponents is that every kind of assistance to production or the village and any credits and privileges in the final analysis hit the pocket of the same impoverished population: After all, where else can income for the budget be obtained, if not from the purses of citizens, by imposing ever higher taxes on them? [Petrakov] I am convinced that taxes should be lowered right now. Moreover, possibly, double taxation of enterprises should be abandoned, inasmuch as the value added tax already includes in itself a tax on profit. On the other hand, why are we raising taxes? In order to pay an acceptable wage to officers, teachers, and doctors. And they have to be paid more and more, because prices are increasing. But why are prices increasing? Because any new tax or an increase in the rate of an already existing tax is already included in the price. We have a monopolized market, a producer's market; consequently, all costs are immediately included in the price. A person sees another increase in prices, he goes on strike, and his wage is increased. And so on, endlessly. That which we gain on taxes, we right away lose on wages. The tax becomes one of the main inflationary factors. [Pomelova] Is it possible unequivocally to divide methods of managing the economy into market and antimarket methods? [Petrakov] Imagine street traffic. It is subject to specific rules, you cannot drive through a red light or make a turn in an unauthorized place. But you are free to drive to wherever you want. But you can also be issued a travel authorization sheet that strictly directs movement from point A to point B, and even to load up with sand. The first example is a market measure, the second a nonmarket measure. Taxes, privileges, and various interest rates for credits--these are market measures. In other words, market measures are an expression of the state's priorities. [Pomelova] Are there any guarantees that support of production and the agrarian sector and the accelerated increase in the standard of living of citizens will not lead to a "Ukrainization" of the Russian economy? [Petrakov] The difficult economic situation in Ukraine is caused by quite specific errors on the part of the Ukrainian leadership. But other factors should also not be forgotten. This country does not possess the necessary economic self-sufficiency. It has practically no energy sources. It imports oil, gas, and timber from Russia at world prices. But the export capabilities of Ukraine are extremely limited: Consumer goods produced there are of a low quality, and the West does not need agricultural products at all. Farmers are being paid there not to expand production. Thus, the sources of hard currency revenues are extremely limited, and this is the main reason for the decline in the Ukrainian economy. The situation in Russia is entirely different. Energy resources keep us and will continue to keep us afloat. But our inflation rates give no justification to boast before Ukraine. When they say that the ruble has started working, they do not mention that they want to spend it immediately. And until it becomes a means of accumulation, it will remain a falling currency, and until that time we will be unable to ensure normal business activity. [end Petrakov] From the editorial office. The draft "Socioeconomic Reorganization in Russia: Current Situation and New Approaches" has evoked a lot of criticism. In our opinion, it suffers from excessive emotionalism in its assessment of the policy being conducted and of the politicians who are conducting it. On the other hand, the specific approaches proposed by the authors to put their program into practice are not entirely clear. For example, lowering taxes and in this way expanding the tax base (that is, the number of enterprise commodity producers and the volume of products that they produce) can improve the budget only in the future, and not in the very near future. At whose expense should production, which is dying today, be supported? Nevertheless, the program has sharply stated a problem to which we can no longer remain thoughtlessly indifferent. The drop in production has reached a critical line. But production in our country is not only an economic factor, it is also a social and political factor. Its crash is capable of provoking a crash of stability in Russia. It is also impossible not to mention Artem Tarasov's praise regarding the study: "Perhaps this is the first time we are being familiarized with a draft of an economic concept that can be discussed, and not with a ready guide for action published in a newspaper."
