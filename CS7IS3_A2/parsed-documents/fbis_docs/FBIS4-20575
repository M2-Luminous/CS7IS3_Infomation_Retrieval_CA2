While, among the icosahedral boron solids, both _a_- and _b_-rhombohedral boron have crystalline structures similar to that of f.c.c. C[.sub]60[/] in their dimensions, as well. The disparities, however, between them are listed as follows. - The interaction between the soccer-ball clusters is covalent in _b_-B. - The soccer-ball cage of _b_-B is not empty (2 icosahedra are in it). - As for doping sites of _b_-B rhombohedron, two tetrahedral sites have almost the same size as those in f.c.c. C[.sub]60[/], while octahedral site is occupied with another boron cluster (there are two other kinds of sites in _b_-B). This paper reports the study on the electronic properties of icosahedral boron solids in the way of doping electrons from alkali metal and other groups of metal. Experimental Alkali metal was evaporated and doped into _b_-B crystal in sealed glass tube.[.sup]1[/] Cu and Al doped samples were precipitated from B, Cu and Al melts (I. Higashi, et al.). X-ray diffraction analysis was carried out for structural investigation, conductivity was measured in van der Pauw method and magnetic susceptibility was obtained by SQUID. Results and Discussion The measured conductivity showed a variable range hopping type conduction rather than thermal activation type one, and the values at room temperature increased with increasing Cu and Li concentration. The magnetic susceptibility obtained was the superposition of diamagnetic component and Curie-Weiss type paramagnetic one. Up to about 2at.% of Cu concentration and after Li doping, doped electron showed little contribution to each component. To clarify these properties, the band scheme of _b_-B is drawn qualitatively as follows. A localized intrinsic acceptor level islocated above the valence band. This level is thought to be originated from a split-off intramolecular orbital of an electron deficient B[.sub]12[/] distorted by the Jahn-Teller effect. Since doped electron occupies only this level, neither metallic conduction nor magnetism (Pauli paramagnetism as in the case of alkali metal doped C[.sub]60[/]) is observed. In addition, formation of singlet bipolaron at the level may prevent the electron to contribute to localized magnetic moment. Conclusion The crystalline structure of _b_-rhombohedral boron is essentially similar to that of f.c.c. C[.sub]60[/]. Doped electron in _b_-B shows variable range hopping type conduction and hardly contributes to magnetic susceptibility up to several atomic percentages. The electron occupies an intrinsic acceptor level originated from B[.sub]12[/] icosahedral cluster and may form bipolaron. References 1. R.C. Haddon, et al., NATURE, Vol 350, 1991, p 320.
