ACTION: Notice of Reissuance of a NPDES General Permit to the State of Florida. SUMMARY: The Regional Administrator, EPA, Region IV intends to reissue the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) General Permit No. FLG830000 to facilities within the political boundary of the State of Florida. This proposed reissued NPDES general permit proposes effluent limitations, prohibitions, reporting requirements and other conditions on facilities which discharge uncontaminated groundwater associated with dewatering or treated groundwater and/or storm water incidental to the groundwater cleanup operation which have been contaminated by automotive gasoline, aviation and/or diesel fuels. This permit authorizes discharges from facilities currently located in and discharging to surface waters within the political boundary of the State of Florida, and any new treatment facilities placed in operation during the term of this permit. Except for facilities meeting the conditions of Part I.3, written notice of intent to be covered by the reissued NPDES general permit shall be provided to the Permit Issuing Authority prior to initiation of any discharge to waters of the United States. For facilities that must submit a Notice of Intent (NOI), coverage by this NPDES general permit is authorized upon receipt of written notification of coverage from the Permit Issuing Authority. The proposed reissued permit contains limitations on the amounts of pollutants allowed to be discharged and was drafted in accordance with the provisions of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq. ) and other lawful standards and regulations. The pollutant limitations and other permit conditions are tentative and open to comment from the public. ADDRESSES: Persons wishing to comment upon or object to any aspects of a specific permit reissuance or wishing to request a public hearing, are invited to submit same in writing within thirty (30) days of this notice to the Office of Public Affairs, Environmental Protection Agency, 345 Courtland Street, NE., Atlanta, Georgia 30365, Attention: Ms. Lena Scott, Public Notice Coordinator. Pursuant to 40 CFR 124.13, any person who believes that any permit condition is inappropriate must raise all reasonably ascertainable issues and position, by the close of the comment period. The public notice number and NPDES number should be included in the first page of comments. All comments received within the 30-day period will be considered in the formulation of a final determination regarding the reissuance of this NPDES general permit. Also, within the 30-day period any interested person may request a public hearing. Where there is a significant degree of public interest in the proposed general permit reissuance, the EPA Regional Administrator will schedule and hold a public hearing which would be formally announced in accordance with 40 CFR 124.10 and 124.12. After consideration of all written comments and the requirements and policies in the Act and appropriate regulations, the EPA Regional Administrator will make a determination regarding the reissuance of this NPDES general permit. If the determination is substantially unchanged from that announced by this notice, the EPA Regional Administrator will so notify all persons submitting written comments. If the determination is substantially changed, the EPA Regional Administrator will issue a public notice indicating the revised determination. A formal hearing is available to challenge any NPDES permit issued under 40 CFR 124.14 except for a general permit. Persons affected by a general permit may not challenge the conditions of a general permit as a right in further agency proceedings. They may instead either challenge the general permit in court, or apply for an individual permit under 40 CFR 122.21 as authorized at 40 CFR 122.28 and then request a formal hearing on the issuance or denial of an individual permit.
