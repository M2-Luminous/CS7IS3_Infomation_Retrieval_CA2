FR940111-0-00034 FR940111-0-00008 Equivalency to the FLEX Public Law 102&hyph;232 provides that alien physicians who wish to perform patient care in the United States must, among other things, pass the FLEX examination or an equivalent examination as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. By notice published on September 16, 1992 at 57 FR 42755, the Secretary of Health and Human Services designated Parts I, II, and III of the National Board of Medical Examiners certifying examinations and the Steps 1, 2, and 3 examinations of the United States Medical Licensing Examinations program as equivalent to the FLEX. Six commenters suggested that the Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada (LMCC), the Canadian medical licensing procedure, or a State license should also be determined to be equivalent to the FLEX. A determination that the LMCC or a state license is equivalent to the FLEX is outside the scope of the Service's authority. Competency in the English Language Public Law 102&hyph;232 also requires that graduates of medical schools coming to the United States to perform services in the medical professions must demonstrate competency in oral and written English or be a graduate of a school of medicine accredited by a body or bodies approved for that purpose by the Secretary of Education. The interim rule contains the requirement that a petitioner may demonstrate English competency by submitting evidence that the alien has passed the English test given by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG). The interim regulation did not contain any additional tests or mechanisms to establish competency in the English language but it was stated in the preamble to the interim rule that the Service would consider other suggestions to demonstrate competency. Two commenters suggested that the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) should be recognized as an alternate test to establish English competency. Since the results of the TOEFL are reported as a raw score which must be interpreted by the entity reviewing the score, and the administrators of the test have not established a passing grade for the test, the Service cannot adopt this suggestion since it does not have the expertise or resources to interpret this test. Two commenters also suggested that the Service recognize that graduates of medical schools located in an English-speaking country in which the language of instruction is also English have competency in the English language. Since the statutory language already addresses the issue of language competency in relation to graduation from certain universities, the adoption of this suggestion would be in conflict with the statutory language. Licensure The interim rule requires that a petition for a physician coming to the United States to perform services in the medical profession must be accompanied by evidence that the physician has a license or authorization required by the State of intended employment, if the state requires such license or authorization. This language was adopted to ensure that at the time the petition was filed the physician and met the regulatory requirements relating to the practice of medicine in the state of intended employment. The regulation also recognizes that, in certain instances, a state may not require a physician to obtain an actual medical license in order to perform the duties of a particular position. Two commenters suggested that the regulations of the state of intended employment should dictate which type of license, if any, should be required by the Service. This suggested regulatory change is unnecessary since it is already provided for in the language of the interim rule at ยง214.2(h)(4)(viii)(A)( 1 ). One commenter also noted that certain physicians employer by the United States government, such as the Veterans Administration, are not required to possess a license issued by the state of intended employment hut merely require a license from any state. The final rule has been amended to accommodate this situation.
