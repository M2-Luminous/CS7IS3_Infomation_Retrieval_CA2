"In 1988 the amount of enterprises losing money was about 10 percent. Now with the new system of accounting, more than two- thirds of the enterprises have both clear and hidden losses," the CHINA BUSINESS TIMES reported. "The state economy while taking up 70 percent of current loans and more than 70 percent of fixed asset investments only account for 20 to 30 percent of the country's gross production value and make up only 42 percent of the national economy," the report said. "The reform of state-run enterprises is a main battle front in this year's comprehensive reform program which will aim at attacking issues dealing with property rights," delegates were reported as saying at a Shenzhen meeting. The meeting was being held to commemorate paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's famous "southern tour" in 1992, which spurred China's economy to 13 percent growth rates over the last two years. Yang Qi of the Research Committee under the State Commission for the Restructuring of the Economy, called on every level of government to quickly auction off small state-run enterprises or implement shareholding or public ownership reforms, the report said. Yang also called on medium-sized state-run enterprises to quickly change into a system of mixed ownership, by attracting diverse funds through all channels, while some medium and large enterprises must become standard corporations, it said. Wang Jue of the Central Party School said state-run enterprises in urban areas must change into a mixed ownership system and principal property rights should be diversified. Chinese leaders have called 1994 an important year in reforming the centrally planned economy. The reform of state-run enterprises, which could mean taking away cradle-to-grave benefits and laying off parts of a huge work force, seems to be an almost impossible task.
