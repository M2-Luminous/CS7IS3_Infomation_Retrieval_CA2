The statement was made by Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing at the international symposium on China's strategy for foreign economy and trade opened here today. Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Director General of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Peter Sutherland made speeches at the symposium. This is the first symposium of its kind to be held in China. In his speeches, Li said that China's foreign trade strategy is of vital importance to China's modernization drive as well as to the Asian and world economies, for China has a large population, a vast market and rich resources. He said that China has made active contributions to the world economy and trade with the speeding up of China's economic development and expansion of its opening since the '80s, which has drawn attention from all over the world. He continued that in the latter half of the '90s, China's economy will maintain sustained, fast and healthy development and China's market will be more open, so China will continue to make its due contributions to the world economy. Wu Yi, minister of China's foreign trade and economic cooperation, said in her report at the symposium that although China's foreign trade has achieved substantial development, it can not fully meet the requirements of China's modernization construction, adding that China's foreign trade has a vast potential. Wu gave a detailed description of China's foreign trade in her report titled "Opportunities and Prospects: Basic Framework for China's Foreign Trade in the 1990s". She pointed out that China's economy is to be brought further in line with international practices and China will learn from successful international experience to formulate a suitable foreign trade strategy so as to ensure its development. Before the opening of the symposium, Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing met with some foreign attendants.
