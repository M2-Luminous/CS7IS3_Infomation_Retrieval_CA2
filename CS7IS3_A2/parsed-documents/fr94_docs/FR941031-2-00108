FR941031-2-00108 FR941031-2-00078 Privacy Act of 1974; Computer Matching Programs agency: Small Business Administration. action: Notice of computer matching programs. summary: Pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974, the Small Business Administration (SBA) is giving notice of its intent to participate in two computer matching programs. The matches will compare records of delinquent SBA disaster home loan debtors against records of United States Postal Service employees and against records of Federal employees and military members, active or retired. If matches are found, SBA will use the information to collect the delinquent debt through salary offset or administrative offset. dates: This proposed action will become effective November 30, 1994, and the computer matching will proceed accordingly without further notice, unless comments are received which would result in a contrary determination or if the Office of Management and Budget or Congress objects to the conduct of the matches. Any public comment must be received before the effective date. addresses: Any interested party may submit written comments to the Chief, Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts Office, 409 Third Street, SW., Washington, DC 20416. for further information contact: Walter C. Intlekofer, Deputy Director, Office of Portfolio Management, Small Business Administration, 409 Third Street, SW., Washington, DC 20416. (202) 205&hyph;6481. supplementary information: Pursuant to subsection (0) of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, (5 U.S.C. 552a), the SBA has entered into agreements to conduct computer matching programs with two recipient agencies, the Department of Defense, Defense Manpower Data Center (DoD, DMDC) and the United States Postal Service (USPS). The purpose of the matches is to compare SBA delinquent loan data with personnel records stored at the DoD, DMDC and USPS to determine whether SBA can proceed with salary or administrative offset against the salaries or other benefits of delinquent debtors pursuant to the Debt Collection Act of 1982. The DoD records contain information on Federal personnel, civilian and military, employed and retired. The USPS records contain information on USPS employees. SBA will provide tapes or other magnetic media containing delinquent debtor data to DoD and USPS. DoD and USPS will perform the matches, return SBA's data, and report any ``hits''. A DoD ``hit'' will show that a delinquent debtor is a Federal employee, a retired Federal employee, an active member of the military, or a retired member of the military. A USPS hit will show that the delinquent debtor is a USPS employee. The records to be matched are contained in Privacy Act Systems in each agency. SBA, the source agency, will extract names and Social Security numbers from ``Litigation and Claims Files SBA&hyph;070'' and ``Loan Case Files SBA 075'' published in the Federal Register on February 26, 1991, and revised on May 14, 1992 at 57 FR 20726. DoD DMDC will match the SBA information against ``Federal Creditor Agency Debt Collection Data Base, S322.11 DMDC'' published at 58 FR 10875 on February 22, 1993. USPS will match the SBA data against ``Finance Records_Payroll System, USPS 050.020,'' published at 57 FR 57515 on December 4, 1992. The matching program will begin on the effective date of this notice and be effective for 18 months. It may be extended for 12 months after that. SBA will learn the debtor's service or agency, category and current work or home address. SBA will use the information to collect the delinquent debt through administrative or salary offset as provided by the Debt Collection Act of 1982 and SBA regulations. The parties to these agreements have determined that a computer matching program is the most efficient, effective and expeditious method of obtaining and processing the information needed to determine whether SBA delinquent debtors are receiving salaries or other benefits that can be offset. Computer matching also appears to be the manner to accomplish this task with the least amount of intrusion into the personal privacy of the individuals concerned. The principal alternative to using a computer matching program for identifying such employees would be a manual comparison of all records of SBA delinquent debtors with the records of all military members and all Federal civilian employees and all Federal retirees. Copies of the computer matching agreements between DoD and SBA and between USPS and SBA are available to the public upon request. Requests should be submitted to the Chief, Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts Office, 409 Third Street, SW., Washington, DC 20416. The matching agreements and an advance copy of this notice must be submitted to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget. These matching programs are subject to review by OMB and Congress and shall not become effective until that review period has elapsed. Dated: October 5, 1994. Cassandra M. Pulley, Acting Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26886 Filed 10&hyph;28&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 8025&hyph;01&hyph;M
