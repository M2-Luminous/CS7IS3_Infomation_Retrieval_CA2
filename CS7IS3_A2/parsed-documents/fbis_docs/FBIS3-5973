"I am not ambitious to serve as president for life," the president said in a dialog with members of National Youth Committee (KNPI). He said that the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) must be able to find a new president. During the dialogue, a KNPI member requested that the head of state be ready to serve another five year term after his current presidential tenure expires in 1998. In response to the proposal, the president said: "Please count how old I am at that time (he was born in 1921 ed.) this must be taken into account." He said that the law of the nature must be considered, referring to the decreasing ability of a person due to old age. "God will provide guidance. Moreover, children today are clever," the head of state said. When another KNPI member suggested that the president prepare a "crown" in order to keep the state policies unchanged even if there is a change in the state leadership, Suharto said that it would not happen as long as the MPR decrees are implemented well. On the occasion the president reiterated that he would not step down before the completion of his constitutional tenure in 1998.
