The Peruvian economy had shrunk by an amazing 20 percent during the two previous years and inflation was running at 7,000 percent. A U.S. company that specializes in risk analysis rated Peru as the most dangerous place in the world to do business. Over a span of less than four years, President Fujimori has managed to overcome formidable obstacles. His government has dealt such a heavy blow to the Shining Path that many Peruvians who had to emigrate -- and even some tourists -- are returning to what used to be battlefields. Fujimori's free trade policy has curbed inflation and turned our country into the fastest growing economy in the Americas. It is hardly surprising that he now enjoys overwhelming popularity among his fellow countrymen. Despite all this, Fujimori has been unable to achieve one crucial victory -- to be accepted by the U.S. Government. Some U.S. officials say Fujimori's achievements will always be stained by the harsh tactics he used to redress that state of affairs. In April 1992, President Fujimori dissolved Congress, suspended the Constitution, and took almost total control of the country on the grounds that this was the only way to prevent the savage Shining Path from seizing power and to end dilatory tactics in the Peruvian Congress which thwarted the economic reform. Peruvians applauded Fujimori's decision to wage a war against the guerrillas and to undertake economic reforms. The United States, however, condemned his actions and suspended its economic aid even though Fujimori kept his promise of holding Parliamentary elections to draft a new Constitution. Human rights associations and leftist groups displayed more concern about this than about the suffering of the Peruvian people when their lives were at the mercy of Shining Path terrorists -- at the mercy of whom they still are to a certain extent because the Shining Path killed 750 people last year. U.S. Congress leaders and President Clinton contend that it is impossible to settle the issue of U.S. economic aid to Peru unless Fujimori takes additional steps to strengthen the democratic process and to improve respect for human rights in Peru. Nevertheless, the Clinton administration does not consider democracy to be a top priority when dealing with countries that are more strategically important. Washington openly endorsed Yeltsin when he dissolved the Russian Parliament last year. Fujimori argues that Yeltsin undoubtedly drew his inspiration from Peru and that Russian intelligence services consulted their Peruvian counterparts before Yeltsin's action. Private investors have already reached their own conclusions concerning Peru and are expeditiously acting to support our country through their investments because it offers so many possibilities, is making headway to consolidate its stability, and its president enjoys enormous popularity at home. It is high time for the Clinton administration to give up its hypocritical and moralistic attitude, which it readily overlooks whenever interests dictate, and to resume its economic aid to Peru.
