Some time ago, RDRM Chairman Gavriil Popov advanced this initiative at the movement's congress. According to the sources, the Public Chamber is to be set up to ensure coordination between the Russian Federation federal executive agencies and public associations, to draw up presidential and government decisions on the most important social and political matters taking into account public opinion, and to create a feedback channel between public association and state authorities. It is expected that if the directive is signed the first meeting of the Public Chamber may take place as early as one of the last 10 days of February.
