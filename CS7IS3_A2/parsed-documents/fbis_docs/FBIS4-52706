Japanese officials plan to conduct negotiations with Taiwanese officials at the same time as a working-level meeting is being held 17 May in Geneva to discuss Taiwan's bid for GATT membership. The Japanese officials plan to submit a list of Japan's requests at that time. Taiwan has prohibited the importation of automobiles and several other products from Japan. Unless Taiwan abolishes such protectionist measures, the Japanese Government does not plan to support the country's bid for GATT membership. In addition to automobiles (excluding those with engine displacement exceeding 3,000 cubic centimeters), Taiwan has prohibited imports of motorcycles, liquor, cigarettes, and apples from Japan to protect its domestic industries. The country has also placed restrictions against Japanese firms' entries in bids for government procurement contracts. However, Taiwan has opened its markets to automobiles and motorcycles, among other products, shipped from Europe and the United States. Therefore, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry considers "Taiwan's measures are discriminatory against Japan." The government also plans to ask Taiwan to lower its tariff rates in addition to abolishing such discriminatory measures. Although the average tariff rate is 5 percent in Taiwan, tariff rates on durable consumer products are still very high. For example, the tariff rate is 30 percent on automobiles, 42 percent on trucks, and 22.5 percent on video tape recorders. The government plans to ask Taiwan to lower tariff rates especially on these items. Along with Taiwan, the PRC has been making preparations to gain membership in GATT by the end of this year. GATT member nations have agreed that "Taiwan will join GATT after the PRC has joined." The PRC has also virtually approved Taiwan's membership in GATT.
