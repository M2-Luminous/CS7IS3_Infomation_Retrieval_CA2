Whereas attempts by Ukraine's Ministry of Defense to establish contacts with Western partners invariably meet with support and even understanding, any movement from that department in an easterly direction gives rise to mistrust and even protests. Just recall the widespread condemnation of the meeting of ministers of defense of the CIS countries in Ashgabat. At that time, an extremely broad range of emphatic accusations were voiced, starting with admonitions for the allegedly servile position assumed by Ukraine's Ministry of Defense and ending with "exposures" of the secret intentions of "hostile forces" to join the Collective Security Treaty. However, realities are such that the East is by no means less important for Ukraine, than the West. Even from the point of view of this circumstance alone, the recent visit by our military delegation to Almaty and Tashkent could not fail to give rise to intense public interest. Its leader, Ukraine's deputy minister of defense Colonel General Ivan Oliynyk repeatedly stressed that Ukraine is building relations with its partners on the principles of mutual respect, trust, and mutual advantage. This determined the readiness to discuss all the apparently most acute issues. Both Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan are interested in regaining, as fast as possible, the technology and armaments of their national armies (as of 1992) that are presently stored at Ukraine's repairs enterprises. The Ukrainian side confirmed its readiness to immediately return that technology to the clients, taking into account the cost of the operations performed on them. Right at the negotiating table, an order was issued to prepare military convoys for shipment; even the procedure for arming the guards who would accompany them was discussed. As a result, trains with repaired military technology will soon set off eastward. The Ukrainian side not only expressed its readiness to provide its own repairs base for the services of Kazakhstan's and Uzbekistan's military departments, but also to improve those that they have. Research institutes in these countries have been invited to take part in elaborating an intensive modernization of military technology. For its part, Ukraine is interested in repairing military transport aviation aircraft at Uzbekistan's enterprises and in using the Baykonur space-vehicle launching site and Kazakhstan's unique testing areas for implementing our scientific research programs. Incidentally, the subject of space missiles was a major topic at the negotiations in both Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Each one of these countries has its matchless missile technology and scientific research basis. Cooperation in this sphere will be extremely useful and advantageous for all sides taking part in the negotiations. In both Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, the sides reached an understanding of the fact that large-scale relationships between the military departments must be reinforced by bilateral agreements on military cooperation at the level of heads of state. Draft agreements are already in the process of elaboration. If such documents are signed, this will open up wide prospects for the interaction between Ukraine, on the one hand, and Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, on the other, in the military technological sphere. It is worth recalling that a very telling phrase has been included in the communique on the results of the negotiations and in the protocols that have been signed: "...bilateral contacts are in conformity with the international agreement of obligations of the sides and ... do not restrict the interests of any of the third countries." Both right after the disintegration of the Union and in the years that followed, it was difficult to picture a state that would come out in favor of integration within the framework of the CIS more consistently than Kazakhstan. However, today, even there, people seem to realize that the role of the leader in the tight pack "Russia -- the rest of the CIS countries" may result in more of a headache than mutual advantage. For example, no sooner did Kazakhstan raise the question of fair principles in withdrawing nuclear weapons from its territory, than Russia immediately responded by launching its propaganda campaign, which has already been tested in Ukraine, to the effect that "Kazakhstan's nuclear facilities are in a critical state." The result was directly opposite to that expected. According to chief of General Staff of Kazakhstan's Armed Forces Major General Alibek Kasymov, today, the removal of nuclear munitions from Kazakhstan has been halted, with the exception of those whose service life has expired or that have serious defects. It might seem that Kazakhstan's right to exercise control over the Baykonur space-vehicle launching site, situated on its territory, is beyond doubt. The initial attempts to exercise this right resulted in a sharp reaction on the part of Moscow: We, they said, will adapt the Plesetsk space-vehicle launching site for our own purposes and, after we withdraw, Baykonur will fall apart on its own. Just like that! Uzbekistan is encountering similar problems -- although at a different level. The disintegration of the centralized system of management has painfully affected everything, starting from replenishing the weapons arsenal and ending with logistic support. Despite the requests of assistance in most elementary issues, yesterday's "big brother" remains unmoved. A paradoxical situation is taking shape in which Russia's excessive striving for leadership and the related arrogance discredits the Collective Security Treaty and turns it into fiction, although Russia itself is one of its most active proponents. Against this background, mutually advantageous bilateral military cooperation between countries of the CIS may be much more productive and intensive than within the framework of a collective treaty. There are no contradictions here. First, potential customers and real producers can do away with the services of the great go-between in relations between one other. For example, systems of weapons manufactured in Kazakhstan may be sent directly to Ukrainian depots, bypassing the "book-keeping" of Russian military-industrial structures, and so on. This itself promises considerable savings of funds. Second, bilateral cooperation will raise the potential of every state manifold. For example, not a single one of them, including Russia, is capable of maintaining such a facility as Baykonur on its own. However, this particular space-vehicle launching site may be efficiently used and serviced with the help of joint bi- or multilateral space-missile programs. Third, the system of relations on the bilateral basis rules out the creation of military alliances and, as a result, the very possibility of confrontation. In our specific case, a step has been made toward a kind of "partnership for peace" on the territory of the former USSR. Finally, fourth, the more actively the states use one another's industrial base, the less dependent they will be upon the former center. However, strange this might sound, this will be a guarantee of the irreversibility of democratic transformations in Russia itself. The sooner Russia rids itself of the illusions on the "spheres of influence," the sooner it will emerge at the level of normal partnership relations with other CIS countries, which, incidentally, at present, only demand equality and respect for themselves. The recent visit by Ukraine's military delegation to Almaty and Tashkent is one of the first signs of the fundamentally new approach toward mutually advantageous cooperation between Ukraine and CIS countries. However, as is known, spring inevitably follows the arrival of the first swallow....
