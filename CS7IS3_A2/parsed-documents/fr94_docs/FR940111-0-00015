FR940111-0-00015 FR940111-0-00005 While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits derived by the operation of the marketing orders. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It is found that the specified expenses for the marketing orders covered in this rulemaking are reasonable and likely to be incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rates to cover such expenses will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register [5 U.S.C. 553] because the Committee and Board need to have sufficient funds to pay their expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis. The 1993&hyph;94 fiscal periods for the programs began on August 1, 1993. The marketing orders require that the rates of assessment for the fiscal periods apply to all assessable tomatoes and walnuts handled during the fiscal periods. In addition, handlers are aware of these actions which were recommended by the Committee and Board at public meetings and published in the Federal Register as interim final rules.
