It goes without saying that just as in any experiment in which one does not implement the known methods and procedures, so in the one on the territory of the former Yugoslav federation one ignores valid norms of international law and universally accepted principles of the UN Charter, the Helsinki Act of the CSCE, the Paris Charter for a New Europe, and other international conventions. The most recent foul massacre of innocent civilians in Sarajevo -- carried out according to an already used scenario and with a strong media campaign against the Serbs who are accused without any proofs -- has been planned with a view to postponing peace negotiations indefinitely and forcing the Serbian side to make new concessions to the Muslims. As we already know, this has been used as an excuse for the world centers of power to exert pressure on the Serbs again, which was also demonstrated at the aforementioned NATO meeting in Brussels. It is no coincidence that Manfred Woerner, secretary general of that only remaining military-political alliance, was given the honor of triumphantly announcing one more ultimatum to the Serbs on the model of the one from the distant 1914. It is not surprising as it is coming from the German Woerner. He would like to settle the debts from the wars gone by. However, we are asking what we have done to our European allies and the United States to make them constantly threaten us. Perhaps by being on these regions for centuries, we are standing in the way of their cartographers who would like to delineate new spheres of interest on the already multicolored political map of the Balkans. And interests -- as their slogan says -- are stronger than distant war alliances and friendships. One should not therefore be surprised when current U.S. President Clinton frequently stresses that he harbors true fondness for better positions of the Bosnian Muslims, in which he is supported by a large group of oil-rich Islamic countries and France, Great Britain, and, of course, Germany, not to mention others. By reading more carefully the announcement of the NATO Council of 9 February, which obviously encroaches onto the powers of the UN Security Council, one notices an ultimatum-like demand issued to the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw heavy weapons to 20 km from the center of Sarajevo in 10 days starting from 10 February 1994 at 2400. The demand to Muslim authorities is to put their heavy weaponry under UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Force] control within the same deadline and, as it is written, to refrain from attacks along the existing lines of confrontation in the city. Further on, it is pointed out that heavy weaponry of any of the sides which is found within the forbidden zone will be exposed to air strikes by the NATO forces which will be carried out in close coordination with the UN secretary general and in conformity with the decisions of the NATO Council. Even such as it is, this document could be a step toward the calming down of the clashes. However, the experiences they have had so far warn the Bosnian Serbs to be cautious, because who is to guarantee that the Muslims will not again stage a performance for the world media so that the command of the NATO southern wing may order air strikes at the Serbs? The Serbs will in that case not sit with their arms crossed and head bowed but will respond according to their own possibilities which, as even the potential attackers admit, are not to be underestimated. Some time at the beginning of last year, one could read in the MOSCOW NEWS the statement by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev on the occasion of the demand by the Western partners for Russia to take into account the pressure by Muslim countries when assessing these partners' behavior towards the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. If we agreed with the very possibility of pressure by the countries that see the Bosnian Muslims as their clients, then it is easy to imagine the formation of a group of Christian countries, with a division into a Catholic and Orthodox groups within it. Then the third world war as well can really begin in Sarajevo.
