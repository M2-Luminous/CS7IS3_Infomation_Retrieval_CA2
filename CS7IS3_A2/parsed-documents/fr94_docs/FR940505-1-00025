FR940505-1-00025 FR940505-1-00012 The FIP proposes a federal enhanced motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program. If California adopts an approvable enhanced I/M program, EPA will either withdraw or refrain from promulgating this federal program. The FIP proposes stringent emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles and provisions to limit usage of older and dirtier heavy-duty trucks within the State and the FIP areas. The FIP describes federal rulemakings in progress for both light and heavy-duty categories of nonroad engines, and proposes additional measures in the FIP areas. The proposed FIP includes innovative control programs to reduce emissions associated with airports and, particularly within the South Coast, emissions from locomotives, ships, and ports. EPA proposes rules, specific to each area, for industrial and commercial sources, and proposes to implement on a statewide basis federal rules for architectural coatings, consumer products, aerosol spray paints, and pesticides. EPA also proposes an ``emissions cap'' program, which allows sources the flexibility to develop their own compliance approach in order to achieve the needed annual emissions reductions. Finally, EPA proposes to approve in part and disapprove in part the proposed South Coast CO State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision designed to address CO requirements of the 1990 Amendments to the Act. DATES: Written comments on the proposal will be accepted throughout the public comment process. EPA expects to hold public hearings in early July 1994, and expects that the deadline for written comments will be approximately 30 days after the public hearings. EPA will give notice in the Federal Register of the public hearings and public comment deadline as soon as possible, but at least 30 days prior to the hearing dates. ADDRESSES: Written comments on the proposed FIP and SIP promulgations must be received by EPA at the address below on or before the close of the public comment period.
