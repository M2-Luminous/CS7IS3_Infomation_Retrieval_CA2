JNP legislators Satsuki Eda and Satoshi Arai filed the proposal with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, the sources said. Kaishin comprises 130 members in the House of Representatives of four coalition parties -- Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], JNP, the Democratic Socialist Party and Jiyuto (Liberals) -- plus five independents. The April 25 establishment of Kaishin led to the departure of the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] from the ruling coalition, forcing Hata to form a minority government. Kaishin ranks second in terms of strength in the lower house only after the main opposition party, the Liberal Democratic Party.
