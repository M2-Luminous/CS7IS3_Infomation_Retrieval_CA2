Speaking at a news conference in this southwestern city of Kyushu, Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren) said, "the government needs to figure out ways, with a public consensus, to secure financial sources to cover tax cuts, taking full account of the rapid aging of Japanese society." He was referring to the government's decision Tuesday to slash income and other taxes worth 5.47 trillion yen as part of a pump-priming package aimed at lifting the flagging economy out of the doldrums. The government is to form a consultative body to discuss the funding question for enactment by the end of the year. Hiraiwa sought an early implementation of the 15.25 trillion yen economy-boosting package, saying a delay would sap its effect on the economy.
