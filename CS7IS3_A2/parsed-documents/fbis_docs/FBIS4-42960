[Mock] (laughs) And you will probably not want to hear the answer anymore: Ask me on 13 June, after the referendum. No, seriously, I am very well. Just after the operation I was a bit suspicious, because I did not feel any pain at all anymore. The next two, three months will be important, then I can overdo it a bit again. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] You are not worried about your health, are you? But what about membership in the European Union [EU]? [Mock] If one is dedicated to something, one is always a bit worried. But, in the end, I trust Austrians will understand. Voters realize that this is not just any election, but a decision that will determine the country's entire position for a long time to come. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] How would you evaluate the current EU debate, do you have any objections? [Mock] Arguments like the ones that we have to supply water to Spain and must build nuclear power plants, are simply irresponsible, they annoy me. I respect anyone who votes "no" for certain reasons, but I do not respect such arguments. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Which brings us to the role of the opposition. You are one of those who do not exclude Freedom Party Chairman Joerg Haider from fundamental considerations. Will you stick to this position even if accession to the EU fails because of, among others, him? [Mock] I have often talked with Haider and also with Voggenhuber [of the Greens], who certainly does not play second fiddle to Haider as regards rhetoric. Even in the case of failure we must continue to be ready to talk to each other. The fact that Haider is now often using excessive rhetoric is his business. It is profoundly regrettable for our country, but it does not excite me much. I do not think of Haider so highly that I would say that he alone has prevented membership. However, Haider's extremely harsh rhetoric is certainly not healthy for our country, and if the referendum fails, Haider will have to be held largely responsible for it, but the same also goes for the government. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Haider, who, until recently, said that the Austrian nation is a monstrosity, now argues that one must vote against membership of the EU out of patriotism for Austria. [Mock] Quite apart from the problem that arises when such arguments come from this side, in particular as a patriotic Austrian one must vote for membership. Membership strengthens our country. One must also include history in one's considerations. In 1948, when the Marshall Plan was initiated and the first schedules were established: It was said, the Dutch need loans for seven or, I do not know, 10 years, the Germans for 15 years, just as the Belgians, and only for one country was no specific date set; this country was not viable, it had to be subsidized longer. This was Austria. And today one has to defend the fact that we are net payers. This is absurd. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] What kind of feeling is it to know that, if the outcome of the referendum is yes, you will enter history as the foreign minister who led Austria into the EU? [Mock] I do not know whether there is any way to examine whether, in 100 or 150 years, I will have entered history. Many people believed that they would figure in the history books and then did not find themselves there, others have been there for a very long time for good or bad reasons. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] What would it mean for you personally if Austria became an EU member? [Mock] In my political career, EU membership is the most important thing. I would be enormously glad if we became a member. I am really very dedicated to this matter. My heart is really in it. Austria would be able to have its say in Europe and would not be some sort of appendage. This would mean very much to me. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Do you see the future of the EU only in a rosy light or are there also dangers? [Mock] The greatest danger is that integration is not yet irreversible. Making it irreversible requires another generation of forming an awareness and of interaction. Another outbreak of nationalism in the EU cannot be ruled out. And the demons of the past are, unfortunately, not yet dead. They are stored in the cupboard of history, and a wrong policy can bring them out again. The door to the cupboard has already been rattled, but it has remained shut so far --thanks also to Helmut Kohl, who has worked long on integration with great intensity. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Perhaps also out of fear of the strength of one's own country? [Mock] Perhaps not out of fear, but out of concern, because if integration is reversed, if it fails, then, sooner or later, there will again be the realistic and great danger of a development toward war in Europe. One must also beware, also of oneself. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Could there be a problem for Austria if the EU referendum results in only a very narrow positive vote? [Mock] Yes, this can be a problem, because then someone will naturally contest the referendum, and this may lead to a terrible mess and an enormous loss of reputation. Many countries are waiting for our referendum results: Switzerland, the Scandinavians. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] If the referendum were negative, could you then imagine that another referendum would be held soon afterwards? [Mock] No, the opportunity would then be over for five, 10, 20 years. The Norwegians, who said no in 1972, would be very happy today if they were already members. At that time there no Spanish and Portuguese, and fishing rights would not have been any problem. And, with all due respect, I would not want the Hungarians and the Poles to dictate the new conditions for membership to us at some time in the future. Now the negotiations were good, and this opportunity should be seized. There are even many in the EU who say that we have been given too much because we were so stubborn. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] What historic significance does the result of the EU referendum now have for Austria? [Mock] Apart from the State Treaty, this is the most important decision in the Second Republic. The State Treaty turned us into a member of the community of states again, and now there is the question of whether we want to remain a member in the future or to become a subject. It is strange that people say we must reform the EU from the outside and, at the same time, claim that, if we are inside, we have no say at all. For our country this is the most important decision for a long, long time to come. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] There are polls that say that you are enjoying the highest credibility both among advocates and skeptics. Is this not a reason for you to tell the voters: You are doing me a favor if you vote for the European Union? [Mock] I think they are not doing a favor to me, but to the country if they vote yes. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Would you also consider announcing your resignation to influence voters? [Mock] No, this would be the wrong thing. With this I would exert pressure, and this is not what I want to do. I want to convince them. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] There are many things that speak for Austria's membership in the EU. Some things speak against it. Which ones, for instance? [Mock] There are a number of difficulties that we will face if we join the EU, for instance stronger competition or the adjustment of the monopolies to the free market. But without the EU we would have to implement even tougher reforms to be able to keep pace. Basically, we Austrians need much more self- confidence. One can acquire this more quickly abroad. I always feel five centimeters taller when I come home than I was when I left. At home they then make me feel two centimeters shorter again. But, I still end up three centimeters taller!. (He laughs) [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] On 10 June, two days before the EU referendum, you will celebrate your 60th birthday. Do you have any wishes for you birthday? [Mock] First, that the Austrians give themselves the present of voting yes to be able to participate in decisionmaking as equals. Second, that they manage to maintain the ability to talk to each other despite the ups and downs of political developments, an ability acquired after World War II, and third, I want an increase in the standard of living, both in ethical and material terms, and the ability to work for something and not to get lost in complete passivity, as is currently happening in connection with Bosnia-Herzegovina. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Your altruism does you honor, but do you not have any private wishes? [Mock] (laughs) I tell my private wishes to my wife. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] What are you plans for the future, for the time after the referendum? Would you be available for another term as foreign minister? [Mock] I feel comfortable with this task and, if I am called, I will be happy to be available for another term. But, you see, I am also pragmatic. I know that we all have our jobs only for a certain period.
