The item claims that Miami counterrevolutionary organizations and special services of imperialism are wholly responsible for the incidents that occurred on 10 and 11 February. They had tried to create a massive influx of Cuban citizens to the U.S. Interests Section as a way to denigrate the Revolution and create an incident that would further damage the nonexistent relations between the two countries. The paper points out that to do this, they used the rumor technique, spreading false reports that the Cuban Government was interested in encouraging an event of that nature. JUVENTUD REBELDE says: The rumors began on the morning of 10 February when the counterrevolution began to spread the news that the sentries had been withdrawn, and that the U.S. Interests Section was expeditiously issuing visas to anyone applying for them at the U.S. Interests Section. During all [several seconds lost due to tape change] from Centro Habana [Municipality] and from the Cojimar neighborhood expressed their intentions of going to the place, while others went to the U.S. Interests Section. Those people were joined by a number of residents from Arroyo Naranjo Municipality. On 11 February, the internal forces of order cordoned off the streets that provided access to the U.S. Interests Section to prevent the crowds from getting near the Section offices. At around noon on Friday [11 February], according to JUVENTUD REBELDE, the presence of lumpen in the area was obvious, again showing that this is the natural medium from which the counterrevolution draws its sustenance. During the course of the incidents at the U.S. Interests Section, 82 people were identified and detained for a few hours. At present, a number of citizens are still under arrest, and the instigators of the events are being identified. In its Sunday item, JUVENTUD REBELDE reports that several participants in the incidents said they heard rumors from Miami radio stations that visas would be freely granted. It is obvious who masterminded the incidents at the U.S. Interests Section. This is how the mechanisms of the counterrevolution and imperialism operate -- on the basis of deception and cynicism. Responsibility for what has happened belongs wholly and exclusively to imperialism, to the counterrevolutionaries in Miami, and to the agitators disguised as dissidents. Cuba does not practice policies based on force. The force of Cuba's policy lies in its proverbial justice, crystal clarity, and fidelity to its proclaimed principles, according to today's article in JUVENTUD REBELDE, entitled, "What Happened at the U.S. Interests Section?" The embassies in Cuba will always be able to count on the protection and facilities they need to carry out their tasks and ensure the the security of their members. Nothing happened inside the U.S. Interests Section. There are no Cuban citizens inside the offices. No one was hurt or injured. Once the rumor about free issuance of visas was denied, everything returned to normal. Nevertheless, JUVENTUD REBELDE adds, these kinds of incidents and this type of irresponsibility have the potential to provoke more serious consequences. The onus falls entirely on whoever is responsible for promoting this kind of thing. Let this incident serve as an experience for the unscrupulous authors of this escapade.
