The lives of innocent citizens and UN peace-keepers have once again come under unwarranted threat. A ceasefire must be put in place and respected and the peace process resumed without delay so that there can be movement towards a political settlement which is irreversible and acceptable to all parties. The Government of India calls upon all parties to the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina to eschew the futile pursuit of a military solution as this only results in endless bloodshed which is abhorrent to the international community. We call for the immediate resumption of the process of negotiations.
