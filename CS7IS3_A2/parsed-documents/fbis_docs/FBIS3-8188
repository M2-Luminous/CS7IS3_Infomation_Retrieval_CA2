Who will be the judge, the one who says the Czech Republic is ready to join the Alliance? Are there any criteria at all? [Zieleniec] I do not think it is possible to set any criteria because we have entered into the very sensitive area of Europe's future security structure. If you were to set criteria, you would now be saying: You, yes and you, no. Mind you, it is possible to visualize very precisely who is capable of fulfilling which criterion. On the other hand, if the program is formulated politically--that is, provided it is oriented toward forging political ties between the Alliance and individual states--the countries that can and want to will come closer to NATO, and vice versa. I would also like to say that NATO's expansion is a process in whose quality we should also be interested. It must also be in our interests to ensure that the Alliance does not lose its quality. Too much opening up could mean that states that could become a source of instability could be integrated within the Alliance. [Pecinka] Soon after President Clinton's visit to Europe, it became apparent that there are, to say the least, two interpretations of the PFP. The Central Europeans are thinking about the fastest possible and individual admission into NATO. On the other hand, Russia views this initiative as the first step toward the transformation of NATO, which will ultimately incorporate all of the postcommunist states at the same time.... [Zieleniec] It is clear that everyone interprets a given political fact according to his own interests. I do not think, however, that Russia's voice will be the decisive one here. [Pecinka] What, then, will be decisive? [Zieleniec] The security situation in Europe. Look, unforeseen security developments in East Europe could mean that NATO may try to provide security for the buffer zone and rapidly expand toward the east. On the other hand, if slower development were to act as a stimulus for stabilizing democracy in Russia, rather than for confrontation with the West, this would also be worth taking into consideration. I think the NATO countries will come up with a solution with two alternatives, which is a classic example of political tactics.
