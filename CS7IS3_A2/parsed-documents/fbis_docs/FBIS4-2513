FBIS4-2513 "drchi070_k_94016" FBIS-CHI-94-070 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 NATIONAL AFFAIRS Political & Social MING PAO Reacts to XINHUA Report on Xi Yang MING PAO Reacts to XINHUA Report on Xi Yang HK1204113294 Hong Kong MING PAO in Chinese 12 Apr 94 p a2 HK1204113294 Hong Kong MING PAO Chinese BFN [Report: "MING PAO's Response to XINHUA Article Entitled `Xi Yang Sentenced to 12 Years Imprisonment at First Trial'"] [Text] First, the XINHUA article once again showed that Xi Yang was actually engaged in normal news gathering as understood by the Hong Kong journalistic circles. In June and July last year, a number of important meetings concerning Hong Kong were held in Beijing and MING PAO sent two reporters, one of whom was Xi Yang, to cover the news in Beijing. During this period, Xi Yang also covered economic news concerning China's macroeconomic control, which was of keen interest to people in various circles at that time. All arrangements made between MING PAO and Xi Yang were within the scope of news gathering and there was no such thing as doing something without relation to news gathering in the name of covering news in Beijing. The XINHUA article once again proved that Xi Yang delivered all the materials he gathered from news gathering to MING PAO for open publishing and did not use the information for any other purpose. Second, PRC Criminal Procedure Law, Chapter 2, First Section, Article 121 stipulates: "All sentences are announced openly without exception." According to the annotation on this article in the book "Collection of Annotations on the PRC Laws" compiled by the National People's Congress Law Committee: "The People's Courts will openly announce their decisions on all cases no matter whether the cases are tried openly or secretely." The "Collection of Annotations" particularly mentions that the decisions on cases related to state secrets and tried secretely should also be announced openly. Relevant law experts in Beijing pointed out that an open announcement of court decisions should at least include the following two points: 1. Delivery of the court verdicts to the accused and the public prosecutors concerned. 2. Posting of the written court verdicts on the notice boards of the courts with the signatures of the courts' responsible officials and the seals of the courts. According to the XINHUA article, the Chinese authorities only satisfied the first point. It is perplexing as to why the court has not yet made public the verdict and the details of the case were only partly revealed by XINHUA. According to the instructions of the court in Beijing, Xi Yang's lawyers were not allowed to reveal any details of the case to the public. Therefore, before the court verdict was officially made public, it was unfair to the appelant that the Chinese authorities gave a unilateral account of the case through the news agency. Third, the XINHUA article said that Xi Yang's case was very serious and Xi Yang might be sentenced to a prison term of over 10 years. However, the article did not quote the official concern and did not mention what evidence showed that the case could be considered as very serious. On the contrary, according to Dr Lo Cheung-kwok, a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, who pointed out in his capacity as a finance expert that, under the current financial operation system, the information about China's gold trading and interest rate adjustment as reported by Xi Yang absolutely could not cause any serious economic losses to the state.
