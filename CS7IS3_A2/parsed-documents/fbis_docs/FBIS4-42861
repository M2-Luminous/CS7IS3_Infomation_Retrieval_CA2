Denktas inaugurated the central siren system established by the Civil Defense Organization. In a speech which was broadcast through the siren system he inaugurated today, Denktas called for mutual disarmament. Denktas said: Come let us sign a disarmament agreement and let our people be comfortable. Let us be good neighbors and let these good neighborly relations lead to peace. This is our wish and will. Armament is of no help to anybody and only instigates enmity. Within this awareness, I repeat my call for peace on this historical day, for signing an agreement on condition that the flag of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is not lowered from its flag-post. Indicating that the whole world knows the Turkish side's feelings concerning this issue, Denktas added that he wanted the Greek Cypriots to be aware of the Turkish side's sentiments as well.
