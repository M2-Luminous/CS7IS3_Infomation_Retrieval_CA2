The deputies on the defense and finance committees who started examining it did not find anything -- regardless of their political leanings -- that would lead to great or violent passions. They read the government's guidelines for ensuring our country's security between now to 2015 with "real interest," combined with "caution" and scattered "skepticism." They felt that the work of the committee chaired by Marceau Long was "suitable, honest, and satisfactory," and that the result was "acceptable." That is what the respective committee chairmen, Jacques and Jacques Boyon, said yesterday to Defense Minister Francois Leotard. The pride of France since the early 1980's, the consensus on defense still endures. While there are some exceptions, the vast majority of the National Assembly does not intend to call into question these two pillars of nuclear deterrence and a "mixed" Armed Forces model which is based on the principle of conscription. The National Assembly also seems resolved to maintain a "significant" budgetary effort, i.e., enough to guarantee our decisionmaking autonomy. Although the consensus is comprehensive, it nevertheless gives the impression of cracking, or even splitting apart, since there are now a great many ambiguities and reservations on which it rests. The primary quality of the white paper stressed Jacques Boyon (of the RPR (Rally for the Republic), Ain) quite clearly is that it does not compromise the future. "It does not close any doors," the implication being that it will not act as a constraint on the future president of the republic, who will be elected in 1995. Debate on M5 The cleverness of the exercise appears with regard to the nuclear issue. The white paper satisfies supporters and opponents of resuming testing. "The moratorium does not currently penalize our discussion, but they will have to be resumed," echoed Francois Leotard. Similarly, it does not bother enthusiasts of any given weapons system. However, on this topic, there are many nuances within the parliamentary majority. A good illustration of this is the debate surrounding the production of the M5, a missile intended to arm missile-launching submarines around 2010 and which, in 1992, was the subject of a decision regarding missile launches made by Francois Mitterrand. Today, Jacques Chirac feels it is an "urgent matter," while Jacques Boyon and Rene Galy-Dejean [members of the National Assembly], for example, feel that a postponement would not be disastrous. The defense minister does not go along with the idea of accelerating this program which, he reiterated, could not have been launched until 1995. He also confided that he does not intend to give the M5 the same warhead as the M45, or to make an S5 version for the Albion platform -- "the cost of that would be unreasonable" -- unlike what Francois Mitterrand let it be understood. As for the future military planning law, the deputies and the defense minister agreed to meet again, when the government has undertaken the necessary and difficult arbitration between the Defense Ministry and the Budget Ministry. Francois Leotard said he was satisfied that the basis chosen by the prime minister should be the 100.4 billion francs in equipment credits to be made available in 1994. From then on, he scarcely hopes to obtain more than a rise of 0.5 percent in constant francs. Such a result would just be acceptable for the Defense Ministry in view of the programs already begun and the new operational needs. However, at the same time it would be a notable exception to the law on controlling public spending.
