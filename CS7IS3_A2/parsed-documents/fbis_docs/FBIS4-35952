FBIS4-35952 "drnes108_j_94049" FBIS-NES-94-108 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Al-'Attas Justifies Secession, Denies YSP Rift Al-'Attas Justifies Secession, Denies YSP Rift JN0406105194 London AL-WASAT in Arabic 30 May-5 Jun 94 p 13 JN0406105194 London AL-WASAT Arabic BFN [Excerpt] Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, who has been tasked with forming a government in the [southern] Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY], has stated that all the members of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] Political Bureau, including those outside Yemen, were consulted before the decision to proclaim the establishment of the DRY was made. In an interview with AL-WASAT in London, al-'Attas said that while he was in the United States for medical treatment, he held consultations with many of his colleagues in the Political Bureau, including Salim Salih Muhammad, YSP assistant secretary general and Presidential Council member, whose name was not on the list of 16 members against whom arrest warrants were issued. Al-'Attas, whom 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih dismissed as prime minister when the situation deteriorated, said that the decision to go back to the pre-unity state of affairs was dictated by the facts on the ground. He said: War has dealt unity a blow and secession is a way to extricate Yemen from its dilemma. The return to the political formula that preceded unity is a preventive measure to save Yemen from fragmentation. Secession represents part of our efforts to introduce Yemen into the 20th century. Perhaps it is an advanced step to save the elite, which calls for the establishment of a state of institutions and law, to enhance the concept of political pluralism, and help modernize the state. By affirming that he consulted all YSP Political Bureau members before the announcement of the secession, al-'Attas seems to be closing the door, if temporarily, in the face of Sanaa's attempts to sow a rift within the YSP by inviting northern leaders within the YSP -- like Dr. Yasin Sa'id Nu'man, Jarallah 'Umar, Yahya al-Shami, and Ahmad al-Salami, who all are YSP Political Bureau members -- to hold a dialogue. Al-'Attas said: All such reports are mere rumors that show just how much the General People's Congress and the Yemeni Reform Grouping wish to divide the YSP. This has been their major concern since the proclamation of unity. In the early months of unity, they disseminated reports about the existence of the intransigent Fattah line within the YSP, which later proved to be all rumors that northern intelligence organizations propagated. He said that reports that Jarallah 'Umar has left Aden for the north is not true, as Jarallah 'Umar has been nominated to assume one of the ministerial portfolios in the new DRY government.
