The poll by the state-run Advisory Council on Democratic and Peaceful Unification showed 54.1 percent of the respondents were not worried that North Korea would start a war, with 13.8 percent saying it was impossible and 40.3 percent highly unlikely. But 45.5 percent of the pollees had a negative opinion: Very probable (6.8 percent) or relatively probable (38.7 percent). The advisory council commissioned the Hyundae Research Institute to survey 1,000 adult men and women across the nation, selected using the probability proportionate to size sampling (PTS) method, from March 28 to April 2. Some 80.3 percent foresaw the need for military preparations -- very appropriate measures (46.5 percent) or inevitable (33.8 percent) -- as far as deploying Patriot missiles here and resuming Team Spirit, the joint South Korean-U.S. military exercise, following the rupture of inter-Korean working-level talks. Meanwhile, 58.7 percent of the respondents supported patience such as inter-Korean dialogue to resolve the nuclear problem, while 16 percent said hard-line countermeasures including military methods should be used. And 38.8 percent thought the United Nations should urge North Korea to allow inspections of its nuclear sites through a Security Council presidential statement, while 28.8 percent favored U.N. sanctions. On the effect of possible U.N. sanctions against North Korea, 39.6 percent said that "as a result, tension will be heightened on the Korean peninsula," while 25.3 percent said "North Korea will eventually accept further inspections." Meanwhile, 75.6 percent felt that North Korea has already developed nuclear weapons or will produce them in two or three years, but only 18.3 percent said Pyongyang seems to have stopped developing nuclear arms.
