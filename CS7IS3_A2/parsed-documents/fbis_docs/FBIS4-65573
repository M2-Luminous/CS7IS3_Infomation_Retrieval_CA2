The employing of young people was a central theme in this year's second proposed supplemental budget that was presented to the Eduskunta on Friday [22 April]. About 700 million Finnish markkas [FMk] are set aside for increasing educational and job opportunities for youth. The intention is to increase by 33,000 the projected number of young people that will be accepted for educational placement this fall. About 8,000 of these slots will require indentured service by the recipient. Education by indenturement will almost double if reality follows the projections. Job-providing subsidies will be paid for those accepted under the indenture program. This will amount to FMk1,500 monthly per person for the first year, and FMk750 per month during the second year. The remainder of the educational spots will be provided in the 10th grade of high school, in trade schools, and in tertiary schools. Some 6,500 young people completing their education this year will have job-providing subsidies offered on their behalf for a period of six months if they do not find employment on the open market. Insuring EKA Costly The supplemental budget will add almost FMk1.4 billion to this year's government expenses. The increase in expenses will be covered by additional borrowing. Besides the program for the youth, the biggest budget item will be the insuring of savings deposits in EKA [expansion unknown]. This phase of the government deficit will amount to FMk635 million. The total government deficit will be almost double this amount. The government will achieve spending cuts in financing arrangements and bonuses linked to the national debt. These spending cuts are estimated to equal FMk400 million. Over FMk100 million will be cut from the supplementing of local government tax income. Expenses associated with refugees will be FMk80 million under earlier estimates. Some FMk40 million will be set aside for humanitarian aid to Bosnia. 50 Million for EU Referendum Fifty million markkas are being set aside in the supplemental budget for conducting the referendum on European Union [EU] membership. Some of the funds needed for this purpose have already been provided by this year's budget. Compensation payment for the whitewater preservation will cost 55 million more over the remainder of the year. The local government crisis act, the so-called Karkkila Law, formulated by the cabinet, will lead to an expense of FMk15 million over the rest of the year. This to-be-enacted law will authorize the granting of over FMk200 million in loans to local governments in financial crises. [passage omitted]
