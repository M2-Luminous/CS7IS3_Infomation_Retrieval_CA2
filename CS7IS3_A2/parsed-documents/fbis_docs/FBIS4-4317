"Lifting the embargo will have a serious and direct effect on Indonesia, in addition to the low labor costs there. For that reason, Indonesia must really compete with Vietnam," said Sanyoto Sastrowardojo, state minister for investment (Meninves) and chairman of the Investment Board, at the DPR [Parliament]/MPR [People's Consultative Council] building this week. Aburizal Bakrie, general chairman of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry; J. B. Bambang Warih Koesoema, member of the DPR's Commission VI; Djaf'ar H. Assegaff, Indonesian ambassador to Vietnam; and the economic observers Christianto Wibisono and Hartojo Wignyowijoto, made similar statements. However, Sanyoto said, lifting the embargo will also provide an opportunity to export Indonesian goods to that country. At the same time, said Bambang, Indonesia must implement an integrated and comprehensive action plan in order to meet the increased competition. "Planned and integrated measures must be taken in order to meet the increased competition from Vietnam." Dja'far, the new Indonesian ambassador to Vietnam, stated that lifting the American embargo on Vietnam should spur Indonesia to increase its competitive abilities. "However, we need to think positively, that is, how can the two countries take advantage of what each one does best for their common good." Dja'far explained that the first step to be taken in anticipation of lifting the embargo would be to open up direct trade relations between Vietnam and Indonesia. "Indonesian trade with Vietnam has never been direct but has had to go through a third country. This is inefficient and wasteful." At the same time, Christianto Wibisono, director of the Indonesian Business Data Center (PBDI), said that Indonesia should not be too concerned about the embargo being lifted. "Indonesia has a 25-year lead so why should we worry? What we have to do is figure out how to maintain our position." Vietnam, he continued, still has a lot of fixing up to do before it can increase foreign investment in the country. "Indonesia has a much better infrastructure. Right now Vietnam is like Indonesia was in the 1970s." For Hartojo the most serious threat that we have to be concerned about is that Vietnam has copied various regulations in the field of oil and natural gas mining (Migas). "They have plagiarized our ideas about mining contracts exactly, meaning that they are prepared to compete with Indonesia in attracting investors who are active in the field of Migas mining." Aburizal said that Vietnam can be an extension of investments from various Indonesian companies.
