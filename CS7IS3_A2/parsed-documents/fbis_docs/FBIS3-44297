Li Peng expressed his important views on such issues as the domestic and international situation, as well as economic work in 1994. He said: Sustained, rapid, and healthy development is our motto [ti fa] for development, and an efficiency-based growth rate is our demand. We should implement the principle of stressing both development and frugality, optimize our structure, expand our transport capacity, and expedite infrastructure construction. On the other hand, we should carry out some long-term construction projects. In real estate development, we should principally build medium- and low-end housing to solve urban residents' housing problems.
