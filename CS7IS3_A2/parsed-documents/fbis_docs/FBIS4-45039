Diabali: "Annaba: When the Fabric of the Economy Unravels..."] [Text] Oran--Annaba, one of the country's most important economic development hubs, is on the verge of foundering. The steelworking capital is leaking at every seam, as indeed it should be, since a large number of enterprises, having taken on too much debt, have gone under. The consequences of a decade of extreme mismanagement are going to end up destroying the last vestiges of its economic potential. One by one, wilaya-owned, parastatal, and state-owned enterprises have been shaken by labor crises that have seriously compromised their future, means of production have been sabotaged or shut down for diverse reasons, bank accounts have been blocked, and equipment has been sold off cheap to local or foreign buyers. Enterprises like Ferrovial, Real-Sider, Enriest, Ferphos, Ecotec, Enafroid, and many others are begging the banks for money to pay workers' wages and desperately seeking even the smallest contract to write into their almost empty order books. The two state-owned companies, Asmidal and Sider, are in a tight corner. The first, operating in the red, financially unhinged, and burdened by a swollen personnel roster, survives only by tapping the public treasury. The second, a veritable monster of heavy industry, manages somehow to limp along with its decrepit equipment and 50 percent manpower excess, reeling under the weight of utopian projects. The Bellar project (Jijel) is probably typical: Although the project seemed feasible in the 1980's, what was supposed to become Algeria's second-largest steelworking complex has been abandoned to its fate after tens of billions of dinars were plowed into it. Corruption, Malfeasance Beyond the economic recession that is generally blamed for the current situation, one must consider the fact that some of the enterprises implanted or represented in the wilaya of Annaba have been weakened by poor business management, embezzlement, and other sorts of malfeasance that have ended up in the courts (Edimco, Orelait, Emifor, Sidal, Asmidal), or stirred up scandals in APCs [people's communal assemblies], technical agencies, the customs service, banks, etc., altogether depriving public coffers of billions in revenue. The two largest scandals to date, the container scandal at the port of Annaba--still a murky affair--and Orelait Annaba's importation of date-expired powdered milk and palm oil, are very significant in terms of the way they were handled. Whereas the former scandal is still in the courts, no one--neither the participation fund, nor the board of directors, nor the state as principal shareholder--has demanded that Orelait account for this palm oil, which was too old to sell only a few months after being unloaded at the port of Annaba. Annaba has certainly seen a record number of corruption and malfeasance scandals. The ceramics and wood for the 19 May stadium complex, the concrete benches now adorning villas in Chrea, near Blida, the large quantity of cement originally destined for Maquam Echahid for the Seraidi road and diverted to the construction of "si flen" [as published]: Resource diversions and abuses of power were an everyday reality between 1985 and 1990, but the perpetrators have never been "punished." In 1994, in addition to business failures and bankruptcies (due in part to poor management), arson has gutted the plants of socioeconomic units such as Enatb, Ecotec, the Civil Protection Unit of Drean, the Annaba APC, EPEA [expansion not given], Sonelgaz, ENATB [expansion not given] and Ecotec at Oued Zied. As if that were not enough, the future of other units has been thrown into serious doubt by labor conflict, sometimes latent but in other cases flaring into open confrontation--for example, at National Highway Transport Company/Chaiba, where workers have been on strike since 5 April, and Hydro-Transfert, where tools were downed on 10 April.
