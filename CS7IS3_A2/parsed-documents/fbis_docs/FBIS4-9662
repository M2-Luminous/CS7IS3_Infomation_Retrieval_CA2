Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo appointed Investments Under Secretary Guillermo Haterneck to replace Redrado, thus making sure that one of his trusted men is at the head of an organization considered vital for the development of the capital market. Redrado's resistance to leaving his post forced the government to evaluate two alternative decrees, one dismissing Redrado and another one accepting his resignation. Carlos Corach, presidential technical and legal secretary, met with Redrado until late last night trying unsuccessfully to convince him to adopt the least traumatic solution. But Redrado did not accept the suggestion to resign and the executive branch had to dismiss him, thus ending his ongoing confrontation with Cavallo. About midnight, before leaving for India, President Carlos Menem signed the decree "firing" Redrado. Alone and without much visible support in the government, Redrado, who is only 32, saw how his last hopes were disappearing on 28 March. [passage omitted] The only support Redrado received was from the pensioners,because Norma Pla went to the National Securities Commission to applaud what was done in the process for selling YPF [Government Oil Deposits] shares in the pensioners' hands. This is the issue that led to Redrado's critical situation when he rejected the first proposal presented by the U.S. firms Merril Lynch and First Boston. Although the second proposal had the endorsement of the first government position, the strong support for the pensioners irritated the already sensitive feelings of Cavallo, who convinced Menem of the need to get Redrado to resign. The old disagreements between the two officials were revived in the last few months due to their different points of view on the destinations of funds for the Pension Fund Managing Companies. Minister Cavallo and Felipe Murolo, superintendent of the Pension Fund Managing Companies, wanted well-established guidelines for the system, but Redrado wanted to give the greatest freedom possible to the investors. The abrupt drop in shares on 28 March convinced officials of the need to eradicate the uncertainty in the market.
