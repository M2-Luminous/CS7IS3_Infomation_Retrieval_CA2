Mr. de Klerk wound up his road show in the Strand this afternoon. Conrad Burke reports. [Begin recording] [Burke] Mr. de Klerk, looking confident, took his road show to Kraaifontein, one of a belt of suburbs which edge onto the farmlands north of the Cape Flats. One of the themes he pressed home today was that the National Party needed every vote, and that a stayaway vote would benefit the ANC [African National Congress]. [De Klerk] We need every vote because the Western Cape, where we will win, must also help us to win throughout South Africa. [Burke] Today's campaign followed the same pattern as yesterday's. At most venues there was a small ANC presence. We heard reports that ANC structures here have worked hard these past few days restraining ANC members to ensure a degree of fairness in the campaign, particularly after the ugly incidents in the northern Cape this week. Covering the De Klerk road show in the Cape heat wave with its frequent stops in long distances can take it out of even the most resilient of journalists. But the organizers have organized a luxury air conditioned bus fitted with one of the journalist's most favorite companion, a cooler box. It was at one of the retirement meccas, the Strand, that Mr. de Klerk referred to ongoing initiatives to win the Inkatha Freedom Party's [IFP) participation in the April elections, particularly in Natal. He said the absence of the IFP at the polls would play into the hands of the ANC. [De Klerk] I, therefore, still have some hope that discussions which is [as heard] taking place between for in stance some of our spokesmen and spokesmen on behalf of the Zulu king, and discussions which is to take place as we read in the news on Tuesday between Mr. Mandela and Chief Minister Buthelezi, that those discussions will be fruitful so that also the Inkatha Freedom Party can become involved in this new dispensation. [Burke] One of the features of the De Klerk road show in the western Cape was the absence of violent confrontation. Wherever we went there was an ANC presence, but the active ingredient was one of friendly competition, and the ANC here has put a lot of effort into ensuring that this campaign went freely and fairly, and this augers well for the elections in the Western Cape. Later this evening Mr. de Klerk had a one and a quarter hour meeting at Tuynhuys with the Organization of African Unity's [OAU] secretary general, Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim. [De Klerk] I had confidence after our discussion that the OAU is supportive of what is happening in South Africa, that it is approaching our problems very correctly in a sense of not trying to interfere in any way. [Salim] We have a vested interest in ensuring a peaceful process. We have a vested interest in ensuring the emergence of a new South Africa, a South Africa which will continue to play an important role within the African family. [end recording]
