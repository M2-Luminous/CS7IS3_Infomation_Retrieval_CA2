In an interview for today's Slovak government daily REPUBLIKA, the prime minister also accused President Michal Kovac of discussing the creation of factions in the governing HZDS. The prime minister was reacting to considerations that the path towards the establishment of a broad government coalition, which Kovac urged in his New Year's speech, could open up with the HZDS's atomization and Meciar's dismissal from the posts he currently holds. "The attack now being waged against me," said Meciar, "has a slightly different background than before. It is following a line that, in case of elections, the HZDS without Meciar would be a less dangerous partner or would not be dangerous at all. What is also being reckoned on is that a possible removal of the HZDS chairman would facilitate the creation of a number of factions. The split of the movement, which now represents a real political force, would in fact provide a space for the Democratic Left Party (SDL) or would help improve the position of the Christian democrats," Meciar said. In his opinion, the creation of factions or the split of the HZDS parliamentary group cannot be initiated from the outside. "I am sorry," said Meciar, "that Mr. President (Kovac) is negotiating this issue with some deputies and recommending specific alternatives." At the same time, Meciar gave assurances that the HZDS is a viable and democratic institution, which "will decide what to do by itself." Meciar also disagreed with "financial oligarchy" and "powerful money" replacing human values. "You can see that attacks against me are launched mainly from the circles of the nouveaux riches. It is no use to hide it. The contacts and links of many politicians to various interest groups are so big," said Meciar, "that I do not know whether they always act only out of their own will."
