He added: "Other aspects, not included in the pact, may be incorporated." Menem said yesterday: "This electoral process is known throughout Argentina and the world, it is known that the Constitution will be reformed." He denied there is public indifference toward the move. Menem asked: "In the past, people were either concerned or unconcerned saying: after all the government party will impose its will. Now there is consensus and the people are saying it has all been prearranged. What do the people really want?" In an interview in the "Haddad and Longobardi" program [not further identified], Menem reiterated: "Absolutely nothing has been prearranged. A pact has been signed, and based on it the constituent members will work to carry out the reform." Menem is optimistic about the result of the upcoming 10 April elections. He says the Justicialist Party "will increase the percentage obtained on 3 October, although I may be wrong." He added: "The Radical Civic Union will also do well." In the federal capital it "will fight with the Justicialist Party for first place." Regarding the position of minister coordinator, Menem said the position will be in force "when the Constituent Assembly approves it. It is its decision." [passage omitted] Regarding his talks with U.S. Vice President Al Gore, President Menem denied any pressure to approve the patents law. He said he asked Gore for a similar attitude regarding the U.S. policy on subsidies on agricultural products. Menem hinted that Gore's message was: "Without a patents law, it will be a bit difficult for you to join NAFTA." Regarding the case of the Argentine Airlines, Menem said the agreement has not yet been signed. He added: "There is an agreement in principle, therefore I don't want to comment on something that has not concluded."
