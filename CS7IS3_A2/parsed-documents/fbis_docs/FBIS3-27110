The region embraces three cities of Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou. Township enterprises, the mainstay of the local economy, brought in 280 billion yuan in output value last year, accounting for 70 percent of the province's total. On the other hand, high efficiency has helped reduce farming population to 9 million, with each farmer bringing in about 100 kg of grain per year from land averaging 0.05 ha per person. So far, all 12 counties in the region have edged into the country's 100 economically powerful counties, with four among the top six. They are Wuxi, Jiangyin, Zhangjiagang and Changshu. The introduction of the joint stock system in 1993 is viewed as a key to the region's success. By the end of 1993, around 90 percent of partnership enterprises the provincial-level enterprises groups were born in the area, together with over 6,500 foreign-funded enterprises. Suzhou City, whose township industry grossed 80 billion yuan in sales and 20 billion yuan in exports, has converted 4,025 of its 12,000 township firms into joint ventures. At present, more than 90 percent of the existing 430 towns under these three cities have risen to become multi-million-yuan towns. The township enterprises have subsidized farm production at an annual average of over 200 million yuan since 1990. Last year, the figure reached 360 million yuan. The degree of farm mechanization in some of its cities and counties has reached the level of developed countries. A comprehensive system of farming services has been coordinated throughout the region, ranging from plant protection and irrigation to seed and fertilizer supplication. All-round services have reduced heavy field labor by 70 percent and farmers have higher income than most workers of enterprises. At present, farmers in the region have contracted for cultivated land of more than 33,350 ha from the collectives, accounting for 15 percent of land for planting cash crops.
