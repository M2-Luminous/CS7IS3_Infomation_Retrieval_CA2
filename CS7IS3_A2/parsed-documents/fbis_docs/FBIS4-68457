But in Ukraine, for some reason, it resembles a civil war. Two camps, two mentalities, two dissimilar halves of Ukraine are seeking revenge against each other over some wretched people's deputies, who have been fiercely shot at from all sides. We must acknowledge the following fact: In this election the Dnieper River has historically divided our state into two huge election districts. Success in one of them was turned into defeat in the other. More than half--64 out of 120 deputies from the left-wing parties--have been elected to the parliament in just 4 Eastern Ukrainian oblasts: Lugansk, Donetsk, Kharkov, and Zaporozhye. Two-thirds of the people's deputies with a right-wing radical orientation--8 out of 12--have been sent to the new parliament from just 2 Galician oblasts--Ternopol and Lvov. But the people closer to the Dnieper, in general, did not want to vote for anyone: Most of the election districts with incomplete voting are in the city of Kiev--18, as well as in the Kiev--7, Dnepropetrovsk--13, Poltava and Vinnitsa (6 each) oblasts. Crimea was an utterly unique case. Twelve districts in that peninsula failed to reach the point of complete voting. The first conclusion to be drawn here is as follows: Ukraine has not yet brought forth such a powerful political force which could unite the two societies living on the different sides of the Dnieper. However, it has already brought forth left-wing and right-wing radicals who are capable of transforming the Dnieper into a frontline. * * * The most contentious analysts have already calculated that--out of the 337 persons newly elected to the parliament--almost 200 acknowledge their membership in a certain political party or election bloc with a precise political orientation. The people, whom the parliament of the previous convocation shamelessly burdened with a majority-type electoral system, openly voted not so much for a specific candidate as for his political bent. This is precisely the most suitable moment for drawing our second conclusion: Our people are not stupid, and they are capable of coping with party lists. Therefore, during future elections we will hardly be able to neglect the proportional principle in forming a parliament. * * * Eight-tenths of the National Democrats who have made it to the parliament should understand the following point: Their strength lies in the "swamp." The latter is populated by approximately 100 deputies with an indeterminate political orientation, predominantly from the camp of the "independents" or the "party of power." Whoever carries most of the "swamp" over to his own side will have a parliamentary majority. However, a spectrum analysis of this Ukrainian "swamp" yields some disturbingly gloomy conclusions: There is a great deal of red coloring here. And, therefore, the chances of profiting from additional votes from the "swamp" are possessed by the left-wingers--the Communist and Socialist parties, as well as by the Peasants' Party of Ukraine--whose proportion in the Supreme Council will amount to 120 persons. They lack only 50 votes to create a parliamentary majority.... From everything mentioned above the third conclusion presents itself: The National Democrats ought to be made aware that they have lost this election. Their principal tasks in this parliament are not to allow the communists to lead our country back to a point from which there is no return. That is to say, they must endeavor to block whatever anti-Ukrainian or anti-market decisions which may be made, while creating--at the same time--alliances, when necessary, with the "party of power," the National Radicals, and--at times--even with the Inter-Regional Bloc for Reforms. The main thing is to resist temptation and to reject those two or three offers to work in the government--offers which will undoubtedly be made to the National Democrats at the time when the ministerial portfolios are being distributed among the communists and the "party of power." This is the simple hook which last year caught many persons ready, willing, and eager to butt their heads against a stone wall and which--in Eastern Ukraine created the myth of the "Benderist-Nationalist" government in Kiev, a government in which the only protectors and defenders of the people are Zvyahilskyy, Landyk, Yevtukhov, and some other honest brothers. The best thing that the National Democrats could do for the government is to keep quiet and remain satisfied to see how the communists attempt to extricate Ukraine from its economic crisis. In order to sense its own fall, our people evidently have to fall to the very bottom. And when everybody comes to understand that this really is the bottom, perhaps a new election will be called. The people must finally learn how to change their rakes--how to substitute new ones for the old ones. * * * The greatest danger for Ukraine lies in those oblasts on the Dnieper which had 113 election districts not voting completely. Whereas the present-day parliamentary game of solitaire still allows for a blockage of openly anti-state or communist sudden moves, several dozen Leninists or chauvinists elected in runoff elections could totally shatter this delicately balanced glass. If the pendulum begins to swing in the other direction, and the people rush to elect right-wing radicals, war will begin in the parliament and end in a slaughter throughout Ukraine. There will be no fourth conclusion. Each person is capable of drawing it on his own.
