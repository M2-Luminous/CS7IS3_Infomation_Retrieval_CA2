As the first step to respond to Saudi Arabia's request, Keidanren is studying a plan to invest several billion yen in food, pharmaceutical, and other companies. Keidanren plans to coordinate the final details when its officials visit there in late April. Through the financial cooperation of 112 major Japanese companies and Overseas Cooperation Fund, Keidanren established an investment company called "Japan International Cooperation Organization" [JICO] aimed at developing industries of developing countries in 1989. The present investment program to help Saudi Arabian companies will also be implemented through JICO. Pharmaceutical and food companies, such as noodle-making companies, are most likely to be offered the investment. Originally, Saudi Arabia requested investment in auto makers. However, Keidanren thinks it will be difficult to meet its request because the amount of investment would become enormous. A Keidanren Secretariat official said that "if possible," Keidanren "wants to sign contracts" when its mission visits Saudi Arabia.
