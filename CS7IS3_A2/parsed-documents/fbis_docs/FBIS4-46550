Classic Armenian disorganization and cottage-industry and self-enterprise mentality could not have taken a worse form than the means that have been "selected" for the organization of the current conscription drive. At virtually every step men, especially young ones, are targeted for roundups that use the crudest methods: force, brutality and disparagement. What is being done behind slogans of defending the fatherland and mobilizing the Army is discrediting the entire essence of this worthy program. As a result, neither the Army can be properly mobilized nor can the defense of the borders of the fatherland become more sound. Instead, fear, panic and demoralization may overtake people's minds, perhaps in an irreversible manner. What is most disturbing, however, is not the roundups but the mistrust which follows them. In the past few days our office has received numerous reports that the individuals who are in charge of these "operations" rob and plunder indiscriminately everyone--those who are liable as well as those who are not liable for military service--with insatiable enthusiasm. Our information about the seizure of cash and jewelry and the collection of bribes in American dollars has already gone beyond the limits of rumors. Strong protests are heard especially from those who cannot afford to "liberate" their kin, because they think that if they had the means their sons and husbands would not be taken to the Army and that the defense of the Army would not have turned into a "merchants'" business. Yes, mistrust rules everywhere, and the minister of state responsible for defense [Vazgen Sargsyan] could not dispel that mistrust with his well-known television address. He could not dispel it by presenting the conscription drive as a personal, almost private, task to the people without taking into account Armenia's morale and psychological state, the socioeconomic condition of the people, the presence of foreign influences that corrupt the young, the natural fear of military service and especially the political capital that the ruling group has lost amongst the people. Since there is no organization or press organ which opposes a strong army and a sound defense, an important task such as the conscription drive should have been arranged pannationally as befits a state in a truly organized and professional manner with the appropriate propaganda. Otherwise, with the current foul means we can have neither a combat-ready army nor a sound defense.
