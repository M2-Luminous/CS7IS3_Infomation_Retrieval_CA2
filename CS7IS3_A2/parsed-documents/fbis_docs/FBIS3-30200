The memorandum is linked with the EU and CSCE missions in Croatia, whose task is to support the sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro. On behalf of the EU the memorandum was signed by Danish Ambassador to Croatia Eric Skov, and on behalf of the CSCE -- currently chaired by Italy -- by Italian Ambassador to Croatia Salvatore Cilento. The memorandum regulates the ways of working and the methods of activity of the two international missions -- the EU and the CSCE -- active in Croatia since January 1993. The missions' task is to ensure that the sanctions are fully implemented. The Croatian authorities, especially the customs and financial bodies, are called on to help supervize the implementation of measures envisaged by the sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro. The memorandum also regulates the status of the missions' members, in keeping with the Vienna Convention. A memorandum with the same content was also signed by all other countries bordering Serbia and Montenegro.
