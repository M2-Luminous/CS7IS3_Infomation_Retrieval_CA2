Orgambides in Mexico City; date not given: "They Will Not Succeed in Destabilizing Us"] [Text] Days ago, the Mexican press obtained a photo of Ernesto Zedillo shining the shoes of a boy in Guadalajara. The item formed part of the electoral campaign, but the aptitude with which he wielded the brush showed that the candidate was quite an expert in the profession. It happens that Ernesto Zedillo, a doctor in economics from Yale University, did indeed take to the streets as a shoeshine boy to help finance his studies. The interview with EL PAIS was held in Mexico City at the headquarters of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), the organization that has governed Mexico for the last 65 years. In this building, there are still photos of the late-lamented Luis Donaldo Colosio, most of them draped in black crepe. Zedillo, despite the coldness of the surroundings, put our interview on an informal plane, admitting his love for rock music and revealing to me the many friends he has in Spain, from the worlds of politics and business. Identified with President Salinas de Gortari, the man who initiated the modernization of Mexico, the PRI candidate at the elections of 21 August is very sure he will win. He respects, although he is not yet worried about, his most immediate rival, the already historical leader of the opposition, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas. [Orgambides] Many things have occurred in Mexico since January: guerrilla warfare, kidnapping, and a crime shrouded in mystery which led to the death of your friend Colosio... [Zedillo] It is true that Mexico is experiencing unprecedented events and that all have one thing in common: we do not know who is behind them. We are very concerned by that, but I am extremely confident that, as time passes, these things will become more clear and, as a result, people will regain confidence. Despite this, this concern has not prevented our country from making progress. [Orgambides] While each of these events pretends to be different from the rest, it would appear that the objective is the same in each case: to destabilize the government. [Zedillo] I cannot say for certain that there is a conspiracy, but many Mexicans have the feeling that someone is trying to destabilize the country. Now, I can confirm that they will not succeed in destabilizing us. Isolated events cannot affect a country as strong as Mexico. [Orgambides] You belong to the generation of change, the one that started the transformation of Mexico. Will this continue if you become president? [Zedillo] The country, because of its problems and circumstances, needs to continue with its transformation. I have already said that my government will combine continuity in certain areas with strength and renovation in others, and change where required. We cannot use a single adjective to characterize the political intentions of my future government. What is clear is that we will place particular emphasis on macroeconomic stability and we will strengthen our social policy to make it more ambitious. I also plan to undertake major reforms in the fields of justice and national security. [Orgambides] Do you think that there is a degree of contrast between a conceptually old party like the PRI and you, the technocrats, who have faced up to the modernization of Mexico? [Zedillo] The PRI has an enormous capacity for change and one of my internal messages was that the party should be seen as an organization that is already fully competing with the other political forces in the country. Times have changed since the PRI dominated Mexican political life and could win without making much of an effort. Now, as far as we are concerned, we have to do it by sheer hard work, day by day, because Mexico is more involved, more diverse, and more demanding. [Orgambides] Do you mean that the reform the PRI needs will come about in the short term? [Zedillo] Reform must be a constant process. I am sure that, given the way circumstances are changing, the PRI will be able to renew itself to lead the way in the progress Mexico is making on the democratic level. [Orgambides] Now you, and before you Colosio, promised clean elections. What are you going to do to ensure this? [Zedillo] Many things. Firstly, we are encouraging our party to establish a consensus for better election legislation. Second, we have requested real action to be taken, such as the external auditing of the electoral roll. We are working in tandem with the rest of the parties to ensure that there no one has any suspicions about the election officials. Mexico will have an institutionalized electoral organization in which the PRI will be one more voice, and an electoral roll comparable with the best in the world. The Mexican voters, on the other hand, will for the first time have to turn up to federal elections with an identity document bearing their photograph. [Orgambides] There is a problem of credibility in Mexico. What would happen if you win the elections and a major section of the population does not believe it? [Zedillo] Credibility has to be built up in a progressive way. We do not have to wait until 21 August to see for ourselves what has already happened and I am sure we will win the majority of the vote. I have publicly encouraged the media and independent organizations to carry out opinion polls that, over the coming months, will show the electoral preferences of the Mexican people. As a result, on the day of the elections, people will see that a lot of effort and the progressive accumulation of preferences have worked in my favor. [Orgambides] President Salinas has said many times that Mexico has already changed its mentality, but we see that the people lately have lost their illusions. [Zedillo] We can make out distinct moments in our country's recent history. With President Salinas, we have witnessed a major process of national renewal that led to the reawakening of hope in the Mexican people because the country's serious economic problems have been resolved. Now Mexico is going through a worrying time because of the violent events that have occurred in the last four months and over which the government has had no control. If one thing is really clear at the moment it is that the people want social peace and Mexican unity. The PRI can guarantee them that. [Orgambides] They say that you, Salinas's men, paid so much attention to macroeconomic issues that you forgot that there are 16 million people in Mexico living in extreme poverty. [Zedillo] That is not true. Six years ago, the country's most serious problem was the risk of hyperinflation. This would have caused the contraction of the economy, the destruction of work, and, above all, it would have had a very negative effect on the poor. The first problem was how to eliminate our foreign debt and thus the lack of control over public finances. Salinas, when he promoted his policy of stabilization and economic modernization, also set out an extremely ambitious social policy. I know that for sure because, as the then-Plan and Budget Secretary I had to balance the national budget and at the same time increase by 100 percent social expenditure in real terms. [Orgambides] Are you afraid of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas? [Zedillo] Absolutely not. I am very confident that I will not only beat him but I will also beat all the other candidates. Everyone aspiring to the presidency deserves my greatest respect, but I sincerely believe that the majority of the Mexican people will vote for me. [Orgambides] What if they do not accept your victory? [Zedillo] That is not my problem. The main thing is that the election must be clean, every vote must count and count well. The people will decide. In any case, I am confident that Cardenas and the other candidates will respect the law. [Orgambides] These days, Mexico is a trading partner of Canada and the United States. Do you think that this new relationship could entail some cultural damage? [Zedillo] The reciprocal influences on the cultures of other countries is an inherent phenomenon of communication. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will not make this situation any worse. As Carlos Fuentes would say, it is the North Americans who should be concerned by too great a Mexican influence. [Orgambides] In recent years, Spain and Mexico have enjoyed excellent relations. What plans do you have in this respect when you become president? [Zedillo] Spain is a very special country for Mexico. The Spanish and Mexican peoples identify greatly with one another. The members of my generation are very gratified to see that our foreign relations -- as well as extending into North America -- are drawing increasingly closer to Spain. Thus I propose, when I am president, not just to ensure closer relations but also to strengthen these ties.
