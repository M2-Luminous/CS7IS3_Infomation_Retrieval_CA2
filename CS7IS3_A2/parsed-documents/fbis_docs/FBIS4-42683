His Moscow doctors advised him to obtain a second opinion in Germany, Chernomyrdin told a news conference in Mainz today. Treatment for the illness, from which he has suffered for several years, could not be put off any longer. Chernomyrdin said the kidney complaint "bothers" him, but it does not impair his work in any way. The prime minister announced that the treatment will presumably begin in Mainz and be continued in Moscow. A long stay in Germany is not planned: "I may fly back before Friday [10 June]," Chernomyrdin said. Rudolf Hohenfellner, the doctor treating Chernomyrdin at the Johannes Gutenberg University Clinic in Mainz, confirmed that Chernomyrdin is not suffering from any other illnesses. "His state of health is actually excellent," Hohenfellner said. A decision on treatment will not be made until the final diagnosis has been obtained this afternoon, the doctor said.
