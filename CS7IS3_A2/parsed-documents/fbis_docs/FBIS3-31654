The ministry's statement on the results of Kozyrev's visit was given to CTK today. Kozyrev's successive meetings with President Vaclav Havel, Premier Vaclav Klaus and Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec showed the need for a dialogue on the top and high levels, the ministry says. The Czech explained motives and goals of their foreign policy, their efforts to obtain, as soon as possible, membership of NATO, the European Union and the Western European Union, and their negative attitude towards attempts to create spheres of influence. The Czechs heard Russian notions on European security that might be centered, Russians say, around the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). Kozyrev's visit is understood as part of the ongoing intensive discussion on European security and in this respect the Czech Foreign Ministry considers it to be very important, the statement says.
