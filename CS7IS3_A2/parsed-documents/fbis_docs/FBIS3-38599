Government spokesman Dieter Vogel said this evening that the chancellor had, however, expressed understanding for the health reasons "that forced Professor Ortleb to give up his ministerial office." In his three years as minister, Ortleb has played a major part in dealing with the changes in the education system that came about as a result of German unification. In particular, he played a successful role in the renewal and rebuilding of the higher education system in the eastern states, the statement goes on to say. Ortleb has shown great commitment in introducing his experience and the concerns of the eastern states into the German Government's work. The chancellor thanked Ortleb for his achievements as a member of the cabinet and expressed the hope that he would continue to play a part in politics using his expertise and experience.
