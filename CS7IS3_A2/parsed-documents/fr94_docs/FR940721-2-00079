FR940721-2-00079 FR940721-2-00040 [WY&hyph;040&hyph;94&hyph;4350&hyph;08] Emergency Closure in the Arabis pusilla Habitat Management Area, Green River Resource Area, WY AGENCY: Bureau of Land Management, Interior. ACTION: Notice of Emergency Closure in the Arabis pusilla Habitat Management Area, Green River Resource Area, Wyoming. SUMMARY: The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) hereby gives notice that, effective immediately, all public lands within the Arabis pusilla Habitat Management Area (HMA) are closed to all mechanized/non-motorized vehicular use to preserve the habitat of this Candidate plant species. This species, commonly called the small rockcress, is being proposed as Endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Its single known population is located at Pine Creek, near South Pass, Wyoming, and consists of approximately 1000 individuals. Approximately 500 acres of land within the Habitat Management Area (HMA) exclosure will be closed. Vehicular use of the existing roads and trails in the area is causing unacceptable levels of damage to these plants and their limited habitat adjacent to the roads and trails. Unauthorized vehicular use off these roads is also impacting the species. Due to the extremely small population number, and the fragile nature of the plant, damage from vehicular activity could be causing irreversible impacts to the species. The Arabis pusilla Habitat Management Plan calls for elimination of all motorized vehicle activity within the HMA exclosure. EFFECTIVE DATE: The closure will become effective July 21, 1994 and will remain in effect until further notice. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William LeBarron, Area Manager, Green River Resource Area, 1993 Dewar Drive, Rock Springs, Wyoming 82901. Telephone (307) 362&hyph;6422. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Monitoring of the Habitat Management Area has revealed that violations of the ``existing road and trail'' ORV designation commonly occurs and causes adverse impacts to the species. The emergency closure applies to all BLM administered public lands within the Arabis pusilla Habitat Management Area located approximately 20 miles southwest of the town of South Pass, Wyoming, in T29N, R101W, sections 26, 27 and 35, Sixth Principle Meridian. The closure prohibits use of all mechanized motorized and nonmotorized vehicles within the habitat management area, with the exception of: (1) Any Federal, State, or local officers engaged in fire, military, emergency, or law enforcement activities. (2) BLM employees engaged in official duties. Authority for closure orders is provided under 43 CFR Subpart 8364.1. Violations of this closure are punishable by a fine not to exceed $1,000 and/or imprisonment not to exceed 12 months. John S. McKee, Associate District Manager.
