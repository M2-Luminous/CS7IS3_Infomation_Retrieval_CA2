FR940228-2-00061 FR940228-2-00036 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Office of the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity [Docket No. N&hyph;94&hyph;3723; FR 3629&hyph;N&hyph;01] Fair Housing Assistance Program: Announcement of Funding Awards for FY 1992 AGENCY: Office of the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, HUD. ACTION: Announcement of funding awards. SUMMARY: In accordance with section 102(a)(4)(C) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989, this announcement notifies the public of those State and local agencies that were certified by the Department as substantially equivalent agencies under 24 CFR part 115, and that received funding under the Department's Fair Housing Assistance Program. The announcement contains the names and addresses of the State and local agencies and the amount of the awards. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Marcella O. Brown, Director, Funded Programs Division, Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, Washington, DC 20410&hyph;2000. Telephone Number 202&hyph;708&hyph;0455 (voice/TDD). This is not a toll free number. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION I. Background Under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3600&hyph;3619), the Department is authorized to investigate complaints alleging discrimination in housing. Section 810(f) of the Fair Housing Act requires the Department to refer complaints to agencies that have ``substantially equivalent'' fair housing standards, as determined and certified by the Department. The certification standards and procedures are set forth in 24 CFR part 115. Under the Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP), the regulations for which are codified in 24 CFR part 111, the Department may provide assistance to ``substantially equivalent'' State and local agencies. This assistance is designed to provide support for complaint processing, training, technical assistance, data and information systems, and other fair housing projects. The regulations in 24 CFR part 111 provide for FHAP funding to be announced through a Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) published in the Federal Register . Although the regulations in part 111 provide for the announcement of the availability of FHAP funding through a NOFA (and 24 CFR part 12 also makes note of the NOFA requirement), FHAP is not a competitive program. FHAP funds are not awarded on the basis of a competition. Accordingly, a waiver of the requirement to make FHAP funding available through a NOFA was requested and granted. In accordance with the requirements of section 106 of the HUD Reform Act of 1989 (42 U.S.C. 3535(q)(g)), the Secretary, on June 2, 1993, waived the FHAP NOFA requirement set forth in 24 CFR part 12 on the basis that the FHAP is not a competitive program. The Department intends to amend 24 CFR part 12 to reflect the fact that FHAP is not a competitive program. In accordance with the requirements of section 102(a)(4)(C) of the HUD Reform Act of 1989, the names and addresses of the substantially equivalent agencies which received FHAP funds for FY 1992, on a noncompetitive basis, and the amount of the awards, are set forth in Appendix A to this notice. Dated: February 14, 1994. Roberta Achtenberg, Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity.
