I. Introduction On December 29, 1993, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'' 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to adopt a set of procedures addressing specialist member organizations affiliated with an upstairs firm. On May 25, 1994, the Exchange submitted Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change. 3 1 15 U.S.C. ยง78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1991). 3 See letter from Michael D. Pierson, Senior Attorney, PSE, to Amy Bilbija, Attorney, Commission, dated May 23, 1994. This amendment, which is available in the Commission's Public Reference Room, codified a provision enabling the Exchange to request information from specialists relating to transactions in a specialty security. The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33751 (March 10, 1993), 59 FR 12631 (March 17, 1993). No comments were received on the proposal. II. Description The proposed rule change consists of Exchange guidelines that outline the minimum requirements that an Exchange specialist firm affiliated with an upstairs firm 4 will be expected to demonstrate to provide for a functional separation (``Information Barrier'') 5 of its specialist activity from its retail and proprietary business. 4 The Proposal specifies that the functional separation must be established (1) between a specialist firm and any associated approved person; and (2) between a specialist and any associated integrated member organization. The approved person or integrated member organization are collectively referred to as an ``affiliated upstairs firm.'' An ``approved person'' is defined in PSE Rule 4.1(n) as a party who is not an employee, a member or an allied member of a member firm, and who is a director of a member firm, or who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the outstanding equity securities of a member firm, and who has been approved by the Exchange as an approved person. 5 Functional separation of specialist activity from its affiliated upstairs firm business is often times referred to as a ``Chinese Wall.'' In addition to requiring affiliated upstairs firms to establish a Information Barrier, the proposal also requires that they establish, maintain and enforce written procedures reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of material, nonpublic information. Finally the proposal requires an affiliated upstairs firm to obtain prior written approval of the Exchange that it has complied with the requirements to establish functional separation as appropriate to its operation and that it has established proper compliance and audit procedures to ensure the maintenance of the functional separation. 6 6 In addition, a copy of these Chinese Wall procedures, and any amendments thereto, must be filed with the Exchange Financial Compliance Department.
