"Being very divided, we can hardly overcome the crisis today", he said. Hryb was elected to the post of speaker on Friday to replace Stanislav Shushkevich, ousted by parliament. The chairman-elect stressed the need for reforming the system of state power and spoke in favour of presidency in Belarus. In his opinion, it would be reasonable to choose a new president first and then elect a new parliament. Calling himself a staunch advocate of his republic's participation in CIS collective security system, Hryb underlined that "it's too early to speak about Belarus pure neutrality" now when there is a contingent of troops from a neighboring state (meaning Russia - IF) in Belarus." He explained that Minsk and Moscow were bound by accords according to which the withdrawal of Russian troops from Belarus would proceed "during certain time." Hryb declared that his election would keep the republic's former policy toward Russia intact, nor would it affect plans to integrate the monetary systems of the two countries and set up a firm economic alliance. He favorably assessed Kebich's activity as Premier and gave him credit for bringing the economies of Belarus and Russia together.
