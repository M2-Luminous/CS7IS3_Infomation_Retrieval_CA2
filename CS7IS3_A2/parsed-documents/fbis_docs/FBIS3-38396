Government Spokesman Dieter Vogel added in Bonn today that the observer group is to provide support in the creation of a permanent peace in Georgia. The deployment of the German soldiers is limited to six months. Vogel said it is the first UN deployment of this nature on the territory of the former Soviet Union and the first involvement of German soldiers in such a mission. Federal Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel stressed that "preventive diplomacy" is becoming an increasingly important element in peacekeeping as the main aim of the United Nations. The mission in Georgia serves that purpose. As the first UN deployment on the territory of the former Soviet Union, it aims to back the efforts of the conflicting parties for a comprehensive political solution in Georgia. The conflicting parties have approved German participation in UNOMIG, he said.
