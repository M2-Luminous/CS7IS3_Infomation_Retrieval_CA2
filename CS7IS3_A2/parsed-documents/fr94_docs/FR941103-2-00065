CRSP-Wide O&M a. Comment. A customer organization stated: The average annual increase in projected O&M expenses which results in a $8.2 million annual revenue requirement is troublesome. How this figure was obtained in the modeling effort undertaken at Western is not explained in detail in the brochure. If the projected figure is based upon an extrapolation of historical data adjusted for inflation, the cost figure may not reflect all of the possible areas of cost reduction available to both Western and the Bureau of Reclamation. Response. Only two projections used in the Integrated Projects and/or CRSP PRS are based on computer modeling: the water available for power production and the ultimate power-related revenue requirements for the participating projects. Estimates for future O&M expenses are taken directly from official budgets; the budgets include modest approximations of labor cost increases. All equipment spending in the 5-year budget window is made up of actual projections received from workers in the field, reporting which equipment is likely to need replacement and when. Miscellaneous revenue and expense projections are based on historical averages and known future commitments. b. Comment. A customer organization said: The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT) has served as the catalyst for increasing competition in wholesale generation. They would anticipate that Western begin to streamline its operations in order that it position itself competitively in the new electricity market. Response. Western's management is presently looking for ways to improve customer service while cutting costs through Western's Strategic Planning initiative. Some of the decisions made to date include: (1) Delayering. This is a reduction in the number of supervisory employees, to reduce red tape and inertia while increasing customer service. The emphasis will be on empowering the employees. The initiative is already under way.
