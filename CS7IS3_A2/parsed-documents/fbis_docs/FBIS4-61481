Whether the exercises in Orenburg Oblast will go ahead after all may become clear at the end of consultations of Russian and U.S. military working groups which opened in Moscow yesterday. The noise around the exercises is in fact of an exclusively political character. It is hard to believe that the tent camp which was to be made for 210 Americans on the territory of the 27th Motorized Division stationed in the area of Totsk can cause irreparable ecological damage. Likewise it is hard to see the presence of 200 men and officers from the U.S. Army as a real threat to Russia's national security. Apparently State Duma deputies, protesting against the conduct of joint exercises, have decided to use the planned one-week presence of the U.S. military on Russia's territory for far more serious purposes. What is at issue is apparently the figure of the defense minister himself. First of all, because many deputies cannot forgive him the tanks on Krasnopresnenskaya Naberezhnaya last October. Furthermore, anyone from the presidential entourage is a "red rag" to the opposition. Especially a power minister. Pavel Grachev's political independence and influence seem no longer to suit not only the opposition but even some people in the presidential team. Even such a presidential structure as the Security Council has come out against the minister on the side of the State Duma. As KOMMERSANT-DAILY has learned, the council apparatus has prepared a memorandum for Boris Yeltsin that talks about the inexpediency of inviting the Americans to Russia. Meanwhile, for Pavel Grachev, who likes to accentuate his successes in relations with "distant foreign lands," the first Russian-U.S. exercises on Russian soil were to mark not only a transition to a new stage of cooperation with the United States. They were to consolidate his image as a serious politician, capable of pursuing an independent line. Cancellation of the exercises can damage the minister's authority with foreign colleagues and put into question the durability of his position in the upper echelons of the Russian power structure. To be sure, this will not force the defense minister to resign. Yet it is just as obvious that the first crack in his status will appear. If Pavel Grachev fails to defend the idea of joint maneuvers, this will indicate that the general, who is part of the presidential inner circle, is not so influential and invulnerable after all, and will increase the opposition's wish to knock a strong figure from the presidential team. Therefore it can be assumed that criticism over the maneuvers will be followed by more serious attacks. It is also noteworthy that almost at the same time an attack was launched on another power minister, also close to the president: Viktor Yerin. When discussing the assassination of Andrey Ayzderzis, deputies demanded Yerin's resignation. Presumably, taught by bitter experience, the president's opponents are now afraid of attacking him directly. They undertake a bypassing maneuver, trying to shake Boris Yeltsin's main props. Surely, the likelihood that he will soon replace the proven power ministers is negligible. By discrediting people close to the president step by step, however, the opposition can finally compel Yeltsin to part with them. Moreover, the president's opponents do not even need to place their people in the vacant posts: After all the new figures, even if appointed by Yeltsin himself, will hardly strengthen him.
