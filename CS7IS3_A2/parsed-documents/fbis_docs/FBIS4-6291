Labor officials of the nations who attended the ASEAN Sub-Committee on Labor Affairs (ASCLA) meeting decided to bring up the matter during the International Labor Conference (ILC) in June. ASCLA Chairman Bienvenido Laguesma said the social clauses, which are standards or conditions imposed on developing countries before they are granted trade access, are "stringent standards for developing nations." He said "the ASEAN countries' stage of development is not sufficient enough for us to be able to comply with the conditions they have made." "We also have to consider the cultural differences of each country involved. A practice in our country may be considered child or forced labor by other countries when, in fact, our culture dictates otherwise which only shows that we have a different situation from them," he added. Last February, the European Parliament issued a resolution which provides for the inclusion of social clauses in international trade agreements designed to combat child and forced labor . Mr. Laguesma said "the motive is good but the standards are too high. It's one way of keeping developing countries from gaining trade access and competing against developed countries." He also said the move of ASEAN countries to file the resolution is "important because this could mean that the ILC will he adopting several measures as instrument to resolve the issue. He added that last year, ASEAN attempted to file a similar resolution. Unfortunately, it was not tackled because there were other more important issues on the agenda. At the same time, the member countries agreed to consider the possibility of holding dialogues with the International Trade Secretariats (ITS) to diffuse the tension between the parties. ITS are countries or group of countries that regulate or determine which imports could enter their market. If standards of the ITS are not met, they can impose trade sanctions, either by reducing the quota or banning the importation of products from the countries that have not complied with the conditions.
