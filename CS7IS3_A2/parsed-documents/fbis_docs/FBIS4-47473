Stepanov at Byelarusian Academy of Sciences; UDC 621.378.33] [Abstract] Earlier studies having indicated that gain limitation in electric-discharge CO[.sub]2[/]-lasers is not related to underexcitation by electrons but rather to insufficiently selective pumping of CO[.sub]2[/] molecules by the discharge into the 00[.sup]o[/]1 upper level, this evidence is explained theoretically on the basis of the temperature model referring to P-branch of the 00[.sup]o[/]1 10[.sup]o[/]0 transition. The corresponding expression for the gain k with respect to the rotational lower-level quantum number J is analyzed, considering first the ideal case of the entire pump energy W expended either on excitation into the antisymmetric vibrational mode _n_[.sub]3[/] or on raising its vibrational temperature T[.sub]3[/] while the temperatures of the vibrational two other modes remain equal and constant (T[.sub]1[/]= T[.sub]2[/]= T. The dependence of gain k(J) on pump energy W is then governed by the X[.sub]3[/]= exp[-h_n_[.sub]3[/]/kT[.sub]3[/]] term (h- Planck constant, k- Boltzmann constant), the gain being maximum when X[.sub]3[/]= (_a_ + X[.sub]1[/]/2_a_ (X[.sub]1[/]- referring to the first vibrational mode, _a_= exp[2BJ/kT, B- rotational constant approximately equal for both levels). Assuming that T[.sub]3[/] is proportional to the pump energy W, when J= 20 the gain is accordingly maximum when T[.sub]3[/] ï¿½ 4880 K. Next is considered the real case of unequal and rising rather than constant T[.sub]1,2[/] temperatures, also saturation of T[.sub]3[/] temperature and dissociation of CO[.sub]2[/] molecules. The results of this analysis confirm that, indeed, the maximum attainable gain in any kind of CO[.sub]2[/]-laser and the corresponding T[.sub]3[/] temperature on the degree of selectivity with which CO[.sub]2[/] molecules are being excited.
