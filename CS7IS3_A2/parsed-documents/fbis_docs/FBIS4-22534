Our newspaper has already reported on the trip to New York by the UN representative in Azerbaijan, Dr. Mahmud el-Said. As a result of the negotiations that took place during the high-level meetings at the UN headquarters, a decision was made to send a special mission to Azerbaijan consisting of representatives of various departments, commissariats, commissions, and councils of the UN. On the whole the presence of the mission in Azerbaijan can be considered to be a very important event. According to preliminary information, agreement has already basically been reached with the donor countries. We asked Mr. Mahmud el-Said to comment on the results of the mission's work. "The fact that the mission is coming here is the result of our close cooperation with the headquarters in New York and Geneva. The resolution previously adopted by the Security Council concerning the need to render humanitarian aid to Azerbaijan was of great significance. I am very glad that our efforts were not in vain. And the arrival of such a representative mission is a very significant result. This is the first time for many departments and commissions to send representatives to us. I am confident that from now on humanitarian aid to Azerbaijan will be increased considerably and, the main thing, it will become more diverse and targeted, responding to the republic's essential needs." From the Aide-Memoire of the Interdepartmental UN Commission in Azerbaijan for Preparing the Appeal to the World Community The UN interdepartmental commission visited Azerbaijan during 6-12 March 1994 to determine the humanitarian needs of the refugees who were forced to resettle and other of the more vulnerable segments of the population during the period from 1 April through 31 December 1994. The information gathered by the mission will be used when preparing the interdepartmental UN appeal for Azerbaijan, which will be submitted for mobilization of funds by donor countries in April 1994. The mission was headed by the UN Department on Humanitarian Issues (OGV). It consisted of representatives from UNESCO, UNICEF, the UN Volunteer Program (PDO), the World Food Program (VPP), United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Health Organization (WHO), and International Organization for Migration (IOM). The mission was greeted and accompanied by the UN representative in the Azerbaijan Republic. The mission was given support from local representatives of the aforementioned organizations and also from the representative of the UN PR [expansion not indicated]. The mission would like to express its special gratitude to His Excellency Mr. President, the speaker of parliament, the deputy prime minister for humanitarian issues, the ministers and members of the government, and also the authorities of Imishli, Bardy, and Svatly, who rendered able assistance to the mission. The mission conducted a survey of the number of refugees who were forced to resettle and the vulnerable groups of the country and evaluated these people's needs for targeted emergency aid. The mission was informed by the government that the number of refugees in the republic comes to 250,000 (the majority from Armenia) and the number of people from within the country who were forced to resettle is 658,000. The latter were saved by fleeing from Nagorno Karabakh and regions of conflict in the western part of Azerbaijan. Of the 908,000 refugees, approximately 60,000 are living in tent camps that have been built and are well kept up and are currently controlled by the Red Crescent Societies of Iran and Turkey and the International Islamic Humanitarian Organization. Some of the rest have moved in with families, and others, the majority, are living in public buildings and facilities located all over the country. The World Food Program (VPP) will provide the resettlers and the most needy refugees with additional food products, above all those who are living in public institutions. In order to render aid in material and technical preparation for deliveries of humanitarian aid to the region the VPP has founded the Caucasian Organizational Consultative Department (KOKO). The main spheres of aid that were earmarked include increasing the handling capacity of the railroads and ports during circulation and transportation of humanitarian cargo. The Office of the High UN Commissioner for Refugees will continue to satisfy the needs of most groups of refugees and those who have been forced to resettle. The Office of the High Commission will supply household goods through deliveries of nonfoodstuffs such as blankets, plastic sheets, soap, kitchen items, clothing, and footwear.
