He remained in Prague longer than the U.S. President and, before his return to the United States, granted LIDOVE NOVINY an interview on Clinton's visit and on relations between the Czech Republic and the United States. [Smidova] These relations give the impression of being like a staunch friendship between the Czech and the U.S. people. Are there any problems here at all? [Zantovsky] The only place where there are no contentious issues is heaven. I consider that we are managing, regardless of the change in the U.S. Administration, to maintain an atmosphere of intense friendship to be paramount. This is something of an exception in normal contacts between states. The fact that the preparation of treaties, such as on the taxation agreement, is a matter for discussion is also part of such a close relationship. It falls to diplomacy, however, to allay any differences. Nonetheless, I am unaware of any serious problems in mutual relations. [Smidova] Some time has already passed since Clinton's visit. What is your assessment, after such a short time, of its significance? [Zantovsky] The visit was extremely useful for us, according to both our own assessment and the reactions from around the world. The Partnership for Peace plan was at the center of attention, but, apart from this dominant issue, the visit enabled us to gauge U.S. views on the Central European region, the Czech Republic, and U.S. policy toward Russia in the security sphere. It also gave us sufficient opportunity to acquaint the United States with Czech views on the issue. The situation seems different up close than it does from overseas. The fact that millions of Americans had an opportunity to get to know our capital city and to see the U.S. President in Prague is also not insignificant. This is something that can be put to very good use and that, of course, we will use, whether in the tourism or the investment spheres. The results of Clinton's visit can simply be turned into ready money. [Smidova] The U.S. President often travels all over the world. In your opinion, was this visit something special, or was it just a routine visit to a small Central European country? [Zantovsky] It is true that U.S. presidents travel all over the world, but, in President Clinton's case, this was his first visit to Europe and thus, of course, his first mission in the Central European region. This visit more or less dispelled the speculation that U.S. attention is turning away from Europe and that it will be focused on only the Pacific region. This was an important signal and confirmation of the continuing U.S. interest in Europe and in the stability and security of Central Europe. [Smidova] The Partnership for Peace plan is being assessed in various ways. Some see it as a mere gesture, while others see it as a well-thought-out and forward-looking strategy. What is your personal opinion? [Zantovsky] It is essential to realize that, since November, when outgoing Defense Secretary Aspin formulated this idea for the first time, its contents have changed considerably. This was also confirmed in Prague by President Clinton--that is, the issue is not whether the Czech Republic and the other countries of Central and East Europe will join NATO, but when and how. And that is per se very important. If, however, anyone imagined that we would be given automatic security guarantees immediately without any effort on our part, the plan will indeed mean very little to him. The Partnership opens the way for specific possibilities that, given our endeavor, will in the foreseeable future--in a few years--actually lead to the structure of the Czech Armed Forces becoming more compatible with that of the NATO armies. This, in turn, will lead to a very intense exchange of personnel, their coordination, and policy planning. And, last but not least, even the guarantee of consultations contained in Article 4 of the Washington Treaty is not insignificant. This is not, of course, a complete security policy. Nevertheless, any potential aggressor has to take into consideration the fact that this element exists. As far as I am concerned, the success of this plan depends primarily on us. After several decades in which we did not have any influence on our own security, no matter what we did, this is an invaluable factor. [Smidova] A Czech expatriate, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations M. Albright, played a significant role in the Clinton visit. Do you think she kept her fingers crossed more for us than for the other postcommunist countries? [Zantovsky] It would certainly be naive to think that Mrs. Albright is our man in the U.S. Administration, even though, during Clinton's visit, commentaries were published joking that now, with Karel Kovanda presiding over the Security Council, the Czech Republic is the only country in the world with two representatives on this body. Mrs. Albright is, first of all, a U.S. politician, someone who very assiduously defends White House policy and U.S. interests in general. It is invaluable for us that, in view of her origins, she is acquainted in detail and professionally with the political trends and situation not only in our country, but also throughout postcommunist Europe. Her views may be an asset to the U.S. President and Administration and, thus, also to us. It is not by chance that President Clinton sent her on a trip to all of the posttotalitarian countries before his visit, although, from a purely bureaucratic point of view, this was not her task. This was an expression of his faith in her knowledge of the region. [Smidova] In connection with asserting Czech interests in the United States, it is said that the Czech lobby is weak and that it does not have the same influence as the Polish or Hungarian special-interest groups.... [Zantovsky] Reference is often made to this. The situation is, after all, somewhat different from the Polish exiles because the Czechs arrived in several distinct waves. These are people who brought with them an image of their homeland belonging to their own time. Therefore, it is sometimes difficult for them to share the same views on an issue. Despite this, a number of expatriates are very actively helping the Czech Republic, among other things, by supporting its interests in political circles. Above all, I would mention Charles Vanik, the coauthor of the Jackson-Vanik amendment. Moreover, the national lobby is not the only or necessarily the most effective force that could act on our behalf in U.S. politics. It is equally important for us that, owing to the influx of U.S. investment in the Czech Republic, there are now a number of businessmen in the United States interested in ensuring that we are successful, that they are successful with us, and that relations between the two countries are the best they can be. These people appeal actively to their congressmen. This is another force on which we can rely.
