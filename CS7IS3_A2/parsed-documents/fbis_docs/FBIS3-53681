In an interview with AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, PPP Secretary General Bashir al-Barghuthi said that the numerous meetings held in Tunis last week with Fatah officials produced positive results, particularly including an agreement on formulating clear and common ground between his party and Fatah regarding developments related to the current negotiations with Israel for the implementation of the Declaration of Principles as well as current Palestinian conditions. This development comes after months of estrangement and cool relations between the PPP and the Palestinian leadership resulting in the PPP's suspension of its participation in the last rounds of the Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations in Washington and boycott of the work of the joint Palestinian-Israeli committees for the implementation of the Declaration of Principles in Egypt. Al-Barghuthi said that the impasse reached in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations for the implementation of the Declaration of Principles was new evidence of the need for the Palestinian leadership to understand and respond to the demands made by the PPP. He emphasized that these were national, not partisan or factional demands, aimed mainly at strengthening Palestinian national unity through the introduction of clear and realistic concepts of what should be done in the current and next phases to ensure fulfillment of the Palestinian people's aspirations. On the PPP's position on the current negotiations between the PLO and Israel on the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement, al-Barghuthi said: There can be no doubt that the situation is difficult. It is clear that, under the pressure of internal opposition, the Israeli Government has retreated from previous positions. That makes it necessary for the Palestinian side to consolidate its unity and explain its position to Arab and international public opinion. It is also necessary for the Palestinian parties which support the Declaration of Principles to assess the situation. The Palestinians, al-Barghuthi said, have no alternative now but to insist on their positions, strengthen their internal front, close their ranks, and continue their struggle. Al-Barghuthi said that his party categorically rejected the recent Israeli proposals on the crossing points and the area of Jericho. He added that "these proposals are totally rejected and should not be accepted because they run contrary to the Declaration of Principles." He pointed out that the Jericho area under Ottoman, British, and Jordanian rules always reached the River Jordan. On Fatah's side, Muhammad Ghunaym (Abu-Mahir), its official in charge of mobilization and organization, emphasized that the PPP, as a part of the existing PLO coalition, had expressed interest in bilateral relations with Fatah that would cover organization and coordination in the various fields of common interest. Fatah, he said, welcomes such a formula which should be open to all the Palestinian forces which support the political grounds on which the Declaration of Principles was based. He added that that formula would be tantamount to an agreed framework for political and field cooperation in the occupied territory among all the organizations which share similar views on a political settlement based on the same foundation, namely the Declaration of Principles signed on 13 September. Abu-Mahir emphasized that the purpose of that bilateral formula is to scrutinize daily activities and draw the necessary plans for the implementation of the Declaration of Principles on the ground to pave the way for a Palestinian state.
