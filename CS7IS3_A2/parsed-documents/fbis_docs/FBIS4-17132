Yeltsin in the Kremlin 20 April. The session examined two main questions: on Russia's policy in the Caucasus region and on the fulfillment of decisions on state support for the Cossacks. However, as Security Council Secretary O. Lobov said in conversation with your IZVESTIYA correspondent, Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev also briefed the Council on the situation in Bosnia. In view of the fact that B. Yeltsin's initiative to hold a summit meeting of leaders of the interested states on the Bosnian problem is meeting with growing support, it was decided to speed up its preparation. Working contacts have already begun in this regard. A. Kozyrev gave the Security Council members a detailed report on the military-political situation in the region of the conflict between Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh and also in connection with the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. The general opinion, O. Lobov said, is this: Russia's interests in this region -- first and foremost the existence of a considerable Russian diaspora there and the presence of a large military contingent -- dictate the necessity of strengthening its peacemaking role in those conflicts. Since organizations like the United Nations and the CSCE cannot send their forces there, Russia advocates the presence of Defense Ministry disengagement forces in the conflict zones, as well as the presence of observers from international organizations. As for the problem of the Cossacks, the Security Council session took note of the slow solution of the questions of ensuring self-government in the Cossack communities and granting them land. In some regions there have been confrontations between local administrations and Cossack elected organs. On the other hand, the government and the president's structures have a common position regarding the rehabilitation of the Cossacks as a community [sosloviye]. A general federal program will be drafted in that regard. The president is going to send the State Duma a draft law on the return of land to Cossack settlements. This process will have different features in different regions, of course. As for the performance of military service by Cossacks, the Cossack formations will be introduced into the structures of the Defense Ministry and the border troops.
