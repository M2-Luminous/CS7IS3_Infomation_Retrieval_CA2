FBIS4-51498 "dreas083_i_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-083 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 Cambodia Demonstrators Protest FUNCINPEC Corruption Demonstrators Protest FUNCINPEC Corruption 11111111 11111111 CSO [Editorial Report] The 4 March REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA carried a report on pages 1, 11 citing the 2 March edition of CAMBODIA DAILY concerning an anti-FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] rally held "outside Phnom Penh" on 1 March. Some 200 "former" FUNCINPEC supporters claimed that party officials had promised to find them jobs during the election campaign, but now those officials are demanding bribes for jobs. A demonstrator from Kompong Cham--who had worked for FUNCINPEC during the campaign--said "Now that FUNCINPEC has won the election, they can't find me a job. They even told me it would cost me $400 to get a police lieutenant's position." Demonstrators who requested anonymity said that FUNCINPEC police "were corrupt from top to bottom" with the amount of the bribe based on the police rank sought. The CAMBODIA DAILY notes that Co-Minister of the Interior Yu Hokkri's response was that "those demonstrators were not among those who had been promised vacant positions." However, Yu Hokkri did admit that the demonstrators' claims of corruption could be valid, saying that "we cannot promise that all of our officials are good." The article noted that during and after the campaign, FINCINPEC personnel had promised voters jobs as an inducement not to support the party's rival, the Cambodian People's Party, which these officials had labelled as totally corrupt.
