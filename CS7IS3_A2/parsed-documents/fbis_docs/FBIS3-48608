The Bosnian president is asking members of the Nonaligned Movement [NAM], which is chaired by President Suharto, to send a peacekeeping force to Bosnia-Herzegovina to end the civil war in the Balkan nation. The Bosnian war is dragging on. Some 250,000 people have been killed, thousands more injured, and (?2 million) made refugees by the war. Peace efforts undertaken by the United Nations, the European Community, and NATO have failed. The worrisome situation is partly due to the continued UN arms embargo on the nation. Serbian and Croatian forces continue their attacks in violation of the UN resolutions on the cease-fire. The two dailies describe as normal and noteworthy the request of President Alija Izetbegovic for a peacekeeping force from Indonesia and the NAM in order to achieve peace in the former Yugoslav republic because former Yugoslavia is a NAM founding member. This will also strengthen efforts of Islamic Conference Organization members and the United States to have the arms embargo lifted and peace efforts by the United Nations, the European Community, and NATO.
