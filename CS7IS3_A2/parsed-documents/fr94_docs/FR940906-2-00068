FR940906-2-00068 FR940906-2-00058 NATIONAL PARK SERVICE General Management Plan, Final Environmental Impact Statement, Jewel Cave National Monument, SD AGENCY: National Park Service, Department of the Interior. ACTION: Availability of final environmental impact statement/general management plan for Jewel Cave National Monument. SUMMARY: Pursuant to Section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the National Park Service (NPS) announces the availability of a Final Environmental Impact Statement/General Management Plan (FEIS/GMP) for Jewel Cave National Monument, South Dakota. DATES: A 30-day no-action period will follow the Environmental Protection Agency's notice of availability of the FEIS/GMP. ADDRESSES: Public reading copies of the FEIS/GMP will be available for review at the following locations: Office of the Superintendent, Jewel Cave National Monument, Telephone: (605) 673&hyph;2288. Division of Planning Design and Maintenance, Rocky Mountain Regional Office, National Park Service, 12795 West Alameda Parkway, Lakewood, CO 80225, Telephone: (303) 969&hyph;2620. Office of Public Affairs, National Park Service, Department of Interior, 18th and C Streets NW., Washington, DC 20240, Telephone: (202) 208&hyph;6843. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FEIS/GMP analyzes two alternatives to protect resources while providing for visitor use of the monument. Under Alternative A, the no-action alternative, existing programs, development, and trends (including implementation of the draft Resource Management Plan) would continue, but new facilities and interpretation would not be added. In the proposed action (alternative B); emphasis would be on protection of Jewel Cave through understanding and mitigation of the effects on cave resources caused by surface facilities and activities. Visitor safety would be given a high priority; access for visitors with disabilities would be improved; interpretation would be expanded to help visitors better understand the relationship between surface and subsurface resources; and the National Park Service would pursue cooperative ventures and boundary expansion to protect cave resources. The FEIS/GMP in particular evaluates the environmental consequences of the proposed action and the other alternatives on cave resources, geology, soils and vegetation, wildlife, water resources, air quality, cultural resources, visitor experience, socioeconomic environment, and management and operations. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Superintendent, Jewel Cave National Monument, at the above address and telephone number. Dated: August 23, 1994. Robert M. Baker, Regional Director, Rocky Mountain Region, National Park Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;21873 Filed 9&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;70&hyph;P&hyph;M
