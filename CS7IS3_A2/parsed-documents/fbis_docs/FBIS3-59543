Ever since the disappearance of the Warsaw Pact, Poland has been trying to revive its military connections with the Western countries, particularly with France. New prospects are opening up for French manufacturers today in view of Poland's desire to join NATO. This revival of bonds has already been expressed by partnerships between military units, such as, between the 2nd Fighter Squadron based on Dijon and the 1st Polish Air Defense Regiment stationed at Minsk-Mazowiecki; there have also been trips by high-ranking military authorities or industrialists. Now it is the turn of a delegation of equipment makers from GIFAS [French Aerospace Industries Group] to visit the country presided over by Lech Walesa. Although the French military budget is declining with barely 10% earmarked for equipment, the needs of the Polish Army are very great. The participation of Polish military personnel in UN missions, side by side with Western forces, enabled them to measure the weakness of their Soviet-produced materiel in terms of modernity and interoperability. This calls for a major effort since they very much want to join NATO. Due to lack of sufficient funds, it is clear that there will be no direct purchasing of defense materiel. Unable to purchase Mirage 2000 aircraft as they said they would like to, the Air Force people are content with modernizing their MiG-21 and MiG-23 aircraft (300 units) and possibly their MiG-29 planes. French producers, such as Thomson-CSF, Sagem [Company for General Applications of Electricity and Mechanics], or Dassault Electronique are particularly well-placed, even in the area of modernizing their armored vehicles, which is also on the agenda. In the armament field, there are good opportunities in the Polish Navy which wants to improve the antiaircraft defenses of its vessels by adding antiaircraft missile systems. Besides, the Navy people want to replace their old SS-N-2 "Styx" anti-ship missiles with "Exocet" and to procure anti-mine and anti-submarine sonars both for their mine chasers and their helicopters (Thomson airborne sonar). Lastly, in developing their own antiaircraft system based on a T-72 tank chassis christened the "Loara" (meaning Loire!), they are looking for missiles of the Roland or Crotale type and they are negotiating for a license with France. This system, equipped with a fire control and electrooptical radar (to be defined), comes in two versions: one with two 35-mm Oerlikon cannons and another with eight antiaircraft missiles. Above and beyond some immediate purchases, Poland's main concern has to do with the future of its armament industry which occupied something like 300,000 workers before the Pact crumbled. This was an industry some of whose production centers were working exclusively for the USSR, such as, for example, a portion of the Mielek plant that annually turned out more than 500 An-28 [aircraft] for export. Today, it is being restructured with something like 50% personnel cuts. But in this entire industry, the Polish Government intends to preserve the aviation sector. A group organized under the consortium PZL (Panstwowe Zaklady Lotnicze) consists of 19 establishments specializing in the license-based construction of light aircraft (trainers and liaison aircraft), helicopters, and engines employing something like 50,000 persons. Along these lines, the Poles are looking for partnerships with Western manufacturers to improve their products, to find commercial outlets, or to get into subcontracting work. Here, we might mention the "Dromader" crop-duster built in cooperation with Rockwell and Pratt & Whitney, or the central section of the wing of the ATR-72 made by PZL-Swidnik (see box) in the wake of compensation agreements that followed the purchase of eight ATR-42 by LOT [Polish Airlines]. They are also looking for new engines to boost the performances of their aircraft: Larzac (in competition with Viper) for their Iryda trainer, or the Ariel turbine for their new SW-4 helicopter. Finally, in the electronics field, agreements have also been signed between Thomson-CSF and the builder of Radwar radars for the production of IFF identification systems. Box French-Polish Cooperation: Example of PZL-Swidnik Located 160 km southwest of Warsaw, PZL-Swidnik is the Polish establishment that has been specializing in the development and production of helicopters since 1953. More than 7,000 craft have come off its assembly lines, primarily the Mi-2. Ever since the big upheaval in 1989, the firm became a "company of the State Treasury," that is to say, an enterprise equivalent to one of our national companies capable of engaging in commerce according to international rules. Its personnel force was cut from 8,000 to 5,000, although management officials "would love to reduce the personnel force even more." Right now, its model assortment still consists of the venerable Mi-2 which PZL-Swidnik is rebuilding and upgrading with Allison turbines under the name of "Kania," as well as the new "Sokol," which has had some export success (see No. 1445), a ground-attack version of which is being developed with the help of South Africa; then there is also the SW-4 light helicopter which is undergoing development and whose power plant could be farmed out to Turbomeca. Like all of Poland's industries, the Lublin Firm is struggling with a slack demand. This year, it will produce barely about 30 craft. Hence, the desire to supplement helicopter production with other activities, especially aeronautical subcontracting or diversified products. Among these new products, the PW-5 glider designed by the Warsaw Technology University has turned out to be a winner. There are also less prestigious products, such as baby carriages, machinery for agribusiness, and vehicle trailers, more than 2,000 of which are sold in France. "France turned out to be the most receptive in our search for cooperative undertakings," confided Pavel Restak, the company's new marketing manager. The first step was taken with the agreement covering the manufacture of 290 elements of the central box of the wing cell for the ATR-72, a first copy of which has just been shipped to France. For the Polish enterprise, this turned into a learning experience and the application of new procedures, above all in terms of surface treatment, quality control, as well as an in-depth transformation of manufacturing processes. For the French, this means orders for equipment (especially a three-axle milling tool capable of machining 10-m long parts), plus plant modernizing agreements. In a more general fashion, Aerospatiale signed a technical cooperation agreement and 105 Polish technicians have already gone through six-month training courses at the Eurocopter plant in Marignane. PZL-Swidnik managers, who believe that this kind of exchange is "profitable and very beneficial," are thus in the process of transforming the old arsenal into a modern enterprise equipped with a 500-person research office, and above all, a commercial division that is already staffed by 60 workers.
