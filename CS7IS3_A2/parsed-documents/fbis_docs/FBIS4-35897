Jalal Talabani, secretary general of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK], has told AL-HAYAH that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard is supporting the Kurdistan Democratic Party [KDP], the Islamic Movement, and the Revolutionary Hizballah, which is led by Adham Barzani, with artillery and rocket bombardment. He told AL-HAYAH over the telephone from his residence in Damascus that Turkey has opened the border between Zakho and the A spokesman for the KDP (led by Mas'ud Barzani) has rejected the accusation that the party is tacitly allying with the Islamic Movement. He accused the forces of Talabani's party of launching "three attacks on KDP positions on Tuesday night/Wednesday morning, thus violating the cease-fire" signed between Talabani's party and Mas'ud's party. Talabani said that the KDP violated the agreement and attacked Halshu [as transliterated] in Qal'at Dizah (north Iraq) from the Iranian area of Sar Dasht on Wednesday, supported by the Islamic Movement and Revolutionary Hizballah. The Revolutionary Guard offered artillery and rocket support. He added that KDP forces "launched an attack last Monday in the al-Jabal al-Ahmar area, Kalaw Qasim [as transliterated], and Bani Haris, and that the attack was repulsed." He pointed out that "Iranian intervention" in the fighting in the Iraqi-Iranian border areas "is now clear. We have requested authorities in Tehran to stop sending groups into our areas, but to no avail." [passage omitted] Talabani accused Barzani's party of preventing the delivery of food and medical supplies from Zakho to Irbil, al-Sulaymaniyah, and Karkuk. He said that he had addressed "an appeal to Barzani to prevent the violation of the cease-fire agreement," [passage omitted] In the same context Hushyar Zibari, member of the KDP Political Bureau and the Kurdish administration's representative in Britain, has denied that "the Revolutionary Guard has infiltrated into Iraqi Kurdistan." Zibari told AL-HAYAH over the telephone from Washington yesterday that linking Iran and Islamic movements with the issue (fighting) is like throwing dust in the eyes." He said: "We challenge the Patriotic Union to show us any of the Revolutionary Guard elements said to have been captured." He described the fears that Talabani might be attacked as "delusions which do not justify delaying his return" to north Iraq. He stressed that Barzani "telephoned Talabani and sent him messages asking him to speed up his return and guaranteeing his safety, but he (Talabani) always changes his mind." [passage omitted]
