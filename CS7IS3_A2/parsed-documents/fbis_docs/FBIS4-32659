Acknowledging the birth of a free press in Albania over the last few years, the journalists highlighted in their discussions the existence of a dual tendency: on the one hand, abuse of the freedom of the press and, on the other, efforts to restrict it. Some of the speakers pointed out that the media in general was still politicized, and the independent press remained a small minority. It is precisely the latter -- having financial support from neither political forces nor government -- that is extremely endangered by the merciless law of insolvency of the market economy.
