Kiosa says he has just spoken to Valentin Sergeyev, head of the press service of the Russian Government. Kiosa continues: "In reply to my question about the premier's reaction to Gaydar's statement, Sergeyev said that Chernomyrdin's reaction was calm. The premier talked with Gaydar about the possibility of combining the functions of leader of the Russia's Choice faction and that of first deputy premier. As a result of that calm and businesslike conversation, a decision was made to think things over and to find a solution. Gaydar announced his decision today. "In reply to my question as to whether Yegor Gaydar had made his decision under pressure from the premier, Sergeyev categorically denied such a possiblity. He stressed, moreover, that Gaydar's coming -- or rather his second coming -- into the government occurred on the initiative of the premier himself, and all their relations were businesslike and working relations. "Valentin Sergeyev said that the final composition of the Government will be announced at the beginning of next week. I think that Tuesday is the most likely day for this." Kiosa recaps that there has been much talk over the past few days that if Fedorov and Gaydar leave the Government this will mark an end to reforms in Russia. Kiosa continues: "According to Sergeyev, the Government will continue to be directed toward the reforms, in keeping with the program which has been approved." He adds: "As far as the question of Fedorov is concerned, Sergeyev stressed he did not have any information on that yet. However, I would draw the conclusion that candidacies for this post held by Yegor Gaydar will be examined now, and are probably being examined already. "In reply to your question, of course, a lot depends on whether Fedorov remains, that is the first thing, and on who will take Gaydar's place. Incidentally, it is probably worth drawing attention to Gaydar's words on his wish that Grigoriy Yavlinskiy should take part in the government." The announcer asks Kiosa if he thinks Yavlinskiy will be offered the post of first deputy premier, to which Kiosa replies: "It is really hard to believe that now, although the most unexpected things may happen." Kiosa wonders why the financial issues raised by Gaydar as motives for his resignation were not discussed in the Government with him. "I think that Gaydar's resignation may have a serious effect on the alignment of forces, both in the Government and on the whole in the higher echelons of power," Kiosa says. Gaydar's resignation may have been undesirable for the head of the Russian Government, the announcer surmises. Sergeyev may just have been putting on a diplomatic act when he spoke to Kiosa, she concludes.
