Chen Bing, director of the Guangdong Federation of Trade Unions, said that the local law is applicable to all workers, in both regular and temporary employment, in enterprises of different ownerships under the province's administration. The law will put special emphasis on workers' interests, and it states clearly for the first time that victims should get compensation, instead of merely punishing those infringing workers' interests, Chen said. In the course of changes in the economic pattern, some problems concerning the relations between labor and capital have popped up -- basically problems concerning working time, payment, safety and health care, insurance and welfare, government officials said. A random sample survey conducted by the provincial federation of trade unions among 1,500 workers indicates that 39 percent of the workers enter factories without signing contracts, and the payment in two-thirds of foreign-funded enterprises is lower than the yearly local average pay. The survey also shows that as many as 61 percent of employees work seven days a week, and 42 percent of them work ten hours or more a day.
