A series of reform measures has been or will be announced. In accordance with the unified central arrangements, we should be bold and good at making overall progress and at bringing about breakthroughs in focal points in light of Hubei's specific conditions. 1. We must emancipate our minds significantly, really understand that the fundamental task of socialism is to emancipate the productive forces, uphold the basic standard of the three favorable's, and free ourselves from all sorts of ideological binds resulting from the abstract debate over whether something being done is of a socialist or capitalist nature. 2. We must make a major move in terms of policy, thoroughly rid ourselves of the influence of the traditional planned economic structure, and in the planning, financial, monetary, commercial, and trade fields, we should work out a set of rules, regulations, and methods corresponding to the market economy. 3. In action, we must produce actual results and develop the spirit of being bold in blazing new trails. In macroeconomic management and microeconomic invigoration, we must do well. For these reasons, we must do the following jobs successfully, and in accordance with the realities in Hubei: 1) While focusing on improving large and medium-sized state enterprises, we must expedite the establishment of a modern enterprise system; 2) We must cultivate and develop a market system so as to form a uniform, open, competitive, and orderly market; 3) We must expedite institutional reform, transform government functions, and make a success of macroeconomic regulation and control; 4) We must actively carry out financial and taxation structural reform and must establish a local financial and taxation system; 5) We must deepen investment structural reform and strengthen the formation of a local investment structure; 6) We must widen the avenues leading to fund sources and strive to turn Hubei into the country's fund pool.
