FR940524-0-00014 FR940524-0-00007 2. Numerous comments and reply comments were filed by interested parties in response to the notice of proposed rule making (58 FR 53489 (October 15, 1993)) in this docket. These comments address the many proposals made in the notice regarding, among other things, narrowband PCS licenses. Auction Eligibility 3. In the Second Report and Order (59 FR 22980 (May 4, 1994)), we concluded that narrowband PCS as a class of service was reasonably likely to satisfy the criteria of section 309(j) of the Communications Act. Also, the use of competitive bidding to award narrowband PCS licenses as compared to other licensing methods will speed the development and deployment of new services to the public and recover for the public a portion of the value of the spectrum. Auction Design 4. The spectrum allocation, service definition and technical rules for narrowband PCS were completed by the Commission in the Narrowband PCS Memorandum Opinion and Order (59 FR 14115 (March 25, 1994)). We anticipated that advanced paging and messaging services would be the predominant narrowband services provided. Three megahertz of spectrum were allocated to narrowband PCS in three one megahertz bands (901&hyph;902 MHz, 930&hyph;931 MHz and 940&hyph;941 MHz). Two megahertz of this spectrum were divided into 50 kHz and 12.5 kHz channels and will be available for immediate licensing. The remaining one megahertz of narrowband PCS spectrum will be channelized and licensed in the future as this service develops. 5. Simultaneous multiple round auction. In This Report and Order, we adopt simultaneous multiple round auctions as our primary auction methodology for narrowband PCS licenses. We expect the value of most narrowband PCS licenses to be sufficiently high to warrant the use of simultaneous auctions. This type of auction will be most likely to deploy rapidly new narrowband PCS technologies and services, promote the development of competition for the provision of those and other services, and thus foster economic growth. We recognize, however, that simultaneous multiple round bidding may involve a greater degree of complexity than other competitive bidding methods and that it may present greater operational difficulties for both the Commission and for bidders. 6. Alternative auction designs. Because narrowband PCS licenses vary in terms of expected value and interdependence, we have determined that no single competitive bidding design will be optimal for all licenses. For this reason and because Congress directed us to test multiple alternative methodologies, we will adopt other auction designs as alternatives to our primary design. When we announce individual auctions to award specific groups of narrowband licenses, we will issue a public notice detailing the competitive bidding design and procedures to be used. 7. Oral sequential and single round (sealed bid) auctions. If, as a result of our auction experience, we determine that the operational costs or complexities associated with simultaneous multiple round auctions outweigh their benefits, we may decide to employ either oral sequential auctions or single round sealed bid auctions. In an oral sequential auction, licenses are put up for bid one at a time, so that bidding ends on one item before it begins on the next item. Oral sequential auctions generate valuable information about earlier auctioned licenses, which can assist bidders in valuing later auctioned licenses. However, if license values are interdependent oral sequential auctions are less likely than simultaneous auctions to award interdependent licenses to the parties who value them the most and to aggregate licenses efficiently, because bidders for licenses that are auctioned early must bid with less information about the value of licenses to be auctioned later, and have less opportunity to pursue backup bidding strategies. Nonetheless, because oral sequential auctions are generally less complex, and costly both for the FCC and for potential bidders, they may be appropriate to use where the expected value of the narrowband PCS licenses to be auctioned is low relative to the costs of conducting a more complex auction or where interdependence is less significant. 8. We may find, for some narrowband PCS licenses that even the lesser cost and complexity of oral sequential auctions are not justified by the revenues these licenses would be expected to generate. In such cases, we may choose to award licenses by single round sealed bidding where bids for all licenses are submitted simultaneously and the high bidder for each license is determined after a single round of bidding. Single round sealed bidding has the principal advantage of being relatively simple for bidders to understand and inexpensive for the FCC to administer and also can generally be completed fairly rapidly. However, because single round sealed bidding provides less information and flexibility to bidders than either simultaneous or sequential auctions, we will generally use this method only where there is less interdependence among individual licenses or groups of licenses and the expected value of the licenses to be auctioned is low relative to the cost of conducting a more complex auction. In addition, we may select this auction design where eligibility requirements limit participation to relatively few bidders.
