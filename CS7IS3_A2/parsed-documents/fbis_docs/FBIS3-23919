Drozdov, deputy minister of foreign economic relations of the Russian Federation, by Boris Rachkov; date and place not given: "Russia-U.S. Business Partnership: One More Chance?"] [Text] The 20th century, in a large part of which the fate of mankind has been determined by the nature of relations between Moscow and Washington, which are situated in different halves of the world, will soon be at an end. The polar opposition of the superpowers personifying them made a heavy impression on all of world history. Not a geographical opposition, of course, but one that grew out of political, ideological, and social contradictions. It was to this that the cooperation of the two states, potentially boundless in terms of mutual advantage, was sacrificed. They could long ago have become the world's biggest business partners, but are as yet still scrutinizing each other and measuring one another, as it were. "And it is not the first time that we have taken these measurements, what is more," Nikolay Ustinovich Drozdov, deputy minister of foreign economic relations of the Russian Federation, says in conversation with an EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN correspondent on Russian-American trade and economic relations at their present stage. "Attempts at a rapprochement have been made repeatedly, by people of several generations, it may be said. And all such attempts have had one thing in common: They have been imperiously dictated to both countries by some irresistible forces and fateful circumstances which forced the politicians of Moscow and Washington to forgo antagonism for the sake of the simple survival of their states." [Rachkov] You are referring, most likely, primarily to the joint participation of the USSR and the United States in the war against Hitler fascism and Japanese militarism? [Drozdov] This also, of course. But not only this. Ten years before the attack by fascist Germany on the Soviet Union, and by Japan on America's Pearl Harbor, the entire Western world, the United States in particular, lay in the ruins of an unprecedented economic crisis. But that crisis stopped at borders beyond which lay one-sixth of the land area of the globe--the Soviet Union--where, albeit by brutal methods, the vigorous experiment of "Stalin's industrialization" was being undertaken. It created a tremendous demand for American and other equipment. In order to give at least some additional stimulus to its crisis-ridden industry the United States--the last of the great powers, after 16 years of hesitation--finally recognized the "Bolshevik dictatorship" diplomatically. In exchange for our goods and gold, Washington encouraged the supply to us of a considerable quantity of equipment, which brought back to the American plants tens of thousands of unemployed. But then the economy in the West picked up, and the vicissitudes of geopolitics threw Stalin and Hitler into one another's embrace for some time, which contributed to a winding down of economic relations with the United States, right up until the start of the joint struggle for survival at the height of World War II. [Rachkov] And then the cold shower for our business relations with America and the majority of Western countries was the cold war, which dragged on for many years. Am I right? [Drozdov] Yes, this is common knowledge. And one further attempt, far-reaching, I would say, at the trade and economic rapprochement of Moscow and Washington was made within our memory even. After all, in the first decades following World War II supernatural force was in the full meaning of the words concentrated in the nuclear warheads of the superpowers. And the Caribbean crisis of the fall of 1962 just about sprang this genie from the "bottle," which would have been lethal for the whole world. The world was horrified at the threat of destruction at that time, Moscow and Washington were horrified. Under the conditions of the recognition of this global threat and on the last waves of Khrushchev's "thaw" and in the last months in office in the United States of the commonsensical President John Kennedy, our countries once again took a number of important steps toward one another. The treaty banning nuclear tests in three spheres was signed in August 1963. Economic contacts were stepped up. But this strongly aroused "hawks" of all stripes also. The assassination of Kennedy and the ouster of Khrushchev once again froze our relations for a number of years. But the common fear in the face of nuclear self-annihilation and the need for mutual tolerance, impossible without economic interaction, now made themselves felt, for all that. The start of the 1970's were, truly, marked by steps, unparalleled for both superpowers, in the creation of the legal foundations of trade and economic cooperation at the interstate and public levels. [Rachkov] I remember those years distinctly. Of all the "projects of the century" which loomed at that time, a contract for the supply to the United States of Russian urea for nitrogen fertilizers in short supply there and for the supply to the CIS of American source material for phosphorous fertilizer, which is in short supply with us, is being realized currently to this extent or the other. Towering up as a solid monument to that period on Krasnaya Presnya is the Moscow International Trade Center, which was built by the billionaire Armand Hammer, the enthusiast of American-Russian cooperation, for a sizable fee, of course. And, in addition, the Soyuz-Apollo brand of cigarettes--a reminder of the impressive attempt to begin the cooperation of the USSR and the United States in space orbits--also still flickers in places, like the light of a distant star. But where are all the other cherished dreams, preliminary outlines, and projects? [Drozdov] It is worth remembering the most far-reaching voluntary association of business circles of the two powers which emerged at that time for the purpose of promoting their cooperation--American-Soviet Trade and Economic Cooperation (ASTEC). It united on both sides over 500 firms, banks, enterprises, establishments, and organizations. But it no longer exists either, alas. But it cannot be said that ASTEC was useless. On the contrary, it performed a great deal of work. But, to be frank, it did not justify all hopes and is now being transformed into new associations. But, generally, the onslaught of the supporters of cooperation of the start of the 1970's once again became bogged down--and once again on account of the oppression of policy and confrontation ideology. As in the 1960's the transatlantic "hawks" plunged the United States into the Vietnam slaughter, so at the end of the 1970's our apologies for strategists involved the USSR in the Afghan adventure. Against the background of the permanent Near East crisis, both were repeatedly accompanied by Moscow's and Washington's stern and rather dangerous warnings leveled at one another. People were not in the mood for large-scale trade and reciprocal work on long-term projects here. There had, most likely, to be a new turn in history which once again revealed to the new generation of politicians and ideologists the futility and ruinous nature of their obdurate opposition. [Rachkov] Following the logic of your arguments, I would venture to maintain that this historical turn was the start of the democratic transformations in our country at the turn of the 1990's, and in the United States, the ruling establishment's abandonment of the view of us as the "evil empire." This turn, dictated by the entire bitter experience of the antagonism, which had grown wearisome, was, truly, all-sufficing and "fateful" for mankind, as our first democrats put it. The world for the first time breathed a sigh of relief at the end of the cold war and both superpowers began to undertake mutually coordinated disarmament and take new steps on the path of economic cooperation. [Drozdov] And once again not everything was that simple. In the past two years Moscow and Washington have implemented very important measures in the sphere of normalization of trade and economic cooperation. But I would not yet venture to call them historic, from which I am restrained by the experience of previous disappointments. And there is still considerable work to be done by myself and my colleagues and you journalists, and, generally, all responsible people in Russia and the United States for a departure as far as possible from the abyss of confrontation, economic included. Judge by the facts. Yes, Washington has removed many of the discriminatory trade and political restrictions which had been established in respect to the former USSR and which had operated in respect to Russia. Thus Russia has for the first time since 1951 been accorded most-favored-nation status in trade. The legislative prohibitions on credit to us along the lines of the Commodity-Credit Corporation and the Export-Import Bank of the United States have been revoked. The restrictions on the special government insurance agency of the United States--the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC)--have been removed. Russia has acquired the opportunity to use soft long-term loans in accordance with the Food for Progress program. The extension to us of the General System of Customs Preferences will contribute to the increased efficiency of the exports of a whole number of our commodities to the United States. Yes, we take a positive view of the Furtherance of Reform in New Democratic Countries Act, which has been adopted in the United States: It provides for the abolition of more than 70 legislative restrictions established in the years of the cold war. The reform of Cocom which is being undertaken at the present time is reason to believe that there will shortly be considerable movement in the direction of abolition of the discriminatory restrictions on supplies to Russia of research-intensive goods and technology, which have been in effect for more than 40 years. At the same time a number of discriminatory restrictions preventing the building of bilateral trade and economic relations on a firm long-term basis continues to operate in respect to Russia. For example, the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which was introduced 20 years ago, gives the American side the right at any time to unilaterally cancel the most-favored-nation status in trade which has been accorded Russia. Antidumping procedures, which are hampering our exports to the United States or threatening to squeeze out of the American market a number of important Russian raw material commodities (carbamide, ferrosilicon, aluminum, and others), continue to operate. And the antidumping procedures applied in respect to our exporters are considerably more harsh and onerous than those that are applied in respect to the vast majority of countries, what is more. In sum, the United States' share of Russia's foreign trade turnover is not even 2 percent, and Russia's share of America's trade is gauged in only tenths of 1 percent. And at the present stage of scientific and technological development the traditional forms of our trade and economic relations with the United States based on the buying and selling of commodities are, generally, exhausted to a considerable extent, evidently. Extensive investment cooperation should, I believe, contribute to the advancement of these relations to an entirely different level in keeping with our desires and the immense potentials of the two countries. Unfortunately, here also we are still only at the start: The share of American investments in the sum total of foreign capital investments in the economy of Russia constitutes only 10 percent approximately ($500 million). In tiny Hungary, incidentally, American investments constitute over $2.5 billion. American companies explain their caution on the question of investments in our economy by the high degree of risk connected with the political instability in Russia. It is possible to view this problem from the other side also, however--the political instability is largely explained primarily by the economic instability. An acceleration of the process of stabilization of the Russian economy with the aid of investments of the United States and other Western countries could contribute to a considerable extent to political consolidation in our country. We are prepared to take the necessary steps to attract direct investments of the United States in Russia. Cooperation could encompass the leasing and concession of fuel and raw material deposits, land, and forest tracts and the organization of joint ventures for the in-depth processing of natural resources and agricultural raw material, which are generally accepted in world practice, between Western countries included. We could undertake the sale at auction or the leasing of real estate, including incomplete construction projects, and also the sale of securities and shares of stock of enterprises and organizations, the processing with the aid of foreign investments of numerous types of waste and secondary raw material, the investment of capital in the creation of a modern industry of tourism and infrastructural facilities for business, and so forth. The development of bilateral investment cooperation should be accompanied by a sound treaty and legal base. The first stones in this foundation have already been laid. Despite all this, the Russian side is endeavoring in every way to overcome the current, not entirely logical situation where the United States is prepared, seemingly, to cooperate with us on a large scale and even render assistance with its resources, but is at the same time in practice permitting actions preventing Russia earning these resources independently, on the American market included. [Rachkov] Generally, a turnabout in Russian-American business relations appropriate to the political changes has not yet occurred. More, the results of our December elections were reason for certain circles in the United States, and in Russia also, to recall the vocabulary of the times of the cold war. And some observers are inclined to belittle the visits to Moscow of Vice President A. Gore and President B. Clinton, which have just taken place, including their significance for economic relations. [Drozdov] Yes, the struggle of opposites continues, but under the conditions of a lower intensity, that is, under less hopeless conditions. While not a reckless optimist, I personally discern signs that there should no longer be an abrupt new rollback in our economic rapprochement. Why do I think this? Mainly because the democratic transformations in our country, the market reforms included, and Washington's healthy appreciation of them leave increasingly less room for an orgy of the totally uncontrolled, suspicious forces, I would say, on which we touched at the start of the discussion--be they chaos in the world economy or the nuclear genie in a missile package. There is today an opportunity to control them. Only democracy and common sense finally enabled the leaders of our superpowers to trust one another to the extent that they are switching from words and small deeds in the sphere of disarmament to actual steps. And the first truly promising prospects for the economic cooperation of our superpowers have been afforded simultaneously. The visits of the top two Americans to Moscow and their meetings with the leaders of Russia were not, truly, of direct significance for foreign trade in its traditional form. But together with the legal base, which was prepared not long prior to this at intergovernmental level, they laid the first tangible stone in the interaction of Russia and the United States in areas which pertain to the "holy of holies" of their military power and which had for this reason been so jealously guarded until most recent days. I refer to the long-term contract for the processing at plants of the United States of the nuclear filling from almost 180 Soviet missiles into peaceful fuel for the needs of America's nuclear power stations for a sum total of $12 billion. Particular compensation has been specified for Ukraine and Belarus. But the potential benefits to be derived from such a contract by the superpowers themselves and the world, particularly considering the fact that this has only just begun, are immeasurable. There is much that is symbolic here also, incidentally. I was present at the signing of the contract, which took place in the hall of the collegium of the former Ministry of Medium Machine Building--the very hall where all the serious decisions on the creation of Soviet nuclear weapons had been adopted. The first large-scale agreements on commercial cooperation in space, in which it was hard to believe just several years ago, have been reached. These include the joint flights of American astronauts and our cosmonauts and the creation of an international orbital station and scientific and technological cooperation in space. Science fiction is, you will agree, becoming reality. [Rachkov] So history has accorded Russia and the United States one more chance to become worthy business partners. This has coincided almost, Nikolay Ustinovich, with your appointment to the office of deputy minister of foreign economic relations of the Russian Federation in charge of business relations with North America. What can you say about this coincidence? [Drozdov] The said events are not to be compared, of course. But this invests my colleagues and myself with a special responsibility, nonetheless. Especially since I have been entrusted also with the position of executive secretary of the Russian-American Economic and Technological Cooperation Commission, of which V.S. Chernomyrdin and A. Gore are the cochairmen. The committees of the commission are led by ministers and other high-level persons of the governments of the two countries. This is a very serious instrument of intergovernmental interaction in the economic sphere and yet further evidence of the seriousness of the parties' intention not to let slip the present and, possibly, last historical opportunity in their economic relations. History might not forgive any force majeure now.
