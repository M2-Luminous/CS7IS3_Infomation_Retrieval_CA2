FBIS3-20779 "jpeer008__s94044" JPRS-EER-94-008-S Document Type:JPRS Document Title:East Europe SUPPLEMENT 10 March 1994 YUGOSLAVIA Federal Program for Secession of Montenegro Attacked 94P20461A 94P20461A Article Type:CSO [Editorial Report] The 20 February edition of the Belgrade daily POLITIKA, on page 9, attacks an article that appeared in the Podgorica, Montenegro, daily POBJEDA "the day before yesterday" calling for the secession of Montenegro from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. POLITIKA states that the POBJEDA article's author, Dragan Hajdukovic, a resident of Switzerland, is remembered for his pamphlets, published in Switzerland, calling for "the bombing of Belgrade" and requesting the "imposition of sanctions against his own country." Now he "makes an appearance in the domestic press," and, "at a time of paper shortages," publishes on "two entire pages" of POBJEDA a political program for the "renewal of the Montenegrin state," instructing the Montenegrin people "to secede from Yugoslavia." Hajdukovic disregards the fact that the large majority of the inhabitants of Montenegro declared themselves in favor of a joint state, POLITIKA remarks, adding that the editorial staff of POBJEDA has already disassociated itself from the article, calling it a "glaring error."
