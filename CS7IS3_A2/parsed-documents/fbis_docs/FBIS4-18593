This was reported yesterday by Interior Minister Frieder Birzele in Stuttgart. One of the three Kurds who were expelled from Bavaria has already appealed to the Administrative Court in Augsburg. Federal Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberg's (FDP) [Free Democratic Party] negative stance toward the expulsions from Bavaria has encountered criticism within the FDP. FDP acting chairman Wolfgang Gerhardt warned that the credibility of the rule of law might be cast into doubt if violent offenders cannot be deported. Detlef Kleinert, legal expert of the FDP faction in the Bundestag, told DIE WELT that the Federal Republic cannot permit foreigners to settle their differences in Germany. Kleinert expressed the need for an agreement with Turkey whereby Turkey would pledge not to subject Kurds to torture or impose the death penalty on them. The relevant talks between the Interior, Foreign, and Justice Ministries are being delayed because of the FDP dispute. The conclusion of the agreement can be expected in a few weeks at the very earliest. Lower Saxony deported 31 Kurds to Turkey in January and February.
