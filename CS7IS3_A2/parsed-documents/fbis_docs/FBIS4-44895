FBIS4-44895 "jpjst022__l94004" JPRS-JST-94-022-L JPRS Science & Technology Japan 27 June 1994 ADVANCED MATERIALS Tonen Transforms Liquid Polymer to Ceramics Through High Tonen Transforms Liquid Polymer to Ceramics Through High Temperature Sintering 94FE0363B Tokyo INFODIA in Japanese Dec 93 p 43--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94FE0363B Tokyo INFODIA Japanese CSO [Text] The material is a perhydro-polysilazane-based, inorganic polymer that, when sintered, becomes silicon nitride and silicon oxide ceramics. It is easy to mold and machine the ceramics, which can be made into fibers, composites, and coating materials. Properties The product is an inorganic material whose main component is perhydro-polysilazane, and it is made in microfine powder and liquid. Like organic polymers and resins, the product can be molded by itself, coated over, impregnated in and mixed with another material. When sintered in an inert atmosphere, the product becomes silicon nitride ceramics after pyrolysis at 200-600�C. When sintered in air, it is pyrolyzed at 400�C to form amorphous silicon oxide ceramics. The product also forms a transparent, high-quality ceramic thin-film when coated over glass or metal, dried and sintered. Also, strong, elastic, and heat- and acid-resistant silicon nitride fibers can be produced by sintering the product made into fibers. The product can be impregnated in carbon fibers, which are sintered to form fiber-reinforced ceramics with excellent composite effect. The ceramics can be used for heat-resistant structural, corrosion-resistant, and friction-resistant materials. By sintering a mixture of the product with another ceramic material, films 10-100 �m thick are produced, with drastically improved strength and corrosion, heat and heat-shock resistance.
