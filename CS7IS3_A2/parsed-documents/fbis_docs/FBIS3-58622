A "last and ironic example" of this is the appeal for help to President Clinton and the Americans by France, the European government most favorable to an active policy in the former Yugoslavia. This is a clever way to "pass the buck," Dupuy comments, since Paris is well aware that the Americans have no intention of picking it up, after their experience of "warring without making war" in Somalia quickly led them to "look for the exit." This is also why the only choice left for Europeans is to continue "the make-believe task of doing something" while letting their soldiers be ridiculed, perform "humanitarian" tasks that may well, in the end, turn against the civilian populations themselves, and wait for fires to die down while praying they do not start again in the neighbor's apartment," Dupuy concludes.
