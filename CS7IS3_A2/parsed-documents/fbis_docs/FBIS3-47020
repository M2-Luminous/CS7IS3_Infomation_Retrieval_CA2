An official at the ministry's budget bureau said the ministry "has no such plans whatsoever." The government is expected to come up with a fresh package of pump-priming steps later this month. The NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN, a major economic daily, reported in its Friday evening edition that the ruling coalition parties will consider removing the securities transaction tax. The newspaper's report pushed Tokyo stock prices sharply higher, with the Nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues ending 242.02 points higher at 18,124.01. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Finance Ministry will "act in line with recommendations made by the government's tax commission last November." The advisory body suggested that the government should maintain the securities transaction tax "at least for the time being." There is no change in the ministry's policy of reviewing the tax and the capital gains tax "in the future" as suggested by the commission, said the official.
