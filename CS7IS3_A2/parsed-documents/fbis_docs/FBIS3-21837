Theoretically, in their capacity as objects, they lack intentions; and, by the same token, they are not blameworthy for being used. [passage omitted] In stock market institutions, cash funds never appear, and there is always a correlation between those participating in the supply and demand. Moreover, it should be recalled that all the commodity firms operating on the Mexican Stock Exchange make their living (who would believe it?) from the trading of a mere 25 stock shares. The market is so slim that it is virtually impossible not to know who has carried out transactions. If there is any doubt of my claim, it would be worthwhile reading the statements that I quote here: "Money laundering is an illegal activity that cannot be achieved through the stock market system, because the transactions carried out in it are documented with certified checks, and not through the handling of cash." This was the assertion made by Rodolfo Leon Leon, ex-president and founder of the Mexican Academy of Stock Exchange and Financial Markets Law (on 28 January of this year). The same thing does not hold true in the banking establishments. One of the reasons for the occurrence of this illicit activity is that there are not sufficient numbers of trained personnel to maintain permanent contact with the clientele. Banking services will (or should) always be personal but, as a result of computerization, clients have been reduced to a numerical symbol with which the banks, in many cases, never even deal. Rather, they are served, though not known, by those assigned to conduct account opening procedures. This task, on behalf of the actual money launderers, can be performed by anyone who allows himself to be used as a tool of the drug traffickers. [passage omitted] Added to the lack of personal acquaintance is the high degree of rotation among executives in bank branches. No one lasts long in one location now, because the bank owners or directors move the employees like chess pieces; something which, furthermore, confirms that the absence of individual attention occurs first within the banks themselves. Apart from the fact that many bank workers never become acquainted with the general director, they do not even know the regional director. Those officials are gods whose presence is reserved for ostentatious functions. Branch managers are shifted with unusual speed, bringing negative consequences for the banks' clients. As if that were not enough, many bank branches have been eliminated, because they were located too close to one another. In some instances this was due to lack of planning and, in others, it resulted from mergers (or strategic alliances, as they are now called), also made in a disorderly fashion. Unfortunately, this is not all. The meager, inadequate salaries, almost token in some cases, earned by bank personnel, previously considered a privileged sector in labor circles, are another negative factor leading to the possibility of the banking system's being used extensively to launder money. These are some of the reasons that the attorney general of the republic, Diego Valades, informed EXCELSIOR (Friday, 18 February, page 5, first section) that, through a mutual agreement with the Finance and Public Credit Secretariat, and respecting bank secrecy, an effort is being made to uncover money laundering transactions. In this endeavor the authorities have the strong cooperation of the bank employees affiliated with the National Federation of Bank Workers Unions (Fenasib). Its secretary general, Enrique Aguilar Borrego, reiterated to a capital newspaper, on 10 January, that "it is fitting to make a careful revision of bank workers' pay, because it is possible that they may succumb to temptation that would eventually foster criminal activities." Two comments regarding this position on the part of the attorney general: One of them pertains to the Mexican Association of Banks because, despite the public expression of the government's concern, the bankers have said nothing, whereas the bank workers certainly have done so. The other is related to the fact that Oscar Gonzalez, director of legal affairs for the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic, declared on 26 January: "A study is being made on devising a new law that would prevent money laundering in Mexico, and the termination of bank secrecy has not been precluded as one of the measures for eliminating this phenomenon." That public servant claimed: "The Finance and Public Credit Secretariat, the Foreign Relations Secretariat, and the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic are already working on the plan for regulations containing fiscal revisions to cope with this problem." He added to this comment the fact that there is insufficient surveillance in Mexico on the part of the National Banking Commission, remarking that the complete situation would be ascertained. In other words: there is a real possibility, and it is a reality, that the banking system may prove to be an immense money launderer.
