[Siemiatkowski] Good morning to you, too. [Bninska] Yesterday's talks ended quite late at night -- in any event, we, journalists, did not leave the hotel at Parkowa Street until after 2300. Did you, the participants of the talks, have any further talks after that? [Siemiatkowski] Yes, we did, but it was a purely social kind of meeting. [Bninska] But was anything more decided during that social meeting than what we managed to find out? [Siemiatkowski] No, especially given that the meeting practically included only members of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. It was a meeting whose practical purpose was to recap what happened in recent days and also to think what the next moves should be, but this time they will be made by SLD. [Bninska] Today's newspapers report that the conflict between SLD and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] has been overcome. Has it really been overcome, or is it just a temporary calm and another story will break soon? [Siemiatkowski] I mean, I would like to make a subtle protest here against using the term conflict between SLD and PSL. We do not hide the fact that it was indeed a case of a crisis in mutual relations between the coalition partners, but this crisis was not caused by [word indistinct] issues, I mean by personal issues -- that is the way it looked in the beginning. It was in essence a grievance of the SLD part of the coalition against the part represented by the prime minister, over some irregularities in the functioning of the Council of Ministers. Everything that was caused by Mr. Kawalec's dismissal was a catalyst for some negative phenomena which took place in the functioning of the Council of Ministers. [Bninska] Aleksander Kwasniewski used stronger terms when talking about that -- he said Prime Minister Pawlak fails to observe the coalition agreement. [Siemiatkowski] In this particular case -- and also in some others which we also made public -- it was a case of nonobservance of some binding provisions on the part of Mr. Waldemar Pawlak -- these provisions boiled down to the need to consult the deputy prime ministers concerned and in the presence of the chairmen of the fractions, over the most important strategic and political decisions, including personnel decisions. In the case of Mr. Kawalec -- and also in other cases, for instance appointing local governors [wojewodowie] -- this particular provision of the coalition agreement was not observed and that is why it was necessary to have another discussion. [Bninska] Yesterday's communique -- which is quite laconic -- says that the coalition agreement continues to be binding and that both sides will observe it. What kinds of guarantees did you [SLD activists] receive that Prime Minister Pawlak will observe particularly that provision, when you look ahead a month, two, or three months down the road? [Siemiatkowski] The communique is not so laconic at all. It contains two very important issues -- it first of all confirms that there is a will on both sides to keep the PSL-SLD coalition in existence .... [Bninska, interrupting] And what is more, it is to continue for as long as four years. [Siemiatkowski] Yes, for four years, so practically speaking all the speculations have been cut off at this point -- I mean the speculations which emerged in the meantime, concerning a possible reversal of alliances. Some have even expressed their willingness to participate in such alliances -- let me remind you of the funny case of Mr. Krol or Mr. Moczulski [of the Confederation for an Independent Poland] among others, who have even called a news conference, and felt they were almost inside the coalition, but then it turned out nobody invited them there in the first place. That is the first issue, and the other issue which SLD felt very strongly about, is that PSL -- through those who signed the communique, including the prime minister himself -- accepts the principle of a unanimous support of the budget draft which had been presented by the government. That is because we felt at one point -- this was our feeling at the time -- that there is a government of Mr. Waldemar Pawlak and a budget by Minister Borowski. We took the position from the very beginning that it is a budget of Waldemar Pawlak's government. The budget was designed according to some criteria which allow for a chance for economic growth and for maintaining positive economic trends. [Bninska] So my understanding is that there will be no more cases such as what happened during a session by a Sejm commission where a minister for this government -- I mean the foreign economic cooperation minister, Mr. Leslaw Podkanski who is at the same time a Sejm deputy -- demanded another trillion zlotys for something, and when asked by Mr. Marek Borowski whether he made the demand as a minister or as a Sejm deputy, he said: This time, I am doing this as a Sejm deputy. [Siemiatkowski] There will be no cases like this. We should not have events like the prime minister's speech at the Zeran automobile factory where he distanced himself from some price rises -- this made it look as if the rises were just Minister Borowski's responsibility and as if they had not been agreed upon by the entire Council of Ministers -- I mean the price rises with regard to energy carriers. We should not have very many other examples of such incidents which basically undermined the coherency of the cabinet's economic policies. [Bninska] All right, the communique also states that the posts of both deputy prime minister and the finance minister, will remain within SLD's range of powers. There are rumors that perhaps it will not be just one person occupying the two posts, like it was in the case of Minister Borowski. The first question is: Who will be the finance minister? The second question is: Who will be the deputy prime minister? [Siemiatkowski] Of course, I have not been authorized to give names at this stage. There are many candidates. The issue requires very deep deliberation on SLD's part. The person to occupy the post of deputy prime minister and finance minister -- I think this is what you mean .... [Bninska, interrupting] So this will be just one person who will be in charge of both posts? [Siemiatkowski] Of course, because only the kind of positioning of the finance minister which also places him as the chairman of the Council of Ministers' Economic Committee, creates an opportunity for him to conduct a coherent economic policy and to influence measures taken by the individual ministers responsible for the economy. I am returning here to the conditions set by Minister Borowski before the prime minister at one point -- where there was a statement [word indistinct] that if the deputy prime minister for economic affairs is to be efficient, then his powers should be clearly defined and he also must enjoy autonomy in what he does. We will return to that condition in our talks with PSL. [Bninska] These conditions were not approved. What will happen to them next? [Siemiatkowski] These were not conditions, these were postulates for improving the activity of the Council of Ministers .... [Bninska, interrupting] But the prime minister refused to agree to them. [Siemiatkowski] I think that yesterday's talks -- and also subsequent talks ahead of us, this time we will discuss a specific person who will take up the post of deputy prime minister and finance minister -- will force both us and PSL to initiate talks again on the topic of improving the Council of Ministers' functioning, on defining the finance minister's powers in a clear manner, and also on increasing discipline in the course of statements and activities undertaken by the individual ministers who on many occasions -- you [addressing Bninska] cited an example yourself -- kind of torpedoed the finance minister's measures. [Bninska] Will the person who will take up both posts be very closely associated with SLD? Or will he be just a well-wisher? [Siemiatkowski] Ladies and Gentlemen, Minister Borowski established such high standards through his skills and competence, that it will be very hard for us to find a person who would meet the criteria which are also required for someone to fulfill the post of finance minister [word indistinct] [Bninska, interrupting] So there is just one Borowski within SLD? [Siemiatkowski] Ladies and Gentlemen, for a few years now we have gotten used to Mr. Marek Borowski being the person responsible for economic policies within SLD -- and before that, in the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic, when we were still in the opposition when he was charged with the concept of opposition economic policies -- we associated our plans and ideas with him, and in a word -- most of us were attached to him but as we all know, life does not tolerate a vacuum and there are no irreplaceable people. In this situation, we must find someone who will be able to continue in a competent manner with the policies initiated by Mr. Marek Borowski. That person also has to be able to implement the policy in close contact with Mr. Marek Borowski, especially since he will also be co-responsible as a Sejm deputy and he will have an impact on the government's economic policies since he is coming back to the [Sejm] Budget Commission where he will work. [Bninska] You came to a compromise with PSL yesterday. If my understanding is correct, a compromise is based on giving something up in return for gaining something else. What did SLD have to give up? [Siemiatkowski] I think we achieved a great deal by forcing the prime minister and also our coalition partners from PSL to think through the situation that emerged, we forced them to discuss again the terms of the coalition agreement, and we also forced them to publicly confirm that there is no alternative to the PSL-SLD coalition. [Bninska] But you must have given up something. [Siemiatkowski] We gave up Marek Borowski. That is a high price to pay. [Bninska] Did you also give up demands for a resignation by the chief of the Office of the Council of Ministers [URM] Michal Strak? [Siemiatkowski] We have never made this kind of postulate. The only postulate we did make was to have a reorganization of work done by URM, and we also expressed criticism with regard to URM's personnel policies, in particular with regard to the government's territorial administration [words indistinct] [Bninska] And what did the prime minister give up during yesterday's talks? After all, he also must have given up something. [Siemiatkowski] I think he gave up the kinds of statements which were made even during the television newscast the day before yesterday -- I mean the kinds of statements were he distanced himself from Minister Borowski's economic policies which were also supported by SLD -- that was an economic policy based on the concept of development, but one which also took the economic realities into account and which does not create a danger of Poland slipping into economic rowdiness, a return of inflation, or announcing slogans which are very nice to hear but which are economically meaningless. [Bninska] And what did SLD gain? [Siemiatkowski, hesitating] What we gained was a confirmation of the will for the SLD-PSL coalition to exist. It seems that is .... [Bninska, interrupting] And what did PSL gain? [Siemiatkowski, hesitating] Nobody needed the conflict, and we made that clear to our PSL colleagues and partners. It was a game with a negative balance -- nobody gained and everybody lost. We all lost in the eyes of part of the public opinion which at one point had a right to ask the question of whether the coalition agreement and the election promises are really being implemented in a responsible manner, and also whether the significant portion of our society did the right thing by voting PSL and SLD on 19 September. We wanted to make that clear to our partners, as well -- namely that the real stakes in the game are much higher: Public trust, the country's fate, and the fact that somebody had put faith in us and we must act accordingly. In that context, individual ambitions by parties or people are a secondary issue. I think we were probably successful in conveying that to our PSL colleagues and to the prime minister during yesterday's talks. [Bninska] Has President Lech Walesa finally signed Deputy Prime Minister Borowski's resignation? [Siemiatkowski] He affirmed during yesterday's newscast that he had signed it. [Bninska] During the same newscast, the president also said that the time has come for the parliament to deal with enacting legislation and that the time has come for presidential rules. What does SLD say to that? [Siemiatkowski] The president's involvement in the last stage of the coalition crisis only proves that nobody gained anything from the crisis, and if there was anybody who could gain, it was the president who immediately used the opportunity to have his contribution and to point to the crisis in the mutual relations within the coalition and also to imperfect constitutional provisions, and in that regard he discussed again his concept of a strong presidency. That is just proof that our crisis was being watched very closely. We also made it clear to our coalition partners that among our mutual obligations toward the voters, there is an obligation to speak in favor of a constitutional authority based on a cabinet-parliamentary system. It would be hard for anyone of us to explain that we are in favor of presidential rules. I think the president unnecessarily made a hurried gesture in the sense of making statements that could in a way strengthen his position. [Bninska] But the president has disliked this government from the beginning, and he did not even try to hide it. Most of all, he has disliked SLD. Is SLD afraid that the president could vigorously try to create presidential rules even before his term is over? [Siemiatkowski] The president is a very skillful politician, and so he is applying the very old principle of: Divide and rule. He points to some parts of the coalition as better than others. The most important thing is that we do not let him divide us, I mean PSL and SLD. I can see no possibility of any special increase in presidential powers before his term is over. He is in power based on the Small Constitution and until the constitution proper is enacted, all in all his powers are limited since he has to share his powers with the executive branch -- that is with the government -- and also with the legislative branch, that is the parliament. There is a system of different forces in effect which mutually control one another, and I think the system proves its validity during crisis situations which erupt now and then. The president has always won when he was an umpire, but in this case he wanted to go beyond the role and be a party, in a way. Becoming a party to conflicts has always been bad for the presidential post. [Bninska] You said PSL and SLD cannot allow having anyone create divisions between them. What about divisions within both of them? As recently as the day before yesterday, the prime minister quote, played, unquote, this whole conflict, with the aim -- among others -- of creating a split within SLD and having the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ] sever its connections with SLD. [Siemiatkowski] An attempt like this was indeed undertaken. We also mentioned that issue to the prime minister during yesterday's talks and I think .... [Bninska, interrupting] And what did he say? [Siemiatkowski] An official statement signed by OPZZ Deputy Chairman Martyniuk was a lot of food for thought for the prime minister -- Martyniuk in a way distanced himself from assessments which were contained in the prime minister's television appearance. Martyniuk informed that OPZZ is not a group which would be interested in creating political destabilization in the country and that the trade union -- while understanding the supreme interests -- is willing to support the budget, and that is also a very important statement which means that you just cannot make irresponsible statements like this [by Pawlak] and play games with social moods and with moods of various interest groups. [Bninska] What are the guarantees of yesterday's agreement's observance in practice? Apart from the joint communique, SLD continues to be practically deprived of an impact on what happens in URM, which means no impact on the day-to-day decisionmaking by the government. There are no SLD men in URM so you have no guarantees that the prime minister will observe the agreement. What did he tell SLD? [Siemiatkowski] Ladies and Gentlemen, we are in favor of a thesis which says that politics conducted without the right principles, must backfire sooner or later. One of the principles in politics is keeping promises and obligations. Our view is that the signatures themselves which were placed under the communique must be proof enough of the goodwill by those who signed the communique. Those who placed these signatures must also be aware that the signature means something more than just the ink. [Bninska] But at the very beginning of the conflict SLD expressed very harsh views on the prime minister and on the whole case. Day by day, the tone of the statements became less radical, until yesterday's shake-hands by Aleksander Kwasniewski and Waldemar Pawlak. How did you calculate this? Why was decreasing the tensions worth it for you? [Siemiatkowski] It was not a calculation. All we did was to come to a conclusion at some point that we will no longer make the conflict more radical. [Bninska] Why is that? [Siemiatkowski] Because of the supreme interest in leading to a stabilization of Poland's political situation -- we were successful in achieving that, thanks to the establishment of the majority coalition which has such a huge support in the Sejm. The coalition has very important tasks before it, namely to solve problems resulting from the necessity of continuing with the reforms of our economy and of making permanent the democratic processes which are occurring in Poland, or which have been occurring for four years now. That is the supreme issue, and all the other issues are secondary. That is why we were even willing to give up our own ambitions, if we could only gain [words indistinct] [Bninska, interrupting] If you could only remain in the governing coalition? [Siemiatkowski] No, remaining in the governing coalition at any cost was not the issue. The issue was about being in a coalition which has the chances to implement a policy which is in accordance with the interests of those people who voted for SLD. I can assure you that if there comes a time when we reach the calculated conclusion that SLD's continued presence in any kind of association with the authorities, or in a coalition, is not in accordance with the interests of those who had voted for us and with the interests of the entire society -- in that case we will not insist on keeping the posts which our colleagues currently occupy. And if we come to the conclusion that we can do more for our voters while being in the opposition, then we will switch to the opposition. But as of today, our view is that there is both a chance and a real possibility of implementing our election program while being in a governing coalition. Only when you are in power, do you have implementation instruments necessary for implementing an election program. [Bninska] Thank you very much for the conversation. [Siemiatkowski] Thank you.
