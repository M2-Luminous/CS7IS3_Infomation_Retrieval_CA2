The United States and the South Korean puppet clique are openly saying that they will resume the provocative Team Spirit joint military exercise. They have decided to deploy Patriot missiles to South Korea and are finally planning to send additional U.S. troops to South Korea. In addition, U.S. Navy aircraft carriers are now moving toward waters near our country. Amid these circumstances, the South Korean puppet Armed Forces have been put on a state of alert at traitor Kim Yong-sam's order, and the puppet Joint Chiefs of Staff ordered the entire puppet military forces to be put on special alert. Seoul is scheming war plots [chonjaeng mouidul] every day. These very unusual, provocative moves that can be seen only just prior to an adventurous [mohomjogin] war are an extremely dangerous development that may cause a catastrophic crisis [pagukchok wigirul choraehalsu innun kukhi wihomchonmanhan satae palchon] on the Korean peninsula. The insidious forces [pulsun seryoktul] of the United States are making extremely provocative warmaniac outbursts [kukhi tobalchogin chonjaeng pogondul], such as remarks that the international community must take strong measures, that pressure on North Korea must be strengthened by actual steps, that North Korea must not misunderstand the U.S. intent, and the like, posing military threats against us. All these facts plainly show that the United States is not interested in resolving the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula and is only trying frantically to isolate and stifle [apsal] our republic.
