Saunders and D. Issacson] [Text] Port Elizabeth March 22 SAPA -- The point of no return had been reached and the election must now take place without the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP], State President F W de Klerk said on Tuesday [22 March]. Outlining his most recent approach to IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi, he told a press conference in Port Elizabeth he had mooted the possibility of the IFP contesting the election in the kwaZulu/Natal region. By not fighting the national election, the IFP could still register its opposition to the interim constitution. The IFP had rejected his suggestion, Mr de Klerk said. "The point of no return has been reached. The matter must be settled democratically in the election." Contingency arrangements were in place if violence erupted in kwaZulu, but he said there was no plan to destabilise the territory. Asked if the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] might take over the kwaZulu administration, Mr de Klerk replied: "The TEC as such is having trouble administering itself." He added: "The government retains the duty to see that there will be good governance throughout the republic."
