Politicians must restore public trust by conducting "moral and salutary politics and productive, efficient and high value-added politics," he said in a policy speech at the National Assembly plenary meeting. Kim stressed the need for both the ruling and opposition parties to produce "a mature image of parliament" through policy confrontation at all of their meetings. For reform of the electoral system, the election law amendments which are being reviewed by the two parties must be passed by parliament during its current session, he said. This year, the ruling party will pursue a plan to revise administrative districts for improved administrative services to the people and successful local autonomy. He said the ruling party would develop a new social welfare model suitable to the realities of the country and work to prepare a basic social security law based on this model.
