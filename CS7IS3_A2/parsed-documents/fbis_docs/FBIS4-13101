The eastern hills of Kafr Rumman were shelled from the position of the occupation forces in al-Dabshah at 1500 today. Majdal Silm and Wadi al-Saluqi came under shell fire at noon today. Israeli planes overflew the central sector, al-Nabatiyah, and Iqlim al-Tuffah. Security reports tell about a massacre in 'Aramta last night. The details are as follows: About 20 Lahd [South Lebanese Army] militiamen entered 'Aramta, firing wildly in all directions. The militiamen then broke into houses and wantonly shot several citizens, killing four and wounding several others, including Jihad Hikmat Jarjah and Fu'ad Jandal Yunus. Two bodies are yet to be identified. The Lahd militia then took the town's entire population of 70--many had already deserted the town--to Jazzin, where they were made to sleep outdoors. Today, the occupation forces and their agents took the 'Aramta inhabitants from Jazzin to Marj 'Uyun to question them about resistance fighters. The women were then released, but the men are still in custody. [passage omitted]
