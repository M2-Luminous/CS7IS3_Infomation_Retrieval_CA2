It also stressed it will entrench all forms of struggle against the Zionist machine of suppression and the Zionist settlers and emphasized need for withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories. In a statement entitled "The Vengeance Call" distributed here today, UNLI said the Holy Ibrahimi Mosque crime, which was committed by the Israeli occupation authorities, reveal the ugly criminal face of these authorities and the true Israeli objectives; namely to murder our people, to empty our land of its inhabitants, and to settle the Zionist settlers in their place. The crime also reveals the falsity of the Zionist allegations, which keep talking about peace. In its call, UNLI demands the United Nations, particularly the UN Security Council, to shoulder its responsibility to protect our unarmed people and provide real protection for them so the world organization can prove its credibility. UNLI urges the international and regional organizations and the European peoples who support human rights to work on fulfilling their role toward our unarmed people and their right to live in freedom, dignity, and security on their land. It also urges our people in the diaspora camps to continue the solidarity activities in the face of the Zionist killers. It also hails the decision made by Fatah Hawks [group in the occupied territories] and Fatah militants to resume armed action and struggle against the occupation troops and end the so-called truce. UNLI also calls for a plan to activate the work of the militant coordination committees in the field, which should group all militant forces and figures in the homeland, and to continue and escalate all forms of struggle throughout the entire homeland.
