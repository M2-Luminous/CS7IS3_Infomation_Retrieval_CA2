In this connection, various points of view have appeared. Incidentally, Latvian Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs stated that an armed conflict was a possibility. How is this assessed by the Russian Defense Ministry? We have contacted Yelena Agapova, the press secretary of the head of the Russian military department, over the phone. [Begin Agapova recording] First of all, I would like to recall how these unprecedented events developed. In the morning on 10 January in a suburb of Riga, armed groups of the Latvian home guard seized the House of Officers, the billeting and operating unit, a hotel, and a number of other installations that belong to the Northwestern Group of Forces. Major General Nikolay Taylakov, the deputy commander of the Northwestern Group of Forces, and Major General Aleksandr Vodopyanov, the commander's aide for work with personnel, immediately arrived at the scene of the incident. When they demanded that the facilities seized be surrended, the chairman of the Vidzeme district commanded that the generals should be arrested. Highly unprecedented and most unceremonious actions were used against them. I would call them humiliating actions. They were handcuffed and put in a car, which was driven toward the Russian border. Naturally, Colonel General Mayorov, the commander of the Northwestern Group of Forces, informed Russian Defense Minister Pavel Sergeyevich Grachev. The minister ordered that all Russian troops stationed in Latvia should be put on a state of operational readiness and that the protection of installations and buildings belonging to the Northwestern Group of Forces should be stepped up. The forces and equipment of the airborne troops were also put on combat readiness. These include the famous Pskov division and also units of the military transport aviation. The commander of the Northwesten Group of Forces also informed Latvian President Ulmanis about what had happened. During a meeting with the commander, Ulmanis expressed bewilderment as to what had happened, gave instructions that those arrested should be released, and conveyed his apologies. Yesterday by 1700 hours the Russian generals and all the occupied facilities had been surrended. In connection with this, the Russian Defense Ministry is demanding that an immediate investigation should be carried out and those responsible for what happened punished. The Russian Defense Ministry believes any violent and illegal acts, like those we are now speaking about, against Russian servicemen, military units, or installations of Russian troops will be halted in a most decisive manner. [end recording] We also asked Yelena Agapova how the Defense Ministry sees the reasons for this most blatant provocation against Russian servicemen. As far as we remember, things like this have happened more than once. [Begin Agapova recording] To our great misfortune, this is not the first instance. On 27 November the Latvian home guard stopped an UAZ vehicle. Threatening with weapons, they brought the vehicle and a driver to the headquarters of the Latvian home guard battalion, where a radio station from the vehicle was dismantled. On 14 December in the region of Plavinas, unknown persons in a car fired from small-caliber weapons on a courier and postal communications vehicle. The latter was carrying correspondence from Riga. All this simply indicates that certain political forces are constantly trying to create a tense and nervous atmosphere around Russian troops and thus, have an effect on both the deadlines for the withdrawal and on the progress of the talks, and, in so doing, to acquire certain political capital. Unfortunately, all such attempts cast a cloud over the relations between the two states and do not help the establishing of good-neighborly relations. [end recording] It is understandable that the Defense Ministry is attentively observing the state of troops stationed in the Baltics. What is the morale of these troops like? What are they ready for? [Begin Agapova recording] The Russian troops stationed on the territory of Latvia maintain calmness and restraint and, in the event of a situation like this recurring, they are ready to take adequate measures.
