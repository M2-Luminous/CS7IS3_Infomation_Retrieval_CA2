FR940825-2-00033 FR940825-2-00015 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Department of the Air Force Notice of Availability of a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) for the Transfer of Wake to Other Federal Agencies The U.S. Air Force is proposing the transfer of Wake Island Airfield (WIA) to other federal agencies in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Council on Environmental Quality regulations implementing NEPA, the Department of Defense Directive (DOD) 6050.1 and Air Force Regulation (AFR) 19&hyph;2. These directives require the U.S. Air Force (USAF) to consider environmental consequences when authorizing or approving federal actions. The USAF has prepared an Environmental Assessment (EA) analyzing the potential environmental consequences of the proposed transfer of civil administration authority for WIA from the USAF to other federal agencies, and the planned future uses of WIA by the recipient agencies. On the basis of the EA, we conclude the implementation of the proposed action or any of the alternatives will not have a significant effect on the quality of the environment at WIA and, as a result, an Environmental Impact Statement is not warranted. Comments on this FONSI must be received on or before September 15, 1994 and may be addressed to Capt William Cronin, 15 CES/CEVP, 75 H Street, Hickam AFB HI 96853&hyph;5328, Telephone (808) 449&hyph;7514. Documents are available for public review at Hawaii State University, 478 South King, Honolulu, HI, 96813, Telephone (808) 586&hyph;3500.
