Fadlala attended the most recent Mercosur meeting--held in Buenos Aires, Argentina--with his colleagues of the other signatory countries. Fadlala said this was a very difficult meeting because of the various aspects, the short time available, and the deadlines that are about to expire. He said: "We have outlined our position and want it considered in order to achieve what we are looking for, that is, an expanded market with coordination and harmony in various subjects." He added that this will turn Mercosur into an expanded market--rather than a free-trade zone--in which we can implement at least an initial common market. As for the products over which there are tariff disagreements, Fadlala said not all points have been raised in connection with the products on which it is not possible to adopt a single tariff. "This will be done at the last technical meeting of subgroup 10, scheduled for the end of the month. The matter will be later addressed at the political level, when deputy ministers will choose the exceptions," he said. The deputy ministers' meeting might be held early in July.
