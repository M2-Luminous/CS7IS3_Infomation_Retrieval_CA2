Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability Under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the NRC regulations in Subpart A of 10 CFR Part 51, the NRC has determined that this rule, if adopted, would not be a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, and therefore, an environmental impact statement is not required. The rule is mainly administrative in nature. It would not change safety requirements and would not have significant environmental impacts. The proposed rule would add one cask known as the Standardized NUHOMS Modular Storage System to the list of approved spent fuel storage casks that power reactor licensees can use to store spent fuel at reactor sites without additional site-specific approvals by the NRC. The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact on which this determination is based are available for inspection at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact are available from Mr. G. Gundersen, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Telephone (301) 492&hyph;3803. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement This proposed rule does not contain a new or amended information collection requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). Existing requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget, Approval Number 3150&hyph;0132. Regulatory Analysis On July 18, 1990 (55 FR 29181), the Commission issued an amendment to 10 CFR Part 72. The amendment provided for the storage of spent nuclear fuel under a general license. Any nuclear power reactor licensee can use these casks if (1) they notify the NRC in advance, (2) the spent fuel is stored under the conditions specified in the cask's certificate of compliance, and (3) the conditions of the general license are met. In that rulemaking, four spent fuel storage casks were approved for use at reactor sites, and were listed in 10 CFR 72.214. That rulemaking envisioned that storage casks certified in the future could be routinely added to the listing in ยง72.214 through rulemaking procedures. Procedures and criteria for obtaining NRC approval of new spent fuel storage cask designs were provided in 10 CFR 72.230. Subsequently, two additional casks were added to the listing in ยง72.214 in 1993.
