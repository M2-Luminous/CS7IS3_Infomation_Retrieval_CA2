Since last year, the foreign trade departments of Xinjiang have actively promoted reform and broadened the scope of opening up, achieving noticeable results in foreign economic relations and trade and enabling the region to sharply increase its imports and exports--its import-export volume totaled $911.545 million last year, an increase of 30.3 percent over the previous year. However, due to the slow transformation of the operating mechanisms of state- owned foreign trade enterprises, and due to their poor ability to cope with the changing situations, their exporting capacities have been seriously affected. This year the region will adopt six reform measures to encourage and guide foreign trade enterprises to earn more foreign exchange and profits. -- All state-owned foreign trade enterprises will be required to link their economic results to the total amount of their wages, and make workers' wages and bonuses directly dependent on enterprises' foreign exchange earnings and economic results--there will be no upper or lower limits for workers' wages and bonuses. In addition, a distribution incentive mechanism becoming to foreign trade enterprises will be established, and foreign trade enterprises will be encouraged to boldly experiment with instituting the system of "deciding one's wage according to the amount of their finished work computed in U.S. dollars" [mei yuan gong zi han liang, 5019 0337 1562 6327 0698 6852]. -- State-owned foreign trade enterprises will institute the all-personnel labor contract system and the system of promoting people based on competition and on their work performances--people with ability will be promoted and incompetent people will be demoted. The "iron armchair [guaranteed rank]" and "life-long tenure" systems will be abolished. -- Accounting units of foreign trade enterprises will be subdivided to eliminate enterprises' equalitarianism and to break their "large rice bowls." Enterprises with required conditions may establish branches, and under the macroeconomic regulation and control of their head companies should work to consolidate their branches' functions, responsibilities, and powers. -- In allotting quota permits to foreign trade enterprises, we should consider the enterprise's efficiency, adhere to the principle of being fair, and do things openly. At the same time, we should encourage competition among enterprises and allot quota permits to winners. -- We will encourage joint operations by enterprises. This kind of joint operation is to be based on trade and is aimed at improving enterprises' economic results. Enterprises may enter in joint operation by buying shares of other companies, by joining their business activities, by pooling funds, or by cooperating with each other. They also may establish foreign trade enterprise groups. -- We will systematically carry out enterprise reform. At first on a trial basis, we will create necessary conditions to gradually reorganize foreign trade enterprises with required conditions into regular limited liability companies or joint-stock companies.
