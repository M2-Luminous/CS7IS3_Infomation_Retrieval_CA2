In statements before Yemeni military units broadcast today, al-Zindani stressed that the scheme to divide Yemen aims at establishing several statelets by inciting tribal and sectarian dissension and paralyzing the state's official institutions in order to drag the Yemeni people into infighting. He said this scheme is part of a colonialist course that targets not just Yemen, but every Arab attempt to forge a better future in the region. He indicated that anti-Arab foreign forces do not want to see Arabs and Muslims become capable of making any advancement and seek to render them desperate about any chances of progress. He recalled that the West wagered on fighting among the parties to the Yemeni coalition immediately after the elections, especially between the Islamists -- the Yemeni Reform Grouping -- and the Yemeni Socialist Party. Al-Zindani revealed that one of the objectives of the foreign scheme against Yemen is to control or lease the strait of Bab el Mandeb and to establish weak statelets. He indicated that when the Yemenis are unified and strong, foreign powers find it extremely difficult to impose their humiliating conditions. The statements by al-Zindani, who is a prominent member of the Yemeni Reform Grouping under Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, are part of the warnings that the grouping issued to the General People's Congress and the Yemeni Socialist Party on the gravity of the continued crisis and its effects on the future of Yemen's unity.
