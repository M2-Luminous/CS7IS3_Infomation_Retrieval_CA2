As a result of generally analyzing the remarks of evangelist Billy Graham, who visited Pyongyang on 31 January; UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali; and Gary Ackerman, chairman of the Asia-Pacific Affairs Subcommittee of the House Foreign Relations Committee, who personally met with President Kim Il-song recently; the ROK and the United States can see that such an analysis is very likely to be true. According to authorities concerned on 6 February, President Kim Il-song has an optimistic view that the nuclear issue will be properly resolved through dialogue with the United States but he is not aware that North Korea should accept full-scope inspections by the IAEA in a bid to hold dialogue with the United States. On the same day, a government official said that "It was highly likely that North Korean officials in charge of nuclear issues reported to President Kim that accepting only limited inspections [chehan sachal] by the IAEA is necessary to resolve the nuclear issue." He added that "They, however, have not reported again to President Kim Il-song that North Korea should accept full-scope inspections to meet the IAEA's demand." Considering the closed North Korean system, the ROK and the United States are concerned about the fact that because North Korean officials in charge of nuclear negotiations worry about their reshuffle, they will adhere to the limited inspections without using a "negotiation card" in negotiations on inspections and, thus, they may lead the situation to an unexpected catastrophe, including the nuclear issue which may be referred to the UN Security Council.
