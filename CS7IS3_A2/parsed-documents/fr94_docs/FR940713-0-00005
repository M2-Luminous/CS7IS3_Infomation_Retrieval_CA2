FR940713-0-00005 FR940713-0-00003 Federal Crop Insurance Corporation 7 CFR Part 406 Nursery Crop Regulations AGENCY: Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) hereby amends the Nursery Crop Insurance regulations, effective for the 1995 and succeeding crop years, by making a change in the policy to clarify the method of determining loss. The Nursery policy contains the term ``said damaged crop'' which has been interpreted, in some forums, to refer to specific damaged portion of the crop instead of the unit as was the intent. EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation is effective on June 30, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mari L. Dunleavy, Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20250, telephone (202) 254&hyph;8314. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This action has been reviewed under USDA procedures established by Executive Order 12866 and Department Regulation 1512&hyph;1. This action does not constitute a review as to the need, currency, clarity, and effectiveness of this regulation under those procedures. The sunset review date established for these regulations is March 31, 1999. This rule has been determined to be ``not significant'' for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). This action will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities. This action does not increase the paperwork burden on the reinsured company because the reinsured company must already provide the additional information required by this regulation to the state in which it is licensed. Therefore, this action is determined to be exempt from the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act and no Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was prepared. This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.450. This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with state and local officials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115, June 24, 1983. This action is not expected to have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment, health, and safety, Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed. The Office of the General Counsel has determined that these regulations meet the applicable standards provided in subsections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. The provisions of this rule are not retroactive and will preempt state and local laws to the extent such state and local laws are inconsistent herewith. The administrative appeal provisions located at 7 CFR 400.169 must be exhausted before judicial action may be brought. It has been determined under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federal Assessment. The policies and procedures contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political subdivisions, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. On April 25, 1994, the FCIC published a proposed rule at 59 FR 19661 proposing to amend the nursery policy to clarify the method of determining loss. Comments were requested for 30 days after the publication of said rule, in which time no comments were received. Therefore, the FCIC hereby adopts the proposed rule published at 59 FR 19661 as final without changes. The date by which all changes in this policy must be final is June 30. All present insureds under the policy and all applicants have been specifically advised of the changes herein. Additionally, changes have been placed in the agents' office prior to the contract change date. Good cause is thereby found to make this rule final in less than 30 days.
