The best example of this is Yugoslavia where the sanctions are expected "to bring peace to Bosnia but instead they have served to foment the war even further." At the same time they have brought about destabilization not just in Yugoslavia but further afield and have "become the largest obstacle to peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina," Jovanovic warned. Minister Jovanovic described the recent declaration between Croatia and the FRY as a major step forward and as an obligation for both sides to use political means and a peaceful way, rather than force, in resolving future problems. According to Jovanovic, the declaration reflects the determination on both sides to embark upon efforts to normalize relations. A joint statement from Geneva provides for an agreement to open representative offices "and not to establish diplomatic relations or to recognize each other." The declaration is only a step in that direction, Jovanovic explained. Asked to comment on the views that since the joint declaration was based on CSCE documents and the UN Charter it indirectly implied recognition of the Republic of Croatia by the FRY, Jovanovic said that "one should not look for something that is not in the agreement." He added that this agreement "prejudges none of the outstanding issues including Krajina, the division of assets, mutual recognition or even full diplomatic relations." When conditions are ripe these issues will be settled, the federal foreign minister stressed. We must bear in mind that the issue of Krajina is part of the Vance plan which stipulates that its political future and status must be resolved through direct negotiations between legitimate representatives of Krajina and the Republic of Croatia. Our agreement in Geneva is conducive to negotiations on these issues. The fact is that we have opened a process likely to increase the chances for exchanging political visits and establishing political contacts directly without mediators. This is a natural course to be pursued by two countries that want to settle their bilateral relations without "foreign middlemen." The coming visit by FRY Federal Deputy Prime Minister Zeljko Simic to Zagreb is a step in this direction. This visit will most likely be followed by a visit to Belgrade by the Croatian deputy prime minister and foreign minister [Mate Granic]. Contacts of a different kind at an even higher level are also a possibility, Jovanovic said.
