The mission wants to present a clear picture of how prepared different countries are to take part in the program. Today, the NATO mission is in Estonia. Urmas Loit reports. [Begin recording] [Loit] Joining the Partnership for Peace program is Estonia's first step towards becoming a full member of NATO. This was said at a news conference today, given by the NATO mission, which is presenting to Estonia the principles and opportunities of the partnership program. NATO representatives had a meeting with Defense Minister Indrek Kannik; Defense Forces Commander Aleksandr Einseln; Peeter Lorents, Riigikogu's state defense commission's deputy chairman; and Foreign Ministry Chancellor Alar Olljum. Defense Minister Indrek Kannik will sum up what was said. [Kannik] During the meetings today, the Estonian side has been speaking about the aspects we ourselves consider most important in the PFP program. Talking about the political aspects, one must emphasize a consultations mechanism included in the PFP program. We consider the possibility of holding political consultations with NATO -- in a situation of a serious crisis -- extremely necessary in our view, and we see it as an essential mechanism. The Estonian side has been talking at today's meetings also about the need for military cooperation. It is precisely joint exercises we have in mind here. Of course, in this context the question will arise immediately as to how Estonia can pay for her expenses. As is known, the PFP program states very clearly that both parties, NATO as well as a NATO partner, must pay for their own expenses. But I believe that here, too, solutions are possible. For example, even in the course of the discussions today our colleagues, our friends from NATO suggested that some exercises may take place on Estonian territory that would substantially reduce our expenses. We also consider the opportunity to have Estonian officers trained very important for us within the PFP program. [Loit] A Defense Ministry, the defense forces headquarters, and the Foreign Ministry working group will be drawing up the Estonian view of concrete cooperation within the next couple of months. Evidently as early as the second half of February another NATO mission will arrive to advise our politicians. [end recording] [passage omitted]
