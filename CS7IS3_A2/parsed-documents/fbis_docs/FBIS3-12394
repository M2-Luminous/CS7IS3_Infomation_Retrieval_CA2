The student and popular demonstrations throughout Egypt, which started a few days ago, speak of the deep Islamic bond that the Egyptian people have with their Palestinian brothers and shows the different stances by the Egyptian people and by the Egyptian Government in their approach to the Zionist regime. The Egyptian Government, which knows this reality more than anyone else, adopted a progressive position immediately after Tel Aviv's recent crime to politically exploit the issue and to avoid the negative repercussions that the Zionist regime's acts could have at home. Condemning the massacre of the worshippers at the Abrahamite shrine, it called on international organizations to seriously examine the issue and take punitive measures against the Zionist regime. But this stance, which did not conform with the nature and principles of the foreign policy of Husni Mubarak's regime, adopted a contradictory nature with the intensification of the Egyptian people's protests against the recent crime by the Zionist regime. The Egyptian police's clashes with demonstrators protesting against the Zionist regime and the killing of 12 demonstrators [as heard] showed the contradictory behavior of the Cairo regime and revealed its accord with the Zionist regime. Political observers believe that the Egyptian Government cannot agree with the Egyptian people's feelings of solidarity with the Palestinian dream and walk hand-in-hand with the Zionist enemy at the same time. These political observers believe that with their people's reaction to the Zionist regime's crime, the Arab governments that have been drawn into a compromise with the Zionist regime based on an incorrect assessment have realized for the umpteenth time that the path of compromise with the Zionist regime that they have chosen to tread does not conform with the people's views and that these regimes are at a crossroads, where they must choose between their people and relations with the Zionist regime. What is certain is that accord among Arab governments and their people will not only help strengthen these regimes, but will also grant them immense popular support, which can play an important role when it comes to showing the direction in which political developments and processes should move.
