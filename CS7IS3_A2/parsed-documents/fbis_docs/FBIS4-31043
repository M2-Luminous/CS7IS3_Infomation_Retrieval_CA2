First they were soldiers, then the civilian police, and now they are armed civilians. In the next stage one can expect that they will strip to the waist. On 3 June at 1100 they occupied the same positions they have occupied for the last 40 days. The issue of the right bank is obscuring the fact that the chetniks have not withdrawn from the 3-km zone on the left bank either. Thus, there is still a chetnik stronghold in Sjenokos which is 2.5 km from the town center. Last night and this morning frequent infantry provocations were exhibited from these positions. The defense lines in the northwest of the battlefield, on the free territory of Rogatica Commune, have been attacked by artillery since yesterday afternoon. It is the Muslim part of the village of (?Vrazovice) that has been targeted. Needless to say, the projectiles have been fired from within the 20-km exclusion zone. [passage omitted]
