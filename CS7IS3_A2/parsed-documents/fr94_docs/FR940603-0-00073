FR940603-0-00073 FR940603-0-00027 50 CFR Parts 672 and 675 [Docket No. 900833&hyph;1095; I.D. 052694E] Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska; Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Pacific halibut and red king crab bycatch rate standards; request for comments. SUMMARY: NMFS announces Pacific halibut and red king crab bycatch rate standards for the second half of 1994. Publication of these bycatch rate standards is necessary under regulations implementing the vessel incentive program. This action is necessary to implement the bycatch rate standards that must be met by individual trawl vessel operators who participate in the Alaska groundfish trawl fisheries under the incentive program. The intent of this action is to reduce prohibited species bycatch rates and promote conservation of groundfish and other fishery resources. DATES: Effective 12:01 a.m., Alaska local time (A.l.t.), July 1, 1994, through 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. Comments on this action must be received at the following address no later than 4:30 p.m., A.l.t., June 30, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be mailed to Ronald J. Berg, Chief, Fisheries Management Division, NMFS, P.O. Box 21668, Juneau, AK 99802&hyph;1668, Attn: Lori Gravel; or be delivered to 709 West 9th Street, Federal Building, room 401, Juneau, AK. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan J. Salveson, Fisheries Management Division, Alaska Region, NMFS, 907&hyph;586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The domestic groundfish fisheries in the exclusive economic zone of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI) and Gulf of Alaska (GOA) are managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI and the FMP for Groundfish of the GOA. The FMPs were prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The FMPs are implemented by regulations for the U.S. fisheries at 50 CFR parts 672 and 675. General regulations that also pertain to the U.S. fisheries appear at 50 CFR part 620. Regulations at §§672.26 and 675.26 implement a vessel incentive program to reduce halibut and red king crab bycatch rates in the groundfish trawl fisheries. Under the incentive program, operators of trawl vessels must comply with Pacific halibut bycatch rate standards specified for the BSAI and GOA midwater pollock and ``other trawl'' fisheries, and the BSAI yellowfin sole and ``bottom pollock'' fisheries. Vessel operators also must comply with red king crab bycatch standards specified for the BSAI yellowfin sole and ``other trawl'' fisheries in Bycatch Limitation Zone 1 (defined in §675.2). The fisheries included under the incentive program are defined in regulations at §§672.26(b) and 675.26(b). Regulations at §§672.26(c) and 675.26(c) require that halibut and red crab bycatch rate standards for each fishery monitored under the incentive program be published in the Federal Register . Any vessel operator whose monthly bycatch rate exceeds the bycatch rate standard is in violation of the regulations implementing the incentive program. The standards are in effect for specified seasons within the 6-month periods of January 1 through June 30, and July 1 through December 31. For purposes of calculating vessel bycatch rates under the incentive program, the periods specified as 1994 fishing months were published in the Federal Register on December 15, 1993 (58 FR 65556). Halibut and red king crab bycatch rate standards for the first half of 1994 also were published in the Federal Register on December 15, 1993. At its April 1994 meeting, the Council recommended bycatch rate standards for the second half of 1994. These standards are set forth in Table 1. As required by §§672.26(c) and 675.26(c), the Council's recommended bycatch rate standards for July 1 through December 31 are based on the following information and considerations: 1. Previous years' average observed bycatch rates; 2. Immediately preceding season's average observed bycatch rates; 3. The bycatch allowances and associated fishery closures specified under §§672.20(f) and 675.21; 4. Anticipated groundfish harvests; 5. Anticipated seasonal distribution of fishing effort for groundfish; and 6. Other information and criteria deemed relevant by the Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director). Bycatch Rate Standards for Pacific Halibut With the exception of the GOA ``other trawl'' fishery, the Council's recommended halibut bycatch rate standards for the 1994 trawl fisheries are unchanged from those implemented in 1993. The recommended 1994 standards are based largely on anticipated seasonal fishing effort for groundfish species and 1991&hyph;1994 halibut bycatch rates observed in specified trawl fisheries. Council deliberations on seasonal bycatch rate standards assumed that directed fishing for Pacific cod by vessels using trawl gear would be closed prior to July 1 (59 FR 24361, May 11, 1994). Council deliberations also considered the August 15 opening date of the 1994 Bering Sea pollock 'B' season (§675.23(e)). The recommended halibut bycatch rate standards for the BSAI yellowfin sole and ``bottom pollock'' fisheries approximate the average annual rates observed on trawl vessels participating in these fisheries during the past 3 years (5 kg halibut/metric ton (mt) of groundfish). The halibut bycatch rate standard recommended for the BSAI and GOA midwater pollock fisheries (1 kg halibut/mt of groundfish) is higher than the bycatch rates normally experienced by vessels participating in these fisheries. The recommended standard is intended to encourage vessel operators to maintain off-bottom trawl operations and limit further bycatch of halibut in the pollock fishery when halibut bycatch restrictions at §§672.20(f) and 675.21(c)(1) prohibit directed fishing for pollock by vessels using non-pelagic trawl gear.
