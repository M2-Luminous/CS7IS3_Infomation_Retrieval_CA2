The police have uncovered a rear-guard logistics network for the Algerian murderers. On 21 and 22 March, police arrested two FIS sympathizers in Lille, and discovered a large cache of false identity papers and other documents. A routine drug search led detectives to this important terrorist network. Eric Young has the details: [Young] For the first time, a police investigation appears to prove the existence of links between FIS sympathizers and the drug world. The network first came to light with a routine police investigation of a drug trafficking network. Detectives from the Lille police force spent several days tracking two suspects called Shahib and Ahmed. One is Algerian, the other French. On 21 March, they were arrested, and it was only during their first search that detectives realized they were dealing with something bigger. They found more than 1,000 false administrative papers at the home of one of the men, including 500 blank Algerian identity cards. Enlisting the help of their Parisian colleagues, the Lille police then carried out a second search, this time in Persan-Beaumont in the Val d'Oise, at the home of Ahmed. Their haul was enormous. They found documents in Arabic linked to the FIS, perfect imitations of Algerian official stamps, several handguns, an assault rifle, and a significant amount of ammunition. They also found a list of telephone numbers, several of which corresponded to people on file for drug trafficking. A third man was thus arrested, a certain Hassan. It therefore seems clear that the FIS has set up a network of dealers in France to finance its movement and its actions. The sixth division of the criminal investigation department, responsible for the repression of threats to state security and of subversive activities, has been given the task of investigating the affair, under the direction of Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere. It remains to be seen how important this network is and to prove how exactly it is passing on its support to the clandestine movement in Algeria.
