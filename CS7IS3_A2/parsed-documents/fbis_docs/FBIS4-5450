The Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] has no intention whatsoever of continuing the war. I will support Samdech Krompreah [Norodom Ranariddh] in his efforts to implement our king's initiative to woo the Khmer Rouge into settling the problem peacefully. Since all manner of attempts and all (?discussions) between Samdech Krompreah and H.E. Khieu Samphan have failed, however, and since the people and the KRAF [Khmer Royal Armed Forces] have continued to suffer from further attacks, Samdech Krompreah and I have decided to launch the attacks to take control of Anlung Veng, Pailin, An Seh, and other areas. If we do not destroy the bases in Pailin and Anlung Veng and other places, the Cambodian people can never live in peace. This is because the Khmer Rouge have used all those bases to attack them and the KRAF. I would also like to say that the RGC is duty-bound to implement Article 1 of the Constitution, which stipulates clearly that the Kingdom of Cambodia is an indivisible state. We have the task of controlling Cambodia totally, according to the Constitution. We have resorted to offensives only after the talks between Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and the Khmer Rouge became unproductive. We can no longer let Cambodia remain divided. According to the Constitution, the royal government has to control the entire kingdom. Therefore, the attacks on Anlung Veng, Pailin, or other places do not constitute a violation of anybody's territory or border. They are the tasks carried out by the RGC in compliance with the Constitution. Moreover, our policy is to use military measures to enter into a political dialogue. Samdech Krompreah and I are of the same opinion that if the Khmer Rouge continue to enjoy their military, economic, political, psychological, and diplomatic support, its leaders will not soften their political stances, no matter what. So the attack on Pailin is to isolate the Khmer Rouge and to soften its political stance while the government leaves the door open for political dialogue to achieve national reconciliation. We continue to implement, not just accept, His Majesty's initiative. The Khmer Rouge has to fulfill the three necessary tasks while the royal government implements the two others. First, the Khmer Rouge has to stop firing on and destroying property; second, it has to surrender its troops to the royal government; and third, it has to hand over the regions under its control to the government. As for the government, it should fulfill two tasks: first, it should agree to include the Khmer Rouge troops in the KRAF; second, it should allow acceptable Khmer Rouge personages to hold some ministerial or advisory posts. Samdech Krompreah and I are prepared to hold political discussion with H.E. [His Excellency] Khieu Samphan. The RGC wants to cease hostilities in compliance with His Majesty's initiative. Especially on this new year occasion, we want to have an unconditional and general cease-fire throughout the Kingdom of Cambodia so as to allow people to enjoy the new year celebration. The KRAF, police, and people, as well as the Khmer Rouge troops, all want to be happy on this occasion. If Democratic Kampuchea agrees to a general cease- fire, the KRAF have no reason whatsoever to launch attacks. Taking this opportunity, I would like to appeal, in case the Khmer Rouge leaders disagree, to the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea officers and soldiers to lay their arms aside and come in to enjoy popular games with the people and the KRAF. This is a very good opportunity for reconciliation. Now, I want to talk a bit about the plan to develop Pailin. We have not only attacked and occupied Pailin militarily, but we should also develop it in line with other regions throughout the country. We need to transform Pailin into an administrative region. The RGC plans to request that the National Assembly authorize the designation of Pailin as a town with a structure equal to that of a province. The government has already set up a group of delegates with the duty of organizing this area as a development zone. Taking this opportunity, I would like to appeal to the people who have been forced out of the Pailin region by the Khmer Rouge into Thailand or other areas to return. If they return, we will hand their homes or land back to them. We want to give priority to those forced by the Khmer Rouge to follow them. When they return, we will allow them to own homes legally as other people do. [Summary from poor reception] I want to talk a bit about relations with Thailand. Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut, deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs, presented this issue to the Kingdom of Thailand on 8 April. As for myself, I will make an urgent visit to Bangkok on 16 April. That will be an urgent working visit to solve not only the Cambodian-Thai border problem at Pailin, but also the issue of security along the common border. I wish to emphasize that while I am there, I will not discuss the issue of establishing the boundary between the two countries because the Thai-Cambodian border, except for the maritime border, has been recognized since His Majesty's Sangkum Reas Niyum era. There have already been maps and proper arrangements. The purpose of my next trip is to settle the problems between Thailand and Cambodia concerning the control of the security situation and the relations of good neighborliness. This is to turn the common border into a border of peace, friendship, and cooperation. I will first make clear with the Kingdom of Thailand that the Khmer Rouge office near the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh does not mean that Cambodia is separated into two different countries. Some Thai leaders have said that the Khmer Rouge has not been outlawed yet because its representatives are still in Phnom Penh. I would like to underline that legally, there is only the royal government, which is the result of the UN-sponsored elections that the royal Thai government has already recognized. There is no other legitimate force on Cambodian soil other than the RGC. As for the Khmer Rouge office in Phnom Penh, it only represents a political liaison among Cambodians. This issue is purely an internal affair. The RGC also wants to keep dialogue through the Phnom Penh Khmer Rouge office with the aim of seeking a political solution. Nonetheless, we would like to specify to the entire world not to consider the Khmer Rouge office in Phnom Penh proof of Cambodia's division into two. This is the first point I want to clarify to my counterpart in Bangkok. Second, we want to implement the Cambodian Government statement that all contracts previously concluded by Thai companies with the Khmer Rouge will be recognized. I will urge those companies to do business with the RGC, because the trade will have a bright future and be legal. The RGC will not tolerate any violation of Cambodian laws, policy, or economy. I hope that my statement will not (?upset) the Thai side. This is done with the intention of settling problems and avoiding creation of new ones, and is also forewords to Bangkok. Anyway, we still have a lot of problems to discuss if the visit is to take place after this new year celebration.
