FBIS4-50730 "drchi098_v_94013" FBIS-CHI-94-098 Daily Report 19 May 1994 TAIWAN Satellite Project Expected To Begin as Scheduled Satellite Project Expected To Begin as Scheduled OW1905140394 Taipei CNA in English 1247 GMT 19 May 94 OW1905140394 Taipei CNA English BFN [By Debbie Kuo] [Text] Taipei, May 19 (CNA) -- The development of ROCSAT-1, Taiwan's first satellite intended for both communications and scientific research, is expected to begin as scheduled, an official of the National Science Council (NSC) said Thursday [19 May]. The NSC signed a contract with the U.S.-based TRW space and electronics group in mid-April to jointly build and launch the satellite, said NSC Vice Chairman Hu Ching-piao, who also supervises operations of the national space program office (NSPO), the executive agency in charge of the satellite project. The launch of ROCSAT-1 is scheduled for the end of 1998. The contract, inked by Hu and Bruce Gerding, vice president of TRW's civil and international systems division, carries an important rider stipulating that the contract will become void if TRW fails to acquire an export license from the U.S. Government within 60 days. As technology acquisition is a predominant factor in international procurements, Hu said, a technology assistance agreement is integral to the ROCSAT-1 contract. The rider also mandates that TRW must secure such an agreement from the U.S. Government to implement the deal. Technology assistance agreements are required by U.S. companies before they can export high technologies. Gerding informed the space program office Thursday that TRW officials, confident in acquiring both the technology assistance agreement and an export license in time, will visit Taipei on Monday and Tuesday to brief the office on progress regarding the contract, NSPO Deputy Director Jung Kai said. Once the technology-assistance agreement is secured, Jung said, the NSPO will send 24 engineers to TRW headquarters in Redondo Beach, California to participate in the design, development, manufacture and testing of the satellite, which carries a price tag of NT$ [New Taiwan dollar] 1.6 billion (U.S.$59.26 million). The NSC began the ROCSAT-1 procurement project in December 1993. Four foreign companies, including France's Matra Marconi -- a group comprising French and Israeli aircraft industries, Germany's Dornier, France's Alcatel, and TRW submitted bids. TRW was awarded the contract in April after the NSC evaluated the bids, Hu said. Under a NT$13.6 billion (U.S.$509 million) space program, Taiwan plans to have three satellites in orbit by 2006. TRW, a leading space/defense contractor to the U.S. Government, has developed and launched 175 spacecraft and more than 500 scientific payloads in the past 35 years, according to TRW officials.
