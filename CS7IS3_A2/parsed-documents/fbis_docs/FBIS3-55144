It is for the first time that the Russian peace-keepers will be armed with mortars, anti-tank missiles and anti-aircraft weapons. Earlier the Russian soldiers had only firearms with them. The service of the Russian airborne troops told TASS on Thursday that the paratroopers were dispatched upon a request of the commander of the UN peace-keeping forces in former Yugoslavia and with the knowledge of the UN Security Council. It added that it is hard for the current strength of the Russian battalion to fulfil its mission on the border between Krajina Serb and Croatia. The zone monitored by the Russian force is 100 kilometres long and 30 kilometres wide and has 24 checkpoints. Both Croats and Serbs regularly violate ceasefire there. The train with paratroopers is expected to arrive in place on January 9.
