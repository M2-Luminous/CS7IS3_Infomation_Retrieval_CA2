Though "the Contact Group", which communicates with the belligerents directly, has made an important preparatory contribution, it is still unable to supplant a meeting of foreign ministers, he said. "Moscow considers it necessary to accelerate preparations for holding a new meeting of foreign ministers. We believe the meeting could take place within a week or two," the spokesman said. Moscow hails the fact that the warring parties in Bosnia have agreed through the mediation of the United Nations to suspend offensive operations and other provocative acts for a month, he said. The agreement comes into force tomorrow at noon (local time). "The most important thing at present is the fact that the parties involved in the military conflict in former Yugoslavia are actually prepared to carry out the reached agreement. The vitality of the truce depends on their position, self-restraint and political will," Karasin added. Aleksandr Belyayev, a Russian soldier of the UN Protection Force, who was fatally wounded in the beginning of this months, died on June 7. A close investigation into the tragic accident is now under way, Karasin told the briefing.
