Position the velocity meter so that it measures the flow rate of the air passing directly across the solvent cleaning machine. 3.3␣Level the Inclined Liquid Level Indicators. 3.4␣Initial Inclined Liquid Level Indicator Readings. Open the sump drainage valves. Allow the solvent cleaning machine to operate long enough for the vapor zone to form and the system to stabilize (check with manufacturer). Record the inclined liquid level indicators readings and the starting time on the data sheet. A sample data sheet is provided in figure 307&hyph;3.
