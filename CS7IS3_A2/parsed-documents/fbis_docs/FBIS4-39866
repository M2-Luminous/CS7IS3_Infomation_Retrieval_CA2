Commenting after the meeting on its outcome the head of the Russian defense department said that the main attention had been focused on two purely military matters. The first matter concerned the future of the Gabala [Gabelinskaya] missile attack warning station, a large installation in northern Azerbaijan that was previously under the control of the armed forces of the former Soviet Union. Pavel Grachev said that on this matter he had met with full understanding on the part of Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev that this station is of strategic importance not only for Russia and Azerbaijan but also for other CIS countries and the states of the whole world. Grachev stated that experts have been given the task of studying this matter very quickly so that an agreement can be signed on the operation of the installation. The Russian delegation also put forward for consideration by the Azerbaijani side a proposal to create a single air defense system in the Transcaucasus. This proposal had been discussed earlier at talks between Armenia and Georgia, and had been accepted by those countries. The head of the Russian defense department said that Geydar Aliyev welcomed the idea, and had instructed the Azerbaijani defense minister to look into this question. Grachev said he hoped for a positive solution. In any case, even if Azerbaijan does not give us a positive answer, we will build a single air defense system in the Transcaucasus, with the participation of Russia, Armenia, and Georgia, -- the Russian minister underlined. Speaking of the settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, Grachev said that he had learned a lot in a one-to-one conversation with Geydar Aliyev. The Russian minister said he would brief in detail President Yeltsin on his return to Moscow. Grachev said he had learned two important things from this conversation. The first one relates to the influence of the internal political situation in Azerbaijan on the conflict there. The second, according to the minister, is that no narrow or departmental agreement on the cease- fire and on stopping the military action would have a positive effect until a comprehensive political treaty between Russia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia on settling this problem has been signed. Such a document is now being developed by the Foreign Ministry and other departments, he said, speaking of this issue. At present, Azerbaijan and Armenia on the whole are observing the cease-fire agreement, Grachev said. However, according to his information, each of the sides was building up its forces and this could lead to a resumption of military actions. At the same time, the minister gave assurances that Russia, as mediator, was monitoring the situation in the conflict zone. Grachev said that the question of introducing Russian peacekeeping forces into the region had not been discussed at the meeting. It has become known that the Russian defense minister and those accompanying him will return to Moscow this evening.
