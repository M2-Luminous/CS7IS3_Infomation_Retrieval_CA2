The Japanese Government plans to provide the loans in cooperation with the World Bank to ease Cambodia's international balance of payments problem, the sources said. The amount of the loans, however, remains undetermined, they said. Japan last extended a 1.5 billion yen loan in March 1969. The government is likely to decide on resumption of the loans after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) assesses the Cambodian economy in February, they said. It is not clear whether Tokyo will be able to make an announcement on the new loans at the International Committee on the Reconstruction of Cambodia (ICORC) scheduled to be held in March, because a meeting of Paris Club creditor nations is to be held in April, the sources said. The ICORC was set up in June 1992 at a ministerial meeting. At its first meeting in Paris last September, donor nations pledged 119 million dollars in new aid in addition to the 880 million dollars pledged at the ministerial meeting. Cambodia is estimated to owe Japan some 2.6 billion yen. The accumulated debt is an obstacle to Japan's resumption of yen loans. Japan has been offering Cambodia grant-in-aids for projects to improve the war-torn country's infrastructure. Japan extended 6.12 billion yen in fiscal 1992 and 8 billion yen in fiscal 1993.
