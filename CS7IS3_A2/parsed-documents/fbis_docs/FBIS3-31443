[passage omitted] "Today the UNMOs (military observers) gave us reports of very significant withdrawal of Serb forces of the hills around Sarajevo," UN Protection Force Lieutenant-Colonel Bill Aikman said. "Up until now, the reports from the UNMOs have been of individual vehicles and pieces of equipment. Today, they're talking about convoys of equipment moving out of the hills," he added. "A major, very significant withdrawal is going on," he said. General Michael Rose, commander of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia, "has received information from senior levels of the Bosnian Serb government that they will have their equipment out of a 20-kilometer (12-mile) zone within 36 hours, that means well before the deadline of midnight Sunday night," Aikman added. Journalists in and around the capital however saw no immediate sign of the withdrawal. There was no new activity at the Lukavica barracks, main headquarters of Serb forces in the Sarajevo suburbs. And armoured vehicles deployed along the front line in front of the barracks which had disappeared in the previous few days were again put into combat position Thursday. [passage omitted] Aikman said UNPROFOR's contingent in Sarajevo was continuing to receive reinforcements and its staff now numbered 3,500 men, an increase of 500 in less than a week. A British armoured unit consisting of 170 men, equipped with 14 Warrior tanks, was expected to arrive here from the central Bosnian town of Vitez on Friday. [passage omitted]
