FR941202-2-00079 FR941202-2-00056 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Institute of Standards and Technology National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program for Ionizing Radiation Dosimetry AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice of change of proficiency testing standard. SUMMARY: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Department of Commerce, began a joint effort in 1981 through an Interagency Agreement to provide an accreditation program for processors of personnel dosimeters, now known as the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) for Ionizing Radiation Dosimetry. The purpose of this notice is to acknowledge publication of a revised proficiency testing standard for the NVLAP, to inform the public and dosimetry processors of this action, to provide an effective date for use of the revised standard, to identify significant changes in the standard and request public comments on use of the standard. DATES: Submit comments by January 31, 1995. Comments received after this date will be considered if it is practical to do so but there is no assurance that consideration can be given to comments received after this date. ADDRESSES: Mail written comments to Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch. Hand delivery comments to 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland between 7:45 am and 4:15 pm on Federal workdays. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 31, 1997. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Donald O. Nellis, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, telephone (301) 415&hyph;6257, or Paul R. Martin, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Department of Commerce, NVLAP, Building 411, Room A162, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, telephone (301) 975&hyph;3679. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The NRC's regulations (ยง20.1501), require that all personnel dosimeters that require processing must be processed and evaluated by a dosimetry processor holding current personnel dosimetry accreditation from the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP), of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Proficiency testing, required as part of the NVLAP accreditation process for Ionizing Radiation Dosimetry, is based upon American National Standard ANSI N13.11&hyph;1983, ``Personnel Dosimetry Performance_Criteria for Testing'' as specified in NIST Handbook 150&hyph;4. A revision to this ANSI standard was approved by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., in September 1993, and published as ANSI N13.11&hyph;1993 in July 1994. The revision embodies changes in the following irradiation categories: Category III, low energy photons; Category V, beta particles; Category VIII, neutron-photon mixtures; and adds a new Category IX, angle of incidence. Accreditation under the NVLAP for Ionizing Radiation Dosimetry is renewed annually, with proficiency testing taking place every 2 years after the initial test. To prevent the possible loss of accreditation that could occur as a result of changing from the original test standard ANSI N13.11&hyph;1983, to the revised standard ANSI N13.11&hyph;1993, the NRC and NIST/NVLAP intend to institute a phase-in period of testing against the revised standard, beginning January 1, 1995. During this phase-in period, dosimetry processing laboratories will be tested against the revised standard when their normal accreditation proficiency testing date comes due. Any laboratory that fails the proficiency test due to changes made in the revised standard will not have their current accreditation suspended, but will be required to retest and pass those failed categories before January 31, 1997, in order to maintain accredited status. Any failure of proficiency testing during this phase-in period that is not attributable to changes in the test standard, however, could affect the processing laboratory's accreditation status. The revised standard, ANSI N13.11&hyph;1993, will be implemented as published with the following exceptions: (1) Categories III(a), III(b) and VI. The requirement for choosing a primary low energy source and at least one other source from Category III as described in the standard will not be used. For each group of dosimeters tested, the source used will be randomly selected from the five sources listed in Category III(a) or the three sources listed in Category III(b), with the stipulation that for at least one of the groups, the source chosen will be either M150 or H150. (2) Category VIIIB testing will not be provided initially because a suitable source with traceability to NIST is not available at the present time. (3) Category IX testing will be required only once for each dosimeter model that is to be tested in Category III or IV. A retest will be required whenever the dosimeter design is hanged or the dose algorithm is modified. For the Department of Commerce. Albert D. Tholen, Chief, Laboratory Accreditation Program, NIST.
