It is now up to Dr. Perez Balladares to reinforce this democracy and set in the future an example similar to the one set by President Endara, for whom I publicly express appreciation. [Perez Balladares] I also wish to join Mr. Galindo in this recognition because it is reality and represents truth. We have held very pure elections in Panama, despite some minor incidents. I acknowledge President Endara's efforts. I also make a public pledge that the 1999 elections will be at least this honest. I will not intervene in the 1999 elections. The Panamanian people can rest assured that on 1 September 1999 I will hand over office to whoever wins the elections. In the next five years, we expect to improve democracy in Panama, which starts today. [Reporter] Mr. Lewis Galindo, do you acknowledge Dr. Perez Balladares' victory? [Lewis Galindo] Definitely. Our reports, which are ahead of the Electoral Tribunal's results, indicate that Dr. Perez Balladares has won by a wide margin. For this reason, I have come to congratulate him in the name of my party. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Perez Balladares] The same message we have been transmitting throughout our campaign. It is a message of reconciliation, of national unity, the message that 8 May, election day, will be over in a few minutes. When this day is over, we will turn a glorious page with the beginning of a participative democracy, which we all now pledge to perfect. In addition, I am inviting all of my adversaries to unite with us in a single purpose so we can attain the national objectives, for which we intend to struggle in the next five years. [Lewis Galindo] I am very pleased by Dr. Perez Balladares' remarks on the day of his victory. This reassures the Panamanian people that all of the electoral promises made by the now victorious candidate will be fulfilled. The Panamanian people should be pleased with this and should stay alert to make sure he keeps his word. [Perez Balladares] I would like to add something else, which I think is very important. As we have said before, our government will be one without hatred or resentment, without revenge or grudges, without a return to the past, but with its eyes set on the future for our young people and children. Thanks. [applause]
