The decision was adopted by a majority of votes. [Correspondent Marina Vasilyeva] Today's session of the Federation Council began with a debate on the possibility of using the Russian Armed Forces for the peacekeeping operation in the zone of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. The debate, held behind closed doors, lasted over an hour. The president's edict was ratified as a result. Journalists learned of this first from Pavel Grachev, who represented the Russian president at the session. [Begin Grachev recording] The Federation Council has adopted a positive decision. The debate was conducted in a proper manner. The motion won an absolute majority. Seven deputies abstained and another seven were against. All the rest voted for the peacekeeping operation in Abkhazia. This is a sign -- or, for me, an order -- to get started. In literally two or three days' time, once Colonel General Kuznetsov has reported to me that all engineering and mine clearance work has been completed, we will start on the peacekeeping operation proper -- in other words, the deployment of outposts, checkpoints, observation points, command points. We will start work. [end recording] [Vasilyeva] The decision that was adopted gives the go-ahead for a contingent of the Russian Armed Forces, numbering up to 3,000 volunteers, to be used in the peacekeeping operation, with an initial mandate of six months. Committees of the Federation Council have been instructed to supervise the implementation of this decision.
