The assurance of support was made in a letter sent to Clinton Tuesday [24 May], which was signed by 118 House democrats and republicans. In the letter, the congressmen emphasized the importance of Clinton's forthcoming announcement regarding China's MFN to the U.S.-China bilateral relations and American economic and security interests. They called for increased trade and economic links with China by unconditional extension of MFN. Representative Jim Kolbe, an author of the letter, said that "If the President imposes trade sanctions at this juncture, we will see a destructive ripple effect on the carefully nurtured U.S.-China relationship that has evolved over the past 20 years."
