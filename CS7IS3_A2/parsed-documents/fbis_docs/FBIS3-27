Document Type:FBIS ANALYSIS-11Mar94-Russia The Union of Officers of Ukraine (UOU), founded by Ukrainian nationalists in July 1991 to promote creation of an independent Ukrainian Armed Forces, initially achieved substantial influence within the nascent Ukrainian defense establishment, particularly in personnel and related matters. Since mid-1992, however, the UOU has increasingly come into conflict with the military establishment and has lost much of its influence inside the Defense Ministry, a trend that has greatly accelerated since Vitaliy Radetskyy replaced Konstyantyn Morozov as defense minister. The union has reacted belligerently to the loss of its insider status, returning to its roots as a military-oriented ally of the moderately nationalist Ukrainian People's Movement (Rukh) and seeking to influence the military from the outside through the political process. It is running candidates for parliament and is likely to remain a significant political force if it and its nationalist allies do well in the 27 March 1994 parliamentary election. END SUMMARY The Union of Officers of Ukraine: From Establishment Insiders to Nationalist Opposition The UOU'S Foundation by Ukrainian Nationalists Rukh was evidently the moving force in the UOU's creation. At least since the fall of 1990, Rukh's leaders had been calling for the creation of a separate Ukrainian army, saying this was an essential element in the drive for Ukrainian independence from the Soviet Union (Kultura i Zhyttya, 28 October 1990; Kiev radio, 19, 22 February 1991). When the First UOU Congress met in July 1991, press reports said that Rukh had organized it specifically to pursue this goal (TASS, 29 July 1991; Kiev radio, 27 July 1991; Krasnaya Zvezda, 5 November 1991). Several Rukh leaders played key roles at the congress. Rukh Deputy Chairman Volodymyr Mulyava chaired the congress's organizing committee; Rukh Military Collegium Chairman Lt. Col. Vitaliy Chechylo was a deputy chairman of the organizing committee; and the congress elected Rukh Political Council member Col. Vilen Martirosyan as the UOU's first chairman (TASS, 29 July 1991; Komsomolskaya Pravda, 18 September 1991; Narodnaya Armiya, 29 June 1992). With a large majority of its members ethnic Ukrainians and retired or reserve rather than active-duty officers, the UOU has always been more a Ukrainian nationalist organization than a military one. Eighty-five percent of its members are ethnic Ukrainians, a proportion far higher than that in the armed forces overall (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 6 January 1994). (See Note 1) Only half of the delegates to the First UOU Congress were on active duty (Interfax, 29 July 1991). At its most recent congress it was reported that twice as many members were retired as were on active duty, and that many UOU officers, including oblast organization chairmen, are either in the reserves or retired from the service (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 6 January 1994). Many of the union's organizers were not military men. For instance, Mulyava and Oleksandr Yemets (See Note 2) were civilians. Other key leaders, such as former UOU chairmen Hryhoriy Omelchenko and Oleksandr Skypalskyy, were career police officers (See Appendix C: Biographical Information). (Note 1) In 1992, according to then-military personnel chief Oleksandr Ihnatenko, eighty-five percent of servicemen in Ukraine were ethnic Russians (Narodnaya Armiya, 5 May 1992). (Note 2) Yemets, leader of the Party of Democratic Revival of Ukraine, was a deputy chairman of the First UOU Congress organizing committee (Kiev radio, 27 July 1991). The rapid disintegration of the USSR led the UOU to shift its attention from its original goal of creating a Ukrainian national army to influencing the nascent army's development. As the Soviet state rapidly withered awaY in the wake of the August 1991 coup attempt, Ukraine enacted a package of laws in October 1991 to create its own armed forces by placing Soviet forces stationed in Ukraine under Ukrainian government control. Ukraine also appointed its own defense minister, Konstyantyn Morozov. The UOU then set itself the task of shaping the armed forces--especially the officer corps--in what it considered a patriotic mold. In practice, this meant striving to influence decisions on appointments, promotions, and dismissals, as well as seeking a leading role in military indoctrination activities. In November 1991, the Second UOU Congress demanded that all appointments, "from battalion commander on up," be "coordinated with" the UOU (Krasnaya Zvezda, 5 November 1991). (See Note 3) The congress also passed several resolutions calling for an acceleration of the creation of a Ukrainian army and for measures to assure that the army be manned by soldiers whose first loyalty was to Ukraine. In March 1992, then-First Deputy Chairman Vitaliy Chechylo said that the UOU should "take a most active part" in military personnel matters (Narodnaya Armiya, 28 March 1992). (Note 3) The Soviet Defense Ministry was not reported to respond directly to these demands, but a few days after the congress Defense Minister Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov decried "centrifugal tendencies" in military affairs (Krasnaya Zvezda, 7 November 1991). The nascent Ukrainian Defense Ministry was also apparently silent; the newly-appointed minister, Morozov, addressed the congress but was not reported to discuss a role for the UOU in military personnel matters (Moscow Russian TV, 2 November 1991). Subsequently, however, Morozov strongly backed UOU aspirations in this area (See below, page ). From the beginning, many officers stationed in Ukraine- -particularly among the ethnic Russian majority of the officer corps--were hostile to the UOU, evidently fearing that its influence in personnel decisions boded ill for them personally. As early as the end of 1991, an assembly of air defense officers accused the union of seeking to arrogate to itself the powers of newly minted commissars" and to revive "democratic centralism" (Narodnaya Armiya, 14 December 1991). Rival servicemen's groups sprang up, often with the apparent purpose of opposing the UOU. According to reports in the Moscow press, groups such as the Independent Officers Association (based in Vinnytsya, headquarters of the predominantly Russian 43rd Missile Army) and the Kiev Constructive Union sought to protect their members and the armed forces overall from what they charged were UOU "witch hunts" for supporters of the 1991 coup attempt. The UOU actively, but unsuccessfully, opposed these groups' creation (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 2 November 1991; Krasnaya Zvezda, 26 November 1991). Defense Minister Morozov Encourages the UOU Despite the hostility of many officers, the UOU at first flourished, helped by the friendly attitude of nationalist-minded Defense Minister Morozov. Morozov signalled early on that his thinking on military matters paralleled that of Rukh and the UOU. He told a Moscow News interviewer that Ukraine needed its own armed forces as soon as possible to guarantee its independence, echoing earlier statements by Rukh leaders (See above, page ). In the same interview, he said that he shared the concerns expressed at the Second UOU Congress over the loyalties of the officers then stationed on Ukrainian territory (3-10 November 1991). A UOU Executive Committee session was held on Ukrainian Defense Ministry premises in January 1992, the members congratulating themselves on their new-found establishment insider status (Narodnaya Armiya, 1 February 1992). Several UOU leaders were appointed to important Defense Ministry and Security Service posts where they were well-placed to pursue the UOU's agenda in personnel and related matters. In December 1991, UOU Chairman Martirosyan was appointed chairman of the government's new Committee for Social Protection of Servicemen (CSPS), with First Deputy Chairman Chechylo as one of his top aides (Narodnaya Armiya, 29 January, 11 March 1992). A UOU Executive Committee member, Oleksandr Skypalskyy, headed the Security Service's Military Counterintelligence Directorate (Molod Ukrayiny, 17 October 1991). UOU Deputy Chairman Hryhoriy Omelchenko was especially well placed to weed out supposedly undesirable officers, heading the organized crime unit in Skypalskyy's directorate as well as sitting on the Defense Ministry Higher Certification Committee, which vets senior appointments (Narodnaya Armiya, 30 January 1993; Nezavisimost, 9 April 1993). "Ukrainianizing" the Armed Forces The UOU scored one of its greatest successes with the appointment of Volodymyr Mulyava, deputy chairman of both the UOU and Rukh, as chief of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's new Socio- Psychological Service. This service was organized on the basis of ideas developed by Mulyava in his capacity as a Rukh deputy chairman to inculcate Ukrainian patriotism and national identity among the troops (See Appendix C: Biographical Information). To this end, Mulyava launched a highly controversial program requiring servicemen to learn the Ukrainian language, history, and traditions (Syn Otechestva No. 7, February 1992; Narodna Armiya, 29 July 1992). President Leonid Kravchuk endorsed the program--at least in principle--at a Ukrainian Security Council meeting in late 1992 (Narodna Armiya, 9 December 1992). However, Mulyava's critics--both in Ukraine and in Russia--charged that he actually sought to purge ethnic Russians from the officer corps (Narodnaya Armiya, 1 April 1992; Narodna Armiya, 3 December 1992; Interfax, 6 January 1993; Pravda, 13 May 1993), a claim which he and other UOU and Defense Ministry officials heatedly and repeatedly denied (Kiev radio, 6 February 1992; Narodna Armiya, 5 May 1992, 3 December 1992, 17 April 1993; Vechirniy Kyyiv, 22 November 1992). The UOU's influence in the Ukrainian government and armed forces reached a peak in the spring and summer of 1992. Senior military and political figures addressed its Third Congress, which met in April 1992 and attracted 918 delegates, the largest number ever (Ukrinform, 6 April 1992). Congress speakers congratulated the union on the large role it was now playing in military affairs (Golos Ukrainy, 7 April 1993; Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992). UOU leaders had expansive ideas about the organization's present and future role in military affairs. For instance, a "Draft UOU Program," signed by several top union leaders and published in the Defense Ministry newspaper Narodnaya Armiya on 4 June 1992, mapped out ambitious goals for direct UOU involvement in drafting military legislation, personnel decisions, training, indoctrination, and social welfare of servicemen. On 24 June 1992, Morozov ordered that the UOU should be involved in identifying and removing corrupt officers (Molod Ukrayiny, 23 July 1992). The UOU Under Attack, Fights Back Even as its influence peaked in the middle of 1992, the UOU was apparently encountering growing resistance from the defense establishment--despite Morozov's friendly attitude--as well as from politicians outside the military. The critics said that its influence within the military establishment was excessive and decried the ends for which that influence was being used. For instance, in an interview published on the eve of the Third UOU Congress, Yevhen Hryniv, a moderate Rukh member of parliament, complained that the UOU had fixated on the "nationality question" and said its decisions should be taken by the armed forces only as recommendations (Narodnaya Armiya, 1 April 1992). Several months later, a favorable article on Mulyava's activities claimed that the Defense Ministry newspaper Narodna Armiya was developing a disloyal attitude" toward him (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 22 November 1992). At the end of 1992, 155 members of parliament called for Morozov's dismissal, on the grounds that he had supposedly allowed the UOU--in particular Mulyava--to "control" military personnel policy and to impose its "nationalist ideology" on the troops (Interfax, 6 January 1993). (See Note 4) (Note 4) Press reports have not been observed to describe the political leanings of the 155 deputies, although Morozov's supporters consistently described them as communists. Among the organizers of the call for Morozov's dismissal were Col. Valeriy Izmalkov, a deputy from Zaporizhzhya in the mainly Russian eastern Ukraine and an inveterate foe of the UOU; Oleksiy Prychkin, also from Zaporizhzhya and a former high communist party official; Maj. Gen. F. Kiparis; MVD Lt. Gen. O. Badurka; and Viktor Slyusarenko (Holos Ukrayiny, 6 January 1993; Nezavisimost, 13 October 1993). Belligerent Response to Criticism In response, UOU leaders rose to Morozov's defense, while they accused their critics in the military and parliament of being corrupt, unpatriotic, and pro-communist. Hryhoriy Omelchenko, elected UOU chairman at its Third Congress, repeatedly complained that a "nomenklatura mafia" in the government, parliament, and armed forces was blocking his efforts to prosecute officers whom he accused of corruption, communist sympathies and subservience to Russia. Omelchenko also claimed that criticism of Morozov was motivated precisely by Morozov's support for the UOU's anti- corruption efforts (Nezavisimost, 18 July 1992; Molod Ukrayiny, 23 July 1992; Kiev TV, 13 January 1993; Uryadovyy Kuryer, 3O January 1993; Nezavisimost, 9 April 1993; Molod Ukrayiny, 15 July 1993; Khreshchatyk, 8 October 1993). Mulyava dismissed the accusations in parliament against himself and Morozov as comical," describing Morozov's critics as "conservative generals" and "pro-imperialist and pro-communist forces" seeking to protect "corruption and abuses in the armed forces" (Kiev radio, 6 February 1993). Morozov in turn defended Mulyava against charges of discrimination against ethnic Russians (Narodna Armiya, 17 April 1993). The UOU issued a combative statement, published in Narodna Armiya on 4 February 1993, decrying "political provocations by pro-communist, chauvinist [pro-Russian] forces," which it said could lead to civil war and the loss of Ukrainian independence. Furthermore, after the Third UOU Congress in April 1992, pressure from opponents began to unravel the web of personal links that the UOU had so successfully created between itself and the defense establishment, a process abetted by the endemic factional and personal rivalries within the UOU itself. Martirosyan and Chechylo, the UOU's two most prominent figures in the area of servicemen's social welfare, broke with the union after the Third Congress (Narodna Armiya, 13 May 1993). In March 1993, Morozov dismissed Deputy Minister for Personnel Oleksandr Ihnatenko, a key UOU ally, for allegedly tolerating corruption (Narodna Armiya, 26 March, 17 April 1993). Meanwhile, there was infighting within the leadership of the UOU. Martirosyan was forced out from the UOU chairmanship at the Third Congress under heavy pressure (Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992) and after his deputy, Chechylo, had publicly criticized him for being reluctant to step down (Narodnaya Armiya, 28 March 1992). Volodymyr Pylypchuk, a UOU deputy chairman as well as deputy chief of the Defense Ministry Military Education Directorate, attacked the UOU leadership--at that point chaired by Omelchenko- -for "authoritarian methods," incompetence and poor organization (Narodnaya Armiya, 19 June 1992). In December 1992, Chechylo, at that point no longer a UOU official but still identifying himself as a UOU member, accused Omelchenko of tolerating and even encouraging corruption within the UOU leadership (Pravda Ukrainy, 21 December 1992). The following year, Oleksandr Skypalskyy, who had just been elected UOU chairman at the Fourth Congress in April 1993, told an interviewer that Omelchenko, his predecessor as chairman and his subordinate in the Security Service, had used his UOU position to advance his own career (Narodna Armiya, 13 May 1993). The Fourth UOU Congress Despite clear signs that its opponents' attacks were taking a toll on the union, the UOU made it clear at its Fourth Congress in April 1993 that it was not backing down on its ambitions to play a leading role in military policy. Attendance, as compared with the Third Congress a year earlier, was down sharply, from 918 delegates to about 6OO. Outgoing Chairman Omelchenko said Ukraine was facing "difficult times" in the economy, which he blamed on the "nomenklatura" parliament. Other speakers criticized parliament for failing either to enact a military doctrine or to cut back the size of the armed forces, accusing it of protecting servicemen whom the UOU thought should be dismissed for corruption or disloyalty. The congress also expressed considerable dissatisfaction" with the activities of the government's Committee for the Social Protection of Servicemen (CSPS) and called--unsuccessfully--for the dismissal of CSPS Chairman Martirosyan, a former UOU chairman who was by that point estranged from the union (Ukrinform, 6 April 1992; Narodna Armiya, 13 April 1993). Addressing the congress, Morozov praised the UOU's activities and said that it "should not be a bystander" in personnel and indoctrination matters (Narodna Armiya, 13 April 1993; Za Vilnu Ukrayinu, 27 April 1993), advice the UOU seemed inclined to take to heart. Its new chairman, Oleksandr Skypalskyy, asserted shortly afterwards that the Fourth Congress had been held "exclusively to affirm the readiness and aspiration of the UOU to take an active part in the building of the Ukrainian army" (Narodna Armiya, 13 May 1993). New Defense Minister Cracks Down on the UOU The UOU's position within the military establishment suffered an especially serious decline after Vitaliy Radetskyy's appointment in October 1993 as defense minister, replacing Morozov. Radetskyy brought with him a reputation as a foe of the UOU (Narodna Armiya, 17 September 1992), a reputation he did nothing to dispel. Asked in parliament about his attitude toward the UOU, he was implicitly hostile, saying that the question of dissolving the union needed to be "studied attentively." He was noncommittal when asked his evaluation of Socio-Psychological Service Chief Volodymyr Mulyava's activities, though he did tell an interviewer later that he would slow down--but not eliminate- -Mulyava's controversial program to promote use of the Ukrainian language in the armed forces (Kiev radio, 8 October 1993; Moloda Halychyna, 14 October 1993). Meanwhile, the parliament sought to curtail the UOU's role, enacting a new Military Doctrine which banned political activity by servicemen (Golos Ukrainy, 29 October 1993). Omelchenko--clearly seeing the ban as a serious threat--called it a "gross violation of human rights" (UNIAN, 3 November 1993). (See Note 5) (Note 5) Ironically, only four months earlier, the Fourth UOU Congress had criticized the parliament's delay in enacting a military doctrine (Narodna Armiya, 13 April 1993). Once in office, Radetskyy took several steps to curtail the UOU's influence. He shifted Mulyava to a new position as deputy defense minister for ties with the public, parties, and movements, a shift seen as a blow to Mulyava and the UOU, since it removed him from involvement in personnel-related matters. Radetskyy also removed Mulyava from the Higher Certification Commission, along with two UOU allies, former Defense Ministry personnel chief Oleksandr Ihnatenko and Yuriy Prokofyev, chief of the Defense Ministry Military Education Directorate (UNIAN, 2 December 1993). These actions led commentators to claim that the ministry was conducting a "purge" of UOU activists (Narodna Hazeta No. 44, November 1993; Valentyn Labunskyy in Holos Ukrayiny, 12, 17 November 1993). One commentary in a nationalist Lviv newspaper even claimed that Radetskyy was serving Russia's interests by making these changes (Andriy Starostin in Post- Postup, 2 December 1993). Radetskyy reportedly forbade officers to write for publication--supposedly in response to a critical article by Air Force Major General Oleksandr Rol, (See Note 6) a UOU member who was subsequently elected the union's chairman (UNIAN, 3 November 1993). Radetskyy also revoked Morozov's 1992 order giving the UOU a role in personnel matters (Kievskiye Vedomosti, 27 November 1993). (Note 6) Rol's article, published only a few days after Radetskyy's appointment, excoriated the Defense Ministry leadership for incompetence and corruption and asserted that the military was incapable of reforming itself without the involvement of outsiders (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 13 October 1993). Radetskyy's apparent hostility toward the UOU communicated itself down the chain of command. Some unit commanders reportedly tried to suppress UOU activities (Samostiyna Ukrayina, 22 November 1993). In December, the UOU's Kiev organization appealed to Radetskyy to put a stop to what it called "arbitrariness" and "pressure" against UOU activists by commanders (Molod Ukrayiny, 17 December 1993). UOU officials also claimed that the Defense Ministry had attempted to prevent officers on active duty from attending the UOU's Fifth Congress, granting permission only at the last moment (Halychyna, 4 January 1994). At the congress, two delegates claimed that the military command was trying to "ban" UOU representatives from certification commissions at all levels, which vet appointments (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 6 January 1994). UOU Remains Defiant, Steps Up Political Activity The Fifth UOU Congress When the Fifth UOU Congress met in December 1993, the organization's estrangement from the defense establishment was near-total. Attendance was down again, to a mere 225 delegates, less than a quarter of the attendance at the Third Congress a year and a half earlier. Outgoing Chairman Oleksandr Skypalskyy and other participants attributed the decline to "persecution" of UOU members by commanders (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 21 December 1993; Halychyna, 4 January 1994). No top Defense Ministry officials attended (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 6 January 1994); by contrast, Morozov and other senior figures had addressed the Second, Third and Fourth Congresses (Moscow Russian TV, 2 November 1991; Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992; Narodna Armiya, 13 April 1993). In contrast to its extensive favorable coverage of earlier UOU congresses, the Defense Ministry newspaper Narodna Armiya published only a short Ukrinform report on the Fifth Congress (22 December 1993). The congress's mood was defiant. It elected a new chairman, Rol, who was already in disfavor with the Defense Ministry and who was rumored to be on the verge of dismissal from the armed forces in retaliation for the critical article he had published in October (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 21 December 1993, 6 January 1994). Speakers attacked the government for not spending enough on defense and failing to promote arms exports (Kiev TV, 18 December 1993; Halychyna, 4 January 1994). Delegates gave a standing ovation to a fiery speech threatening to revive the 1940's anti-Soviet Ukrainian Insurrection Army if "anybody" prevented the UOU from playing what it considered its proper role (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 21 December 1993). Mulyava called on the UOU, despite the "new conditions," to expand its influence "in all spheres of army life" (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 6 January 1994). Another UOU official, Bohdan Vivchar, assailed the UOU's parliamentary critics as "national chauvinist [pro-Russian] forces" who sought to "prevent the consolidation of an independent Ukrainian state through the building of strong armed forces" (Halychyna, 4 January 1994). Delegates also pointed to recent opinion polls showing high popular support for the officer corps, evidently seeing this as proof that the UOU was in a stronger political position than its critics (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 21 December 1993, 6 January 1994). Parliamentary Election Campaign Activity Faced with official hostility and with its influence within the establishment on the decline, the UOU is re-emphasizing its long- standing links with Rukh and other nationalist groups in preparation for the March 1994 parliamentary election. In December 1993, UOU Deputy Chairman Omelchenko appealed for all "democratic" groups to unite during the election campaign and to run a single "democratic" candidate in each parliamentary district (Interfax, 17 December 1993). Addressing the Fifth UOU Congress, Rukh leader Vyacheslav Chornovil likewise appealed for unity of all "democratic and patriotic forces" in the election campaign and urged the union to "engage in political activity more daringly" (Molod Ukrayiny, 24 December 1993). While the UOU is clearly taking an active role in the campaign, these appeals for unity are meeting with mixed success. The Fifth Congress decided to run UOU candidates in all regions of the country (Halychyna, 4 January 1994)--a goal the union is unlikely to achieve--while at the same time UOU is participating in the All- Ukrainian Electoral Committee of the Democratic Bloc with Rukh and several other nationalist groups to try to unite behind common candidates (Interfax, 17 December 1993; UNIAR, 4 January 1994). At least six UOU leaders are candidates for parliament: Rol; Omelchenko; Skypalskyy; Mulyava; Guards Lieutenant Colonel Oleksandr Lobashchuk, a member of the UOU's Executive Committee and deputy chairman of its Lviv Oblast organization; and Vasyl Krychun, a local government official and deputy chairman of the Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast UOU organization. All but Krychun are apparently defying the Military Doctrine ban on political activity, since they remain on active duty. Five of the six are running in nationalist western Ukraine, the UOU's main power base. Rol is running in Lviv Oblast on the ticket of the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists, Lobashchuk also in Lviv Oblast as an independent supported by the UOU, Skypalskyy in Volyn Oblast, and Mulyava and Krychun in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast (Za Vilnu Ukrayinu, 4, 14 January, 24 February 1994; Vechirniy Kyyiv, 21 December 1993; Holos Ukrayiny, 12 January 1994; Halychyna, 27 January, 12 February 1994). Omelchenko is running in Kiev as a candidate of the Party for Democratic Revival of Ukraine (UNIAR, 29 December 1993; Vechirniy Kyyiv, 4 January 1994). Prospects Despite the reverses it has suffered since mid-1992, the UOU is clearly determined to remain a force in Ukrainian military policy. Recent statements by the UOU's leaders show that it has not abandoned its central ambition of playing a leading role in shaping the armed forces and acting as the guardian of their loyalty and honesty. Its vigorous activity in the parliamentary election campaign shows its determination to seek alternate means to exert influence on the military even in the face of the Defense Ministry's hostility. Its strong and long-standing links with Rukh and other important political groups will probably be helpful to it in this endeavor. Appendix A: The UOU'S Agenda UOU spokesmen have said that the union's goal is to ensure that all members of Ukraine's officer corps will be honest, competent, and loyal to Ukraine (See for example the UOU Draft Program in Narodnaya Armiya, 4 June 1992; as well as interviews by then-UOU First Deputy Chairman Vitaliy Chechylo in Narodnaya Armiya, 28 March 1992; then-UOU Chairman Oleksandr Skypalskyy and Kiev local organization Chairman Volodymyr Saladyak in Narodna Armiya, 13 May 1993; and current UOU Chairman Oleksandr Rol in Samostiyna Ukrayina, 5 February 1994). Stated in such general terms, these goals are hardly controversial and in fact have been endorsed even by the UOU's opponents, including Radetskyy (see his articles in Armiya Ukrayiny, 26 January 1994, and in Ukrayinska Hazeta, 2 February 1994). Controversy has centered instead on the UOU's aspiration to play a direct and leading role in personnel decisions, down to the level of influencing individual appointments and dismissals, as well as on its criteria- -particularly ethnicity--for ensuring loyalty to Ukraine. Beyond its primary interest in influencing personnel and indoctrination, the UOU has also pledged to work for better living conditions for servicemen and to prevent the misappropriation of military property, either by corrupt individuals or by Russia. Its focus on Ukrainian nationalism is displayed in its strenuous opposition to Crimean separatism. It has also lobbied against ceding control of the former Soviet Black Sea Fleet to Russia and against the presence of any foreign troops in Ukraine (Khreshchatyk, 3 March 1994). Military Personnel, Indoctrination and Loyalty Issues The UOU's attempts to shape Ukraine's officer corps has been its main raison d'etre almost from the beginning. Two key UOU leaders, Hryhoriy Omelchenko and Volodymyr Mulyava (See Appendix C: Biographical Information) have played the most prominent roles in this area. Omelchenko has sought to use his positions in the Security Service and on the Defense Ministry Higher Certification Commission to weed out unsuitable officers--though he claims to have been thwarted in these efforts by entrenched conservatives in government (See above, page ). Mulyava, meanwhile, took the lead in attempting to mold servicemen into what he and the UOU considered Ukrainian patriots. It remains unclear to what extent this meant--as critics charged--favoring ethnic Ukrainians over ethnic Russians (See above, page ). However, UOU leaders frequently warned union audiences against the danger of ethnic discrimination, suggesting that at least some UOU supporters, despite denials, may have in fact pursued discrimination against Russians. For instance, UOU Deputy Chairman Andriy Haysynskyy told an interviewer in 1991 that "in my opinion" ethnicity should have no significance, implying that others did not share that view (Za Vilnu Ukrayinu, 2O September 1991). At the Third UOU Congress, Deputy Chairman V. Lazorkin said the union should "help" military personnel authorities "make correct appointments to key posts," which should be filled only by "true patriots." While Lazorkin's statement was not unambiguously a call for ethnic discrimination, it may have been understood as such. Omelchenko, who was elected UOU chairman the next day, responded to Lazorkin by warning against seeking "enemies" on the basis of their ethnicity (Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992). The concern with ethnicity seems to be lingering, however, even among the UOU's friends; an interviewer for the nationalist newspaper Za Vilnu Ukrayinu praised newly-elected UOU Chairman Oleksandr Rol's "good idiomatic Ukrainian" as evidence of his "healthy family roots" (14 January 1994). Whatever its views on ethnicity, the UOU clearly will not willingly give up its claim to a role in shaping Ukraine's officer corps. In a recent interview, newly-elected Chairman Oleksandr Rol, while making conciliatory statements about the new Defense Ministry leadership, asserted that "We [the UOU] consider it our duty to indoctrinate army personnel in the spirit of Ukrainian patriotism and glorious traditions of the Ukrainian Army" (Samostiyna Ukrayina, 5 February 1994). The UOU has also pushed insistently to require all officers to swear allegiance to the Ukrainian state. Characteristically, the union presented itself as the guarantor that this goal would be achieved. It early on created a data bank to identify officers who had or had not taken the oath (Moscow Ostankino TV, 29 January 1992). Then-UOU Chairman Vilen Martirosyan said he would use this data to lobby for the dismissal of all commanders who refused the oath (Moscow radio, 18 March 1992). The Defense Ministry has endorsed this goal, but not a UOU role in enforcing it. In mid-1992, then-military personnel chief Oleksandr Ihnatenko, a UOU ally, said that all officers who refused the oath would be transferred to service in Russia or other former Soviet republics (Krasnaya Zvezda, 9 June 1992). One officer, Major Grigoriy Nesmyanovich, claimed that this in practice meant denying salaries and other benefits to officers who refused the oath as a way of pressuring them to leave Ukraine voluntarily (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 15 July 1992). Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy, a UOU opponent, recently ordered that any remaining officers who had not taken the oath be removed from active service (UNIAN, 1 February 1994). Yet another aspect of UOU involvement in military personnel matters has been its campaign to bring Ukrainian servicemen, stationed in other parts of the former Soviet Union or in Eastern Europe, "home" to Ukraine. Shortly after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the UOU Executive Committee called for an interstate agreement to send all former Soviet servicemen to their "native" republics (Narodnaya Armiya, 29 January 1992). Then-Defense Minister Konstyantyn Morozov told the Third UOU Congress that the "return" of these servicemen would help to "Ukrainianize" the army (Golos Ukrainy, 7 April 1992). Protection of Military Property The UOU has cast itself as the protector of military property from both theft and attempts by Russian authorities to appropriate equipment claimed by Ukraine. The subject was raised at the Second UOU Congress (Literaturna Ukrayina, 7 November 1991) and at a January 1992 UOU Executive Committee session (Narodnaya Armiya, 1 February 1992). At its Third Congress, the UOU took credit for protecting military property against misappropriation (Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992). The Third Congress highlighted its concern with the corruption issue by electing Security Service Col. Hryhoriy Omelchenko as UOU chairman. Although Omelchenko has complained that he has been prevented by conservative politicians from carrying out this mandate (See above, page ), the UOU nonetheless remains determined to attempt to police the military. The head of the UOU Lviv Oblast organization, Mykola Vasylkevych, recently asserted that "the UOU will take a most active part" in inventorying and protecting military property, "from ships under construction to the last cartridge" (Shlyakh Peremohy, 15 January 1994). "Social Protection" of Servicemen The problem of the shortage of housing and other amenities for military officers evidently presented a dilemma for the UOU. While any organization aspiring to influence among servicemen in the former Soviet Union must address this issue, Ukraine's near- catastrophic economic situation makes it difficult for any group to deliver on its promises. Although the union characteristically at first presented itself as the guarantor that living standards would improve, it eventually backed off its earlier aspirations and promises. It may be a testament to the intractability of the problem that the UOU officials most identified with the social welfare issue, founding Chairman Vilen Martirosyan and former First Deputy Chairman Vitaliy Chechylo, have both fallen out with the organization (See Appendix C: Biographical Information). The UOU urged, and took credit for, the creation in late 1991 of a Committee for Social Protection of Servicemen (CSPS) attached to the Ukrainian Council of Ministers (Narodnaya Armiya, 29 January 1992). Martirosyan was appointed chairman of the new committee (Narodnaya Armiya, 29 January 1992), and Chechylo chief of its General Department (Narodnaya Armiya, 11 March 1992). Martirosyan told the UOU Executive Committee in January 1992 that military housing and other "social protection" issues were a "main task" and "top priority" for the UOU and that his dual role created "new opportunities" to solve the problem (Narodnaya Armiya, 1 February 1992). The "social protection" issue was a major topic of discussion at the Third UOU Congress, and Martirosyan told the congress that the union was establishing a fund to finance housing construction (Moscow radio, 4 April 1992; Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992). In June, the UOU Draft Program repeated that promise (Narodnaya Armiya, 4 June 1992). However, the Third Congress reportedly believed that Martirosyan could not adequately lead both the UOU and the CSPS. Both he and Chechylo stepped down from their UOU posts, Martirosyan reportedly under heavy pressure (Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992). By 1993, the UOU was backing off from its earlier plans to play an active role in providing for servicemen's welfare. In April, the Fourth Congress assailed Martirosyan's stewardship of the CSPS, calling for his dismissal but rejecting a call for the abolition of the CSPS (Interfax, 12 April 1993; Narodna Armiya, 13 April 1993). In May, then-UOU Chairman Skypalskyy said that, earlier promises notwithstanding, the union could not help finance housing construction, and would merely offer "moral support" to officers in need of housing (Narodna Armiya, 13 May 1993). In contrast to the Third and Fourth Congresses, the Fifth UOU Congress in December 1993 was not reported to have discussed "social protection" at all. Crimea In keeping with its Ukrainian nationalist roots, the UOU opposes any change in Crimea's status (Narodnaya Armiya, 9 June 1992). The union and its Crimea regional organization assailed the Russian parliament's July 1993 resolution claiming Crimea as Russian territory (ITAR-TASS, 1O July 1993; Holos Ukrayiny, 28 July 1993). In September, the union declared that no bilateral issues could be solved until Russia "surrendered its territorial claims" (Kiev radio, 2 September 1993). In December, a Crimean Ukrainian Civil Congress was created, headed by Lieutenant Colonel Serhiy Lytvyn, chairman of the UOU Crimea regional organization, to lobby for "preserving Ukraine's territorial integrity." The congress opposed the very holding of a Crimean presidential election (Kiev radio, 2 December 1993; Moscow Radio, 4 December 1993; Holos Ukrayiny, 7 December 1993). Box Allegations of UOU Links to Radical Nationalist Groups Although there have been claims that the UOU is linked to, and is even giving active support to, underground armed nationalist organizations such as Ukrainian Self-Defense (UNSO) (Moscow News, 14-21 June 1992; Pravda, 13 May 1993; Valeriy Izmalkov in Kievskiye Vedomosti, 27 November 1993), Ukrainian news media have not been observed to report hard evidence of such ties. It should also be noted that these allegations emanate mostly from Russian sources or from Ukrainian critics of the UOU. Former UOU Chairman Oleksandr Skypalskyy has denied these claims; although he said that the members of UNSO and similar groups were "patriots," he also said "I do not share their methods" (Literaturna Ukrayina, 23 September 1993). UNSO leader Dmitriy Korchinskiy recently told a Moscow News interviewer that UNSO has the support of "officers' circles," but he did not mention the UOU or any other organization by name (18-24 February 1994). End Box Appendix B: Evolution of UOU Policy on Nuclear Weapons The UOU has moved gradually from a position of supporting the country's denuclearization to one of seeking to retain a strategic nuclear arsenal for some time to come. The First UOU Congress called for a nuclear-free Ukraine (TASS, 29 July 1991). The UOU's first chairman, Vilen Martirosyan, subsequently said that plans for separate Ukrainian armed forces did not include any ''strategic'' component, which he said should remain under central" control (Kuranty, 29 August 1991). The Second UOU Congress in November 1991 supported this position (Literaturna Ukrayina, 7 November 1991). However, the Third UOU Congress hailed a statement by Vasyl Durdynets, deputy chairman of the Ukrainian parliament, that any "strategic" forces on Ukrainian soil should be subordinated to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry (Moscow Radio, 4 April 1992). The Fourth UOU Congress called for keeping nuclear weapons in Ukraine (Interfax, 12 April 1992). At the Fifth UOU Congress, outgoing Chairman Oleksandr Skypalskyy spoke in support of the Ukrainian parliament's heavily- conditioned ratification in November 1993 of the START I Treaty and the Lisbon Protocol (Kiev TV, 18 December 1993). His successor, Oleksandr Rol, recently told an interviewer that he believed that Ukraine would need a nuclear deterrent for as long as Russia possesses nuclear weapons--a position which he has made part of his parliamentary election campaign platform. Rol also said that, in his capacity as UOU chairman, he would "investigate" the fact that the officers of the Vinnytsya-based 43d Missile Army had not sworn allegiance to Ukraine (Za Vilnu Ukrayinu, 14 January 1994; Shlyakh Peremohy, 29 January 1994). The UOU has issued a statement opposing Ukraine's "unilateral nuclear disarmament" (Khreshchatyk, 3 March 1994), and the union's local organization in Kiev has called for a nationwide referendum on the subject (Khreshchatyk, 5 March 1994). Appendix C: Biographical Information The following biographical entries are intended to illustrate the UOU's connections with Rukh and other nationalist organizations, as well as with the Defense Ministry and other government institutions. Russian spellings, where they differ from Ukrainian, are given in parentheses. Chechylo (Chechilo), Vitaliy, Lt. Col.

He is chief of the General Department of the Committee for Social Protection of Servicemen attached to the Ukrainian Council of Ministers (Narodnaya Armiya, 11 March 1992). He stepped down from his UOU post at the Third Congress (Narodnaya Armiya, 28 March 1992). He has since been feuding with the union's leadership, accusing it of corruption (Pravda, Ukrayiny, 21 December 1992). Former UOU Chairman Oleksandr Skypalskyy called his criticisms "ignoble and ungentlemanly," claiming that he had not been expelled only because the union had no expulsion procedure (Narodna Armiya, 13 May 1993). Haysynskyy (Gaysinskiy), Andriy, Lt. A UOU deputy chairman (Za Vilnu Ukrayinu, 2O September 1991), he served on the commission to organize the Defense Ministry Socio-Psychological Service (Narodnaya Armiya, 29 July 1992).

He served as UOU deputy chairman (Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992) and chairman of the UOU Coordinating Council (Narodnaya Armiya, 8 July 1992). He helped draft the 1991 legislation setting up Ukrainian Armed Forces (Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992) and was one of the authors of the UOU Draft Program (Narodnaya Armiya, 4 June 1992). Lytvyn (Litvin), Serhiy, Lt. Col., retired. Chairman of the UOU Crimean regional organization and chairman of the Ukrainian Studies Department at the Symferopil Higher Building School, he was elected chairman of the new Crimean Ukrainian Civil Congress in December 1993, at which time he retired from active military duty (Holos Ukrayiny, 7 December 1993). Martirosyan, Vilen, Maj. Gen. A member of Rukh's Political Council, he was elected the UOU's first chairman at its First Congress in July 1991 (TASS, 29 July 1991). He served as chairman until the Third Congress in April 1992, when he stepped down under pressure (Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992), and subsequently left the UOU altogether (Narodna Armiya, 13 May 1993). He recently authored a scathing attack on the UOU, claiming that under Volodymyr Mulyava's leadership it had instigated an "open purge" of the officer corps in favor of then- Defense Minister Konstyantyn Morozov's supporters, which according to Martirosyan has resulted in a wholesale exodus of highly skilled servicemen, both officers and enlisted men (Kievskiye Vedomosti, 5 February 1994). He has been chairman of the Committee for Social Protection of Servicemen, attached to the Ukrainian Council of Ministers, since its creation in December 1991 (Narodnaya Armiya, 29 January 1992; Kievskiye Vedomosti, 5 February 1994). He is an ethnic Armenian (Narodnaya Armiya, 4 April 1992). Mulyava, Volodymyr. Mulyava's only military rank prior to January 1992 was sergeant in the reserves (Moskovskiye Novosti, 10 November 1992). He developed his ideas for a military Socio- Psychological Service to inculcate Ukrainian patriotism among servicemen as early as 1986, and was active in Rukh's 1990 and 1991 preparations to organize the UOU (Narodnaya Armiya, 29 July 1992). A deputy chairman of Rukh's governing board, he chaired the organizing committee for the First UOU Congress and was elected UOU deputy chairman (Kiev radio, 27 July 1991; Rabochaya Tribuna, 2 August 1991). In September 1991, he submitted a report on behalf of Rukh to Ukraine's new defense minister, Konstyantyn Morozov, proposing to create a Socio-Psychological Service. Morozov gave Mulyava the rank of colonel and appointed him to head a commission to organize the new service (Narodnaya Armiya, 29 July 1992). In February 1992, Mulyava was appointed head of the service (Syn Otechestva No. 7, February 1992). He also sat on the Defense Ministry Higher Certification Commission. At the end of 1992, he was promoted to major general (Narodnaya Armiya, 3 December 1992). In late 1993, Mulyava was removed from the Socio-Psychological Service and appointed deputy minister for ties with the public, parties, and movements, a shift which was seen as weakening his and the UOU's influence since his new position gave him no role in personnel or indoctrination (Holos Ukrayiny, 12, 17 November 1993). He was also removed from the Higher Certification Commission (UNIAR, 2 December 1993). Mulyava has served as Rukh spokesman on economic policy (Narodna Hazeta, No. 1, January 1992) and on Ukrainian Orthodox Church affairs (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 4 June 1992) and is the hetman of the Ukrainian Cossacks (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 4 March 1993; Kiev radio, 18 August 1993).

He is also a member of the Defense Ministry Higher Certification Commission (Narodnaya Armiya, 30 January 1993). Omelchenko was a deputy chairman of the UOU until its Third Congress in April 1992, when he was elected chairman (Narodna Armiya, 8 April 1992). He served as chairman until the Fourth Congress a year later, when he was again elected deputy chairman (Kiev radio, 15 September 1993); he was re-elected to that post at the Fifth Congress (Molod Ukrayiny, 24 December 1993).

He was removed from the Defense Ministry Higher Certification Commission by Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy (UNIAN, 2 December 1993). Rol (Ryl), Oleksandr, Maj. Gen. Once a senior Soviet Air Force officer, Rol is now chief of the Operational Administration Staff of the Ukrainian Air Force (Samostiyna Ukrayina, 5 February 1994). He has persistently criticized the leadership of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry for inefficiency and corruption and has called for a robust Ukrainian military, including offensive as well as defensive capabilities (Za Vilnu Ukrayinu, 17 March 1992; Ukrinform, 3 March 1993; Vechirniy Kyyiv, 13 October 1993; Za Vilnu Ukrayinu, 8 February 1994).
