[Prime Minister] Silvio Berlusconi called for this clarification, in his usual tone, which allows for no objections, acting since Sunday evening [12 June] like the leader of what will become the single party of the center-right. "There is only one thing that I can say: As things stand, there must be a clarification, first and foremost within the League," the prime minister replied to a journalist who tried to goad him with [League Secretary] Umberto Bossi's latest outbursts. In fact Berlusconi is aiming directly to separate the League's two leaders. On one side the "reasonable" [Interior Minister] Roberto Maroni, his deputy at the Palazzo Chigi [government seat] (and to think that until a few weeks ago he was averring: "Rather than allow a League member to become interior minister, I will drop everything..."). And on the other, the unpredictable Bossi. An attack on the League for the sake of necessary "governability" and the essential "clarity" between government partners. This is Forza Italia's latest task. The successful attack will be followed by another strategy: first, an electoral reform to introduce a pure single-candidate system, (that is, without the 25 percent elected proportionally) with a single round; then, the building of the single party, led, of course, by supreme leader Silvio Berlusconi. Defense Minister Cesare Previti told LA REPUBBLICA: "I dream of seeing a great party united under the same name...." After the elections the members of the team have set to work. And the first step toward what Maroni described as "a three-way integration of Forza Italia, the National Alliance, and the League" is the exclusion of the restless Bossi. The prime minister's political adviser, Domenico Mennitti, explained: "The balance of forces has changed; the European elections obviously clarified any uncertainties about the identity of the majority's linchpin. In March we were blood donors, but now... The real problem is that the League has already performed its tasks: It has brought down the old system and brought federalism into Italian politics." Mennitti's theorizing continued: "The fact is that the great political earthquake is still under way: The country's political geography has not yet been established. We will see a great many more changes both on the Right and on the Left... With a pure single-candidate system, the cake will be cut in two, and there will be many surprises." Could Bossi become a leader of the progressive alignment? "Why not? He has great political flexibility, but he is someone who has to operate on his own: He is irritated by negotiations, mediation; he is someone committed to struggle.... For the present, however, it seems to me that he is merely creating great ideological confusion: Liberalism and laborism are not the same thing. When he has clarified his ideas, we will all understand things better. At last we now have before us a year in which to ponder, a year without elections. But let this be clear: We do not want to reform a party, but to govern an alignment." To this end Mennitti is planning a conference and a magazine. To govern an alignment. In which there will be room also for "Catholics, nonconfessionals, socialist-liberals." This idea horrifies League minister Francesco Speroni: "I would like to know from Mr. Berlusconi whether that gang of former Christian Democrat and former Socialist scoundrels that are trying to join with him are doing so on their own initiative or with his consent... But as far as we are concerned, he can be reassured: There has already been a clarification, and it is a positive one. If he is demanding it as government leader, he is entitled to do so. But it is incorrect for the leader of a political force to demand to know who is in charge in another party. He cannot ask whether Bossi or Maroni is in charge here." And yet this does indeed seem to be the question of the moment. This, as long as the two League leaders are not planning to share the roles, in the hope of causing difficulties for their allies, breaking free with a superlative "one-two." Those who know them well rule out the possibility of rifts between them. And yesterday the interior minister himself shelved the issue until Sunday [19 June]: "In Pontida [League rally venue] there are never any pauses for reflection for the Northern League. In Pontida there is always a return to the attack. The same will apply next Sunday... I think it will be a very interesting meeting, useful in order to see where the League will go in the near future." Some say, with Berlusconi. And others, such as the League's lower house floor leader, Pierluigi Petrini, see it "on the Left side" in the near future.
