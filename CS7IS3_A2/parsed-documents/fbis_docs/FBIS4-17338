He announced this in the Kremlin today at a working conference of those participating in the agreement on the attainment of civic accord in Russia. "Russia has an alternative to confrontation," Boris Yeltsin declared. According to him, the document on civic accord that has been prepared "is an agreement of which all the social and political forces are the authors." The president noted that "each side will commit itself to implementing the treaty; everyone will have to give up something." "Calm in Russia is the main thing; for the sake of that, one must impose limitations on oneself and find a salutary compromise." Boris Yeltsin is certain that "the country is badly in need of a new political culture." In his opinion, a permanently operating mechanism for accord must be devised. Analysing the draft agreement that was achieved, Boris Yeltsin noted that all political and social forces needed to prove in practice that "extremism is ineffective in politics."
