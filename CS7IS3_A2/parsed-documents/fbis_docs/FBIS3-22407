Focusing on establishing efficient, innovative technologies and the training of national specialists in Algeria through a knowledge transfer, this program, after two years in existence, was found to have yielded a "very positive" outcome by the CNRS's Languedoc-Roussillon regional delegation. The delegation, in a communique sent Friday to APS, found that "original solutions have been found to treat effluents from the National Cellulose and Paper Industry's [CELPAP] pulp paper plant in Baba-Ali, near Algiers" and that "about 15 internships have been served in Montpellier by Algerian engineers." "This effort," the delegation added, "which is aimed at implementing new membrane technologies to remove the pollution from the water supplies of the countries of the Maghreb and at the fight against pollution in the Mediterrean, has been strengthened by another cooperative program financed by the European Community between the Montpellier teams and the Algerian (especially from the National Polytechnic and Houari-Boumediene University) and Moroccan (University of Fes) teams." According to the CNRS's regional delegation, "the success of this cooperation is based on the sharing by numerous agencies (universities, research agencies, and industrialists)" and it emphasized "the importance of the specific progress made in Montpellier in the area of membrane technologies." These programs, based on the principle of partnership and shared objectives, reflect the spirit and the organization of scientific cooperation with countries on the southern rim of the Mediterranean as envisioned by the CNRS and reflect the willingness of that agency to strengthen relations with the industrial sector.
