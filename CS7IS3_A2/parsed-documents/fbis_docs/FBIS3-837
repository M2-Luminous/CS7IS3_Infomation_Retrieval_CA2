Initially, only fighters of the AFL [Armed Forces of Liberia] began to hand in weapons. Yesterday NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] fighters began disarming. But ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] has faced problems. It has been racked by internal splits, and over the weekend there were reports that rival ULIMO factions had been fighting. Well, the UN special representative to Liberia, Trevor Gordon-Somers, has been traveling around the different parts of Liberia. On the line to Monrovia, Josephine Hazely asked him what news he had of inter-ULIMO fighting. [Begin recording] [Gordon-Somers] In fact, as far as I know there was none yesterday and the day before. There was fighting in ULIMO going back a week ago in Tubmanburg, but since Tubmanburg calmed down I have had no evidence or no information that there has been fighting anywhere else among ULIMO. [Hazely] In that right, because we are getting reports that there has been fighting in the Todi center itself? [Gordon-Somers] Well, I visited the Bong Mines, the Todi Mission, Kakata, I think on Thursday [10 March] and we talked with the fighters, we saw them massed in their center, and what they told us was that they were waiting for clear instructions from their high command. Now, Mr. Alhaji Koromah, in fact, sent written instructions, as I understand it, to the field commander and then sent in one of his commanders out to him, and as has been reported to me they started disarming this morning and I think that it is a good sign that they have started their disarmament today. [Hazely] So, as far as you can gather, the faction fighting within ULIMO is more or less (?finished now). [Gordon-Somers] I would like to believe that but, I mean, one must not oversimplify these matters. Notwithstanding the reconciliation efforts, it doesn't necessarily heal in one day. But I believe that it is a very positive sign and I think that the best indication that there is calm in ULIMO headquarters and in the various ULIMO barracks is that they have started disarming. At least it means that fighters themselves have a sense of confidence that they are not going to be attacked by one faction or the other. [Hazely] As has been reported, ULIMO commander Roosevelt Johnson has not acknowledged Alhaji Koromah as the leader of ULIMO. [Gordon-Somers] That is correct. [Hazely] Okay, let's talk about Charles Taylor's NPFL now. You, I understand, went to watch some of them disarm yesterday. What did you see? [Gordon-Somers] That has taken place in NPFL territory. This is between Konola and Sir George Philip Mission or something of the sort. Well we... [pauses] there were some... [pauses] I -- the figures may vary but -- I suspect it was about 400 NPFL fighters who were assembled with their weapons and we processed them through yesterday evening between three o'clock and I think they must have finished at about six or seven because I left before they were completed. [Hazely] What sort of weapons did they hand in? [Gordon-Somers] They were handing in weapons like some types of machine guns or AK's or what was it, and there were some mortars. [Hazely] What was the mood of the fighters from what you could judge? Were they happy to hand in their weapons or did they do this grudgingly? [Gordon-Somers] No, they were extremely happy. They were singing songs and dancing around, and their commanders who were with them were cheering them on and dancing with them. It was a very happy occasion, and some of them to whom we spoke indicated their readiness, their willingness, they want to go back to school, they want to go and do something else. It was a very happy occasion. [end recording] [London BBC World Service in English at 0600 GMT on 14 March adds that "Fighters of one of Liberia's largest armed factions have begun to surrender their arms to the African peacekeeping force. They were ordered to do so yesterday by the National Patriotic Front leader, Charles Taylor, despite a political dispute over the composition of a new transitional government and continued factional fighting clashes. Fighting has continued among members of the ULIMO faction around the town of Todi, which has been designated a disarmament site."]
