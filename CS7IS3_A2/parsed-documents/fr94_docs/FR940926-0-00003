FR940926-0-00003 FR940926-0-00001 In the 1992 and 1993 price change rule documents, the Administrative Committee invited public comment on the pricing structure of Federal Register publications. Three comments were received regarding the December 10, 1993 rule. Two commenters inquired whether unofficial Federal Register data formerly available as ACFR publications on magnetic tape would instead be distributed under the auspices of the Superintendent of Documents. This unofficial Federal Register data derived from the printing data base remains available for purchase from GPO in compressed diskette form as a GPO reproducible product under the authority of 44 U.S.C. chapter 17. One commenter inquired about implementation of the Government Printing Office Electronic Information Access Enhancement Act of 1993 (GPO Access), 44 U.S.C. 4101, and asked when the official online edition of the Federal Register would be available and how much it would cost to subscribe. The online Federal Register , including full text and graphics, began daily service on the GPO Access System's Wide Area Information Server (WAIS) via the Internet on June 8, 1994. Subscription information is contained on page II of the daily Federal Register or by telnet to wais.access.gpo.gov (log in as newuser (all lower case); no password is required). Dial-up users (SWAIS service) should use communications software and modem to obtain subscription information at 202&hyph;512&hyph;1661 (log in as wais (all lower case); no password is required). Complete price schedules, including discounts for multiple workstations, are available by calling GPO at 202&hyph;512&hyph;1530 or by fax at 202&hyph;512&hyph;1262. Prices are subject to continuous review and will be adjusted periodically based upon GPO's calculation of the incremental cost of dissemination. In addition to the price changes contained in this document, the Administrative Committee is updating §11.2 to reflect the availability of the online Federal Register . The Committee has granted authority to the Superintendent of Documents to price the online Federal Register for the first six months of operation to allow GPO to collect actual cost data. The Administrative Committee continues to welcome comments on Federal Register publications and prices. The Administrative Committee has determined that publication of a proposed rule is unnecessary. The Administrative Committee has authority under 44 U.S.C. 1506 to set the prices to be charged for Federal Register subscriptions and individual copies. To the extent possible, the Administrative Committee sets prices to recover only the actual cost of producing and distributing Federal Register publications. The revised prices are based on an in-depth cost study conducted for the Administrative Committee by the Government Printing Office. Because only actual costs were considered in setting the revised price schedule based on an in-depth cost study, the Administrative Committee has determined that there is good cause for promulgating this final rule without a prior notice of proposed rulemaking as permitted by 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). This regulatory action has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, under Executive Order 12866. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq .) does not apply to rate increases necessary to recover the costs to the Government of printing and distributing these publications.
