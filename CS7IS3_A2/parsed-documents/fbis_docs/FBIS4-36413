The political parties and organizations also stand ready to confront all the conspiracies that are targeting Yemen and to make sacrifices in the cause of its national rights -- unity, democracy, and freedom. A statement, issued by 24 political parties and organizations, said that what the rebels are doing today is a cheap attempt to forcibly slice off a part of the Republic of Yemen. The Yemeni masses, who on 22 May 1990, thronged to the streets to celebrate the inauguration of the Republic of Yemen and the realization of unity -- the dream of their fathers and forefathers -- and [word indistinct] self-determination. The masses, who said yes to the 15 May 1991 Constitution of the Republic and went to the polls in the first free and fair elections in the region -- even in the Arab world at large -- are the same masses who are now taking a determined stand against their rebellious and adventurous enemies. The remarks made by the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] on Yemen, added the statement, amount to a serious precedent that, rather than advance security and stability in the Peninsula, opens the road for many conflicts in each of the states of the region and creates the potential for negative and unwanted consequences. The statement paid tribute to the brother State of Qatar's lone voice at the ministerial session of the GCC with respect to the unity of the Republic of Yemen. All Arab states and the United Nations and the international community, as well as all political parties and mass organizations around the world, were urged by the statement to stand by the Republic of Yemen and its right to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity and to adopt a noninterventionist posture. The statement warned against the consequences of further interference in the Republic of Yemen's domestic affairs or taking the rebels' side. The statement was signed by the following parties and organizations: The General People's Congress; the Yemeni Reform Grouping; the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party; unionists in the Yemeni Socialist Party; the Nasirite Popular Unionist Organization; the Right Party; the Democratic Nasirite Party; the Nasirite Correction Party; the al-Ummah Party; the Popular Forces Union; the National Forces Union; the National Union of the Yemeni Unity Forces; the League of the Sons of Yemen Unity--the Legitimate Leadership; the League of the Sons of Yemen Party--the Executive Committee; the Liberation Front Party; the Yemeni Renaissance Movement; the National Democratic Front; the Popular Organization of the Liberation Front Party; the Arab Ba'th Organization; the Revolutionary Democratic Party; the Democratic September Organization; the Social Democratic Party; the Islamic Monotheism and Action Movement; and the Yemen Revolution Struggler Organization.
