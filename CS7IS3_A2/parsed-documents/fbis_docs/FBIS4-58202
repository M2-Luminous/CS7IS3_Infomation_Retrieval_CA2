He added that an absolute priority had been given to the improvement of the security situation and the protection of people and property. The prime minister further said that the relentless efforts of the security forces, the improvement of living conditions for the citizens, the fight against unemployment, the protection of the workers' purchasing power, and the strengthening of the local authorities together constitute activities aimed at guaranteeing a better security situation. On ways to bring the security situation under control, the prime minister believes that for the Algerians who are concerned about the country's future, who respect the constitution and the laws of the Republic, and who work for the nation's highest interest, dialogue seems natural and necessary, and allowing the expression of various viewpoints is a democratic act and is evidence of civilization, as the prime minister put it.
