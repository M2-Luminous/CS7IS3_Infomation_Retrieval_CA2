SADTU President Shepherd Mdladlana said in an interview that his organisation took the threat seriously because many white teachers in the townships were SADTU members. He said that if the Azanian Students Movement (Azasm) carried out it's threat there would be confrontation, because SADTU members would feel compelled to defend their colleagues.
