[Sliva] This year Russia will celebrate the 130th anniversary of the movement toward local self-government. In 1864, three years after the abolition of serfdom, the Zemstvo Reform was implemented, and subsequently the City Reform also began in Russia, that is to say, two branches of local self-government began to develop. Later came October 1917 and Soviet power. Only in 1989 did the train of local self-government, which, shall we say, had been shunted onto the "side track," begin to move further with friction. We traveled through a few "stations": the Union and Russian laws on local self-government, and edicts of the president on reform of local self-government which put an end to the operation of soviets. At present, local self-government in Russia is in a unique situation: In the Constitution the rights of the local organs of power have been worded and codified at the level of the most exacting world standards, whereas legislation in effect, edicts, various decisions, and executive acts have come to clearly contradict the Constitution. [Kozlov] What are these standards according to the Constitution? [Sliva] The power of communities of citizens of urban and rural localities is recognized to be natural. Local self-government exercises full rights in resolving issues of local significance. Ownership, use, and management of municipal property by local self-government are guaranteed. Local self-government should have its own budget; its right to municipal land is also proclaimed. The structure of the organs of local self-government is determined by the population itself. Residents themselves will resolve whether the mayor, town governor, or settlement administrator is to be or not to be. The Constitution says: Self-government shall be performed through elected organs. Representative organs are at issue, but heads of local self-government may also be elected. [Kozlov] In this case, what is the reason for the continuously developing conflicts between the executive authorities of components of the Federation and urban self-government? Let us look, for example, at the scandal in Nizhniy Novgorod. Mayor of Nizhniy Novgorod Dmitriy Bednyakov stated live on the air that oblast Governor Boris Nemtsov intends to find a way to have him removed from his position by an edict of the president. [Sliva] The Constitution says clearly that the organs of local self-government do not belong to the system of state power. They may not belong to the system, but state functions are assigned to them through dozens of laws, edicts, and executive acts. Conflicts frequently develop over local budgets. Continuous redistribution of financial funds is underway. Decisions are made at the level of components of the Federation, including those on finance, which the local organs are instructed to carry out immediately. This is not just unconstitutional; this results in social tensions locally. [Kozlov] And what if the local authorities do not intend to obey the dictate? [Sliva] There is the tiny town of Shlisselburg in Leningrad Oblast. Last Sunday mayoral elections were held there. There were six candidates. A worthy candidate, Svetlana Yurkova, who got 42 percent of the votes of those turning out for the elections, came in first in a most stubborn struggle. The nearest competitor trailed her by 20 points. What did the electoral commission do the following day? It did not qualify Yurkova for the next round! Their motives? They said that on the same day she was elected a deputy of the Legislative Assembly of Leningrad Oblast. This, allegedly, was incompatible. This decision was completely unlawful. Incidentally, in Shlisselburg 50 percent turned out for the elections, whereas in the oblast on the average--29 percent of voters. So, the struggle over local self-government is unfolding not only in Nizhniy Novgorod. Budgets have been taken away from many cities, including oblast seats. The head of an oblast or kray administration single-handedly deprives the population of a city of the status of local self-government. Local self-government has been liquidated in cities dating back 500 to 700 years! The Constitutional Court is not in operation; the procuracy organs are silent, while "telephone law" continues to apply just as it did.... Meanwhile, this should provide grounds for notorious court proceedings to resonate throughout Russia! All of this is happening notwithstanding the constitutional requirement to structure local self-government with historic traditions taken into account. Is this supposed to be a new historic tradition? Cities are demanding the natural rights that are constitutionally codified as theirs. Governors and heads of oblast and kray administrations treat the local organs of power far more sternly than the center treated components of the Federation at one time. There is a paraphrased saying: "The devil is not as horrible as his...little ones." Somehow, these "little ones," who are ensconced in lofty seats, have suddenly forgotten that local self-government is the root system of democracy. By restricting local self-government, the "little ones" are signing their own death warrant as politicians. If there is no local self-government, there will be no real democracy; moreover, there will be no real federalism and real rights of components of the Federation. Today they turn the screw on those who are under them; tomorrow, those who are above them will turn the screw on them. I repeat tirelessly that a dictatorship--regardless of its specific form--is a social system for beggars; self-government is one for affluent people owning property, those who are responsible and law-abiding. Only with such people may reform be advanced. Failing to understand this means failing to understand why reforms are actually being carried out in the country. After all, this is not for the sake of the personal power of some heads of oblast administrations or governors. [Kozlov] As you see it, what is to be done, after all, about mayors or, as the edict of the president calls them, "heads of local self-governments?" Are they to be elected or appointed along the vertical chain of command? [Sliva] The Constitution specifically disallows appointment practices. Although it is not fashionable at present, I will recall this: The fundamentals of democracy are violated by the bid of the center to appoint or confirm local authorities. Lenin said this in June 1917 at the First All-Russian Congress of Soviets. The correct answer to the simple problem of whether "to elect or not to elect the head of the local administration" is not to appoint. Incidentally, the Constitution does not allow for appointing governors, either. At present, we are at a transitional stage: There are both elected and appointed heads. In the event a vacancy occurs, the issue should either be resolved by way of a direct election or the head should be elected by the local representative organ. It is at the very least unwise to frustrate elections, to interfere with them, or to strive to appoint the person needed at any price. [Kozlov] Does the State Duma Committee for Issues of Local Self-Government have an opportunity to influence the situation at least somewhat? [Sliva] I believe it does. The president has instructed the government, the State-Law Directorate, and his Administration to bring all previously issued edicts, decisions of the government, and so on into compliance with the Constitution within one month. Instructions have been given. Let us hope that they will be carried out.
