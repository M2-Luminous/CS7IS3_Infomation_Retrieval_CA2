FR940620-2-00059 FR940620-2-00037 [Docket No. 40&hyph;8681 UMETCO Minerals License No. SUA&hyph;1358] Receipt of Petition for Director's Decision Under 10 CFR 2.206 Notice is hereby given that by Petition dated May 2, 1994, the Honorable Michael O. Leavitt, Governor of the State of Utah, and the Utah Legislature (Petitioners) requested that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission take action regarding Umetco Minerals, licensee of the White Mesa uranium mill facility near Blanding, Utah. Petitioners request that the NRC modify the Umetco Minerals license to reflect the licensee's original request for authority to receive 5,000 cubic yards of in-situ waste at the White Mesa facility, rather than the 10,000 cubic yards authorized by a license amendment granted by the NRC on August 2, 1993. Petitioners also request that the NRC confer with the State of Utah prior to future license amendments and receive the concurrence of the Utah Legislature and Governor before approving future license amendments involving mill tailing disposal in Utah. Petitioners assert as the basis for this request that the NRC has in effect created the equivalent of a commercial waste disposal facility for in-situ mining waste unlicensed by Utah, while ignoring Utah's waste policy and laws. The Petition has been referred to the Director of the Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards pursuant to 10 CFR ยง2.206. As provided by ยง2.206, appropriate action will be taken on the specific issues raised by the Petition in a reasonable time. Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 13th day of June 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Robert M. Bernero, Director, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards.
