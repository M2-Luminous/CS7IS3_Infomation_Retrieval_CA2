The total industrial output of the province in 1993 reached 9.3 billion yuan-worth, with a growth of about 28.9 percent over the previous year. The agricultural output value was 8.4 billion, an increase of 6.2 percent. Industrial enterprises around the whole province flourished last year. The automobile and motorcycle industries recorded production increases of 446.7 percent and 460.5 percent, respectively. Remarkable growth was also achieved in the beverage, pig iron and cement industries. Last year the provincial government earmarked 1.5 billion yuan for major industrial construction projects in order to lay a firm foundation for further development.
