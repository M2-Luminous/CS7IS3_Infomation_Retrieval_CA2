Greek ambassador set forth to the Albanian foreign minister a demarche of Greek Government on the accuses of the authorities of the Albanian Public Order Ministry, against six people of Greek minority, for illegal possession of arms and for illegal activity against Albanian territory, in collaboration with Greek secret service. In the Greek Government demarche, among others is said, that in such a situation is impossible to hold the foreseen meeting between the Albanian and Greek officials, and let alone the meeting between the two foreign ministers. Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi turned down the Greek demarche, considering it as a premature reaction and as an expression of good will lacking on the part of Greek Government, to develop a constructive and bilateral dialogue. He pointed out that the above-mentioned statement is not issued by the Ministry of Public Order, but by the Tirana Attorney's Office, and we are amazed by the fact that Greek Government confounds these two institutions, which in Albania are separate by law and independent from each other. Minister Serreqi pointed out that the Greek act or demarche is completely unacceptable and constitutes an interference to the interior affairs of the independent Albanian judges and attorneys offices, which will hold a just and no-one sided judgment, in conformity with the laws of the Albanian state. Between other things, Minister Serreqi pointed out to the Greek ambassador that the Albanian state doesn't base the treatment of its citizens on the ethnic belonging. He said that during the judgment, which will be opened, proofs will be presented, which will be treated by the independent judge's body with objectivity, professionalism, and full transparency. The Greek side has no right to prejudice the Albanian justice. The Albanian Government confirms its readiness to contribute even in the future to the solution of all the disagreements between the two countries through the bilateral dialogue. The Albanian Government will be opened to the commissions or missions of the CSCE, EU, and the Security Council or other international institutions which are interested to give their contribution to their solution. The spokesman expresses the doubt that the undevelopment of the meeting between the two foreign ministers, proposed by the Albanian side and accepted by the Greek side many days after the detention of the six accused people, the usage as a pretext for that by the Greek side of the announcement of the Tirana Attorney's Office, considering it as an announcement of the Ministry of Public Order, has more to do with the interior problems and the elections fevers in Greece and it is an expression of a constant nervousness of the Greek Government to the intensive attempts of the Albanian Government for a broader cooperation and stability in the region.
