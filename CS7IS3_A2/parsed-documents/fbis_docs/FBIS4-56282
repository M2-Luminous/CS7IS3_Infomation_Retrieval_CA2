The negotiations are clear. We are highlighting not only the positive aspects of the bill, but also the aspects of what I call a corrective tax system. This is not simply a matter of laws, but of a series of administrative measures, the objectives of which I could outline as follows: the administrative reform of institutions to facilitate tax collection, the reform and modernization of the state to collect taxes efficiently, and the utilization of the required authority to effectively penalize tax evaders. By doing this we are not only modernizing the state and finding solutions for situations -- such as locating necessary resources -- but also laying the groundwork for a functional tax system in this country. All sectors, Congress, and the taxpayers can see that this government is unquestionably taking corrective measures. In my presidential tours, I am allocating resources to those areas in which they need to be allocated, and I am not funneling them into the pockets of government officials. The president has demonstrated that he is not engaged in illegal activities or breaking the law to get rich. The resources -- 28 percent of them -- are being invested, and this is why I can rightly and with moral authority ask the various sectors to pay their taxes, because the salvation of Guatemala is everybody's duty, and because when one person cooperates, he is cooperating not with the president alone, but with the entire country. In this way, we can allocate resources to health care, education, road work, and security. I trust Congress will pass a bill that definitely will not hurt the people, because we are simply talking about a modification -- about only one additional tax -- and it only involves 4,000 enterprises out of the hundreds of thousands that exist, as well as 150 individuals. This tax does not affect any person or company whose income is less than 500,000 quetzals. We are asking those enterprises effected for their concerted effort, support, and cooperation at this time. The tax on these businesses will be in effect only once. Many businesses in this group have already given their approval, because they know that resources are necessary now to make social investments. I trust we will be able to clean up the country's finances in order to face economic and social problems, considering that most institutional and political problems have been resolved. [passage omitted] [Reporter] Mr. President, a deputy has charged that some funds have been transferred to the Presidency. [De Leon] I thank you for the opportunity to flatly deny this deputy's assertions. We have to begin by asking who is Juan Carlos Simons, and what has he done as a deputy? [passage omitted] The first thing I did when I became president was eliminate the Presidency's secret expenditures. In addition, a constitutional reform that is now in effect and that was passed on my initiative, constitutionally bans secret expenditures. From now on, no government organization will be able to get its hands on funds that serve to promote corruption. Regarding the deputy's charges that such expenditures exist and that funds have been transferred, this is completely false, and I demand that he support his charges with evidence. Otherwise, I will turn to proper legal measures. If there is one thing of which I am proud, it is my honesty and integrity. [passage omitted]
