The resolution proposed by the United States and cosponsored by Nicaragua and El Salvador was approved by 24 votes in favor, nine against and 20 abstentions. Juana Silveira, deputy director of the International Organizations Directorate of the Foreign Relations Ministry, stated that "the vote on the U.S. proposal reflects an ever increasing perception by underdeveloped nations with respect to this issue" Silveira believes the issue has been highly politicized by Washington, and the U.S. Government's political intention is to include it within the framework of the dispute it has had going with Cuba for years. According to official Cuban sources, the number of countries that "resisted pressure and refused to vote in favor of the resolution" increased this year in comparison to 1993. "In failing to obtain half plus one favorable votes of the nations gathered at the commission, and seeing its efforts to obtain massive support from Latin America thwarted, the White House saw its main hopes begin to vanish," Silveira pointed out. Likewise, she stated that this year, contrary to 1993, the proposal found less support among Asian, European, and Latin American nations. It was not supported by African countries either. Local radio stations reported that in addition to the United States, Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Costa Rica, Chile, Cyprus, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Mauritius, Holland, Pakistan, Poland, South Korea, Romania, Great Britain, Russia, and Uruguay all voted in favor of the resolution. China, Guinea-Bissau, Libia, Sudan, Syria, India, Indonesia, and Iran supported Cuba. On the other hand, the nations that abstained included Angola, Bangladesh, Barbados, Brazil, Cameroon, Colombia, Ivory Coast, Gabon, Kenya, Lesotho, Malaysia, Malawi, Mauritania, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Sri Lanka, Togo, Tunisia, and Venezuela.
