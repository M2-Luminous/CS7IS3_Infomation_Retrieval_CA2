Thus, a cease-fire which was due to be put into effect as of yesterday morning in Kabul was broken with exchange of scattered fire, and the opposition group's attacks against one another's positions. Dispatches received indicate that the set cease-fire was proposed by a council of Afghan Mojahedin commanders. The Coordination Council of the Islamic Revolution of Afghanistan on Wednesday January the 19th unilaterally announced that it will unconditionally accept the cease-fire conditions and will observe it as of 6 a.m. Thursday morning. In the meantime, reports coming in from Peshawar, Pakistan, indicate that a four man team consisting of the representatives of Hekmatyar's Islamic Party, Dostum's National Islamic Movement, Mojahedin's National Salvation Front, and the Wahdat Party have arrived in Peshawar to hold talks with the responsible Pakistani officials, the Afghan parties, as well as theologians and the chieftains. Based on this report, another group of Afghan commanders too, have decided to mediate between the opposition groups and supporters of Rabbani's presidency. In the meantime, the United Nations yesterday called on the warring sides in Kabul to create safe corridors for relief assistance to tens of thousands of Afghans who have fled to the nearby cities from Kabul. This is while the International Red Cross Committee has announced that clashes between hostile groups in Kabul has left 600 dead and 7600 injured. War in Kabul continues at a time when the leaders of the warring groups have not yet attained common principles on the division of power in a country, which has witnessed war for the past 15 years, and where military clashes in Kabul has led to the killing of a high number of innocent people in that country. Despite mediation by the neighboring countries the clashes still continue. Beyond doubt the bloody war which we have witnessed in Kabul over the past few days will not entail anything other than adding further dimensions to the ruins of 15 years of war. Heavy losses arising from the spread of war and bloodshed has damaged the brilliant record of 14 years of struggle by the Afghan people and will leave its negative and unpleasant effects in the history of Afghanistan. Evidently the new conditions which the present leaders are trying to obtain by making the use of military power will by no means solve the numerous problems faced by the Afghan people, for any solution to the problems, specially the political ones is legitimate only when the majority of Afghan people accept it. On this basis, the present war whose most immediate result is spread of ruins, loss of resources, and waste of human force will not only not solve any problems of the disastrous stricken Afghan people, but will add to their problems. At any rate, the meeting and talks between the four-man team and the Pakistani officials is a move aimed at putting an end to the clashes and establishment of peace in Afghanistan. And it will be efficient only if all the warring factions participate in it. Hence, if one of the warring sides does not take part in it the success of the measure has to be doubted. Evidently, although efforts aimed at paving the way for meeting among the leaders of the opposition groups in Afghanistan may face problems in terms of putting an end to the war in Kabul, beyond doubt, perseverance of mediatory countries along with flexibility which political groups have to show will picture a promising outlook for the agonized Afghan people. At any rate, we must draw the attention of the leaders of the warring sides to the reality that the experience of the past 21 months in Afghanistan has shown that war is not the main solution to political problems in Afghanistan. And that the continuation of clashes in Afghanistan will not entail any result other than increasingly the number of war victims who are mostly innocent people.
