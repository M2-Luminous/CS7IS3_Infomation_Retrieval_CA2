This is the view expressed by Yegor Gaydar, leader of the Russia's Choice parliamentary faction, in a conversation with correspondents today. Next Friday the State Duma will resume its sittings and the amnesty issue looks likely to be one of the items on the agenda. "We are very doubtful about the provisions of the draft which reduce punishments for serious criminal offenses," Gaydar said.
