Not naming them causes confusion. Defining them is important so that we know the countries that do not want stability for us. [Al-Alfi] We have some good information about the financing and training places and the planners and their locations. But there is an advantage in not revealing all the facts about this issue, because there are continuing efforts and intense contacts under way with numerous countries to cooperate with us. Indeed, several fugitive terrorists have been arrested and others have been handed over. I hope you will not ask for the names of these countries and any figures right now, so that we will leave them in the dark. [Tawfiq] But the minister told a news conference he would name these countries. [Al-Alfi] Yes, but I said I would do that at the proper time. When I announce a specific location and say we brought in someone from there, his colleagues will go elsewhere or flee the country and thus we will have done them a service by warning them. The same thing applies to terrorist operations. Sometimes we ask that news of such operations is not published and journalists start asking in whose interests is this secrecy. I tell them: Yes, there is an advantage, that of the investigation. There are two examples: First, when we arrested the first suspect and banned the publication [of news] on the attempt to kill the prime minister. Then, we arrested nine suspects in subsequent measures. The second example was the Hulwan movie theater incident. After news was published of two arrests, the others escaped after reading the newspapers. We had pinpointed their locations but found nothing except that day's newspapers. [Tawfiq] Are the people required to live with terrorism for years to come? When will we eliminate this phenomenon that is alien to our society? [Al-Alfi] I am not required to coexist with terrorism and it must be eliminated. Egypt has always been a safe country, where people are extremely friendly and loving and religion is tolerant. Egypt is home to al- Azhar and Islam is a religion that follows a middle course; it knows no extremism and does not advocate violence. All these criminal incidents are the ideas of renegades with particular beliefs who live in some Islamic and Arab countries. But the Koran, the main source of our legislation, contains straightforward verses renouncing terrorism, violence, and killing. The entire nation now knows that those who say some people are the infidel and sanction their killing and confiscation of their property are fakes. They are not Muslims. They even commit crimes against Islam and against the country. It is not only Egypt that faces terrorism, because it is apparent that there is a plot to strike at every Arab and Islamic country in the name of Islam. Training in implementing this plot takes place abroad, where they assemble personnel of every nationality in one place. The methods of arming, training, and financing are the same. I saw pictures of incidents carried out by terrorists abroad and found them compatible with what happens in Egypt. The bombs have the same materials; they put nails and ball bearings in the bombs and use the same detonator. Weapons here and abroad are used in the same way and the training is the same. Thus, the target is every Arab and Islamic country. Everyone has begun to realize this. We will eradicate terrorism because we are right and the people support us. The end of terrorism is certain. If we had wanted to eliminate terrorism fast, we could have done so by resorting to extraordinary measures. But we are confronting terrorism with law and democracy, not resorting to extraordinary measures. In addition to aborting the plots that were prepared during the new year, Christmas, and police day celebrations, we aborted other plots, arrested the plotters, and seized documents containing the names of some personalities. But I will not name names. All these are now cases, which will be referred to the court. The trials will be public. But secrecy will be maintained during the interrogation period. [Tawfiq] Have antiterrorism steps been developed? [Al-Alfi] Most important for us, the security men, is that we adopt a scientific course and sound planning and train on the highest level, in addition to acquiring weapons. The police department has been supplied with the most modern weapons. Police missions travel abroad. Technicians and experts arrive in Egypt to train us. The whole department has undergone such training. I want to say something: Our action is no longer a tit-for-tat response. The initiative now is in the hands of the police. This has produced better results. We are searching for the terrorists' hideouts. We have arrested many terrorists and seized their equipment, explosives, and weapons. Thus, we have foiled several incidents before they took place. If the terrorists are targeting policemen to get at the morale of the entire police department, I tell them: Every incident against a policeman, security man, or any citizen increases our determination to eliminate these terrorists. It also deepens our faith because we uphold justice and defend religion and the homeland. The initiative is in our hands and will remain so, despite the sacrifices. [Tawfiq] You have referred 20 officers to the inspection department for investigation for mistreating citizens. You have confirmed that you are following up these investigations personally. Is this a standard policy? How can a complainant reach the minister personally? [Al-Alfi] My office is open to everyone. There are instructions to the police commanders and the ministry's officials to open their offices to all citizens. No one is lax. We accept no insult against citizens. If there have been excesses, they are isolated incidents; they are not part of a policy toward citizens. There is periodic, sudden, and continuous inspection of sections, centers, and services departments, such as the traffic department, the passport department, the work permits department, and the civil status department. Soon there will be a public relations officer in every section, center, and department. The public relations officer will receive the citizen, look into his problem, and advise him what to do. There are also instructions that officers should be present in the service departments day and night. You may remember a complaint by a tourism college graduate, which was published in the newspaper AKHBAR AL-HAWADITH. I said at the time that the complainant should come to my office immediately. We receive complaints but we also seek to identify the shortcomings. I ask people outside the police department to submit fictitious complaints without identifying themselves. For instance, they may say their home has been burgled or they have been attacked. They see how the duty officer reacts and the way he treats the complaint. Afterward, the complainant reveals his identity, investigates him, and decides on the punishment. There are many officers who behave positively. Some behave negatively. But more officers behave positively and are rewarded. Those who behave negatively are punished while those who behave positively are rewarded. [Tawfiq] Terrorist incidents take place in broad daylight in crowded places in Upper Egypt's governorates. How do you explain the people's failure to resist the terrorists? Is this due to the negative attitude of the Upper Egypt resident to some customs and traditions that prevent him from intervening or to the police's bad treatment of citizens? [Al-Alfi] One thing manifested in these crimes is the custom of taking revenge. This custom still exists. In some cities and villages in Upper Egypt, the people take their own revenge and do not surrender the criminal to the authorities. They do not even receive condolences for their own dead until they have taken revenge. Some families teach their children to take revenge as soon as they are old enough to use firearms. The mountains on both sides of the valley in Upper Egypt also make it easy for criminals and accused people to escape. I can say the police do not get involved in ill treatment. But there is no doubt that like other police forces, there are violations. [Tawfiq] Why, when owners of licensed weapons apply to renew their licenses, are weapons being withdrawn? This is happening more and more. And why have stringent measures been adopted when it comes to granting new licenses? [Al-Alfi] It is not an issue of making things easier or more difficult. The firearms law is clear. There must be justifications and reasons, as stipulated by law, for granting a firearms license. What is happening is that some people are carrying weapons without any legal justification. But when there is a justification, the license is issued immediately. Many incidents happened in Upper Egypt in front of people carrying licensed weapons; they did not attempt to intervene. The issue here does not relate to licensed or unlicensed weapons, but to customs and traditions. In the past few months we seized about 18,000 unlicensed weapons. We also discovered many weapons manufacturing shops and stores illegally trading in weapons. These stores' licenses have been canceled and their owners brought to trial. [Tawfiq] Has the attempt to combat terrorism overshadowed the attempt to combat corruption, deviation, and narcotics? [Al-Alfi] Our task is to implement the law and prevent crime. No one is above the law. Corruption, bribery, fraud, damage to public property, narcotics trafficking, and the exploitation of power must be checked. We investigate every report or every piece of information about such crime and the perpetrators are arrested and brought to trial. This is what is happening and has been happening recently. [Tawfiq] Why were violations in Madinat al-Nasr only revealed 10 years after they were committed? [Al-Alfi] The government tackles corruption and implements the law. The government--the Interior Ministry and the state's administrative control departments--uncovered the violations in Madinat al-Nasr. We investigate any information we receive or any report submitted to us to uncover the truth. In the Madinat al-Nasr case, the government control departments uncovered the violations, on which no reports were submitted. The government control departments cannot turn a blind eye to violation. Our position is known. Repentant terrorist 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi, whose story was published by AKHBAR AL-HAWADITH, deserves every honor. He is indeed a brave man and bold and I wish everyone was like him. He deserved every honor bestowed upon him. AKHBAR AL-YAWM editor Sabir Shawkat also did a courageous job. It was a bold, great step by AKHBAR AL- HAWADITH. [Tawfiq] Do you have anything else to say? [Al-Alfi] No. Thank you.
