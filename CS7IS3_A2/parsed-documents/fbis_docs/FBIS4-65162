A poll taken by ICM [International Communications and Marketing Research] for the Guardian shows 27 percent intend to vote Conservative in the Euro-elections against 44 percent for Labour and 24 percent for the Liberal Democrats -- a result that could cost the Conservatives half their 32 seats. John Major's woes were compounded last night as pressure grew for the resignation of one of his ministers, Nicholas Scott, who was forced to make a humiliating apology to MPs after admitting he had misled the Commons. In a personal statement, Mr Scott, minister for the disabled, said he was wrong to deny that his department was not involved in attempts to wreck a bill on disabled rights. In next month's European election, Conservative-held seats would fall to 16, with the party holding only one seat outside its traditional heartland in the South-east, according to a projection made from the poll by John Curtice of Strathclyde University. Labour would emerge as the clear winner with 57 of the 87 seats, but the Liberal Democrats would make the most dramatic gains, taking almost the entire West Country and winning nine seats, their first in the European Parliament. The poll was taken in the wake of the local elections on Friday and Saturday and asked a sample of 1,483 people whether, given the results, Mr Major should continue as Prime Minister. Fifty-three percent said he should resign and 33 percent said he should continue. But what will be undoubtedly more worrying for Mr Major is that support for his resignation goes far beyond Labour and Liberal Democrat voters with 24 percent of Conservative voters saying he should resign. Conservatives are usually the most loyal to their party leader, but Mr Major now has the support of only two thirds of Tory voters, and they represent little more than a quarter of the electorate, hardly a strong position for a Prime Minister going into an election campaign. Even if the Conservatives win the same vote as in the local elections, they are likely to have far less to show for it because of the way in which European elections work. When a party does well, it sweeps the board. When it does badly, it can quickly be wiped off the map. The large size of the constituencies coupled with the British first-past-the-post voting system -- which Mr Major insisted on retaining against strong pressure from the European Parliament -- together with the concentration of Liberal Democrat support, combine to spell disaster for the Conservatives. It has always been known that the Conservatives become particularly vulnerable if their vote falls below 30 percent in an election, but it has never happened in the party's history at local or general elections until last Thursday. Below this level the even spread of Conservative support around the country turns from an advantage to a disadvantage. In the last three European elections the Liberals have won no seats and have blamed the first-past-the-post system, the only nonproportional system used anywhere in the European elections. Ironically the system could turn to their advantage in this election. If the Conservative vote falls during the campaign, they could rapidly find themselves with a risible number of seats. It seems unlikely that John Major could survive that. Labour's support in the poll -- 44 percent -- is four points down from their rating in April. Now research by the Guardian's pollsters, ICM, suggests that a more realistic Labour lead in a general election may be as low as 10 points.
