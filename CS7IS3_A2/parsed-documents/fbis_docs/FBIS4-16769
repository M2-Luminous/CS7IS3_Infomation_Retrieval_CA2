Results of a Sociological Poll"] [Text] Despite the fact that it is almost two years until the next presidential election, a number of politicians have already started to prepare energetically for it. Some are creating new parties, like Ye. Gaydar; others are developing the infrastructure of already existing parties and movements at regional level, like S. Shakhray and A. Rutskoy's team; still others, like Yu. Skokov, are strengthening influential all-Russian multisectoral associations, for example the Federation of Commodity Producers, or are actively gathering money, like Zhirinovskiy. All this varied activity, aimed at creating positions to give them a spurt at the imminent presidential election, is filing past B. Yeltsin's vigilant eye, as he himself put it, or else the eye of the numerous Russian special services now subordinate personally to the president. However, they are scarcely capable of presenting an objective picture of the real influence of potential candidates for Russian president in various social groups today, since the leaders of the special services want to please their Kremlin master too much. Some food for thought is provided by a poll, conducted in March by the "Vox Populi" service, of the eight most important groups in the Russian elite: the State Duma deputies, leaders of Russian ministries and departments, leaders of political parties, directors, captains of business, top officers in the Armed Forces, mass media editors, and also eminent figures in science and culture -- 50 people per group. When they were asked: "Which of the famous politicians is now more capable than the others of leading Russia out of the crisis?" -- the following curious data was obtained. B. Yeltsin still occupies first place (21 percent), and second place is occupied by G. Yavlinskiy (13 percent). Over a period of seven months, starting with August of last year, when G. Yavlinskiy was the undoubted leader with 28 percent (B. Yeltsin only had 17 percent), his rating has been falling inexorably. This is evidently connected with his lack -- as a politician, and now State Duma deputy -- of any specific results which the people could evaluate in a positive fashion. Society has grown tired of fruitless declarations, statements, and promises. Third place, according to the Russian establishment, is occupied by Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin (10 percent). At the same time, during the past three months, since the pseudo-reformers Ye. Gaydar and B. Fedorov left the government, assessments of its activity have been fairly stable. Yu. Skokov and Ye. Gaydar, who share fourth place, (9 percent each) are breathing down the premier's neck. However, the trends in the change of influence of these famous politicians on the people who shape Russian public opinion are diametrically opposed. Since November of last year, when Ye. Gaydar (20 percent) was even ahead of B. Yeltsin (19 percent), his rating has been falling constantly, and indeed particularly sharply since his resignation from the post of first vice premier. Evidently this rapid fall in Ye. Gaydar's personal popularity will not increase the chances of success of the party he created under the trite name of "Russia's Choice," which, in the eyes of the majority of the electorate, is clearly associated with the defeat of the democrats at the December elections. Yu. Skokov, chairman of the Russian Federation of Commodity Producers, who does not occupy any official state posts and does not make showy statements, has conversely been steadily gaining points during the six months. This can primarily be attributed to his increasing practical work with leaders of enterprises, labor collectives, trade unions, and entrepreneurs, aimed at alleviating the consequences of the rampant fall in production and restraining the growth in unemployment. Among the top echelons of our society, V. Zhirinovskiy (3 percent) and S. Shakhray (2 percent) received low assessments as figures able to lead the country out of the crisis. As can be seen, Vladimir Volfovich's great popularity among the people does not affect the cold reaction toward him in the top echelon of our society. It is interesting that S. Shakhray, who literally never comes off the television screens and the pages of newspapers and periodicals, is experiencing a disastrous fall in influence in the eyes of the people who shape our public opinion and who know the people's real worth. In August 1993, he received 13 percent, in October only 4 percent, and in December only 3 percent. Of course, any public opinion polls are of an approximate and subjective nature. People in the top strata of society are more aware of the genuine professional qualities of people with whom they often come into contact. But at the same time, those of them who have a vested interest in the personal [favorable] disposition toward themselves of specific statesmen and public figures and above all the president and the prime minister, who ensure their interests, can scarcely be objective. The majority of the population is on the one hand strongly subjected to the influence of targeted propaganda by the mass media, and is inclined to believe in illusions connected with simple solutions to complex problems which demagogues promise. But on the other hand, ordinary people, who have felt at first-hand the consequences of Ye. Gaydar's reforms (it is enough just to mention the mass plundering of savings in the savings banks), as well as of the state activity of politicians such as S. Shakhray, are beginning to draw their own impartial conclusions. Of course the picture of public opinion obtained is clearly not a complete one. People who have been put forward by the left-wing (and possibly left-centrist) forces are not represented in it at all. Meanwhile their influence in society is very noticeable and it may grow in the future.
