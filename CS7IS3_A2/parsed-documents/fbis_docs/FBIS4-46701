A number of urgent economic issues were examined at the session. In his presentation, Deputy Minister of Economics Viktor Kalnik provided information on the course of implementation of the Edict of the President of Ukraine "On Measures To Restrain the Rate of Price Growth." It was noted that thanks to implementation of the edict, which put limits on profitmaking levels in production and on markups in trade turnover, a certain degree of success was achieved in limiting the rate of growth of prices and, accordingly, the rate of inflation. Whereas the average monthly increase in wholesale prices in industry last year was above 146 percent, in January of this year this index was 123 percent, in February--116 percent, and in March--106.9 percent. The rate of inflation in January was 19 percent, in February--12.6 percent, and in March--5.7 percent. For the first time in the past two years, price projections were confirmed providing a basis for planning and budgeting. These indices would have been much better if the sectors had standard regulations for calculating the producer cost of output. Through the fault of a number of ministries and departments, such regulations were not developed. Insufficient supervision on their part, and in some cases their connivance with violators, constitutes the main reason for excessive overstatement of producer cost of production output and wholesale factory prices. Inspections conducted during the first quarter uncovered violations of existing price formation procedure in 58 percent of over 9,000 entrepreneurial activity entities inspected. Economic penalties were exacted from the violators amounting to over 260 billion karbovantsy. The Presidium of the Cabinet of Ministers determined specific measures for intensifying supervision and responsibility with respect to compliance with state price policies. Ways to perfect the price formation mechanism were also specified. Minister of Agriculture and Foodstuffs Yuriy Karasyk reported on the status of formation and placement of state contracts and state orders for agricultural production output, raw materials, and foodstuffs in 1994. The underlying causes of complications in effecting timely settlements with agricultural producers were comprehensively analyzed. A number of measures were specified with respect to providing farms the resources for producing output sold to the state. The Presidium of the Cabinet of Ministers also examined issues related to the manufacture of automated cash registers and their introduction at trade enterprises, public kitchens, and everyday facilities. These devices significantly improve the supervision exercised over trade turnover and, accordingly--over revenue going to the budget. More than 320,000 units are presently required. But their rate of production at enterprises of the Ministry of the Machine Building Industry still does not conform to the standard prescribed by governmental decree. Additionally, automated cash registers are slow to be introduced in the trade sector. The Presidium of the Cabinet of Ministers therefore adopted a resolution providing for significantly closer cooperation between the concerned parties in this question.
