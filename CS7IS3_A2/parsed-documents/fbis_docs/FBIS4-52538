During his trips, he induced his retinue to express their candid impressions of North Korea and later he wrote a book about the real situation in North Korea on the basis of these impressions. The book is titled "Dreary Maze: Real Picture of North Korea" In this book Sekigawa describes the Pyongyang-Wonsan Expressway on which he travelled for the first time as follows: "The highway to Wonsan can hardly be called an expressway. It looked something like thick concrete plates randomly laid out. It seemed that not enough gravel was laid on the road bed. It was impossible to drive at a high speed because the car rattled at each seam in the road." However, we are more interested in the following description. "As is in Pyongyang, we did not see even a single gas station all the way to Wonsan. We traveled both ways in the afternoon on weekdays, but the volume of traffic was very light. There was not much traffic in Pyongyang, but even less on the way to Wonsan. I counted the number of cars driving in the opposite lane, and the number was about 300 for a time period of slightly over three hours. On the way back the number was nearly double, but most of the vehicles were spotted near Pyongyang." Sekigawa noted that there were very few loaded trucks. According to him, "On our way back to Pyongyang from Wonsan, we saw 10 or more trucks loaded with lumber, and there were only a small number of trucks also. A truck with its cargo compartment covered passed by on the opposite lane. There was no way of knowing whether the truck was loaded or not. The rest of the trucks were either empty or carried passengers. Not a single long-distance bus was seen." Sekigawa says the situation was much the same when he visited North Korea in 1991, four years after his first visit in 1987. He says that during his last visit he noticed that the volume of traffic on the Wonsan-Pyongyang expressway (a simple paved highway for motor vehicles in his words) had rather decreased. He could see about 30 vehicles passing in the opposite lane during a drive of slightly less than three hours over a 200 kilometer distance. About half of them were empty trucks, and some of the trucks carried passengers. Sekigawa says he could not spot even a single long-distance van, and the sights outside viewed from his car were very much the same as he had seen during his first trip. He saw many vehicles standing in the countryside--apparently broken down. Oxen were tilling the fields; only a few tractors were at work in the paddies; and on the street some tractors were carrying passengers in trailers. From the scanty movement of freight, he could tell that very few products made on the east coast were shipped to the west coast. South Korean journalists who visited Pyongyang to cover the International Parliamentary Union [IPU] general meeting in 1991 also reported seeing very few cargo-carrying trucks during the 600-kilometer round trip on the Pyongyang-Wonsan-Kaesong-Mt. Kumgang route, particularly on the Pyongyang-Wonsan expressway. Other travelers visiting North Korea have given similar impressions of the expressways in North Korea. Each time I come across these travel accounts about North Korea, I always wonder how the volume of goods transported could be so little. This skepticism intensifies all the more when I compare it with the scale of North Korea's national income. As of 1991, North Korea's per capita national income, computed in the same way we compute our GNP, is estimated at $1,038, and its per worker GNP at $2,271. The $1,038 per capita income is equivalent to South Korea's 1977 per capita income. It is problematical to compare the scales of the economies of the North and South in terms of the size of the national income or fiscal expenditure. North Korea's 1991 fiscal scale ($17.2 billion) corresponds to somewhere between the comparable figures of South Korea's 1980 and 1981 budgets. However, there is too large a gap between the figures cited above and the volume of goods transported in North Korea actually observed by travelers. North Korea's land transportation system gives more weight to freight transportation than to passenger transportation. The North Korean authorities explain that with the gradual increase in the transportation of raw materials and supplies needed in economic development, the importance of passenger transportation has decreased. They also say that given its weak foreign exchange position, North Korea had no alternative but to expand and develop railway transportation, powered by coal and electricity, so that it could conserve oil, the supply of which depends wholly on imports. Still, the volume of goods transported in North Korea that could be inferred on the basis of actual observations by travelers is way too small compared with the scale of the North Korean economy as projected by its per capita national income. This raises doubts as to the validity of the estimated per capita national income of North Korea. [passage omitted] Even where most materials are transported by rail as in North Korea, when railway transportation is inadequate, naturally road transportation is bound to come into play to compensate. This is the basic universal economic principle of seeking efficiency that applies all economic systems alike. North Korea's expressway system crosses the country coast to coast connecting Nampo and Wonsan on the one hand, and on the other runs from north to south linking Huichon and Kaesong, with Pyongyang as its center. North Korea had its own reason for connecting these cities by expressways: the purpose was to connect these industrial areas and ports to Pyongyang. With Pyongyang as its axis, the expressway system connects Pyongyang to Nampo Port to the west; Wonsan Port to the east, behind which lie the Hamhung and Hungnam metallurgical and chemical industrial areas; and Huichon, the center of the precision machine and automobile industries, to the north. The recently completed Kaesong-Pyongyang expressway in the northern part is playing the role of a passage to Pyongyang from South Korea. In other words, the North Korean expressways connect the areas that need to be developed as an essential requirement and on a priority basis in order to link different industrial centers. Entry to modern society means entry to an automobile-based society. As industry develops, automotive transportation of goods and personnel becomes all the more important. North Korea's expressways could prove as efficient as railways as a means of transportation. But that did not happen, and this may indirectly prove that there is a big gap between the actual scale of the North Korean economy and our estimate of it.
