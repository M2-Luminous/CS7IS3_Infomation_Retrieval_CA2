ACTION: Notice of Implementation. SUMMARY: This notice implements special local regulations for the Great American Music Festival Fireworks Display to be held in the Waterside area of the Elizabeth River between Norfolk and Portsmouth, VA. These special local regulations are needed to control vessel traffic within the immediate vicinity of Waterside due to the confined nature of the waterway and the expected vessel congestion during the event. The effect will be to restrict general navigation in the regulated area for the safety of participants and spectators. EFFECTIVE DATES: This regulation is effective from 8:30 p.m. to 11 p.m., July 3, 1994. If inclement weather causes the postponement of the July 3, 1994 fireworks display, the regulations will be in effect from 8:30 p.m. to 11 p.m., July 4, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Stephen L. Phillips, Chief, Boating Affairs Branch, Fifth Coast Guard District, 431 Crawford Street, Portsmouth, Virginia 23705 (804) 398&hyph;6204, or Commander, Coast Guard Group Hampton Roads (804) 483&hyph;8559. Drafting Information: The drafters of this notice are QM2 Gregory C. Garrison, project officer, Boating Affairs Branch, Boating Safety Division, Fifth Coast Guard District, and LT Monica L. Lombardi, project attorney, Fifth Coast Guard District Legal Staff. Discussion of Regulation: Norfolk Festevents, Ltd. has submitted an application to hold the Great American Music Festival July 3, 1994, in the Waterside area of the Elizabeth River. This area is covered by 33 CFR 100.501 and generally includes the waters of the Elizabeth River between Town Point Park, Norfolk, Virginia, the mouth of the Eastern Branch of the Elizabeth River, and Hospital Point, Portsmouth, Virginia. Since this event is of the type contemplated by this regulation and the safety of the participants and spectators viewing this event will be enhanced by the implementation of special local regulations for the Elizabeth River, 33 CFR 100.501 will be in effect during the Great American Music Festival. The waterway will be closed during the fireworks displays. Since the waterway will not be closed for an extended period, commercial traffic should not be severely disrupted. In addition to regulating the area for the safety of life and property, this notice of implementation also authorizes the Patrol Commander to regulate the operation of the Berkley drawbridge in accordance with 33 CFR 117.1007, and authorizes spectators to anchor in the special anchorage areas described in 33 CFR 110.72aa. Dated: April 20, 1994. W. T. Leland, Rear Admiral, U.S. Coast Guard, Commander, Fifth Coast Guard District. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;11711 Filed 5&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;14&hyph;M
