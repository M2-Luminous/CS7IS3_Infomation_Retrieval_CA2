N. Yeltsin, on Questions of Local Self-Government"] [Text] Esteemed Boris Nikolayevich! In the last 3-4 months, the heads of administrations of such major Russian cities as Omsk, Saratov, Vladivostok, and Nizhniy Novgorod have been released from the posts they occupied. The circumstances of the dismissal were varied, but everywhere they took place under pressure of the governors of the oblasts. The standard set of accusations was made against almost every one: attacks on the oblast administration, the collapse of Russian statehood, ties with opponents of the reforms, corruption, repeated flagrant violations of work duties, and so forth. The same situation is now taking shape in a number of other cities. We are very worried that honest, decent people who are truly supporting the interests of their cities and vigorously defending the rights of local self-government established by the Constitution of Russia and guaranteed by your edicts are leaving the job. Objective examination of the work of the heads of administrations of the cities did not precede the dismissals and they did not receive written explanations, and the grounds for removal were not considered by any commissions, while some were refused the right to meet personally with the president of Russia, which your edicts stipulate directly. Today most of the governors are doing everything possible to subjugate local self-government to themselves, which directly contradicts Article 12 and Chapter 8 of the Constitution of Russia. Those who oppose this are as a result either dismissed or they resign themselves. One gets the impression that local self-government is a fiction and the federal authorities do not need it, although we are certain that local self-government is objectively an ally of the president of Russia and the central authorities in the political and economic reform of our country and in the defense of public interests. We propose the following to you: 1. Put local self-government under your protection and supervision. 2. Meet with representatives of unions and associations of the cities of Russia. 3. Speed up the development of normative enactments to demarcate the jurisdictions of the organs of state power of the subjects of the Federation and local self-government. 4. When heads of administrations are released from their posts, set elections of the heads of local self-government on an alternative basis. 5. At the petition of heads of administrations who have been released from their posts, conduct reviews and publish their results. Accepted at the meeting of the Union of Cities of the Northwest of Russia on 9 April 1994, city of Kirov.
