The nine-man group, which Friday travelled the short journey to Pale, east of Sarajevo, for talks with Serb leaders later returned for a further meeting with Bosnia's Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic, before flying on to Zagreb. [passage omitted] In a statement after the group's departure, Izetbegovic said his discussions with the group had provided no results. He said he had set no conditions for restarting negotiations apart from full Serb compliance with the NATO ultimatum and ceasefire, but said he was not satisfied with the situation in Gorazde. There were Serb troops deployed in part of the three-kilometre (two-mile) exclusion zone dressed as police, and artillery remaining in the outer exclusion zone of 20 kilometres (12.5 miles). He added that since the Bosnian Government had received no guarantee from the international community, the army must continue to defend "free" territory. [passage omitted]
