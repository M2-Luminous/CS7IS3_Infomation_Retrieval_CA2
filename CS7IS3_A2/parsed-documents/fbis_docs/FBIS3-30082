Around 1053 [0153 GMT] today, the armed rascals of the South Korean puppet army, who were entrenched in Taeyongpyong Island, fired a 155 mm gun against Changje Island at our side on the sea off (Pokpo) in Kangnyong County, South Hwanghae Province. Because of this, fishermen of our side, who were catching fish in the area, were gravely threatened. Such action by the South Korean puppets has not escalated into an armed conflict between the two sides. This is totally due to our People's Army soldiers' high sense of patience and self-control. The dangerous military provocation by the South Korean puppets -- which was committed in broad daylight -- is a deliberate provocation to lead the Korean peninsula to confrontation and war. We regard such provocation by the South Korean puppets as even more grave because they committed it at the same time of their persistent strategy and war maneuvers in order to crush [apsal] our Republic, the socialist fortress, in collusion with outside forces under the pretext of our non-existent nuclear issue. With a high sense of the revolutionary alertness, our people and the People's Army soldiers are keenly watching out the new war provocations by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets. Because of the U.S. imperialists' and the South Korean puppets' continuous new war provocations, a grave touch-and-go situation has been created on the Korean peninsula. Therefore, they must clearly see it and must not act recklessly. Despite our repeated warnings, if the South Korean puppets continue to embark upon the road of confrontation and war, warmongers cannot avoid the stern punishment.
