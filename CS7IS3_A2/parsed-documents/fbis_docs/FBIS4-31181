Mehmed Hodja was elected chairman, and National Assembly member Ismail Ismail and Sabri Hyusein, lawyer from Plovdiv, were elected deputy chairmen. Statements made at the meeting voiced dissatisfaction with the DPS and its leaders. The new formation will seek an alliance with all non-communist forces and will reject any cooperation with the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP]. The new party categorically dissociates itself from the manifestations of nationalism and separatism, reads the program that was adopted. The charter stresses that any member disseminating nationalist ideas will be ousted from the party. The new party will struggle against the practice according to which minority members only become members of parties formed on an ethnic foundation. The party considers itself to be on the right side of the political spectrum and supports the mixed election system. The first national forum will take place by the end of the year. Informed sources think that several local DPS branches will participate. [DPS spokesman] Yunal Lyutfi described the new party as a new attempt to split the DPS and predicted that it will have the same fate as Adem Kenan's organization.
