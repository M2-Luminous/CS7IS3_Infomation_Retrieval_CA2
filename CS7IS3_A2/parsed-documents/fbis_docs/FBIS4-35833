Muslim brothers and sisters all over the world, a quick glance at the situation of the Islamic countries, the governments dominating them, international relations, and the big powers' treatment of the Muslims, particularly the Third World countries, raises a question. The question is: Has this situation been caused by Islam and the divine system and teachings or because of Muslims' conduct, most of which is not acceptable to Islam? The propaganda of Islam's enemies openly attributes this to Islam and says that Islam is the cause of the backwardness and degradation at intellectual, cultural, and industrial levels of these countries that have been controlled by foreigners. But examining the Islamic intellectual resources and practical conduct of the noble Prophet and the infallible imams, salutations be upon them, clearly indicates that this is propaganda from the arrogant powers' agents who have infiltrated and affected the Muslims' thinking. It has even infiltrated and affected leaders and clergymen who believed that Islam, like Christianity, has no effect on worldly affairs, politics, and social life and that Muslims should turn to worship and not interfere with political and social issues. This is what has created a favorable atmosphere for the foreigners' hegemony. Islam is the religion of both this world and the world hereafter, the religion of politics and administration, the religion of independence and freedom far from the foreigners' domination. Turning the reigns of power over to infidels, polytheists, and foreigners is a great sin. We believe that Muslims should know Islam well and realize its truth. Had the Muslim countries realized the true Islam, Islam would have dominated the government and (?judiciary) and rulers would have been compelled to keep in line with Islam and Muslims or relinquish power. Clashes being seen between governments and peoples in some Islamic countries form a picture of this phenomenon. Had this been the case, Muslims would have realized that the rulers' behavior in these countries was not Islamic and would have naturally demanded that Islamic laws be respected. The religion is one of politics, prudence, progress, independence, and freedom, not a religion of shackles, servility, and surrender to foreigners' hegemony. Muslim brothers and sisters, this issue has proved that Islam passed the test of viability in the days of early Islam. Today our country has managed to rid itself of the foreigners' domination and establish an Islamic government amid Islam's laws under the leadership of the founder of the Islamic Republic in Iran, the late Imam Khomeyni. Such a success cannot be achieved without the awareness of the public. We should explain the spirit of Islam more than before to restore to Islam its former strength in the hope that Islam and Muslims will achieve their desired strength and greatness so that Islamic rule will dominate the Muslims, God willing. I ask God's forgiveness for you and myself.
