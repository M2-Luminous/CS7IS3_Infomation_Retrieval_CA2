FR941206-2-00004 FR941206-2-00003 [Docket Number 941123&hyph;4323] Transportation Annual Survey AGENCY: Bureau of the Census, Commerce. ACTION: Notice of Consideration. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that the Bureau of the Census is considering a proposal to conduct the 1994 Transportation Annual Survey under the authority of Title 13, United States Code, Sections 131, 182, 224, and 225. On the basis of information and recommendations received by the Bureau of the Census, the data have significant application to the needs of the public and industry and are not available from nongovernmental sources. We will provide national estimates of the dollar volume of revenue and expenses for the for-hire trucking and public warehousing industries, as well as inventories of revenue-generating equipment for the trucking industry. Effective with the 1994 survey, the Census Bureau proposes changes to the trucking questionnaires. We propose to adopt a more descriptive name for this survey and add questions that will allow publication of data on miles traveled, weight of shipments, and revenue from transborder shipments. DATES: Any suggestions or recommendations concerning the proposed survey should be submitted in writing by January 5, 1995. ADDRESSES: Director, Bureau of the Census, Washington, D.C. 20233. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thomas E. Zabelsky, Chief, Current Services Branch, Services Division, on (301) 763&hyph;5528. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Census Bureau is authorized to conduct surveys necessary to furnish current data on subjects covered by the major censuses authorized by Title 13 of the United States Code. This survey will provide continuing and timely national statistical data on the for-hire trucking and public warehousing industries for the period between the economic censuses. The next economic census is in 1997. The data collected in this survey will be within the general scope, type, and character of those inquiries covered in the economic censuses. Preliminary information and recommendations received by the Bureau of the Census indicate that the data have significant application to the informational needs of government agencies, the public, and the transportation industries. Furthermore, these data are not publicly available from other sources on a continuing basis. The Bureau of the Census needs reports only from a limited sample of trucking and warehousing firms in the United States. The probability of a firm's selection is based on revenue size (estimated from payroll). The sample will provide, with measurable reliability, statistics on the aforementioned industries. We will mail report forms to the firms covered by this survey and require their submission within thirty days after receipt. This survey has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for approval in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, Public Law 96&hyph;511, as amended. Copies of the proposed forms are made available on request to the Director, Bureau of the Census, Washington, D.C. 20233. Dated: November 28, 1984. Martha Farnsworth Riche, Director, Bureau of the Census. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29943 Filed 12&hyph;5&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;07&hyph;P
