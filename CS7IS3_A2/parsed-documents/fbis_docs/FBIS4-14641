He said that at least five highly radioactive articles made of metal were sold to the West from Estonia. He explained how the command of the [place-name indistinct] harbor in Tallinn sold two air-cushion vessels for scrap whose engine components emitted 200 roentgens per hour of radioactivity. Specialists consider a person's unprotected exposure to such a source of radioactivity for three hours to be lethal. After the vessels were scrapped, the metal was sold to Finland. However, several turbine sections containing radioactive cobalt disappeared without a trace. According to the statement made by Viktor Mikhaylovich Krug, assistant to the chief military procurator, the Russian Federation military procuracy possesses no facts or material concerning the sale by the Northern Group of Forces of components or other items containing radioactive isotopes. For its part, the Russian Federation military procuracy is prepared to begin the immediate investigation of such a situation.
