FR940222-0-00047 FR940222-0-00016 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 9 [FRL&hyph;4839&hyph;5] OMB Approval Numbers Under the Paperwork Reduction Act AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Technical amendment. SUMMARY: In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, this document displays the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control numbers issued under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) for Determining Conformity of General Federal Actions to State or Federal Implementation Plans. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule is effective on February 22, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Doug Grano (telephone 919/541&hyph;3292). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA is today amending the table of currently approved information collection request (ICR) control numbers issued by OMB for various regulations. Today's amendment updates the table to accurately display those information requirements promulgated under the Determining Conformity of General Federal Actions to State or Federal Implementation Plans rule which appeared in the Federal Register on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63214). The affected regulations are codified at 40 CFR part(s) 51, Subpart W and 93, Subpart B. EPA will continue to present OMB control numbers in a consolidated table format to be codified in 40 CFR part 9 of the Agency's regulations, and in each CFR volume containing EPA regulations. The table lists the section numbers with reporting and recordkeeping requirements, and the current OMB control numbers. This display of the OMB control number and its subsequent codification in the Code of Federal Regulations satisfies the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ) and OMB's implementing regulations at 5 CFR part 1320. This ICR was previously subject to public notice and comment prior to OMB approval. As a result, EPA finds that there is ``good cause'' under section 553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)) to amend this table without prior notice and comment. Due to the technical nature of the table, further notice and comment would be unnecessary. For the same reasons, EPA also finds that there is good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).
