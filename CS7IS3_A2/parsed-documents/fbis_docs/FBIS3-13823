On the face of it, collecting the signatures of 82 congressmen for the sake of Jerusalem would seem to be a heart-warming achievement for Israel and its friends in America. In fact, it was a cheeky action on the part of Jewish functionaries, an unprecedented deed in relations between the sovereign State of Israel and the Jewry of the diaspora, perhaps even between any sovereign state and an ethnic minority that bears no responsibility for the consequences of its deeds and misdeeds. Only a short distance separated their action from a veto of the UN Security Council [UNSC] resolution, which might have turned into a veto of the peace process. This event should shake the Israeli Government out of its complacency regarding the compromises waiting down the road. As long as the argument is over Israel's security -- and the subsequent debate about the contribution of the settlements -- the mainstream of the U.S. Jewish community avoids wars to the last drop of Israeli blood. Only a marginal minority challenged the Oslo agreement and spoke against concessions on the Golan Heights in exchange for peace with Syria. Israel's legal government shoved the handshake with the unshaven and kaffiyeh-clad Arab down their throat. It was Yitzhaq Rabin, the Six-Day War general, and not the left-wing Yosi Beilin who presented them with the fait accompli that the dimensions of Greater Israel will not be so great when peace comes. Barukh Goldstein, the doctor from Brooklyn, embarrassed them and set the ground under the settlements on fire. The battle over Jerusalem on the eve of the UNSC resolution put the color back in their cheeks. Never before has a group of Jews so insolently exploited its political clout to thwart a diplomatic compromise reached by Israeli and U.S. Government leaders. They played the role of a distinct opposition to Israel's legal government by manipulating a political system that has absolutely nothing to do with Israel's political or security interests. Most of the congressmen who signed the petitions took the name of Jerusalem in vain, just to please their Jewish constituents and tycoons. Others added their signature yesterday to be able to ask Connie Mack or Alfonse D'Amato tomorrow to endorse the initiative against a tobacco tax which threatens to ruin the livelihood of cigarette manufacturers in their constituencies. As long as the argument was conducted in coordination with the Israeli Government, the latter felt at peace with the fact that the Jews and the U.S. Congress presented clear limits to the administration with regard to Jerusalem. It could do no harm to show the Americans that when it comes to concessions on Jerusalem, Israel demands a special price. However, the Jewish warriors did not make do with an explicit commitment from the U.S. President, the vice president, and the secretary of state that the refusal to veto the UNSC resolution does not attest to an erosion in the administration's position vis-a-vis Jerusalem. The worst of the lot, led by Washingtonian pressure groups that did not digest the recognition of the PLO, seized on the issue of Jerusalem. They took advantage of a Jewish apparatus which had been founded by and for Israel to undermine a policy they opposed. As far as they were concerned, the chance of a veto that would thwart the efforts to heal the wounds of the Hebron massacre was an opportunity to save Israel from continuing to make concessions to the Arabs. According to them, Jerusalem is not just the capital of Israel but "the capital of the Jewish people." In a few days, as they do on Passover every year, they will declaim "Next Year in Jerusalem" and proceed to check how the construction of their villas in Beverly Hills and on Long Island is getting along. Seeing that this is not the first and probably not the last time that Jerusalem becomes a topic on the agenda of the peace process and gets the adrenalin of American Jews racing, we would seem to have no other choice but tell them in no uncertain terms: Jerusalem is the spiritual and religious capital of the Jewish people. Jerusalem is the political capital of the citizens of the State of Israel, just like Tel Aviv is their financial capital and Washington is the sole capital of the citizens of the United States, including the Jews. As long as the Israeli Government does not propose to hand over the Western Wall to the Muslim Waqf and to ban Jews from visiting the tombs of their ancestors on the Mount of Olives, the right of Jews to meddle in Israel's affairs is identical to their right to interfere in the negotiations about the size of the Palestinian police force in Gaza. A capital is first and foremost the manifestation of a state's sovereignty. There is no clearer sign of weakness than to permit the citizens of a foreign country -- be they Jews, Christians, or Muslims -- to dictate to an elected government a policy concerning its capital. It is a pity that in his appearance at the AIPAC [American Israel Public Affairs Committee] convention, the prime minister chose to voice the same old tunes they so much like to hear about his struggle for a united eternal city instead of telling them that Jerusalem is far too important to be a pawn in the hands of wheeler-dealers in the diaspora. The Jews of America usually begin fund-raising banquets by singing the U.S. and Israeli anthems. For those who make do with donating money to Israel, the words "being a free people in our land, the land of Zion and Jerusalem" are nothing more than lip service.
