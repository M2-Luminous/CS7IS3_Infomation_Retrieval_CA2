The United Democrats' spokesman on airport and infrastructure, Albert Chan Wai-yip, rejected the statements by the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, calling it an "irrational" move. Mr Chan said the Chinese Government breached the agreement -- the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) -- under which both sides said they would co- operate on the construction of Chek Lap Kok. He further criticised China's warning that it would declare airport-related legislation passed by the pre-1997 legislature invalid as disrespectful of the Basic Law. Mr Chan called on the two governments to reveal their interpretation of the memorandum and any exchanges that had taken place before the signing. Despite the threats from China, the United Democrats would continue to support the Government's funding request for the airport projects to give them a chance of being completed before the changeover, Mr Chan said. Meeting Point's Fred Li Wah-ming said the statement was a heavy blow to the confidence of Hong Kong people. He said China's four point declaration carried an explicit warning that legislators should not approve any of the funding proposals put forward by the Government recently. Mr Li said his party would not bow to such pressure, added that continuing objections from China without concrete counter-proposals were of no help to the airport row. While other political parties regarded China -- the future sovereign of Hong Kong -- as in a legitimate position to bring its threats into action, they said due consideration should be given to the impact on the community. Describing the Chinese position as "unfortunate", Steven Poon Kwok-lim of the Liberal Party said it would inevitably harm the airport's construction. It would be more difficult for the project to move ahead if China displayed such an attitude, he said. But Mr Poon said the declaration would not change his party's stance on the airport funding issue or the Airport Corporation Bill, the legislation governing the management body for the new airport. "The four-point declaration does not contradict our principles, we have stated very clearly that we would not agree to any funding requests that would leave any (financial) implications for the SAR [Special Administrative Region] government", he said. As for the airport bill, Mr Poon said the party's stance was that it would not give its consent without China's approval. Frederick Fung Kin-kee, chairman of the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood warned that the mainland statement could lead to further delay in the airport projects. It would create further hurdles in the search for financial support, he said. Tam Yiu-chung of the pro-China Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong said Britain should stop all funding requests until it received China's approval for the financing arrangements. "One central theme of the statement is that China as well as the future SAR will not shoulder any of the responsibility left over by the unilateral move of the Hong Kong British Government," Mr Tam said.
