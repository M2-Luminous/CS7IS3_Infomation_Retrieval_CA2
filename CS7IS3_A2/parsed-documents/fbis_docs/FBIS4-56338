He is traveling with his wife and some of his ministers. Wasmosy will fly to Uberaba, Brazil, where he will be decorated for his work with the International Federation of Zebu Cattle Breeders. He will also meet Brazilian President Itamar Franco on 3 May, although there was initially some doubt about this meeting given the official mourning declared in Brazil over the death of car racing champion Ayrton Senna. Sources close to the president have confirmed that the meeting will take place. The president was actually supposed to leave for Brazil on 1 May but he is leaving today. The plane is ready and the president is saying goodbye to ministers, high-ranking military officers, and Colorado Party leaders. [Begin Wasmosy recording] Messrs. journalists, as I have told you before, we are respecting and will continue to respect the rights of the strikers and will protect them, but they do not have the right to close streets, highways, set tires on fire, and other things. We will not allow this because both strikers and those who do not want to participate in the strike have the same rights. It is the government's duty to keep streets and highways open to traffic. This is our duty and we will do it. Thank you. [end recording] This was President Wasmosy on his way to the plane, reiterating the position that several ministers stated a few minutes ago at Government House. The president now is boarding the plane with his wife, Teresa Carrasco, and the agriculture and livestock minister. As you have seen on the screen, President Wasmosy's plane has started rolling and this is the end of our report.
