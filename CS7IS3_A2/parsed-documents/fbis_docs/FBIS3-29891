Kim said, "On May 13 last year, I ruminated on the historical meaning of `the Kwangju democratization movement' and announced government measures to relieve the pain of Kwangju citizens and retrieve their honor through a special statement. The mayor should see to it that the city seeks a council of citizens and related organizations to complete the government's measures as soon as possible." On May 18, 1980, hundreds of thousands of Kwangju residents resisted then-General Chon Tu-hwan's attempt to grab power and hundreds were killed by special soldiers. Kim also voiced hope that the people of Kwangju will strive to create an international city of science and industry, leading other cities in the 21st century. Meanwhile, Kim visited a machine tool factory and told workers there over lunch that he was pushing ahead with change and reform with all his might. In an impromptu address, he said, "I will never neglect change and reform, and the rooting out of irregularities and corruption during my term of office."
