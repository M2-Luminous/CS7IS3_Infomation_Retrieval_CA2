A team of TANJUG's reporters who managed to come near the dump situated in the popular Belgrade picnic site of Kosutnjak say the explosions occur at approximately 40-minute intervals. The whole area smells of gunpowder and is covered by a cloud of whitish smoke.

Widow of the late Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito, Jovanka Broz, whose residence is located near the ammunition dump, was among them.
