Government spokesman Dieter Vogel told reporters today in Bonn that the term "expansion" of NATO is "at present clearly not quite the best choice." Bonn supports the concept of a "partnership for peace," namely, close cooperation with those states beyond the rules of the European Cooperation Council [as received]. The modalities of this cooperation in the security field "up to and including joint peace missions, joint training, and joint exercises" will be discussed in Brussels. The Federal Government is committed to "intensifying" cooperation with the partners of the NATO Cooperation Council "in a further-reaching partnership for peace." It is not yet possible to name specific schedules, criteria, and candidates for this "process." Vogel expressed understanding for the concern of the Warsaw leadership that Poland cannot be admitted to NATO swiftly. However, the situation is "less dramatic" than Polish President Lech Walesa is stating. At the NATO summit to be held in Brussels this Monday and Tuesday [10-11 January], the Federal Government will be represented by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party) in addition to Chancellor Helmut Kohl (Christian Democratic Union). Vogel is not yet able to say whether Kohl will meet U.S. President Bill Clinton for talks at the margins of the summit.
