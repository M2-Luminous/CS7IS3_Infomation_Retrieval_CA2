FBIS4-8392 "dreeu071_i_94004" FBIS-EEU-94-071 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Churkin, Karadzic To Visit Gorazde Churkin, Karadzic To Visit Gorazde AU1204124694 Paris AFP in English 1217 GMT 12 Apr 94 AU1204124694 Paris AFP English BFN [Article by Victoria Stegic] [Text] Sarajevo, April 12 (AFP) -- Russian envoy Vitaliy Churkin and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic reportedly headed to the beseiged Moslem enclave of Gorazde Tuesday as Serb forces pursued their advance on the town in defiance of NATO warnings. Karadzic told the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA early Tuesday that he and Churkin were leaving for the eastern Bosnian enclave "to see the situation on the ground." The two men had met earlier in the Serb stronghold of Pale outside Sarajevo as part of a bid by Churkin to renew the dialogue between Serb forces and UNPROFOR following NATO airstrikes on Serb attackers around Gorazde on Sunday and Monday. Karadzic accused the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) of taking sides in the confict and said the NATO attacks had "caused significant damage and caused deaths" in the centre of Gorazde, SRNA said. "NATO bombed both sides" in the dispute, Karadzic insisted. Major Rob Annink, a spokesman for UNPROFOR, said meanwhile that Serb forces had on Monday "closed up to the river Drina" all along the southwest of the Gorazde enclave and were also trying to push southward from the north, coming close to Bosnian army positions. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) quoted aid officials on the spot as saying seven Serb shells hit Gorazde early Tuesday. Regular bursts of small arms fire could also be heard, said UNHCR spokeswoman Lyndall Sachs. But she said the observers in place described the situation in the town as "relatively calm" the day after NATO warplanes carried out their second strike in two days on advancing Serb forces. In Sarajevo on Tuesday, UNPROFOR commanders defended the NATO airstrikes as a legitimate support of the UN-declared "safe haven" in Gorazde, denying Serb claims that UN forces were now taking sides in the conflict. Lieutenant General Michael Rose, UNPROFOR commander in Bosnia, told journalists the airstrikes were a legitimate, limited tactical defence and it was out of the question to see them as a political act. General Bertrand de Lapresle, commander of all UN forces in former Yugoslavia, said the air strikes should not be blown up in importance and should not "put in question the well advanced peace process," interrupted by the Gorazde offensive. "We hope to be able to restablish bridges and resume political negotiations, which alone make sense," he added. A total 156 people have died and 646 been wounded in Gorazde since the Serb offensive began two weeks ago, UNHCR spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said Tuesday at the organisation's headquarters in Geneva. The total did not include the victims of Monday's fighting as the Gorazde hospital could not be reached, she added. Food was running out, with only 50 tonnes of supplies left in storage, since fighting has prevented fresh aid deliveries since March 22, she said. In another report, SRNA charged that Monday's raid by NATO planes had hit a clinic near Gorazde, killing two Serb male nurses. Serb military sources quoted by the Belgrade-based agency TANJUG said the first raid on Sunday by two American F-16s only hit a civilian car. Washington said Sunday's raid hit a Serb command post near Gorazde and Monday an F-18 bomber destroyed an attack tank and two military transport vehicles on the southern edge of town. Major Roy Thomas, the senior military observer in Sarajevo, said UNPROFOR was trying via the Bosnian Serb army to gain contact with a Dutch military observer and his Serb interpreter who have been missing since they left the mainly Moslem encalve of Zepa, northeast of Gorazde, Monday morning. The observer was on a routine administrative patrol, Thomas said. He and his interpreter passed through a Serb checkpoint out of Zepa and were last heard of at 9:30 a.m. (0730 GMT) Monday. In Belgrade, a UNPROFOR spokesman said several UN vehicles had been damaged by vandals overnight, but he said it was not possible to link the attacks to Serbian anger over the NATO air raids.
