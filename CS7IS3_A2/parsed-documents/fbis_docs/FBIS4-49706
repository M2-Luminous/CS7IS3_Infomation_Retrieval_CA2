The Chinese Government has placed great expectations on overseas funds in its attempt to ease up the strained transportation capacity, which has been a major bottleneck hampering the development of the national economy in recent years. In its general outline for the last decade of the century, the Chinese Government has attached prime importance to the construction of transport infrastructure. At the beginning of the 1990s, the central government defined nearly 400 large and medium-sized transport infrastructure construction projects, with a predicted budget of over 700 billion yuan. Among the 151 key construction projects for 1994, which were announced last week by the State Planning Commission, 33 belong to the field of transportation. In the past few years China's construction of transport infrastructure has experienced a fairly fast development. At present the country has 54,000 km of railways, 1.075 million km of highways, over 300 deep-water berths and more than 40 large and medium-sized civil airports. However, experts estimate that the existing infrastructure is capable of carrying only about 60 percent of the country's total transport demand. Railways and highways have been much more intensively used than called for by their designed capacity. Meanwhile, in important ports ships have to queue up for days for a berth to load or unload. According to plans of related departments, by the end of this century China will have 70,000 km of operating railways, 1.2 million km of highways, and the number of deep-water berths in coastal ports will exceed 600, basically alleviating the tight transport condition. To make sure that these plans are fulfilled, while expanding the state investment, the Chinese Government actively encourages foreign investors to participate in these fields, with preferential policies drafted to ensure profits for foreign businessmen. Foreign funds have, in fact, played a significant role in China's construction of transport infrastructure in recent years. Since 1979, the country's rail construction has used loans of some 2.06 billion U.S. dollars from the Japanese Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund, and 1.62 billion U.S. dollars from the World Bank. With the help of which more than 5,700 km of new railways have been constructed and 6,500 km of old rail lines relaid. To date more than two billion U.S. dollars in overseas loans has been used to construct more than 50 deepwater berths of 10,000-ton class, largely promoting the handling capacity of China's inland and sea ports. So far foreign funds going to China's transport infrastructure have mainly come from the World Bank, the Japanese Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund and the Asian Development Bank. To raise more construction funds, the Chinese Government is actively exploring even more extensive foreign fund sources, including foreign governments, financial groups, investment institutions and entrepreneurs. China has instituted preferential policies on tax exemption and reduction, rational sharing of profits and some other aspects for foreign investors. Moreover, many restrictions have been lifted to open a much wider investment field for overseas businessmen. Sources said that all civil aviation infrastructure, except for the air surveillance system, are open to foreign funds; foreign businessmen can invest exclusively to build docks and open navigation channels and are allowed to construct and manage special port areas and docks on the tracts of land they have invested in. In addition, China's transport infrastructure construction has also introduced the "build, operate and transfer" arrangement, which refers to a scheme in which foreign businessmen invest in the construction of a project, manage it for a fixed time, then hand over the management and ownership to the local government. Due to its huge potential profits, this arrangement has aroused deep interest among foreign investors. Most of China's basic industries have defined a recovery rate higher than the credit interest rate on the international financial market. Experts indicate that China's transport infrastructure has the characteristics of low risk and a high recovery rate, where foreign funds will surely have bright prospects. At present, the planned Beijing-Shanghai express railway, the national trunk highway network, and a large number of big port and airport projects have become the focus of foreign investors' attention, who are trying to negotiate with related Chinese departments and competing with each other for a share in the huge investment market.
