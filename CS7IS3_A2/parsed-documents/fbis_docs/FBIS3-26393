The organizing committee for "An In-Depth Look at Economic Returns in China" sponsored a "Forum on Deng Xiaoping's Ideas Concerning the Improvement of Economic Returns." In an impromptu speech at the forum, Honorary Chairman Bo Yibo said: The country's economy is now growing vigorously, while initial successes have been made in macroeconomic regulation and control. The situation is heartening. The whole nation, full of confidence, is trying hard to push China's economy to a new height by following the principle of seizing the current opportunity for development, deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, promoting development, and maintaining stability. All of you present here today have charge of improving economic returns. As you are in this business, you must be soberly aware of the fact that low economic returns nationwide remain largely unchanged. For example, the composite index for industrial economic returns fell at the end of 1993. We must, in particular, watch out for the bad tendency arising in some localities toward blindly undertaking construction projects, overextending construction scale, blindly seeking development speed, and neglecting economic returns. The scale of fixed assets investment is so large as to exceed what China's financial capabilities can withstand. Regarding publicity on economic work, not enough attention has been given to highlighting the importance of improving economic returns. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to study in a comprehensive manner -- and to unify our thinking on -- Comrade Xiaoping's ideas on combining development speed with economic returns to make sure that high speed and high economic returns promote each other and help bring about the sustained, rapid, and healthy growth of China's economy. Comrade Bo Yibo spoke of his understanding of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's exposition on the relationship between development speed and economic returns. Comrade Xiaoping's ideas of "development being the last word" and "being conducive to the three causes" [developing the productive forces of socialist society; increasing the overall strength of socialist society; and improving the people's living standard] are the operative ideas concerning pushing China's economy to a new height. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "If development is possible, we should not block the way. Localities with suitable conditions should carry out development as quickly as they can. As long as attention is paid to economic efficiency, product quality, and foreign economic exchange, we need not be worried about anything." He also said: "We must strive really hard to upgrade the economy to a new level every few years. We are, certainly, not encouraging unrealistic high growth rates. Rather, we should do solid work, stress economic returns, and bring about steady and well-balanced development." As far as I know, this has been Comrade Xiaoping's consistent idea. Over the past 10-plus years, he has repeatedly stressed this dialectical unity between development speed and high economic returns. We must try our best to achieve a relatively high growth rate. It is both possible and necessary for China to achieve an annual growth rate of 8 to 9 percent in line with its economic strength, financial capabilities, and materials supply. We must combine development speed with economic returns, product quality, and market demand. A low development speed and underproduction will adversely affect the improvement of China's overall economic strength and living standards; we must not allow this to happen. Neither excessive stockpiles nor redundant construction should be tolerated. Inventories of industrial enterprises covered in government budgets amounted to 170 billion yuan at the end of last year. What a gargantuan figure this is! What does it signify? Comrades: Think about it! In conclusion, Bo Yibo stressed: An organic combination of high speed with high economic returns serves as an "inevitable road" for us to achieve the strategy of modernizing China in three phases. This is not only an economic issue, but also a political one. Also speaking at yesterday's forum were Wang Zhongyu, minister in charge of State Economics and Trade Commission; and Sun Shangqing, director of the Development Research Center of the State Council. They noted that in order to raise the nation's economy to a new height and improve its overall level, we must combine development speed with high economic returns. The fundamental way to improve economic returns lies in raising the technological level of enterprises and lowering production costs. Other speakers included Fan Jingyi, editor in chief of RENMIN RIBAO; Yang Weiguang, director of the China Central Television; Min Fanlu, deputy editor in chief of the XINHUA news agency; and Ai Feng, member of the Editorial Board of RENMIN RIBAO.
