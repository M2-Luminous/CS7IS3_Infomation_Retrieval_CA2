The Maximo Gomez thermoelectric plant, one of the nation's largest with an installed capacity of 600 megawatts, suffered damages and had to be removed from the national network. Other plants throughout the country have also been damaged by Cuba's heavy oil, which can cause serious damage if it is not adequately treated or if adjustments are not made to the industrial equipment in which it is used. Cuba has been forced to use this heavy oil to generate a considerable amount of the electricity required by the country, because there is an insufficient amount of light oil for all of the generators. Workers at the Maximo Gomez plant are struggling tooth and nail to repair this important power plant before the month is over in an effort to restore services to the limited level the people were receiving before the plant went off-line. Problems like these, which pose a daily inconvenience for the entire population and generate severe economic problems because they paralyze various services that require electricity, are characteristic of the critical economic situation Cuba has suffered ever since the USSR collapsed and the full burden of the criminal blockade imposed more than 30 years ago by the U.S. Government was brought to bear on the country. This blockade has now been intensified by the well-known Torricelli amendment, whose purpose is to extend the so-called embargo to all of the countries that maintain commercial ties with Cuba. This is yet one more difficulty the Cuban people must deal with. It is perhaps one of the main difficulties, if you will, but certainly not the only one, because the industrial sector is nearly paralyzed by a shortage of fuel, replacement parts, lubricants, fertilizers, and numerous other resources which, in turn, has created the worst economic situation in the country's history. A situation like this would have made the best of the capitalist or so-called democratic-representative governments collapse. In Cuba, however, we have a heroic people who are resisting, because they know what they are defending, and because they are fully aware of what they would lose with the disappearance of their socialist system, which has brought them so many achievements, not only material, but also moral and spiritual. This is why the Cuban people voted overwhelmingly in favor of the revolution headed by Fidel Castro during the recent elections. This is why Cuba has so much strength and prestige throughout the world. This is why the Cuban people will continue fighting until they achieve victory.
