FR940622-2-00059 FR940622-2-00043 Bureau of Land Management NV&hyph;050&hyph;4210&hyph;06, N&hyph;57922 Intent To Amend Two Land Use Plans for a Proposed Withdrawal AGENCY: Bureau of Land Management, Interior. ACTION: Notice of Intent and Scoping Period. SUMMARY: The Bureau of land Management (BLM) is proposing to amend the Caliente Management Framework Plan (MFP) and the Nellis Air Force Range Resources Plan (RP) to analyze a proposed withdrawal by the Nellis Air Force Base. The withdrawal would involve 3,972 acres of public land in the White Sides Area of the BLM's Caliente Resource Area, Lincoln County, Nevada. This amendment is proposed to be an environmental assessment (EA) level amendment. A 30 day scoping period is being conducted to give the public an opportunity to comment on this proposed amendment and the following tentative issues: (1) Oil and gas leasing; (2) Off-road vehicle use; (3) Locatable minerals; and (4) Access. In addition to the proposed withdrawal and the no action alternative, the public is also invited to suggest alternatives to be analyzed in this amendment. DATES: A 30 day scoping period is scheduled from June 24, 1994, to July 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: All comments and concerns the public may have with this proposed amendment and EA must be mailed to: Bureau of Land Management, Attention: District Manager, P.O. Box 26569, Las Vegas, Nevada 89126, or delivered to the Las Vegas District Office, 4765 W. Vegas Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 0 Gary Ryan, Acting District Manager, at the above address or telephone (702) 647&hyph;5000. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The purpose of the proposed withdrawal of the White Sides area, located adjacent to the Nellis Air Force Range, is to provide a security buffer to the Nellis Air Force Range. The White Sides area is currently managed by the Caliente MFP. The adjacent Nellis Air Force Range is withdrawn for military purposes (see Public Laws 99&hyph;606 and 100&hyph;338) and its natural and cultural resources are managed by the BLM through the Nellis Air Force Range Resource Plan (RP). If this area is to be withdrawn, its management would be similar to that of this RP. Therefore, it is proposed that the Caliente MFP be amended to not include the management of the subject 3,972 acres and the Nellis Air Force Range RP be amended to include the management of the subject 3,972 acres. Management of resources that may be changed by this amendment include: (1) Oil and gas leasing; (2) Off-road vehicle use; (3) Locatable minerals; and (4) Access. Thus, they become tentative issues that will be addressed in one or more of the alternatives of the amendment. Issue 1. Oil and gas leasing: The area is currently open to leasing under the Caliente MFP Minerals decision 2.0. The proposed withdrawal could impact oil and gas exploration and development. Issue 2. Locatable minerals: The subject area is open to locatable mining under the Caliente Minerals decision 1.1. The proposed withdrawal would close the land under the mining laws. Issue 3. Recreation/Off-Road Vehicle Use: The subject area is currently open to sight-seeing, recreational, and off-road vehicle use under Caliente MFP Recreation Decision R&hyph;2. The proposed withdrawal would close the area to public access. This amendment will analyze the impacts of several alternatives to the proposed withdrawal, including the no action alternative. Federal, state and local agencies, and other individuals or organizations who are interested in/or affected by aspects of the proposed amendment and environmental assessment, are invited to participate in this planning process. Comments and recommendations will be accepted only on those subjects being addressed by this amendment. Dated: June 15, 1994. Ronald B. Wenker, Acting State Director, Nevada.
