FBIS4-58109 "drnes084_n_94003" FBIS-NES-94-084 Daily Report 2 May 1994 LEBANON Hizballah on Media Decision, Peace Process Hizballah on Media Decision, Peace Process NC0105083594 NC0105083594 BFN [Editorial Report] Beirut AL-'AHD in Arabic on 15 April publishes on page 5 an approximately 200-word report on a speech delivered by Hizballah Deputy Secretary General Shaykh Na'im Qasim during a ceremony held at Beirut's Arab University on Wednesday, 13 April, to honor excellent students. Shaykh Qasim says in part: "The media ban imposed by the Lebanese Government aims to deflect attention from the case of the perpetrators of the church massacre, and to pave the way for Lebanon to normalize relations with Israel." On the same page, the paper publishes an approximately 350-word report on a speech by 'Ammar al-Musawi, deputy head of Hizballah's Political Bureau, at a ceremony organized by Hizballah on the occasion marking the 14th anniversary of the martyrdom of Scholar Ayatollah Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr. Al-Musawi says: "The law on the reorganization of the media is primarily aimed at silencing the voices rejecting the peace plan with the enemy." He adds that "the resistance is the chief loser from closing radios, because without radios, the resistance cannot communicate with its masses and society." Al-Musawi calls "for confronting the government's decision which portends grave consequences." Pointing to the ongoing "capitulationist" process, al-Musawi says: "Sixty people were recently killed in al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. What have the Arab rulers done regarding crime?" The Hizballah official goes on to say: "The Arab regimes were more embarrassed than the Zionists by this massacre. This is because the Arabs made a treasonous decision. These crimes expose their treason and collusion. What kind of peace are they talking about after this massacre which was committed during the ongoing negotiations which are imposed on the Arabs? Had this peace been a true peace, they would have allowed us to have our say. But they want to repress every voice in the name of stability. They are accusing us of plotting against Lebanon. Even if for the sake of argument we agree that the logic of negotiations is sound, we would still be wrong to lay down our weapons while the enemy owns the most sophisticated planes in the world and even nuclear weapons." On another memorial ceremony for martyr al-Sadr held in Burj al-Barajinah in Beirut, AL-'AHD publishes on page 5 an approximately 650-word report on an address by Shaykh Muhammad Yazbik, member of the Hizballah leadership council. After underlining the feats of the martyr and criticizing the "plot" against the media, Shaykh Yazbik says: "This plot is a coup against the nationalists in Lebanon and a conspiracy to abrogate Lebanon." He adds: "We will not allow this plot to be implemented against our kinsfolk and people." Shaykh Yazbik adds: "If they believe that they are paving the way for a peace settlement, I tell them that they will not succeed in doing so. Our reply to the Zionist enemy's attacks and massacres will be carried out in the form of suicide operations by the mujahidin in the occupied territories and in the form of qualitative operations by the Islamic resistance." In a similar memorial ceremony held in Damascus, Ayatollah Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah delivered an approximately 2,000-word speech. After devoting the bulk of the address to the occasion, Fadlallah turns to the ongoing peace process. He says: "There is much talk, and as al-Sadat used to say, that there can be no solution without the United States. We have seen the U.S. solution in Egypt, and we also know the U.S. solution everywhere, including the current one in Palestine. The U.S. solution is the Gaza-Jericho agreement, which gives the Palestinians neither a homeland nor a state." Continuing, Fadlallah says: "They say that innocent people were killed in al-Ibrahimi Mosque and in the Israeli bus. But is there any Jew in Palestine whom you could call innocent? The issue is not one of carrying arms. He who seized the Palestinian land is an enemy. He who confiscated the Palestinian house and built a settlement on the Palestinian land is an enemy. But the United States wants to convince us that they are innocent." Fadlallah adds: "The United States wants to place the entire region under its control, including the region's riches, human beings, land, policies, economy, and security. The United States seeks to revoke everything called the Arab world." In a 1,000-word statement on page 6 issued at the end of its ordinary meeting, the Bloc of Loyalty to the Resistance [Hizballah's parliamentary group], notes that "the government's decision serves the conspiratorial scheme targeted against the country's principal issues, foremost being the issue of liberation and resistance." The Bloc concludes its statement, saying: "With all objectiveness, resolve, and determination, we call for the cancellation of the government's recent decision concerning the ban of newscasts and political programs, and we will make every effort, and everyone is responsible, to wage the battle of media freedoms until the government reverses its decisions." A 500-word interview is carried on page 9 with Dr. 'Ali al-Shaykh 'Ammar, deputy head of the Islamic Group Political Bureau. 'Ammar discusses the ministerial measures concerning the private radios and says: "These measures involve all of Lebanon and the Lebanese people and they will have impact on Lebanon's future and status and on the role being played by the resistance in confronting the Jewish plan in the region. These measures should not be allowed to preempt or circumvent the various effective and influential forces in Lebanon."
