Why are we creating it? Why have I, who am not overfond of "party building," considered it my current duty to spend all my efforts and time on creating the party? To avoid getting bogged down in details and in order to highlight the main points, I offer an initial perspective. Let's imagine that we -- like Solzhenitsyn and his family, for instance -- have not been in Russia for 20 years and have now returned. We were expelled from the USSR in 1974 and we are returning to Russia in 1994 and traveling from the East to Moscow. I think that as conscientious people we will single out several main features characterizing Russian life today. The nauseating, decaying system of state hypocrisy has disappeared. It is a case not only of freedom of speech, political freedoms, and so forth. The newspapers and television are not filled solely with politics. For all their shortcomings -- persistent and crude advertizing and other unpleasant elements -- people nonetheless see life in the mirror of the mass media. After all, in 1974 what we had was simply a mad country. We were told lies to the effect that there were no poor people, no crimes, no ecological or other man-made problems in the USSR -- there was just shock labor, the issue of orders, and a "sense of profound satisfaction." This cardboard lie has disappeared -- and it is stupid to argue about whether that is good or bad. The new life is real, the former life was fictitious. Much else has disappeared with the lies -- party meetings, interference in private life by the state, fear of the KGB and informers, the constant feeling that "abroad" was some kind of sweet "forbidden fruit." The world has been opened up to us from all sides. You can go wherever you like as long as you have the money, you can get any currency, we have any information about other countries, we can watch all their movies, buy any of their goods, and so forth. From being a camp-country we have become an open country. Once again: There is much that we may not like in the outside world and in our own country but we can choose, our blindfold has been taken away. Our life is not ideal, it may be bad, but it is real, not a life made up for us by someone. The lines -- a main feature of the Soviet way of life -- have disappeared. By Western standards we have a very poor range of goods and insane prices. But let's think -- if goods, including necessities, have increased in cost so insanely, why are people mostly calm, why are there no general strikes, and why -- thank god! -- are there no barricades, rebellions, and so forth? Why do all the calls of the "intransigent opposition" remain just talk, however much they try to provoke the people to violence? The answer is obvious. If life had indeed deteriorated drastically the country would long ago have been drenched in blood. Yes, life is hard, often unfair. But if we compare it not with paradise but with what we were used to, the conclusion is clear: As a whole we have not started to live worse. An apartment, an automobile, and simple respectable clothing and food were always almost inaccessible to an honest man while thieves -- both state thieves (the nomenklatura) and ordinary criminals -- always had all that in abundance. Today life has become a little more normal: We no longer have to "chase after" things and get them on the black market in humiliating circumstances. We "only" have to earn money -- and today that is the chief, the only problem of a normal person. That can be put to the credit of "perestroyka" and then the reforms. We have stopped standing on our heads -- although, alas, we have not yet found our feet. Hence the first aim of our party. It has gathered together those who are active builders and supporters of today's hard but natural human life. And our first "conservationist" task is to prevent a return to the old ways. We also adopt a "conservationist" stance on military-strategic questions. In other words, we are opponents of demagogic plans to restore the USSR's military-imperial might. Matters can go no further than demagoguery here -- in reality Russia has no strength for such a resurrection. But this demagoguery itself, which distracts people from real tasks, is also very dangerous, especially as what are incredible funds for peace time -- over 20 percent of the budget expenditure goes on the army -- continue to be spent to the accompaniment of this demagoguery. We are in favor of a relatively small, mobile, combat-capable, professional army. Of course such an army will not give us the opportunity to maintain superpower ambitions but Russia cannot afford them and does not need them. Russia must consciously leave the race for a place as a superpower. In fact that is what has happened. The same applies to borders. We have the precise borders of the Russian republic. Attempts to revise them and to expand them can only lead to catastrophe -- you only have to look at Karabakh to understand what "territorial disputes" are. The USSR cannot be restored -- however badly the CIS republics may be living they will not surrender their independence just as there is no country in the world which will surrender it voluntarily. But for Russia it is not only impossible but unnecessary to restore the USSR -- Russia has always been the giver to the "fraternal republics" and indeed to other "fraternal" regimes -- in Angola, Cuba, and Afghanistan.... These are all vestiges of the imperial trumpery which gratify some people's vanity but which the country cannot afford today. Normal economic relations with the CIS republics are being set up and will develop without solemn oaths -- it is simply that they are more interested in this than we are. Incidentally, we should not reduce trade problems to interstate relations. Enterprises, dealers, and bankers will find for themselves and already are finding partners -- we are simply doomed to collaborate. But collaborate as equals. We shall not sacrifice the interests of Russia, the Russian economy, and Russian people to maintain a "single and indivisible" power. The defense of Russians' rights is a special issue. To be honest, Russians in Central Asia and the Transcaucasus have always been "second-class" people. When -- while we still had a united USSR! -- the first pogroms against Russians occurred in Dushanbe (1990) Moscow kept silent in fear -- to avoid offending the "fraternal republic." The great empire never cared a jot for the interests of the individual person and sacrificed them for the sake of imperial interests. It is here that Russia must display vigor -- only, of course, it must not fuel hysteria, not squeal and wave its arms "Zhirinovskiy-style." But the main tasks for which we are creating the party are not to preserve what has been achieved but to help advance along the path of reforms. The main problems lie in the economic sphere. And it is here that the question is being decided of whether Russia will become a great power in the modern sense of the world and join the ranks of the leading countries or will be a semicolonial country with nuclear weapons and a large territory. We have one global economic aim: freeing enterprising people from the state's fetters, and then they will raise Russia as destroyed Germany, Japan, the previously backward Korea, and other countries were raised up after the war. Capitalism is not an ideal system, it is simply that nothing better has yet developed in the world. Only private interest can be a real motivating force of progress. For that we need several conditions: We must facilitate and simplify the creation of new enterprises, develop a simple and stable taxation policy, where possible avoid stifling small enterprises with taxes, promote the creation of a normal credit system, and firmly elaborate a bankruptcy mechanism. The main thing is political stability, when a person knows for sure that the state protects his property. These conditions can in general become the point of departure for the most mobile section of business -- small business. Small enterprises are closest of all to the real owner, they are less subject to bureaucracy and react flexibly to the market. A more complex issue involves large-scale military production. We should not fear the slump which is now taking place. In a certain sense this is a correct and inevitable process and a necessary element in structural restructuring. After all, we can sense for ourselves that production is declining but the living standard is not declining with it. That means the lion's share of what is no longer being produced was not vitally necessary. But something else is also obvious. The decline in production has two main negative aspects: Unemployment. Serious in itself when it exceeds a certain level, it threatens to cause a mass sociopolitical eruption. The collapse of high-technology production. It threatens to relegate Russia to the ranks of the third world countries. Three tasks stem from this: -- Creating new jobs, primarily in the construction sphere. The construction of housing, roads, and the entire infrastructure is a necessary and very promising business. It could quite well draw into its orbit a substantial proportion of people who are without work and enterprises which are changing their profile. -- A "selective" point-by-point policy for supporting promising high-technology production facilities. -- Help for competitive industry. For this we do not need to engage in "head-on" protectionism -- that leads only to monopolism and the stagnation of production. But we need to do everything to encourage (tax benefits, guarantees of noncommercial risks, and so forth) the creation of joint production facilities and the introduction of modern technology into our industry. All this is closely linked with financial policy. The stable upsurge of the necessary production facilities and the normalization of the economy are impossible under conditions of high inflation. Thanks to a reduction in the growth rates of the money mass last fall to 10 percent a month by this spring inflation had been successfully educed to the same level. But that is still a very long way from the financial stabilization needed for serious investments in production. Everyone understands that financial discipline is essential. Everyone knows that a production slump is inevitable. It is obvious to everyone that "growth spots" in the economy are connected primarily not with "giants in the desert" but with the swarm of small and medium private enterprises. That is the theory, common sense, and interest of society and the state. Realistic policy is made not so much under the influence of these general matters as under the influence of personal and group interests. Today's policy is a policy pursued by a bureaucracy in the interests of a bureaucracy. Bureaucracy is not a swearword. It is a social stratum of managers, primarily economic managers, a stratum that is specific and is needed in the country. But Russia's trouble has always been that it is not the bureaucracy that has worked for the country but the country that has worked or the bureaucracy. The officials' interests are the same -- controlling the distribution of financial wealth and material resources. They will not help all private business -- only those businessmen who have become 'theirs,' who have grown akin to them, and who give bribes. They will not help renew leader cadres at enterprises -- they will not remove themselves! Any written law (on bankruptcy, on the sale of lossmaking enterprises, and so forth) they will in practice distort in their own way. So we see our social and political goal in ensuring that it is not bureaucracy but society which becomes the decisive political force. There is one path here -- reducing the degree of state influence on the economy. Demonopolization and privatization should serve this goal. But laws alone are not enough here -- what is needed is a strictly oriented political will. The will of a party which sets as its task the transformation of a bureaucratic society into a civil society. The struggle against bureaucracy is no less important (and difficult!) than the struggle against crime. Only by placing both under control will we be able to "expand" the social area and give breathing space to vigorous, lively people who are the only ones on whom we can pin our hopes as builders of the future Russia. In just the same way the destruction of the tough bureaucratic system will make our society open -- open not to the outside world but "internally open," so that a person will be able to move far more freely than at present within the social area, achieving everything by his own abilities and not by bureaucratic connections. That is not only a condition for economic progress but exceptionally important of itself -- important for the reaction of a more human, humane, and normal society.. I have not listed all the party's aims. But the main thing is clear: We are in favor of a normal path of development for Russia, in favor of private ownership and democracy. We are against imperial ambitions: territorial, military, bureaucratic, and ideological. They say that today our slogans are "unfashionable." Perhaps. But they are based on common sense. Hence our methods. The methods of a calm, correct policy. We are not building paradise -- we are trying to build a normal life. Violence is not our method, and, moreover, we know how ineffective it is. At the same time in some situations we cannot avoid it -- however sad it may be, I do not dissociate myself from the government's 3-4 October actions, I take responsibility for them and continue to see no alternative to them. Only thus could we trample underfoot the embers of of civil war. We are in favor of an open society and an open policy, including open, tough, but persuasive and precise polemics. I hope no one will accuse either the party or me personally of demagoguery and vagueness. We are in favor of a party with clean hands. That is what all politicians say, but it seems to me that we have real grounds for this. At any rate I do not know which of our active workers could has been accused of corruption even once. Those democratic politicians whose reputation was not irreproachable have left "Russia's Choice" one way or another or initially belonged to other parties. On the other hand those who are known as decent people who do not chase after money and position but on the contrary have been imprisoned for their convictions, support our party. Almost all the former dissidents in the State Duma belong to the "Russia's Choice" faction. We are not romantics. I can clearly see even the psychological portrait of the person to whom our party could be close: a sensible man consistent in his convictions, someone who does not seek external effect but real results. We are in favor of a capitalist Russia but that does not mean that entrepreneurs make up the basis of our party. We are glad to have them, as we are glad to have workers, private farmers, and so forth, but our party will be a party of intelligent people, whatever professional or social labor they perform. The party of those who think not only of the present but also of the future of their children, the future of Russia.
