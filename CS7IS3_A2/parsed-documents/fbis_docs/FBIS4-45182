FBIS4-45182 "jptdd023__l94026" JPRS-TDD-94-023-L JPRS Narcotics 25 May 1994 LATIN AMERICA HAITI Chief of Antidrug Service Comments on 143 Kg Cocaine Seizure Chief of Antidrug Service Comments on 143 Kg Cocaine Seizure FL2505190194 Port-au-Prince Radio Metropole in French 1600 GMT 25 May 94 FL2505190194 Port-au-Prince Radio Metropole French BFN [Text] The antidrug brigade made a spectacular seizure of cocaine at the Port-au-Prince Airport by intercepting 143 kg of cocaine going to the United States on board an American Airlines plane. The cocaine was being carried by two Haitians residing in the United States, who were arrested. Another person, a Canadian of Haitian origin, was also apprehended with one kg of cocaine and three pounds of marijuana while he was getting ready to travel abroad. Clarence Renois questioned Colonel [Antoine] Atouriste, who is in charge of the Antidrug Service. [begin recording] Atouriste: [Word or words indistinct] only cocaine yesterday. It was very unusual. We have never had such a case at the airport before. Renois: Where did those drugs transiting through Haiti, that you fortunately succeeded in intercepting, come from, Colonel? Atouriste: Just like for the other Caribbean countries, the drug comes from Colombia. We are situated on the international axis for the international traffic from south to north--meaning from Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia to the United States or Europe. It is therefore indispensable for the drugs to go through Haiti. Of course we know that many measures have been taken in Haiti. We have been in control of the situation for many years, despite certain false allegations by certain sectors or by the opposition, which is continuing its campaign of denigration. [Word or words indistinct] in the Caribbean, and it is done as well in Haiti. Renois: Could you say today, Colonel, that the antidrug brigade controls the drug-trafficking situation in Haiti totally? Atouriste: I tell you sincerely that to see what we have been able to accomplish with the support of the authorities concerned constitutes our greatest satisfaction. The system is under control and they [not further identified] know that. You have heard about the latest report of the international observers in that regard, how they congratulate Haiti despite the embargo. We have accomplished without much money what the Haitian Government was never able to accomplish in the past, before 1991. Renois: Indeed, Colonel Atouriste, there is a report from the U.S. Justice Department that calls into question high-ranking Army officers, who are allegedly involved in protecting this trafficking from Colombia to Haiti to the United States. An investigation has been opened, in that regard. Is the Haitian Army or the Antidrug Service concerned about that? Atouriste: Your question is quite political. We are technicians. I will simply say to you that the Haitian Army is now the dog to kill. When one wishes to kill his dog, he accuses it of being rabid. But we are from the Army and we have been fighting drugs for more than a quarter of a century in Haiti. The Haitian law on narcotics dates from 1971. To my knowledge, the Haitian Armed Forces are in charge of fighting drugs, and continue to do so. I want to believe that what you hear on the media nowadays is again this sick sector of the national life that is continuing its campaign of denigration, or that it is this sector of the international community that is affected by this virus that you know. That is my opinion on that. [end recording]
