Yesterday the Democratic Alliance [AD] leader was in Puglia, first at Bari, then Taranto and Foggia, walking around in a region that has such a large number of AD supporters and admirers. "Yes, I saw Occhetto. What can I say? We have provided an illustration of the progressive alliance's objective of a progressive government for quite some time back." [LA REPUBBLICA] Hence, no to Bertinotti and his Communist Renewal party in a government of the Left? [Adornato] The problem is simple and we have always stated it. It is a question of consistency. There are sectors in the progressive alliance who do not believe in the unity of progressives, but in that of the Left; moreover, Ingrao said so just too explicitly, precisely in reference to the word "progressive" itself. And these sectors do not believe in, or rather are not looking to governing the country. They believe in, and are looking to introducing an extremist policy. [LA REPUBBLICA] Whilst the progressives should... [Adornato] In the first place we should state that not all progressives are in this alliance. I am referring in particular to the Catholic democratic world which has not chosen the AD or the Christian socialists, but who have preferred to defend, pointlessly, the political center, which makes no sense under the majority system. [LA REPUBBLICA] Let us say, of the progressives. [Adornato] Good, in this alliance not everyone believes in or wants the prospect of governing. And then it is correct to say that this is not our problem. [LA REPUBBLICA] Not at all? [Adornato] No, it does not concern us because our intention is to give birth to a large democratic and reformist party which can govern our country in a totally new way. Communist Renewal? Nor should one become obsessed with individual parties or movements; the important thing rather is to overcome the barriers, though without losing one's own identity. [LA REPUBBLICA] But is a progressive government possible without Bertinotti? [Adornato] I will repeat myself for the umpteenth time: If certain parties do not have a social and economic policy with which to govern, that is not our problem. We want to govern. But we have also loyally accepted the alliance.
