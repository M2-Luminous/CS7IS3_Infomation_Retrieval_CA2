The president of Lazare Kaplan, Leon Tempelsman, made a short visit to Moscow from 25 February through 1 March. All his Moscow meetings were strictly confidential. But the editorial office of KOMMERSANT managed to gather some information regarding the position of the interested parties and to determine that final negotiations are planned for mid-March. The precedent of large loans secured by diamonds was created in 1990: the DeBeers firm loaned the USSR government 1 billion dollars for 5 years on the security of 14.6 million carats in raw diamonds. Only certain details of the liquidation of the loans are known: payments are made under a special schedule four times a year and by the end of 1995 will total 1.25 billion dollars. After that the Ministry of Finance received a whole number of such proposals. Some of them have already been rejected and some are still being considered. In accordance with existing practice, all negotiations in this field were strictly confidential. But in the case of Lazare Kaplan International (LKI), there was an information leak and the American firm's proposal began to be discussed extensively throughout the diamond world. In Western business circles, it is commonly thought that the purpose of Lazare Kaplan International's proposal is to prevent an excessive flow of jewel-grade diamonds out of Russia by transferring the entire federal reserve to the United States. But according to KOMMERSANT experts' opinion, with its proposal LKI is demonstrating the serious intention of North American capital to launch a power play in the world raw diamond market: to drive a wedge in DeBeers' delicate relations with Russia, squeeze them out of the market, and free up a niche for Canadian diamonds (industrial production of these diamonds amounting to 5-7 million carats a year is expected in 3 or 4 years). The participation of the large firm DuPont de Nemour and the American branch of the mining company VNR is possible in this project. In any case it is quite unlikely that the Russian Federation government will accept LKI's proposal. In mid-March the deputy minister of finance, Anatoliy Golovatyy, plans to conduct final negotiations with the LKI leadership and make a counter proposal which is more modest in parameters, for example, a 5-year loan of 1 billion dollars on the security of raw diamonds worth 1.2 billion dollars, on the condition that the specialists of Komdragmet [Committee on Precious Metals and Precious Stones] make up the specifications and there is a commission of 0.1 percent; Mr. Tempelsman will most likely reject this proposal. But then the Yakut government and the Almazy Rossii-Sakha company will apparently continue separate negotiations with LKI on a loan of 300 million dollars on the security of 3-4 million carats in raw diamonds from their own reserves. If the federal authorities do not take a sharply negative stand on this issue, an American-Yakut agreement can be expected by the summer (the start of the navigation season). As of today, the interested parties upon whom realization of LKI's deal with the federal government depends take the following stands: The Group of Experts of the Russian Federation President "We have no instructions on the LKI proposal," the leader of the group, Viktor Krivov, reported yesterday. Most likely if the group is hired to analyze this proposal, its experts will take the finding prepared by the Ministry of Finance and Komdragmet as a basis. Russian Federation Ministry of Finance After Boris Fedorov's resignation, Anatoliy Golovatyy became responsible for preparing the text of the decision. He let it be known that there are "respectable, well-known banks" behind the LKI proposal, but it is a "raw" one. According to information from other sources in the Ministry of Finance, two provisions in the LKI proposal are absolutely unacceptable: the enormous amount of the security and the high commission to Mr. Tempelsman. Mr. Golovatyy emphasized that the possible loan secured by diamonds "in no case should violate the agreement with DeBeers." "Whatever agreement there may be, it must be fulfilled," he stated. Russian Federation Committee on Precious Metals and Precious Stones "This is an unacceptable proposal," announced the deputy chairman of Komdragmet, Leonid Gurevich. It is interesting that 2 years ago Mr. Gurevich was a supporter of diamond security and during his time as a member of the parliamentary committee on foreign investments vigorously promulgated Western banks. But recently his opinion did an about-face. According to his assertion, this happened "as a result of new guidelines in the diamond strategy of Russia, which today has more effective means of using raw diamonds on international markets in its arsenal." Administration of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) In the accompanying letter to Boris Yeltsin attached to the text of the LKI proposal, the president of Yakutia, Mikhail Nikolayev, not only showed fundamental interest in this idea but even formulated four additional points. Taking into account persistent efforts to return some of the diamonds from the federal storage facility to the republic or receive part of the money from transactions with them, Yakutia's interest in federal loans secured by diamonds becomes completely clear. As KOMMERSANT found out from circles close to the Russian Ministry of Finance, Yakutia is hoping to receive around 10 percent of any "diamond" loan which the federal government decides to take out. Moreover, Yakutia will be able to insist on an increase in the internal Russian quota for exports of raw diamonds through the DeBeers channel. The Almazy Rossii-Sakha Company "The company does not have instructions from the federal government to provide a conclusion on the LKI proposal," said the executive director of the company, Sergey Ulin. It is not impossible that such instructions will be given in the near future, since the company specialists, in particular advisor Valeriy Rudakov, participated directly in preparing the security agreement with DeBeers and has valuable experience in ongoing diamond security transactions. Obviously, a state loan secured by diamonds meets both the company's tactical (increasing the internal quota on exports) and strategic interests. DeBeers "LKI informed the DeBeers management of the essence of its proposal but does not act on DeBeers' instructions," reported the LKI representative, Robert Keshmia. Most likely the president of LKI discussed the possibility of hiring DeBeers specialists to make up the security specifications with the DeBeers executives. But there were no public announcements on DeBeers' part. Obviously, the DeBeers management is facing a dilemma: either free Russian reserves with LKI's help, and if the security agreement is violated buy up the diamonds and thereby increase its own reserves which are already burdensome (according to information of the newspaper BUSINESS DAY, they are estimated at 3.4 billion dollars), or refrain from any participation in this deal and reconcile itself to the "diamond drain from Russia" which it believes exists. Description of Lazare Kaplan International Lazare Kaplan International was founded in 1903. It became a public company in 1972, the only diamond firm in the United States whose stock is quoted on the stock exchange. LKI is a sightholder of DeBeers, participates in a joint advertising campaign for prestigious diamond jewelry, and jointly with DeBeers is realizing a project in Ghana on the Bayrim River. LKI concluded the fiscal year which ended on 31 March 1993 with a sales volume of 150 million dollars, which is 4 percent higher than the result of the preceding year. The sales volume in cut and polished diamonds totaled 43 million dollars, but in March-May dropped by 30 percent. In the next half year, which ended on 30 November, the total volume of sales grew by 32 percent, although cut and polished diamond sales fell by another 6 percent. The volume of sales of raw jewel-grade diamonds rose by 48 percent in the second half year, which allowed profits of 1.1 million dollars to be obtained. Basic Provisions of the LKI Proposal (According to Information from the Western Press: Reuters, WALL STREET JOURNAL, BUSINESS DAY, and others): - LKI is undertaking to organize a loan for Russia in the amount of 3.3 billion dollars for 10 years at 6 percent annual interest; - raw diamonds worth 4.5 billion dollars function as security and are removed from the federal storage facility in Moscow by representatives of the creditor; - in the event Russia violates the obligations, the diamond security or part of it will be sold through the Central Marking Organization (a trade subdivision of DeBeers); - for the deal LKI acts as the foreign advisor of the Russian government and receives 1.5 percent of the total amount of the loan plus costs and consultation fees (in all about 50 million dollars).
