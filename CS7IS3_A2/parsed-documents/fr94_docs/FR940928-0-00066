ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') adds pool heaters, instantaneous water heaters, and heat pump water heaters to the list of products covered by the Commission's Appliance Labeling Rule (``Rule''). This action is being taken because amendments to the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (``EPCA'') added pool heaters to the list of covered products for which the Commission must consider labeling requirements, and because the Department of Energy (``DOE'') promulgated final test procedures for the two types of water heaters at issue that triggered an obligation under EPCA for the Commission to consider labeling requirements for them. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 29, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James Mills, Attorney, 202&hyph;326&hyph;3035, Division of Enforcement, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, DC 20580.
