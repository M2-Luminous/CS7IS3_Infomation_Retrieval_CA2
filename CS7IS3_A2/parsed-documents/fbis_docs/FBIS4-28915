Sujana said Monday that OPEC's strategy of maintaining static quota of 24.2 million barrels per day (BPD) is effective in keeping prices at the stable level. The static quota has up to the second quarter of this year proved to be effective in stabilising prices, and therefore it is expected that the quota will be maintained until the end of this year, the minister said. OPEC countries must also maintain their discipline, violating their respective quota, Sujana said when installing a number of senior officials at the state-owned Perum Gas Company. In reply to a question in connection with the planned meeting of the price monitoring committee of OPEC's oil ministers in Vienna on June 15, the minister said that the decision by OPEC to maintain the production level is correct. The OPEC oil ministers will discuss in the Vienna meeting the developments of oil prices, the minister said adding that the present quota was decided in March in anticipation of an increase in demand for oil supplies. The prediction of increased demand was based on the recovery of economies of advanced countries after recession over the past few years. Although the dry season has fallen in the countries of the Northern Hemisphere, the oil demand on the world market remains stable so that prices are improving. According to the minister, the other factor which contributes to the improving price is the on-going repair of oil installations in the North Sea producer countries. Supply of oil from the North Sea producing state was reduced temporarily as a result of the installation repair. It seems that the non-OPEC producers have yet to increase their output from 4.5 million barrels per day to 5.3 million BPD. Besides, the discipline of the OPEC members to abide by their respective production quota was able to prevent oil oversupply, he added. The minister said that oil price at present is about 16 US dollars per barrel, higher than the price during the March-April period which stood at US$13 per barrel. The price of Indonesian minas oil has since last month reached 15.9 dollars per barrel, he said. He expressed the hope that the OPEC oil ministers will in the next meeting reach consensus that will continue to improve oil prices. Minister Sujana said that the agenda of the meeting consisted of 15 items, including the succession of OPEC secretary general. Current OPEC secretary general Subroto is to complete his tenure of office this month. Sujana said that Subroto cannot be elected for the next period as he had occupied the post for two consecutive terms. Venezuela's Oil Minister Dr. Parra and his Iranian counterpart Gholam Reza Aqazadeh are strong candidates for the secretary general post. For Indonesia, the two candidates have similar commitment to OPEC, the minister said.
