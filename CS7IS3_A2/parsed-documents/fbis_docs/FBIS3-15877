This was the focal point of a session of the Committee for Assisting in the Search for Employment under the capital's government. It was noted that at present the city employment service has 40,000 job vacancies for the 16,000 officially registered unemployed in Moscow. Many of these, however, do not want to find a job because of miserly wages, increased demands by employers, and the simple fact of uninteresting work. The capital's government has drawn up a number of measures capable of averting a sharp increase in unemployment in Moscow. Among other things, training for entrepreneurs seeking to set up their own businesses has been started for the first time.
