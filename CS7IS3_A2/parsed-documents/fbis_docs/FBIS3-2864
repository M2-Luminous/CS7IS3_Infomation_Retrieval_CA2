After hearing Premier Li Peng's government work report at the current session of the National People's Congress, leaders of three provinces and one autonomous region expressed their above view. In an interview with XINHUA, Ma Zhongchen, governor of Henan Province in central China, said that rural enterprises are a powerhouse for economic development in central and western regions, a main channel for surplus rural labor and a driving force for the development of rural towns. He said Henan Province, the second largest agricultural province in China, has achieved remarkable progress in developing rural enterprises. In 1993 rural enterprises in the province produced an output value of 195 billion yuan and a gross profit of 24.18 billion yuan, up 62.5 percent and 76.5 percent over the previous year. Rural enterprises in Gansu and Yunnan Provinces and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region also made breakthroughs and achieved record economic returns in 1993. Local leaders said that the output value of rural enterprises in the two provinces and Guangxi registered 58.4, 41.5 and 71.6 percent of growth respectively last year. However, leaders of the three provinces and Guangxi clearly understood the giant gap between coastal areas and the central and western regions. Zhang Wule, acting governor of Gansu Province, said the central and western regions account for 80 percent of China's land area and 65 percent of rural population. However, the output value of their rural enterprises took up only 35 percent of the national total in 1993. "This gap will have an adverse impact on the economic development of the whole county," Zhang said. According to existing conditions, it is necessary to carry out large-scale cooperation between coastal and central-western regions in the development of rural industry, because the eastern areas have technologies, financial resources and management expertise while the central-western regions abound in raw materials, natural resources and manpower, the acting governor said. Liu Mingzu, chairman of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Regional People's Congress, said the joint-stock cooperative system arising from rural enterprises adapts to economic conditions in central and western regions. It is necessary to spread the system. Leaders of the three provinces and Guangxi agreed that shortage of fund is the key factor restraining the development of rural enterprises in the central and western regions. The State Council has decided that the central treasury will earmark loans to support development of rural enterprises in central and western regions from 1993 to 2000. In addition, the Ministry of Agriculture is preparing a pilot program for east-west rural enterprise cooperation and plans to set up 100 pilot zones for east-west rural enterprise cooperation. In accordance with state industrial policies, the ministry will also select 1,000 pilot projects for developing and upgrading rural industries in central and western regions. At present, provinces and regions in eastern, central and western China are interested in the pilot program. Ten provinces and regions such as Sichuan, Hubei and Guangxi have planned to set up 50 pilot cooperative zones. Leaders of the three provinces and Guangxi region believe that the central and western regions will usher in a new phase of rural industry development thanks to east-west cooperation, support from the central authorities plus local advantages.
