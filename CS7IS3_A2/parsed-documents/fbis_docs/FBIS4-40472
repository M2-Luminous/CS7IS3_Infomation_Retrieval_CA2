In parliament there is an increasingly widespread idea that it would be no bad thing if deputies were to extend their own powers and perhaps those of other institutions of authority. The Federation Council is examining questions which it has no right to examine and is trying to give advice cum injunctions to the State Duma (just try to imagine that sort of thing happening in relations between the Senate and the Congress or the House of Lords and the House of Commons!). Many questions that fall within the competence of parliament are being decided by decrees and edicts. A vast number of laws, edicts, and decrees are being implemented only partly or not at all. The components of the Federation are adopting laws which conflict directly with the laws of the Russian Federation and sometimes conclude what are, to put it mildly, bizarre agreements with the "center." What is there in common between all these and many other facts from our life? It is the fact that in all these cases the laws are being violated but everyone is pretending that nothing has happened and that nothing special is going on. But everyone is sitting in his own corner demanding benefits, subsidies, and aid for himself, his region, or his enterprise. And no one gives a damn for Russia. The impression is being created that there are no citizens of Russia, there are only citizens of the military-industrial complex, the agro-industrial complex, Metrovagonmash [plant building subway cars], and the like. No one particularly wants a conflict: The protection of Russia from collapse in the direct and indeed any other sense of the word is not a topical issue. At the time of the collapse of communism and the USSR there was much talk about the creation of a rule-of-law state and the final departure from the arbitrary rule and lawlessness which existed for decades. Today, however, neither the democrats nor the lawyers say a word when the laws, beginning with the Constitution, are broken. No one is particularly bothered. An incredible toleration of lawlessness has developed. Can you imagine the deputies of even one parliament in the civilized countries which might vote for an extension of their powers beyond those for which the electors voted? No matter how bad the electoral rules are, this is unacceptable. No matter what the circumstances are, I personally will regard 12 December 1995 as the last day of my lawful mandate as a deputy. Especially since, given the absence of a real majority in parliament today, the elections should be brought forward, not put back. Otherwise the state will mark time. The Federation Council, the State Duma, the government, and the president must operate strictly according to the Constitution and the laws, no matter how bad they seem. If unlawful legal acts are adopted in the components of the Federation, the state is obliged to repeal them, not to sign bizarre agreements. If individual parts of the country are, essentially, in revolt and declaring sovereignty, you cannot close your eyes to that fact. Four years after the proclamation of its sovereignty, Russia is still not a rule-of-law state from the purely human viewpoint. Hence the absence of order, the crime, and the corruption, for which no one wants to bear responsibility. I hope that Russia will be able to celebrate both the fifth and the 10th anniversary of the restoration of its sovereignty.
