FBIS4-52839 "dreas094__a94012" FBIS-EAS-94-094-A Daily Report 14 May 1994 ANNEX Japan JNP, DSP To Discuss Dissolution of Kaishin JNP, DSP To Discuss Dissolution of Kaishin OW1505110694 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 14 May 94 Morning Edition p 3--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1505110694 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] Voices demanding dissolution of the lower house floor group "Kaishin"--creation of which caused the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to bolt the coalition--are now growing in the Japan New Party [JNP] and the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] in the ruling camp. The two parties are expected to hold talks to discuss the issue of "Kaishin" early next week. The prevailing view is that even when the floor group is disbanded, "the SDPJ will not return to the coalition" (as an SDPJ staff official predicted). It appears that the two parties want to "at least avoid the situation of fataly damaging relations with the SPDJ" in light of the forthcoming possibilities of the cabinet resigning en masse and the House of Representatives dissolving for a general election. Within the JNP, it is said that "nearly 90 percent of the party members oppose keeping the `Kaishin' group intact" (according to a JNP Dietman). At a standing committee meeting of all party Dietmen on 11 May, voices of criticism were poured on former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and his leadership for causing the SDPJ to bolt the coalition over the Kaishin issue. The issue of criticism was settled on 12 May only after Banri Kaieda, chairman of the public relations committee, proposed that the party "make efforts toward retracting the `Kaishin' concept in cooperation with the DSP," and the members accepted the proposal. In the party also are unceasing voices calling for Hosokawa to step down from the post as the party representative. The retraction of the "Kaishin" concept is, in large measure, aimed at preventing the party from breaking up. The DSP held its meeting of all party Dietmen of both houses at its headquarters on the evening of 13 May. Nearly all the members agreed that the "Kaishin" issue became the cause for the SDPJ to bolt the coalition, and that "this means the DSP should take responsibility for the grave consequence." After the meeting, Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa told reporters the DSP wants to take concerted action with the JNP on this issue, and added: "If disbanding of `Kaishin' could solidify the base of the Hata administration, we must take this into our consideration." Meanwhile, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] is negative about the immediate retraction of the concept because it believes "the disbanding of `Kaishin' should be done as a last resort only" (according to a Shinseito official). Shinseito adviser Tatsuo Ozawa, who was named secretary general of the "Kaishin" floor group, met with SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama on 12 May. Shinseito is now seeking ways to break the current deadlock. But with the likelihood of the SDPJ returning to the coalition being slim, the party appears to be more interested in breaking up the SDPJ-Liberal Democratic Party alliance relationship now.
