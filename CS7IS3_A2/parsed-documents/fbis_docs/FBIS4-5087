He is straining every nerve to convince the Asian nations in particular that Japan will not choose to be a military power. Commenting on this, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says: But what Japan is doing totally gainsays this. In fact, its armed forces are being beefed up and its conversion into a military power is being hastened. The analyst points out: The Japanese Government decided to allocate 45,000 million dollars to military expenditure this year. It must not be overlooked that Japan is arming the "self-defence forces" with long-range attack weapons. Nuclear armament is an immediate main goal in converting Japan into a military power. Having completed material and technical preparations for the manufacture of nuclear weapons, Japan developed and launched even a nuclear-capable space rocket. After paving the way for the dispatch of troops overseas, Japan has taken a mobilisation posture so that it may send large combat units anywhere and any time. In categorically denying Japan's scheme to convert itself into a military power, the Japanese authorities seek to lull the concern of the Asian peoples over the danger of its aggression and dull their caution. It is the ulterior intention of the Japanese ruling quarters to become a military power and realise their old dream of "the greater east Asia coprosperity sphere" with strength. The Asian people are watching the movement of Japan with heightened vigilance. The conversion of Japan into a military power and its overseas aggression will lead it to self-destruction. Japan must act with discretion, not forgetting the lesson of history.
