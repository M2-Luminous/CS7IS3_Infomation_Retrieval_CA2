Until recently public opinion in Russia considered that particular Republic of the former Soviet Union a relatively safe one. Contributing to this was in large part the image of Nursultan Nazarbayev, an intelligent and farsighted politician pursuing a moderate course. Against the backdrop of "ethnic cleansing" in the Baltic countries the de-Russification policy, at first merely of a "precautionary" nature (replacement of Russian city names, restrictions on the activities of Russian Orthodox Church congregations, severe curtailment of Russian-language education, etc.), seemed more tolerant and well-balanced. The situation changed after the Kazakhstani Ministry of Justice decided on 14 December 1993 to ban and forbid registration of all Russian communities. At virtually the same time criminal proceedings were begun against one of the leaders of the Russian community movement, KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent Boris Suprunyuk, who was accused of "inciting interethnic strife." According to a report received from the Congress of Russian Communities [Kongress russkikh obshchin], what is happening is an intentional campaign against the human rights movement. This could inflame the situation in the Republic by prompting retaliatory acts by the non-Kazakh population. This is particularly true of Kazakhstan's northern oblasts, which historically have had a predominantly Russian population. In this situation much will depend on the position taken by Russia's leaders; it is clear that neither side wants another Transdniester on its hands.
