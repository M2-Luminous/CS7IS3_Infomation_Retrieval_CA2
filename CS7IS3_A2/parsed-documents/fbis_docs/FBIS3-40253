They state as the reason for this request the fact that they have proof that these representations have been spreading lies about the entire Croatian people and organizing the delivery of equipment and mercenaries, as well as espionage, for the benefit of Muslim forces which are fighting against the Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina. They claim that they have the following documents as proof of such activities: Muslim passports with falsified data, video shots of the training of Muslims in Slovenia, video shots of anti-Croatian speeches by current Reis-ul-Ulema Ceric at the Zagreb mosque, video shots of the recruitment of mojahedin among Turks and Arabs in Germany, photographs of mojahedin who arrived in Bosnia via Zagreb, video shots showing a UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] officer giving permission to a Muslim unit to carry out an attack, video shots of Muslim criminals of the `Crni Labudovi' [Black Swans] unit, and so forth. It is stated in the protest that data will continue to be gathered and that there are people in the Croatian Ministry of Internal Affairs and Ministry of Defense who are concealing these facts for money.
