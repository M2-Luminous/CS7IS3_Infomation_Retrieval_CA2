Fundamentals of Its Economic Program" [Agrarnaya Partiya Rossii. Osnovy Ekonomicheskoy Programmy"], (authors M.I. Lapshin, L.P. Orlenko, and I.P. Rybkin, published in 1993 by the N.E. Bauman Moscow State Technical School): Who is to blame for Russia's present-day troubles; and what must be done to get out of the state of crisis. The answer to the first, traditional Russian question is not one-dimensional. Those primarily to blame are those who broke up the USSR. The political struggle between the different branches of power which ended in the bloody October events made a considerable contribution to the present-day crisis. Yet the main agents of the crisis are those whose actions generated the "shock therapy" program, which is based on the "Houston Report." This document, compiled by order of the leaders of seven Western countries, is a program (around 1,200 pages long) for integrating the USSR (Russia and the other CIS countries) into the world economy in two to three years. Through a transition to world prices, privatization, liberalization of prices and foreign trade, financial stabilization.... Essentially it is the "Houston Report" that has determined the Russian Government's activity in the last two years. This program's implementation is leading to the destruction of Russia's scientific and technical potential, the bankrupting of the processing industry, the collapse of agriculture, and the utter decline of education, medicine, and culture. The Western program is creating conditions for mass unemployment, a reduction in the population of Russia and the CIS countries, and a drop in the people's living standards. "Shock therapy" is advantageous to the domestic comprador bourgeoisie and the developed countries, which are expanding a raw-material base for themselves, obtaining a market for selling unsold goods, and eliminating a future economic competitor. What is being created in Russia instead of a market and democracy is a criminal mafia society intent on plundering Russia's national wealth in the interests of Western civilization. The work in question sets out a concept for extricating Russia from the crisis. It is based on the implementation in 1994 of a range of measures to halt the decline in production and prevent the population's further impoverishment. These are primarily to stop the illegal export of currency abroad (around $20 billion a year), the unbalanced exchange with CIS countries (losses of $17 billion a year), and the robbery of the overwhelming mass of the population by a small section (around 4 percent) of it; to resume weapons exports (losses of over $15 billion a year); to stimulate (by taxes, credits, subsidies, etc) the production of goods and services; to utilize the banking system to invest in production; to temporarily introduce tight control over the export of raw and other materials, energy, and consumer goods; to end the import of colonial goods into Russia; and to restrain inflation by regulating the entire mechanism of economic instruments (prices, taxes, subsidies, credits, etc). Creating the conditions for economic growth and for building a civilized market requires a corresponding structural reorganization of production, privatization, and the destatization of public property. In order to preserve scientific and technical potential and use it practically it is necessary to form several hundred major corporations like Sony, Boeing, General Motors, and suchlike. A structural reorganization, that is a substantial expansion of the production of goods and services for the population, requires the utilization of the currency which is now "escaping" to foreign countries far and near and into the pockets of swindlers and speculators. These objectives require the corporatization of production and the leasing of enterprises (corporations) to labor collectives or the transfer of enterprises to their economic control, with payment being made for capital and with the possibility of enterprises' being bought out for shared collective ownership. This will enable millions of workers to be made the owners of the fruits of their labor and simultaneously the co-owners of an enterprise. This trend is now gathering momentum in developed countries. Given our criminalized economy, only labor collectives will be able to cope with economic banditry and create the conditions for a civilized, socially oriented market. The law-enforcement organs cannot resolve this task on their own. Supporting agriculture requires a balanced exchange with other sectors, aid to the economic units providing goods for the population, and the termination of aid to foreign private farmers (in the form of imported agricultural products). The buying and selling of agricultural and urban land is not permissible. Otherwise land will be bought up through front men by foreigners and the nouveau riche, who have become wealthy through the impoverishment of pensioners, children, doctors, engineers, military personnel, workers, and peasants. A land free-for-all will lead to the collapse of the agricultural economy and to famine in the cities. Public land must be leased long-term to producers in the countryside (collective and state farms and private farmers). The buying and selling of land must not go beyond the framework of dacha and garden plots and land attached to individual homes. A system of draft laws on privatization, the agricultural economy, social policy, prices and price formation, taxes, finances, and banks, and other topics needs to be drawn up for the State Duma on the basis of the concept of economic reform in question. The adoption of these documents will create the legislative basis for a program of reforms providing an alternative to "shock therapy."
