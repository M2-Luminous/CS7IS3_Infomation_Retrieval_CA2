Living Buddha Yexiong Zhanyanggendeng Jianchuo, deputy to the provincial people's congress and vice chairman of the Huangnan Zang Autonomous Prefectural People's Congress, who had just returned from a panel discussion, enthusiastically showed us into the room, and accepted our interview with pleasure. The Living Buddha, in his red patchwork outer vestment and with a string of beads in his hand, has a stout physique and a sedate countenance and manner. He is 47 years old this year, and a cousin of the late Great Master Bainqen Erdini Qoigyi Gyaincain. He was tonsured when he was four years old, and is now the abbot of several monasteries, including Xunhua's Wendu Monastery and Tongren's Yexiong Monastery, as well as a council member in charge of the Buddhist Association of China. When we talked of the late Great Master Bainqen, Living Buddha Ye Xiong became very excited, saying that Great Master Bainqen Erdini often had taken care of him, and had showed great concern for him in many ways. In particular, he had accompanied Great Master Bainqen Erdini to visit Tibet on three occasions, and personally had heard Great Master Bainqen Erdini propagate party policy, and his several talks on safeguarding the motherland's unity. He said: The government work report has summarized the 1993 economic work in the province, and was inspiring. This year, the whole province, from top to bottom, should take longer strides so as to accelerate the pace of economic development. As one from the religious circles, he said that he too should exert efforts. In excitement, he raised his hands and said: The patriotism and religious devotion of the late Great Master Bainqen were genuine. Patriotism and religious devotion are likened to a man's two hands; one hand represents patriotism, and the other religious devotion. In completing any undertaking, neither hand is dispensable. Patriotism means to be in favor of socialism, and to support the party and government in developing the economy, whereas religious devotion means to observe state laws, decrees, rules and regulations conscientiously; explain Buddhist teachings; safeguard the unity of the motherland; and strengthen nationality solidarity. Here the Living Buddha indicated that it had been stressed in the government work report that normal religious activities must be protected, whereas there must be a stern crackdown on lawbreaking activities that take advantage of religion to engage in actions that endanger society, stability and unity. That passage is well put, and I approve of it with both hands. Should patriotism and religious devotion be absent in any religious person, this will violate the most basic religious teaching. He added: Those individuals who have failed to abide by basic religious teachings are like a burning cigarette butt: If it is allowed to burn, a fire may break out and endanger the monastery, as well as other people. Such people must be purged from the religious circles. Living Buddha Ye Xiong continued, only by strengthening unity and maintaining stability will it be possible to pursue construction, and achieve economic development. When the nation prospers, Buddhism will prosper, too. Patriotism and religious devotion are the common aspiration. When the reporters concluded the interview and expressed their thanks to Living Buddha Yexiong, the latter wanted the reporters to relay one of his suggestions, which is that specific departments should be given specific help when they conduct experimental exploration in developing production to support the maintenance of monasteries. For example, some plots of land, or hill slopes, or woods should be allotted to them. Thus their abilities will be strengthened, and the financial burden of the government and the masses will be relieved. When the reporters nodded approval of relaying his opinion to related departments, Living Buddha Yexiong happily signed his name on the reporters' books in beautiful Tibetan calligraphy.
