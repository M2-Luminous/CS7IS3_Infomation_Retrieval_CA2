We are here at the office of General Antonio Riviello Bazan, secretary of national defense, who has kindly approved of this interview with the Mexican news agency NOTIMEX. Good day, General. [Riviello] Good day. [Alvarez] Sir, the talks for peace and reconciliation began today in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas. What is the opinion of the Mexican Army and the secretary of national defense regarding this round of negotiations? [Riviello] In the first place, I would like to tell you that I thank you for your presence here at the National Defense Secretariat, which allows us to convey our views to Mexican society. I would tell you that the members of the Army and Air Force support the decision of the government of the republic to continue the path of political solutions over armed confrontation. We believe this is the most appropriate way to attain peace and reconciliation in the Chiapas highlands. [Alvarez] What are the measures that the Army will adopt regarding the troops based in the area, particularly those in the area of conflict? [Riviello] As we have said on various occasions, since the day the president of the republic decreed the cease-fire, the troops returned to their garrisons in order to preserve the security of the towns. Since then, the troops have avoided all operating movements [movimientos operativos] that could interfere with peace negotiations. [Alvarez] Will the conflict in Chiapas have an effect on the Mexican Army? Will it affect the Army's organization, training, or reconnaissance of potential conflict areas, for instance? [Riviello] Our legislation is very clear in that regard. The Basic Law of the Army and Air Force establishes that to fulfill their missions these services must organize, train, and equip themselves with the requirements demanded by their missions. We have not stopped fulfilling these ordinances. However, these circumstances have given us the opportunity to assess our deployment and concentration capacity and, of course, to train our ground and air troops [one-second break in reception] Regarding the areas of potential conflict, I can tell you and our compatriots that the security missions encompass not only Chiapas but all the national territory. [Alvarez] Gen. Riviello, without a doubt, the Mexican Army has contributed since the beginning to create conditions for the political dialogue in Chiapas. Do you believe that the media have objectively reported the actions of the National Defense Secretariat? [Riviello] Since the beginning of the conflict, the National Defense Secretariat has issued several communiques explaining in a specific and honest manner the information available to the public. Now, regarding the media's handling of that information, I can tell you that their reporting has been very accurate. However, they have carried out their duty from different perspectives and according to their opinions. [Alvarez] General, Gen. Absalon Castellanos was finally released after 45 days of being held captive. Do you think that the release of Gen. Castellanos is a good start for the dialogue on peace and reconciliation? [Riviello] I think that this event represents a step forward. [words indistinct] Castellanos had been held illegally. His release reduces the existing tension and improves the possibilities of solution through dialogue, which has been the offer of the government of the republic. [Alvarez] If you had to summarize, how would you evaluate of the Mexican Army's performance during the Chiapas conflict? [Riviello] I believe I addressed that in a previous question. I would like to add that the Army and Air Force prepare and train continuously to be ready to accomplish their missions. These missions include guaranteeing internal order, to which they responded efficiently to reestablish peace and guarantee the security of the inhabitants in strict compliance with the law. [Alvarez] Allow me to ask a somewhat elaborate question now. Following the Chiapas conflict, have you considered the possibility of reinforcing our country's borders militarily? Perhaps not because of the continued speculation about foreign participation in the conflict, but because the enormous amount of information has shown that our southern border is highly vulnerable. [Riviello] As the public knows, the relations Mexico has with its bordering neighbors are of total respect and sincere cordiality. The borders are in fact quite vulnerable, given their geographic characteristics and their length. To reinforce them militarily requires an enormous economic and human effort, which cannot really be justified by the purpose. I would like to remind you that we have always had personnel stationed along the southern border to aid in the fight against drug trafficking and ensure national security. [Alvarez] General, has the Chiapas conflict had any kind of political effect within the Mexican Army? [Riviello] I would say that it has allowed us to reaffirm our commitment and loyalty by placing the fulfillment of our specific duties above our personal interests for the benefit of social peace. This implies the commitment Mexican soldiers have to serve Mexico. [Alvarez] Finally, General Riviello, do you believe certain human rights organizations have politicized the issue or lost their objectiveness? [Riviello] Allow me to say that these organizations are of great importance to society and therefore deserve our respect, especially those which carry out their duty objectively. Now, regarding the possibility that some have politicized their work, I would say that they would be making a serious mistake if they were to trade such a noble goal for some sort of political interest.
