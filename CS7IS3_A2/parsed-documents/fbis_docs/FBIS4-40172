Shakhray said that the matter was not whether to unite or not but how to unite. Shakhray stressed that integration must be carried out in a civilized way, equitably and voluntarily, preserving the political sovereignty of the countries involved. Otherwise, he said, the result could be the use of force. Shakhray said that the issue of uniting and restoring economic and other ties was now a factor of political stability in all CIS states, including Russia. "The forms and the title of the new integration can vary," Shakhray said. He added that the CIS will be becoming more and more efficient and friendship with Russia will be the victor at the presidential elections in Belarus and Ukraine.
