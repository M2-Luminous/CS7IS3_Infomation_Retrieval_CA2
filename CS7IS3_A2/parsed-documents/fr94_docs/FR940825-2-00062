SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The information collection described below has been submitted to OMB for review in order to obtain a renewal of OMB approval prior to expiration of the currently assigned OMB control number (3069&hyph;0002) on October 31, 1994. Title of Information Collection: Personal Certification and Disclosure Forms. Need For and Use of Information Collection: The Federal Home Loan Bank Act (Bank Act) establishes certain eligibility requirements for Federal Home Loan Bank (Bank) appointive and elective directors and authorizes the Federal Housing Finance Board (Board) to promulgate rules implementing these requirements. See 12 U.S.C. 1422b(a)(1), 1427(a), (b), (d). Selected provisions of parts 931 and 932 of the Board's regulations (director eligibility provisions) implement the statutory eligibility requirements for Bank directors. See 12 CFR parts 931 and 932. The information collection is used by Board staff to determine whether prospective and seated Bank directors satisfy the statutory eligibility requirements and are carrying out their official responsibilities without conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest. The director eligibility provisions require appointive directors; candidates for appointive director; elective directors; and nominees for elective director to file forms with the Board certifying their compliance with the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and disclosing certain financial relationships. Where the information collected indicates that an appointive director candidate or elective director nominee is not eligible to serve, the person is so notified, and his or her name is withdrawn from consideration for the directorship, unless the person intends to remedy the ineligibility. If the information collected reveals that a seated appointive director is ineligible to serve, the director is so notified and is either required to resign or given the opportunity, in the Board's discretion, to cure the ineligibility. If the information collected indicates that a seated elective director is ineligible, the person is so notified, and the directorship becomes vacant immediately, by operation of the statute. See 12 U.S.C. 1427(f)(3). The Board would promptly notify the affected Bank of any vacancies that have arisen on its board. Description of Likely Respondents: The respondents to this information collection will include all Bank appointive directors; candidates for appointive director; elective directors; and nominees for elective director. Estimate of Burden: The total annual average number of respondents is estimated at 350, with one response required per respondent. The average hours per response is estimated at 0.9 hours.
