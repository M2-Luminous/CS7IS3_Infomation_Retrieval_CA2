"I am grateful to all North Ossetian electors who supported my candidature at the Russian presidential elections. The new Russian parliament will have to work hard in the name of economic revival of the country and its indivisibility. My hopes are pinned on the new Russian constitution approved by the people," he said. Speaking of the North Ossetian presidential elections scheduled for January 16, Dzasokhov noted the supreme official should personify the spirit of accord and well-wishing in the multi- national republic. Any social-economic policy can be successful only on this basis. "I would wish the future North Ossetian president to be more active in solution of personnel issues and combine experience and youth. When introducing the presidency in Northern Ossetia, we should clearly decide on our foreign and domestic policy, development of the social sphere and perfection of inter-ethnic relations," added Dzasokhov.
