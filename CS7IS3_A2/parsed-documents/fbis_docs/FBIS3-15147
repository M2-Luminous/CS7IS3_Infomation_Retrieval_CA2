The deputies thus approved the institution of a presidential republic. Does this mean moving to the next stage now -- that is, to elections of the future leader of the state and head of executive power in the republic? [Hryb] No. It does not mean yet that Belarus will have a presidency, because these sections which have been voted on by named ballot will be part of the section on the constitution. And only when we adopt the constitution as a whole and determine, adopt a resolution on the procedure for bringing it into effect will this section, that is, the one on introducing a presidency, come into force. If we do not adopt the constitution in the Supreme Soviet, I will use my right to submit this question to a national referendum.
