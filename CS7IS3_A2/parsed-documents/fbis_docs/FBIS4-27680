FBIS4-27680 "dreas107_d_94019" FBIS-EAS-94-107 Daily Report 3 Jun 1994 South Korea * Concern Over Prime Minister's Lack of Authority * Concern Over Prime Minister's Lack of Authority 94P30059 94P30059 CSO [Editorial Report] The May 17 TONG-A ILBO editorial on page 3 expressed concern over the new prime minister's lack of authority. On 4 May, Yi Yong-tok, in office for only five days, issued a memorandum revising regulations on official vehicle usage for government-funded businesses and institutes. The memo, which had a 14 May suspense date, requested all concerned to prepare an action plan and return it to his office. Although there are 340 such businesses and institutes, not even one has carried out his order. Were the plan to be implemented, the government could save over 100 billion won annually. It appears the Prime Minister's office is trying not to make this non-compliance a major issue. The office made the excuse that 10 days was not enough for the offices to make their reports. The editorial pointed out that saving 100 billion won isn't a minor issue, but the real problem is a powerless prime minister. Without authority, he cannot have an effective working relationship with his cabinet or with the National Assembly. Former Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang left office because he couldn't establish his authority. The editorial urged President Kim to grant the prime minister sufficient authority so he can act to reform the government. It also reminded the president that the real victims--should Yi fail to carry out his job--are the people; not the government, not the National Assembly, nor Yi Yong-tok and his office.
