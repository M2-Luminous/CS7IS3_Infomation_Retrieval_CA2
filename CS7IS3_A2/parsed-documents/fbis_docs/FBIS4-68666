Khamidullin, deputy prime minister of the Republic of Tatarstan, at the 19th Session of the Republic of Tatarstan Supreme Soviet: "Results of the Republic of Tatarstan's Socioeconomic Development in 1993 and the Forecast for 1994"] [Text] Esteemed People's Deputies! A most important event in the life of the republic was the conclusion of the treaty between Russia and Tatarstan, which affords new opportunities for the socioeconomic development of the republic. The government has drawn up and adopted an action program for realization of the treaty, which will largely determine the directions of our activity in the current year. Permit me to dwell briefly on the progress of the economic reforms. Mention should be made briefly of being among the most important measures in this sphere in 1993 for the further development of the processes of privatization and denationalization in accordance with the republic program approved by the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan. More than 300 enterprises with summary statutory capital of more than R427 billion have been privatized in the course of its realization. They include the Tatneft, Nizhnekamskneftekhim, and Orgsintez associations, the Kazan Engine-Building, Kazan Helicopter, and Tatmyasoprom plants and the Chistopol Watch Works, the Tatnefteprovodstroy Trust, and others. The privatized industrial enterprises manufactured more than 40 percent of the total commodity product. The privatization of housing has begun. Work on the issue of registered privatization deposits got under way. Fifteen specialized check investment funds, which have altogether accumulated privatization checks totaling more than R10 billion, were functioning in the republic by the end of the year. F.G. Khamidullin went on to say that as a result of the many months of work of a large group of specialists, scientists, and employees of economic departments a program of the targeted social protection of the populace, the first in the CIS in practice, had been prepared. Its realization will make it possible to protect more efficiently the needy strata of the population of the republic under the conditions of the development of market relations. An important instrument of government regulation of the economy in 1993 was the use of the system of the preferential allocation of credit. A special commission of experts under the auspices of the State Committee for Economics and Forecasting made an expert appraisal of almost 400 specific plans presented by the enterprises, took the most efficient of them, and recommended them to the government for the preferential allocation of credit under the strict supervision of the banks and the State Committee for Economics and Forecasting. Realization of the agrarian reform continues. Of the 884 kolkhozes and sovkhozes which underwent reregistration, 702 retained their status, and 182 farms were reorganized. More than 4,000 persons are employed at the 725 peasant (private) farms that are operating at this time. They have been allocated 24,300 hectares of land, 642 tractors, 340 motor vehicles, 78 grain-harvesting combines, and the requisite set of agricultural equipment. Some R589 million of credit resources and R170 million from the republic budget were allocated last year for the development and formation of these farms. The speaker then called the deputies' attention to certain negative trends causing the government particular concern. It is a question primarily of the decline in industrial production. The main reason is the nonpayments problem. The sum total of receivables from customers, the majority of whom are outside of the Republic of Tatarstan, amounted as of 1 March to approximately R2.3 trillion, of which more than one-third is past due. The economic development of our republic also will depend to a considerable extent on the measures that are adopted to resolve the problem of arrears on the scale of Russia. After all, a large part of the biggest enterprises works for the Russian market. Another problem is the enterprises' lack of preparedness for operating under the conditions of the competition that has arisen and their inadequate knowledge of market conditions. The year of 1994 must be one of the real stimulation of the structural reorganization of the entire economy. What are the specific directions of the structural transformations? One of the main ones is a fundamental restructuring of the military-industrial complex. The transformations have begun by way of the state's selective support on the basis of a competitive seeding of the most rapidly recoupable business projects in areas of significance for the republic. Conversion problems came to be tackled more actively in 1994 with the Russian Federation Government. Specifically, measures to reduce the debt to enterprises of the republic's military-industrial complex for special products manufactured in 1993 were adopted. The enterprises have begun to obtain funds for advance payments for the defense order for 1994. This is a direct result of the treaty that has been concluded between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan. A special commission has been formed under the auspices of the State Committee for Economics and Forecasting of the Republic of Tatarstan for a fuller analysis of fulfillment of the mutual commitments in respect to the defense block. Serious structural changes are needed in the republic's oil and petrochemical complexes. An oil-producing republic lacking extended petroleum refining for fuel and oil remains dependent on monopoly refiners. In addition, the reserves of high-grade oil are being depleted, and the wear and tear and depreciation of the petrochemical works continue. This is why a number of alternatives involving the attraction of foreign capital is being worked up and the Neftekhiminvestk holding industrial and financial group has been created in the republic. The areas for a number of new crops--corn for grain, rape, and sunflower for oil seeds--are being increased in sectors of the agro-industrial complex. The breed is being improved in animal husbandry. Thus we have smaller numbers of cows than in neighboring Bashkortostan, but the dairy product output is greater here. The facilities for the processing of the agricultural product are being reinforced at the same time--the sugar refineries, meat-packing plants, and milk-conversion enterprises are being modernized. The purpose of all these transformations is to improve the republic's food balance to achieve self-sufficiency in the basic food types with the simultaneous creation of a competitive market environment. The structural transformations should also encompass other sectors, the nonproduction sphere included. Thus the market is already signaling a shortage of skilled managers, accountants, and other people capable of working under market conditions. The entire ideology of government support for structural transformations of the economy is essentially changing. Support must be targeted exclusively at a specifically computed project. The times of support for everyone in succession have passed. The structural transformations will produce results with simultaneous institutional changes. The development of alternative forms of property and competition and the formation of a secondary securities market will create a fundamentally new environment for all subjects of the market. Support for enterprise should be among the priority areas in 1994. A draft of the corresponding program has with the active participation of the Trade and Industry Chamber of the Republic of Tatarstan been prepared in execution of the edict of the president of the Republic of Tatarstan. It provides for measures of support for small business and the priority areas of the economy, the granting of tax privileges and preferential credit included. The realization of this program will contribute to the further development of the infrastructure of the market and the formation of a competitive environment. An acceleration of the pace of denationalization and privatization will contribute to a considerable extent to the development of market relations in the republic. A further 450 enterprises will be privatized in 1994. They include the Tatenergo and Zavod imeni Sergo associations, computer systems, Elekon, and others. The privatized industrial enterprises will manufacture more than three-fourths of the total commodity product in the republic as a whole. The set task for the creation of a competitive environment in 1994 is an acceleration of the rate of privatization of trade, public catering, and consumer service facilities. A most important task of 1994 is the privatization of housing. Only 5 percent of the apartments out of the total amount of housing subject to privatization has been privatized in the republic at the present time. It is contemplated having raised this indicator to 30 percent by the year's end. Proceeding from the current situation, the speaker emphasized, the forecast of the economic and social development of the republic for 1994 is oriented toward support for the life-sustaining sectors of production and also selective support for the enterprises that are prepared to secure the rapid recovery of the resources invested in the interests of the republic's economy. Industrial production is to constitute R12.365 trillion, and output in comparable prices will decline 17 percent here. The overall decline in the level of production in the republic as a whole will be influenced appreciably by fuel industry. The reason for this is the reduction in the production of oil and gas, the continued deterioration in the structure of the reserves, and the fraught environmental situation. Accordingly, a decline in production in petrochemical industry and power engineering is anticipated; a decline of 15 percent is forecast at enterprises of the defense sectors. A number of enterprises, including the Kama Truck Plant, is forecasting an increase in the manufacture of its product in the mechanical engineering and metal-working sectors. A certain increase in production is expected in the food sectors of industry. Despite the crisis situation, a number of associations and enterprises is operating in stable fashion. They include computer system associations, the Chistopol Watchworks, and the Tochmash Plant. The Terminal Association and the Plant imeni Gorkiy, which have pretty good prospects, have begun to increase the pace of production. The process of the conclusion of trade and economic agreements with countries of the near abroad for the supply of material and technical resources is becoming more purposeful and efficient. Agreements have been concluded at the present time with Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova, and the Republic of Lithuania, and agreements with 37 regions of the Russian Federation have been extended. In 1994, according to forecast estimates, the production of consumer goods will constitute 100.2 percent, including 103.4 percent for foodstuffs and 96.7 percent for nonfood commodities. An increase in the manufacture of basic consumer commodities like refrigerators, synthetic detergents, toilet soap, footwear, and knitwear is expected in the current year. It is planned to maintain the trend of a stabilization of the production of agricultural products in 1994. Purchases of agricultural products for republic food stocks will remain practically unchanged. It is contemplated continuing the government support for the agro-industrial complex in the current year. Budget resources will be channeled, in the main, into an increase in the fertility of the land--the compensation of expenditure on the purchase of mineral fertilizers and chemical plant-protection agents, a fundamental improvement in the land, support for pedigree breeding and elite seed growing, and scientific-personnel support. The funding of the construction and modernization of the most important enterprises of the food and processing industry, the supply of gas and electricity to the countryside, and social and cultural amenities is planned also. It is planned allocating from the republic budget R310 billion for these areas. It is contemplated preserving for the purpose of the social protection of the population of the republic the subsidies on animal husbandry products purchased for republic needs. Approximately 27 percent of the expenditure side of the republic budget is earmarked for the funding of the agro-industrial complex altogether, subsidies included. Land reform will continue. The reform of the kolkhozes and sovkhozes, which will to a considerable extent interest the workers of the countryside in the end results of production, will be completed. An increase in the number of peasant (private) farms is forecast. It is planned to render them government support from budget appropriations and make soft loans available in the current year. According to the forecast estimates of enterprises of food and processing industry, an increase in the production of foodstuffs of 3.4 percent (in comparable prices, counting alcoholic beverages) is envisaged for 1994. An increase in the production of wholemilk products (in milk equivalent), macaroni products, flour, and canned fruit and vegetables is scheduled. The forecast for 1994 as a whole in terms of all sources of funding envisages the assimilation of R2.5 trillion of capital investments with a decline compared to the 1993 level in comparable prices of 28.6 percent. The allocation of capital investments for the construction of housing for persons demobilized from the armed forces and certain other facilities totaling R56.5 billion from the budget of the Russian Federation is contemplated. Aside from this, a whole number of other federal targeted programs, in which enterprises and organizations of the republic may participate thanks to the treaty that has been concluded with Russia, is being drawn up. The leaders of enterprises, ministries, and departments should step up their efforts for the specific development of projects with Russian departments. The Government of the Republic of Tatarstan has performed the corresponding preparatory work. It will be hard in the coming years to expect under the conditions of a reduction in production, the arrears crisis, and the high rate of inflation a significant increase in investments from the resources of enterprises of all forms of ownership and the republic budget. The funds of commercial banks and foreign investments could be realistic sources of an increase in investments. In 1994 the proportion of funds channeled into construction for nonproduction purposes is forecast at the level of 37.7 percent against the actual 1993 level of 35.2 percent; this ratio will be maintained thanks to the republic budget, in the main. The introduction of housing with a total area of 980,000 square meters, 91,400 square meters of which will be for the movement of residents out of dilapidated and dangerous housing, is contemplated from all sources of financing in the present year. The government has adopted a decision on the supplementary allocation of funds for the construction of housing for the handicapped and participants in the Great Patriotic War. It is contemplated through the efforts of individual developers building 320,000 square meters of housing, which is 25 percent more than was introduced in 1993. The forecast envisages the introduction of general schools for 9,900 students (101 percent of the 1993 level), preschools for 3,110 children (103.8 percent), hospitals with 749 beds (179 percent), general clinics catering for 1,720 visits per shift (116.2 percent), and clubhouses with 4,000 seats (87.7 percent). The adoption of the laws of the Republic of Tatarstan "The Subsistence Minimum" and "The Minimum Wage" created the legislative basis for the stabilization and prevention of a decline in personal living standards. A legislative provision specifying that the minimum wage may not be lower than the subsistence minimum has for the first time been made the basis of the calculation of wage-increase indicators for 1994. It is forecast that, despite the considerable decline in production, the average wage in 1994 will increase by a factor of 4.1 compared with 1993 and will in December 1994 be in excess of R400,000 per worker. An increase in the remuneration of the employees of publicly funded organizations also is specified in the draft budget with regard to this rate of increase in the average wage. With a growth of consumer prices by a factor of 4.3 approximately compared with the 1993 level the increase in the price of goods and services constituting the subsistence minimum will be regulated and should not exceed the 3.8-fold level. That is, the forecast provides for a preferential growth of wages (by a factor of 4.1) compared with the value of the subsistence minimum (a factor of 3.8). Realization of the program of targeted social protection of the population will continue. The amount of the sums of compensation to the needy strata of the populace in the form of food checks (more than 140,000 inhabitants of the republic are currently being paid a sum total of more than R5 billion a month) will increase proportionate to the increase in the value of the subsistence minimum. It is contemplated making the subsidies for transport services, for provision of the public with fuel, and for medication specifically targeted in 1994. A 50 percent reduction in fares on suburban motor transport will be introduced in the period from 1 May through 1 October. A whole set of measures pertaining to the social protection of the population is envisaged by an agreement among the Cabinet of Ministers, the republic Council of Trade Unions, and the Association of State-Owned Enterprises of Tatarstan for 1994. Realization of the comprehensive "Care" program for an improvement in services for war and labor veterans, elderly single citizens, and the handicapped will continue. Funds for the organization of the summer recreation and health and fitness of children and funds for the support of the children of employees of publicly funded organizations in preschools will be allocated from the republic budget. The forecast of the labor market for the republic for 1994 contemplates a level of unemployment that is no higher than 1.5 percent of the workforce. Financial assistance to enterprises and organizations for the creation of approximately 12,000 jobs is envisaged simultaneously within the framework of the Employment Program (2,453 jobs were created thanks to resources of the Employment Fund in 1993). Switching to the concluding part of the report, F.G. Khamidullin emphasized that work had been under way for more than a year in the republic on a draft concept of socioeconomic development incorporating a reform of the organs of administration. The provisions of the concept are currently being specified in the light of the treaty and the agreements concluded with Russia. It will upon completion be presented to the people of the republic. The independence and rights of Tatarstan accorded by the treaty demand increased responsibility for all business in the republic. Questions of the strictest austerity in all types of material, labor, and financial resources are particularly pertinent. The government is contemplating a number of organizational and economic measures in this direction. On the whole, the year promises to be difficult, and the crisis has not yet been overcome, but there will in the present year be appreciable qualitative changes in the economy laying the foundations of prospects of an improvement in the general economic situation.
