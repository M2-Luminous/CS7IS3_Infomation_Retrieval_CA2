ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action amends the East Coast Low Control Area by expanding the area in the vicinity of Nantucket, MA, to allow aircraft executing the Localizer Back Course Runway 6 instrument approach procedure at Nantucket Memorial Airport, Nantucket, MA (ACK), to remain in controlled airspace at lower altitudes, and thereby promote the efficient use of that airspace. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901, u.t.c., February 2, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Karl D. Anderson, Management System Specialist, System Management Branch, ANE&hyph;530, Federal Aviation Administration, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299; telephone, (617) 238&hyph;7530; facsimile, (617) 238&hyph;7560. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On June 28, 1994, the FAA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) by amending the East Coast Low Control Area in the vicinity of Nantucket, MA. The proposal addressed a need to more efficiently use the airspace in the vicinity of Nantucket Island by allowing aircraft executing the Localizer Back Course Runway 6 instrument approach procedure at Nantucket Memorial Airport (ACK) to remain in controlled airspace at lower altitudes. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal of the FAA. No comments on the proposal were received. Designations for Low Control Areas are published in Paragraph 6007 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The amendment to the Offshore Airspace Area designated in this document will be published subsequently in the Order The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends the East Coast Low Control Area in the vicinity of Nantucket, MA. The effect of this action is to allow aircraft executing the Localizer Back Course Runway 6 Instrument Approach at the Nantucket Memorial Airport, Nantucket, MA (ACK) to remain in controlled airspace at lower altitudes. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore (1) is not a ``Significant Regulatory Action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
