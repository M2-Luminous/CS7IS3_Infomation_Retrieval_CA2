Informed sources told ITAR-TASS that the talks focused on the political situation in Russia. The American side displayed deep interest in how relations between the Russian president and parliament are being established. The State Duma chairman assured his interlocutor that notwithstanding all shades of factions in the parliament and differences, the striving for interaction with the president prevails among the legislators. Such an interaction should be carried out in two key directions: the first one is to untangle the whole knot of economic problems of the country through a stable legislative basis meeting the present state of reforms and the second - to search for a broader consensus for national concord and reconciliation, the duma chairman said. Rybkin emphasized that as far as he understands, reforms are not at all what was implied at an early stage of their implementation, when the mood of economic euphoria and romanticism were reigning. Talbott agreed that now the time has come if not for making radical, then at least significant reappraisal of what is happening. Elections in Russia have given Washington a serious signal as to which direction reforms should proceed in, he said. According to him, as far as reforms are concerned the Duma is in constructive mood. The U.S. deputy secretary of state emphasised that from Washington's point of view, Russia is now playing a positive role in resolving the Bosnian crisis. In his turn, Rybkin said that Russia gives top priority to cooperation with the United States, since in the contemporary world two countries just canot go without each other. During the talks considerable attention was paid to prospects of cooperation with the CIS states. The American side in principle agrees that Russia is a stablilizing factor in this region and its peace efforts are for the time being not running counter to universally acceptable political standards and deserve Washington's support.
