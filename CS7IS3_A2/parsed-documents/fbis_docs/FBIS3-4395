Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, gave an important speech at the opening ceremony of these two conferences. He emphasized: Leaders at all levels and comrades on the propaganda work front and organizational work front in Tianjin should have a clearer understanding of the overall interest of the work of the entire party, subordinate to and serve this overall interest, raise spirit, work in a down-to-earth manner, open up a new situation in propaganda and ideological work and in organizational work, and provide an effective ideological guarantee and organizational guarantee for Tianjin's reform, opening up, and modernization drive. Gao Dezhan's speech consisted of three parts: 1) The issue on clearly understanding the overall interest of the work of the entire party and thoroughly implementing the guidelines of the second enlarged plenary session of the sixth municipal party committee, 2) The issue on conscientiously implementing the guidelines of the national propaganda and ideological work conference and strengthening and improving propaganda and ideological work, and 3) The issue on conscientiously implementing the guidelines of the national forum of directors of organization departments and further strengthening organizational work. Li Jianguo, deputy secretary of the municipal party committee, presided over the conferences. The major guidelines of the national propaganda and ideological work conference and the national forum of directors of organization departments were relayed. Attending were municipal leading comrades Li Shenglin, Yang Zhihua, Fang Fengyou, Song Pingshun, Luo Yuanpeng, Zheng Zhiying, Wang Hongjiang, and Zhang Guanwen. Gao Dezhan said in his speech: At the national propaganda and ideological work conference, Comrade Jiang Zemin gave profound expositions on the basic principles for the work of the entire party for this year and the overall interest of the work. We must earnestly study and profoundly understand them and make propaganda and ideological work, organizational work, and the work in various fields of the party subordinate to and serve the endeavor of "seizing the opportunity to deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, promote development, and maintain stability," which meets the overall interest. The guidelines of the second enlarged plenary session of the sixth municipal party committee are totally in conformity to the principles for the work of the entire party and the overall interest of the work as defined by the party Central Committee. We should conscientiously implement the arrangements of the party Central Committee and, focusing on the overall interest of the work of the entire party, implement more thoroughly the guidelines of the second enlarged plenary session of the sixth municipal party committee and comprehensively fulfill all the targets and tasks as put forward in the major points of the municipal party committee's 1994 work. Gao Dezhan said: Since the second enlarged plenary session of the sixth municipal party committee, all departments, committees, offices, districts, counties, and bureaus have conscientiously relayed and implemented the guidelines of the session, stepped up efforts to start up work, and carried out in a down-to-earth manner. They had a fairly good beginning and a very good development trend. However, this was only a beginning, and the development in different localities and departments was also uneven. Thus the tasks remain very arduous to fulfill the work targets put forward by the municipal party committee. To make this year's work successful, we should continue to pay attention to the following key areas from ideological understanding to specific practice and continue to raise our leadership level and work level. First, we should firmly embrace the awareness of opportunity and the awareness of development and further enhance the sense of urgency and responsibility. Second, we should fully understand that reform and opening up are the motivation and the basic way of development and firmly embrace the idea of relying on reform to promote development. Third, we should persistently take economic construction as the central task, muster efforts to promote the economy, and maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. We should attach importance not only to the increase in the total supply and total demand, but we should also attach importance to the improvement of the quality of economic development. In developing the economy, we should have new ideas and should devote great efforts to and achieve major breakthroughs in adjusting the structure, strengthening management, achieving technological advance, ending deficits and increasing profits, raising efficiency, and improving the quality of staff members and workers. Fourth, we should have a good command of the relationship between reform, development, and stability. Fifth, we should persistently take the "three advantages" as the basic criterion for judging all work, strive to develop social productive forces, enhance the economic strength, and upgrade people's living standard. We should keep the interests of the masses in mind, do everything for them, rely on them in doing work, and exert utmost efforts to seek benefits and do practical work for them. Sixth, we should persistently "attend to two tasks and be competent in both." Economic construction should be promoted to a new height, and so should the spiritual civilization. We should strengthen propaganda and ideological work; strengthen democracy and the legal system; step up efforts to comprehensively improve public security; actively develop all social undertakings; promote overall social progress; and make sure that economic and social undertakings develop in a coordinated manner. Gao Dezhan said: The general demand on Tianjin's propaganda and ideological work for this year is to conscientiously implement the guidelines of the important speeches delivered by Jiang Zemin and other central leading comrades at the national propaganda and ideological work conference, take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the basic guide, arm the people with scientific theories, guide them with correct public opinion, mold them with noble spirit, encourage them with outstanding works, provide an effective ideological guarantee and a good media environment for accelerating the establishment of the socialist market economy system, facilitating sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development, safeguarding social stability, and promoting overall social progress, and mobilize, unite, and encourage party members and the masses more successfully to advance Tianjin's reform, opening up, and modernization drive. Gao Dezhan said: In the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, propaganda and ideological work shoulders great missions and has a direct bearing on the overall situation of the modernization drive. Leading cadres at all levels should enhance ideological understanding and have more initiative and stronger sense of responsibility in making propaganda and ideological work successful. In the new situation, this work merits more attention and should never be neglected; and it should only be greatly strengthened and improved and never be weakened or become stagnant. Gao Dezhan emphasized: In compliance with the requirements put forward in Comrade Jiang Zemin's important speech, the propaganda and ideological front should persistently take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the basic guide and strive to achieve success in the four aspects of work. First, it should thoroughly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory and use this theory to arm the minds of the vast number of party members, cadres, and the masses. This is the most important task for the propaganda and ideological front. The propaganda and ideological front should continue to intensify the study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, exert more efforts to read it in the origin, master its essence, integrate theory with practice, and unify thinking to guide work. It should further intensify theoretical propaganda and theoretical study. Second, it should persist in the correct media guidance and do a better job in the propaganda by the media. In carrying out propaganda and media work, it should adhere to the party's basic line, unswervingly maintain political unity with the party Central Committee, uphold the principle of unity, stability, encouragement, and propaganda through positive examples, and make sure that the political orientation is firm and correct, the propaganda style is healthy and progressive, sensitive issues are properly handled, and a good media environment is created for reform, development and stability. Third, it should intensify ideological and moral education and carry out the activities to build the spiritual civilization in a down-to-earth manner. Fourth, it should greatly advocate the main melody, make culture and art flourish, and strive to provide more and better nourishment for the minds of the masses. He pointed out: Party committees at all levels should attach great importance to propaganda and ideological work, conscientiously hold the responsibility for it, truly place it high on their agenda, and comprehensively strengthen leadership over it. They should enforce strict system of responsibility for work targets, make earnest efforts to attain them, and pay close attention to and make conscientious efforts in all the work of the propaganda and ideological front. Speaking on further strengthening organizational work, Gao Dezhan said: The tasks of the organizational work for this year are very heavy. The general demand is to take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as the guide and, proceeding from the overall interest of the work of the entire party, strive to meet the needs of the new situation, achieve success in party building, step up efforts to improve leading bodies at all levels, strengthen and improve grass- roots party organizations and the education and management of party members, and provide an organizational guarantee for deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, promoting development, maintaining stability, and facilitating overall social progress. This year, we should take party building as key work, persist in the practice of making the party take charge of party affairs, and run the party strictly. Party organizations at all levels should concentrate effort on party building and devote more efforts to it. They should focus on the economy to promote party building, promote the economy by making party building successful, and achieve notable results in improving ideology, organization, and work styles. In strengthening party building, we should particularly achieve success in improving leading bodies at all levels; win greater results in improving their ideology and work styles; make a great step forward in the system whereby cadres can be promoted and demoted as required and in the exchange of cadres, the training and promotion of outstanding young cadres, and the education, theoretical study, and vocational training of cadres; and open up a new situation in the organizational work. In his speech, Gao Dezhan put forward clear demands on the endeavors to improve the ideology, work styles, and organization of leading bodies at all levels, greatly train and promote outstanding young cadres, and make the party's grass-roots organizations still better. In conclusion, Gao Dezhan said: Propaganda and ideological work and organizational work are important work concerning the overall situation, and they play a very important role in the party's attainment of all tasks. The propaganda and ideological front and the organizational work front bear heavy responsibilities, and the municipal party committee places great expectations on them. It is hoped that party committees at all levels will conscientiously implement the guidelines of the national propaganda and ideological work conference and the national forum of directors of organization departments and, in line with the arrangements of the second enlarged plenary session of the sixth municipal party committee, adopt effective measures to make propaganda and ideological work and organizational work still more successful, create a new situation, and make still greater contributions. Attending the conferences were major party and government responsible comrades, comrades in charge of propaganda and ideological work and organizational work, directors of propaganda and organization departments, and responsible comrades of all the units of propaganda departments, totaling more than 1,200 persons.
