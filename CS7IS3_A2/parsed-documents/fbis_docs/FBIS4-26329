This is an important conference to mobilize the whole party and all of society to further implement the strategy of giving priority to the development of education, and to seriously carry out the "Program for Education Reform and Development in China" in a new situation, in which the establishment of the socialist market economy structure and modernization are being accelerated in China. The meeting certainly will have a great influence on the realization of the strategic goal of educational reform and development in China in the 1990's, and on promoting reform, opening up, and modernization. The rise or decline of a country is determined by education. This is particularly true of our country, which has a population of nearly 1.2 billion, with relatively insufficient resources and relatively backward economy and culture. One thing that has a decisive significance for the attainment of the magnificent goal of socialist modernization is to shift economic construction into the orbit of depending on the progress in science and technology and of improving the quality of laborers, and to raise the entire nation's level of ideology, ethics, science, and culture. It is precisely because of this that the CPC Central Committee has decided to put education in a strategic position, in which priority is given to its development. This is a far-sighted strategic policy decision, and is a matter of fundamental importance in the realization of modernization in our country. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the broad masses of educational workers have worked industriously under the leadership of party committees and governments at all levels. They have rapidly developed the cause of education in our country, gradually carried out reform in education, made remarkable achievements in educational work, improved the quality of the people, trained large numbers of qualified personnel, and made an important contribution to our country's economic construction, scientific and technological progress, and social development. At the same time, we also should be aware that education in our country is still relatively backward, educational reform still lags behind the demands of the establishment of the socialist market economy structure, and educational development still cannot meet the needs of modernization. The phenomenon of neglecting education -- and of neglecting basic education, in particular -- still exists to varying degrees in some localities and departments. These localities and departments lack a sense of urgency in educational reform and in practical work, and have not completely put education in a strategical position in which priority is given to its development. This situation demands prompt solution. The most important thing in implementing the spirit of the national educational work conference and to carry out the "Program for Education Reform and Development in China" is to make great efforts to understand and implement the two words "giving priority" in "giving priority to the development of education." We should not just talk about "giving priority," write about it on paper, and discuss it at meetings, but should implement it in work and in deed. As far as planning and the arrangement of funds are concerned, party committees and governments at all levels, in studying and formulating development plans and annual plans, should ensure that priority is given to the development of education; in making arrangements for financial budget and spending, should ensure that priority is given to the needs of education; and in increasing wages for staff members and workers, should ensure that priority is given to raising the wages of teachers. As far as the arrangement and inspection of work are concerned, party committees and governments at all levels should give priority to the study and arrangements for educational work, and should give priority to summing up and inspecting educational work. As far as the appraisal and use of cadres are concerned, party committees and governments at all levels should give priority to the appraisal and use of cadres engaged in educational work and to the appraisal of how cadres at lower levels exercise leadership over educational work. They should give priority to promoting cadres who attach importance to education and have made achievements in work in leading posts in education. As far as commending and awarding the advanced is concerned, party committees and governments at all levels should give priority to commending and awarding advanced individuals and collectives that have worked industriously for the reform and development of education, have made selfless contributions, have obtained remarkable results in work, and really have made major attainments. For sometime to come in the future, we should make greater efforts, from top to bottom, to create the public opinion of "giving priority to education," to think of practical moves to "give priority to education," to do solid work to "give priority to education," and to get actual results in "giving priority to education." We should make unremitting efforts over a period of time to enable the strategy of giving priority to the development of education to strike root deeply in ideological concepts and in actual work. We should turn "giving priority to education" into the ideological habit of the people and the conscious demand in the arrangement of work, so that "giving priority to education" can become a common practice in society. In this way, our country and our nation will be full of promise. Ideology is the guide to action. To do a good job in implementing the spirit of the recent educational work conference, we must seriously study Comrade Jiang Zemin's important speech at the conference and Comrade Li Peng's theme report. In particular, we should seriously study and understand a series of expositions on education made by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. Comrade Xiaoping's ideas on education are the theoretical basis for our party to formulate the educational principles and policies for the new period, and are a powerful ideological weapon guiding educational reform and development. At the last national educational work conference nine years ago, Comrade Deng Xiaoping made an important speech entitled: "Seriously Grasp Education Work." (See Volume 3 of Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping.) He pointed out: "A leader who neglects education is a leader who lacks far-sightedness, is not mature, and is not able to lead modernization." Comrade Xiaoping hopes party committees and governments at all levels will grasp education work and will "not indulge in empty talk, but do more solid work." That speech was very good and what he said is still applicable to reality, even today. We suggest that leading comrades at all levels restudy it properly. The key to revitalizing education lies in leadership. As long as the leadership of party committees and governments at all levels really implement the strategy of giving priority to the development of education, a new situation in which education in our country develops even more vigorously certainly will emerge!
