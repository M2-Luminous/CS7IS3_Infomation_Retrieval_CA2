"They all write about the budget deficit, growing unemployment, `sugar affair' (concerning the repayment of an Indian debt to Slovakia), and comment on fictitious speeches by Meciar -- but they pass over the fact that Slovakia has the smallest national debt per person of the post-communist countries," Slobodnik said. "The struggle against Slovakia is essentially economic. Slovakia is portrayed in a negative way. What happens next is that some capitalists, say from the Netherlands, who want to invest in Central Europe and who have read such information, say to themselves: 'With this kind of situation there, it would be better to avoid Slovakia and invest the millions in Hungary and the Czech Republic instead,' and that indeed is the aim of the propaganda," Slobodnik says. Frequent criticism leveled against Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar by the opposition press is a sign, Slobodnik says, of a "concerted attack directed by someone hiding behind the scenes who objects to the fact that Meciar is leading Slovakia to prosperity and who is bent on replacing him with a new premier, more amenable and responsive to foreign pressure. "When you, the Czech journalists, do it, it is to some degree logical since you thus support the position of the Czech lands. But when Slovak journalists do this, it is a case of intentionally harming Slovak interests. "What we do with such journalists? We tolerate them, we respect democracy," Slobodnik says. "Slovakia will attain the goals it aims for, albeit with some detours, and then it will remember those who stood in its way." At a recent Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) meeting, Slobodnik pointed a finger at an opposition journalist. "You do not understand that when you shower the premier with abuse, it will have an opposite effect. It has happened once before with Meciar. When they willfully removed him from the government, his popularity increased. An objective survey would show that his popularity has been growing since last October, because people think: 'this man is being hunted.' "They stooped to fabricating a speech Meciar allegedly made at Zlata Idka, but they used at least ten different voices," Slobodnik said. A HZDS east Slovak regional meeting took place at Zlata Idka, east Slovakia, on November 27-28, 1993. "This republic is stronger than the antagonistic journalists would have it. Life has been difficult for the government, it has a lot of enemies who would like to pick up power in the streets, but they will not succeed. Slovak people do not want a new government. "People are able to see that the HZDS is the only force that has fought uncompromisingly for Slovak interests without seeking any benefits for itself. Various things have been written about Meciar and me but nobody has dared to say that we have been profiteering. The present government is incorruptible," Slobodnik says. "The HZDS is destined to win the next elections. It will not gain as many votes as in 1992, but it will still receive three to four percent more than the Democratic Left Party (SDL). I bet five bottles of whisky against one. Are you on?."
