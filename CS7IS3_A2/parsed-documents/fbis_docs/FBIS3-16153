The idea of signing the memorandum between various branches of power, political parties and public movements was proposed by Yeltsin during his meeting with journalists on March 9. On March 10 he held the first working meeting to draw up a draft document. Nikolay Travkin, leader of the Democratic Party of Russia, confirmed his readiness to cooperate with other parties. "The development of the political situation in the country will depend on the solution of economic rather than political tasks. Unless we stabilise the economy, the country will be doomed to political catastrophes," he said. Lev Ponomarev, leader of the Democratic Russia Movement, told ITAR-TASS that he "did not believe in the possibility of forging a union with communists and other representatives of the opposition." He called for "unconditional support for the idea of civil peace and accord by his movement." "I am sure that during the work on the memorandum the opposition will demand state regulation of prices and other conditions of restoration of socialism. In that case we will not be able to sign the document," Ponomarev said. Grigoriy Serebrenikov, a member of the faction of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) in the State Duma, said that "the LDPR has already made a step towards civil peace" and "plans to take an active part in the development of the draft memorandum."
