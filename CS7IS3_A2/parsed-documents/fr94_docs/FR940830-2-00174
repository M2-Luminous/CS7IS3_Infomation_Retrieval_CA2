ACTION: Notice of availability and request for comment on contaminated sediment management strategy SUMMARY: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed and is requesting public comments on a comprehensive, multimedia Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy. The proposed Strategy describes specific actions that EPA will take to reduce environmental and human health risks associated with contaminated sediment. The Strategy does not propose new regulation. EPA is acting, under existing statutory and regulatory authority, to implement policies to consistently assess, prevent, and remediate contaminated sediment. Because the proposed Strategy is a unique plan of action developed to address a significant national environmental problem, and to streamline decision-making within and among EPA programs, the Agency is taking the unusual step of requesting public comment on this internal EPA work plan. DATES: Written comments must be postmarked or submitted by hand on or before October 31, 1994. ADDRESSES: Requests for copies of EPA's Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy (EPA document number EPA 823&hyph;R&hyph;94&hyph;001) should be sent to: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Center for Environmental Publications and Information, 11029 Kenwood Road, Building 5, Cincinnati, Ohio 45242; telephone: 513&hyph;891&hyph;6561, fax: 513&hyph;891&hyph;6685.
