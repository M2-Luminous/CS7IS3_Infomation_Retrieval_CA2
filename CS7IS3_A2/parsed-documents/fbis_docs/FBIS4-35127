The first stage of the project, in its final phase of completion, includes a small-sized accelerator capable of generating energy on the order of 30 mega-electron volts (Mev) of power. The director of the Institute of Advanced Studies (IEAv -- part of the CTA), Colonel Hugo Pereira Chavez, remarked: "That energy is sufficient to solve 80 percent of the problems relating to studies in the nuclear field." He reported that the final configuration of the accelerator will have eight accelerator structures 2 meters long, fed by four Klystron (high-powered) valves, and energy totaling 130 Mev. The accelerator is being installed in the underground gallery of a building designed to meet all the radiological safety operational requirements. The first part of the project occupies a two-story building inside the IEAv area, where 15 nuclear physics specialists and technicians are working. According to director Pereira Chaves, the project absorbed $5 million in investments within an eight-year period. The resources were financed by the Parallel Nuclear Program associated with the Federal Government's Strategic Affairs Secretariat. Laboratories The IEAv director thinks that, with slightly over $5 million, it will be possible to complete the construction of the accelerator in eight modules. This step is considered essential to the development of an autonomous national nuclear program. The IEAv's accelerator project involves the construction of microwave, electronics, electron beam transport and focusing, vacuum, and chemical laboratories. The accelerator will also consist of an electron gun (source emitting electrons). The IEAv has already built and tested two versions of the gun. According to Colonel Pereira Chaves, the second version is now in operation, and is undergoing an optimization process. The director claims that one important aspect of the electron gun was the pioneer development in Brazil of the metal-ceramic weld, a process with extensive technological applications already transmitted to other research institutions. The IEAv also has developed the electron beam injection system, the accelerator structure, a microwave network, a Klystron modulator, a control system (allowing for mechanical operation of the accelerator), a vacuum system (with pressure of 10-9 torr/pressure unit), and a cooling system. Among the accelerator's main applications is the evaluation of the effects of irradiation of materials in the industrial field, with uses in radiochemistry, environmental pollution, and sterilization of surgical materials and food. Another application might be the development of experiments for radiological protection (shielding), to assess damage from irradiation of materials in the nuclear and aerospace fields. Processes Through the accelerator, the IEAv has now succeeded in producing electron beams with energy of 30 Mev. "With that energy, it is possible to carry out experiments with the production of pulsated neutrons simulating nuclear reactors." According to the IEAv director, with the accelerator project it was possible to develop various techniques of interest in other fields, as well as to master special processes not yet available in Brazil. Prominent among the processes are those for metal-ceramic weld, electroforming (shaping of surfaces), construction of an electron gun, magnetic lenses (focusing of electromagnetic radiation), and microwave components.
