Moscow Believes that Russian-U.S. Partnership Has Entered a `Stage of Maturity'"] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Russian Foreign Ministry believes that the message that Clinton will bring to Moscow is that the reforms need "social cushions," and expects the U.S. side to offer its assistance in this field. Diplomats are recommending to President Yeltsin to raise the question of the United States' increasing its influence in international financial organizations with a view to unfreezing the funds earmarked for Russia. At the same time, in Russia's opinion, the economic effect from the abolition of discriminatory limitations in trade substantially exceeds the scale of any existing aid programs. Deep in their hearts U.S. officials have presumably understood that they are incapable of influencing the development of the situation in Russia. Even so they continue to support Yeltsin in the interest of global security. The level of confidence achieved by the leaders of Russia and the United States indeed has no precedent. During the visit the presidents are expected to sign a document tentatively called the Moscow Declaration. Although its final text has not been coordinated yet, it is known to contain a number of new ideas in the sphere of disarmament and nonproliferation of mass destruction weapons, also defining the sides' general approaches to the concept of Partnership for Peace. It is not ruled out that in the near future Moscow will announce its intention to acquire the status of an associate NATO member state [strana-partner NATO]. The agenda for the talks on security will include such topics as prohibiting the production of fissionable materials for military purposes, a comprehensive ban on nuclear tests, and the retargeting of strategic nuclear forces. According to a high-ranking Russian diplomat who spoke confidentially, Moscow is "advancing the idea" of Russia and the United States making available special units for peacekeeping operations under the aegis of the United Nations and the CSCE. On the Russian side such a unit will be the 27th Motorized Infantry Division and on the U.S. side the 3d Infantry Division. The Foreign Affairs Ministry regards President Kravchuk's consent to arrive in Moscow and fully reaffirm Ukraine's obligations under the Lisbon Protocol as a major breakthrough. Russian diplomats believe that thereby an end has been put to debates on the fate of the Russian nuclear weapons stationed on Ukrainian territory. At the same time, the Russian-U.S. strategic partnership which, according to a highly placed Russian diplomat, has entered a "stage of maturity," is far from ideal. In particular Moscow is not happy over Washington's attempts to internationalize the conflicts on CIS territory. Russia considers this territory to be the zone of its special interests. Moscow is also unhappy with the fact that it is not being admitted to talks on creating a new international organization which is to replace the defunct Cocom. [passage omitted]
