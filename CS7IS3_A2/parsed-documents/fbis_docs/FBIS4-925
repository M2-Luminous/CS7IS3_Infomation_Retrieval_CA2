Good evening to you, Dr. Jiyane. [Jiyane] Good evening to you, Leslie. [Mashokwe] Many people are now happy with your participation. It almost presupposes that people were concerned about your exclusion? [Jiyane] Yes, many thoughtful South Africans were concerned. But, indeed, God is able. We are now able to be in the election and give our people a chance to make a choice. [Mashokwe] What happened? Why all this sudden change of heart? [Jiyane] There are several reasons. Of course you know about the very special gentleman from Kenya who came here, who is a man of God, and who was able to relate to the chief minister and president of the IFP, and the president of the African National Congress, and you know we were just there on the brink, and we saw the abyss, and fortunately the last minute we all shrunk back. So many corpses would have gone by, people would have died, but we are Christians, and nobody would ever benefit from that, and I'm glad we shrunk back from the abyss. [Mashokwe] What did he say to you that was so special. I mean, we talk here of a tough proposal that he presented to Inkatha and the ANC in Durban on Sunday. What was contained in it? [Jiyane] Well, the draft proposal I've shown you at the beginning here, it contains a possibility of Parliament coming together to make an amendment that satisfies what his majesty, the king of the Zulus, has asked for -- that is, an entrenchment and protection for the kingdom, plus which says something definite about the constitutional issues that are outstanding, that they will be resolved through mediation after the election. But now, particularly the coming together of Parliament, and putting this in the constitution of 1993, was a major point that enabled us to say we could go in. [Mashokwe] What is different that you were offered in Johannesburg as opposed to what was being offered at Skukuza, the Kruger National Park, a week or so ago? [Jiyane] Well, at Skukuza obviously, for one thing, there was no agreement -- there wasn't. It merely actually frustrated the whole thing. The other side, I wouldn't mention which one, was reluctant to allow Parliament to come and make this on black and white in the constitution. That possibility was not there at Skukuza. [Mashokwe] I'm trying to understand exactly what was so special today, because seemingly the positions of say the ANC and the government, vis-a-vis the proposal in Skukuza, has not changed. It's only the entrenchment of the writing in of this agreement about the king, that has changed the whole atmosphere? [Jirs?] Yes, of course, but you remember, Leslie, that one of the fundamental problems of the whole process is lack of tr?st, given the animosity and the killings. Now because of this lack of trust, for example, we, the IFP, couldn't go in knowing that there was no assurance that after elections there would in fact be consideration to his majesty's call for the recognition of the Zulu kingdom. I mean commitments on paper without any legal commitment, something that would be justiciable in a court of law for example, and something that the whole world would say, if you renege on, you would be actually saying you're no longer for the rule of law. Now its a matter of trust that does not exist, that will be built over time. But at least this action of going to call Parliament goes a long way to assure us that we are not going to be taken for a ride. [Mashokwe] Okay, we're talking about say something like Article 54 here, because we've had now something like Article 53, which entrenches self-determination in a way. What is different from that article? [Jiyane] Well that principle, like all principles, is just a general principle. We were talking of a specific case of the Zulu kingdom with a lot of people in support of that view, and history behind us, which we needed to be there in the constitution, because if it was not there, there wasn't going to be a way of living in South Africa with the understanding that all the uniqueness of South Africa is taken into consideration. The Zulu kingdom is a special case. Even the president of the African National Congress has recognized this, but we knew because of the depth of feeling among Zulus, particularly in kwaZulu/Natal, that if that question was left unresolved after the constitution, because of this general principle, because for example there is no assurance that the issue of a volkstaat [homeland] will be resolved just because there is that principle. [sentence as heard] But on the question of the Zulu kingdom, we couldn't take a risk in terms of not committing people legally, you see, to the....[pauses] But of course we know that the greatest guarantee is not the legal and what [as heard]. It is the political muscle which we are going to show electorally, and the fact that the Zulu kingdom and the Zulu people will still be there after elections, and God forbid any politician who would try to play tricks with that. Of course they would be responsible. [Mashokwe] Are you going to be able to persuade your followers to accept that you've now changed your mind, you're now into elections? Is it not too late? [Jiyane] Well, our followers have been fighting for the interests that the IFP has articulated, plus the fact that because the IFP historically has the bulk of its membership in Zulu, the fact that the Zulu king, his majesty, had to be catered for. Now they have agreed. They will call Parliament. Everybody will see on the screens that they are going there to meet about the issue of his majesty, the Zulu king. Now anybody who didn't know--I mean, it would only be people who didn't know why we were out of elections. That was one of the important issues, and the other one--that is, the constitutional differences, will be addressed through mediation. [Mashokwe] Are you going to accept the outcome of the elections without any hesitation. Won't you say you came in late, therefore you will not accept the outcome? [Jiyane] Well, it's difficult for anybody to say they would accept the outcome of the elections unless they are asked: Will you accept the outcome of free and fair elections. [Mashokwe] Will you call them free and fair? [Jiyane] Well free and fair elections, yes. [Mashokwe] No doubt? [Jiyane] Why should there be doubt. But if they are not free and fair, no politician can say they will accept such. [Mashokwe] In your region, in kwaZulu/Natal, you have not been electioneering; you have not being electioneering anywhere else. Is that not putting you in a disadvantage. Won't you use that as an excuse to say we fared badly because we were not electioneering? [Jiyane] Well, you yourself know it wouldn't be an excuse; it's a fact. We know it now that we're at a huge disadvantage; we haven't educated our people as much as other people on voter education and we haven't had funds. I mean, we know all those disadvantages, but to us what counted more than anything was when we saw the (?possibility) of this abyss and the corpses that would go with it, and we said no we would not be held responsible, even if as a party we will suffer so many disadvantages. If we've saved lives, to us that was more important. [Mashokwe] What about the fact that some cynics are saying you are going to disappear into oblivion come the 27th of April anyway? [Jiyane] That's laughable. The Zulu nation would never disappear? [Mashokwe] No, no, the politicians in kwaZulu at Ulundi. We have a new order coming into place, and you would disappear? [Jiyane] Yes, those are people who think we are there because of kwaZulu government, as we always say the Zulu nation is there, irrespective of the Bantustan structure. In fact, we went there knowing it was an apartheid structure, but which we wanted to use to avert, to divert, the course of other Bantustan leaders who wanted to take independence. That's why we grafted in a legitimate Zulu kingdom structure there, and now if that goes, that doesn't mean that the people who deliberately with wide open eyes went into it to use it, and we've used it successfully to stop the apartheid system of separate development and negotiations, and the (?tricameral) constitution without Mandela, and so on and so forth. Now if that goes, that does not mean that the people of that area will go. They will be there, and they have a king. [Mashokwe] Dr. Jiyane, talk to me about this Zulu kingdom. If it comes into being, does that assure Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi of a position as premier or adviser to the king, as he is now? [Jiyane] Well, that's the wrong way to ask the question, because this is a problem even with the king. The problem is not ?positions and assurances; the problem is the kingdom of kwaZulu, a historical reality. Now Chief Buthelezi, our leader, is the president of the IFP; he is a politician, a hardbitten politician, and that's why he is going through an election, which you know, ironically, Leslie, people have said we are afraid, we are afraid of elections, but very few politicians would have been as brave as Dr. Buthelezi, to go into an election with so few days. I mean such a short time, They will be scared, but he's not scared because the support is there. So he depends on that, he has the support and he's not scared of elections. Few politicians would take that as he has done. [Mashokwe] Dr. Jiyane, thanks for your time and for talking to us.
