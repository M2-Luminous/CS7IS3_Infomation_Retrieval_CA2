FR940810-0-00066 FR940810-0-00021 HEI concluded that ``the mesothelioma risk for chrysotile was an issue of disagreement; some members of the Literature Review Panel held the view that a lower estimate should be recommended, as it would be more consistent with available data. The crucial issues, neither of which can be resolved unequivocally, are (1) what proportion of the mesotheliomas observed in groups such as the U.K. textile workers and the U.S. insulation workers were caused by their exposure to crocidolite or amosite; and (2) whether the best general estimate of the ratio of mesothelioma to excess lung cancer caused by chrysotile is provided by the Quebec miners and millers (about 1:4 or 1:5), or by the South Carolina textile workers handling Quebec fiber (zero)'' (Ex. 1&hyph;344 p. 6&hyph;32). Thus, although there is some evidence linking chrysotile to a lower mesothelioma rate than some amphibole fiber types, OSHA believes that there is insufficient evidence to show that chrysotile does not present a significant mesothelioma risk to exposed employees. Furthermore, the major disease linked to asbestos exposure, lung cancer, occurs at the same frequency among employees exposed to equivalent doses of chrysotile or to amphibole asbestos fiber types. Indeed, evaluation of all of the evidence indicates that chrysotile asbestos presents a similar significant risk of lung cancer and asbestosis as other forms of asbestos. Since these adverse health effects constitute the majority of diseases related to asbestos exposure, OSHA is still of the opinion that chrysotile exposure should be treated the same as other forms of asbestos. In addition to contentions that OSHA's risk assessment had overstated asbestos risks because it treated the risks from all asbestos fiber types equally, other contentions were made that the earlier risk assessment may have understated the risks from asbestos, because it ignored evidence of the incidence of pleural plaques, and other asbestos disease which occurred in workers exposed at low levels, primarily as building custodians. The earlier risk assessment in 1984 focused on whether there was a significant risk of cancer and asbestosis at various levels of cumulative exposure. During this hearing, various labor groups stated their position that the presence of pleural plaques in asbestos exposed employees is not only a marker of asbestos exposure, but also an independent ``material impairment'' because they are associated with a greater risk of lung function impairment and pleuritic pain. Pleural plaques are focal areas of fibrous thickening of the pleura, the membrane lining the lung. Further, suggestions were made that OSHA should reduce its PELS to correspond to these increased risks of ``material impairment'' which occurred at lower exposure levels (see e.g., Ex. 143 at 35&hyph;37).
