What was the PLO's and Tel Aviv's aim in signing this agreement? [Sheykholeslam] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful, greetings to dear viewers. As you might know, the issue of Gaza and its transfer to Egypt has been under review for some time in Israeli circles. As reported in the press, the management of this part of Palestine had become a serious problem for the Israelis due to an intense and extensive revolutionary movement, or what we know today as intifadah. Intifadah consists of methods that we had in our own revolution; that is, people coming into the streets with bare hands and there taking whatever they can. Everyone--small children and old men--wanted the Israelis to leave them alone and to get out of their country. One faction in Israel believed that they should let go of the area and get out no matter what. Mr. Rabin, Mr. Peres, and other statesmen believed that they should save something from the spoiled oil, and Mr. 'Arafat was after getting whatever they would give him at any cost. So they reached this agreement. In reality, Israelis aim to control intifadah through the Palestinians themselves. Unfortunately, Mr. 'Arafat has a poor record in the war between Palestinians. On various occasions, he has suppressed Palestinians for political and personal interests--including in Lebanon, where we were a witness. The main danger facing the situation is that, God forbid, Palestinian police trained by Britain and other western countries should stand face to face against the Palestinian nation and take the place of the Israeli police, which is presently the main instrument of suppression, and that the war becomes one among Palestinians. This has to be avoided whatever way possible. [Correspondent] Mr. Sheykholeslam, you spoke about the intifadah before. What is the reason for the intifadah to oppose the accord? [Sheykholeslam] As you know, Jericho and Gaza is a very small part of the land of Palestine. The greater part of the land of Palestine has remained in the possession of the Israelis. It is the right of the Palestinian nation to oppose the accord and to fight for the liberation of its land. More importantly, 'Arafat has given the Israelis a guarantee of security and has considered the control of the Palestinians as one of his duties. However, despite that, the Israelis have, nevertheless, guaranteed the unjust right to enter that same confined area that was put at the disposal of Mr. 'Arafat for self-rule any time they wish. In fact, he becomes a mayor of that area. Whenever--this is categorically stated in the accord--whenever they consider it necessary to enter the area for their security, they will do so. In fact, the Palestinian nation has not achieved anything. Moreover, they seek to divest it of its main right, which is fighting for the liberation of its lands. That is why the intifadah does not accept the accord. The number of those who do not accept the accord is far larger than the number of those who accept it. I venture to say that if there were to be a referendum or a similar plebiscite, the accord will undoubtedly fail to gain any votes. Undoubtedly, those supporting the accord will be in the minority. The movement is still continuing, either by the Palestinians inside or those outside. [Correspondent] We see that the United States and Egypt especially, among the Arab states, are mostly seeking to internationalize the issue. They invite various states to gather in Cairo, as well as movies and satellite films, etc. Is all that for the same reason? Is it all for raising the issue and establishing the issue, or are there other reasons for it? [Sheykholeslam] In fact, since the weakness of the accord at its heart is obvious to the Arab states, they are trying to get it accepted by the Arab nation through much propaganda and hue and cry. Despite all the invitations extended by the Egyptian Government to the foreign ministers of various states, there was not good participation. Foreign ministers of principal states, such as Lebanon and Syria, were not present. There is no doubt that the weakness of the accord was evident both in the minds of the Americans and the Israelis. That was even evident yesterday at the scene of the signing of the accord, as it was being shown in the news bulletin. I was watching the Egyptian television's live broadcast. 'Arafat hesitated in signing some sections and demonstrated that even he did not wish to accept the accord. Then, as a result of the dominating pressure of the leaders of states there, unfortunately, he eventually signed. It is regrettable that the fate of the Palestinian nation was exchanged for the sake of several presidents and foreign ministers. In any case, the Americans and some other big countries want no one to oppose the accord. That, in itself, is evidence to the weakness of the accord. It is clear that opposition can damage it. [Correspondent] Considering the role of Arab countries, perhaps we can divide them into two groups--the countries that do not share borders with occupied Palestine, and those who are next to it such as Syria and Jordan. How do you see the role of each of those countries? [Sheykholeslam] Some of those countries, like Syria, adopted a better stance from the beginning. Syria is calling for Israel's complete withdrawal from the Golan, which has been occupied by Israel. I should mention that Syria has resisted well despite various pressure exerted by some Arab and large countries like America, and sometimes Russia, and has not given up its fundamental stances. Christopher brought various plans during his recent visit, and the Syrian reaction so far does not indicate that the Syrians have accepted Christopher's plans. Those plans are about Israel's withdrawal from three villages. Lebanon has adopted a very good stance so far. Their stances have been in coordination with those of the Syrians. [passage omitted] Jordan, with its large Palestinian population, tried to see that the accord developed in a way that did not harm it. [passage omitted] Egypt is left, which is obvious. Unfortunately, a wrong step was taken by Anwar Sadat, and Egypt has left the camp of struggle against Israel since then. On the whole, the stances of the countries who live next to Palestine are, unfortunately, not very solid, and they accept the presence of Israel due to their need or dependency on the United States. That is a great danger that threatens the Arab world in the future. [Correspondent] If you allow me, I would like to raise my final question. Please tell us about the Islamic Republic of Iran's position with respect to the recent accord? [Sheykholeslam] The position of the Islamic Republic of Iran has been clear from the beginning. Since before the revolution in Iran, his eminence the imam believed that Israel should be destroyed. It is an illegitimate creation that has been imposed on the region. [passage omitted] Naturally, the Islamic Republic of Iran supports all oppressed nations and their struggles--such as the Bosnians. It also supports the struggle of the Palestinian nation, particularly since the Muslims' first Qiblah, the Holy Quds, is there. The accord has no grounds whatsoever, and one of the main slogans that says Quds must be the capital of Palestine has been ignored. Only a request has been made by Mr. 'Arafat in his speech that the holy place should remain open to Muslim pilgrims. It is said that the Israelis have not even mentioned the holy places by their real Islamic names in the maps that they have prepared, which is regrettable. The accord offers nothing but abjectness. Fortunately, the Palestinian nation is on the scene, resists, and continues to roar for its rights. We condemn the accord and support the Muslim nation of Palestine and their struggle. [Correspondent] Mr. Sheykholeslam, thank you for coming to our studio.
