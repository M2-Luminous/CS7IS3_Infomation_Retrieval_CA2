Vice-Minister of Labour, Zhu Jiazhen, said recently that the Government was facing increasing pressure to find work for workers displaced because of the restructure of the industrial sector. Although China has claimed impressive economic growth this year, many state enterprises faced a serious shortage of working capital and some even had difficulty paying their workers after the Government ordered the state-owned banks to restrict credit as part of its anti-inflation policy. In addition to finding employment for the displaced workers, Mr Zhu said the Government was also under great stress to speed up the establishment of a national insurance scheme to act as a "safety net" for the unemployed. He said the top leadership feared that the country could become unstable if unemployment was not brought under control soon. While the Government would try to create as many jobs as possible in a bid to make inroads into unemployment, the authorities also hoped that more displaced workers would be able to find work in the burgeoning servicing industry. He also admitted that China faced the problem of "hidden unemployment" as Chinese enterprises abandoned their old socialist management systems. Workers displaced by these enterprises were often kept on the enterprises' payrolls but they only received part of their usual salaries and were not officially classified as "unemployed".
