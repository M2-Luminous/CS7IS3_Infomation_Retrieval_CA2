On 2 March, the Turkish Parliament decided to waive the parliamentary immunity of eight Kurdish deputies, six of whom belong to the Party of Democracy (DEP). Most of these deputies subsequently were arrested. Belgian socialist deputy Marc Galle (of the Flemish Socialist Party) made an emergency trip to Turkey on 7 March in his capacity as chairman of the interparliamentary delegation for Turkey, it was learned on Thursday. Mr. Galle has the task of collecting information in Ankara from the Turkish president and Government. He must make his report next week in Brussels before the EP's Committee on Foreign Affairs and Security. In its resolution, the Parliament denounces the "Turkish Government's attack on pluralist democracy" and says that the "only crime" of those arrested was "defending the interests of the Kurdish people in Turkey who are the victims of a bloody military repression." The policy of repression and the ban on elected representatives expressing themselves freely "could only encourage the members of the Turkish minority to support the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]." The EP concluded by asking the Turkish Government "to finally recognize the right to autonomy of the Kurdish people in Turkey."
