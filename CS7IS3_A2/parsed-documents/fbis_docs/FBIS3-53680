Hanna 'Amirah, a prominent PPP official in the occupied territories, said that intensive talks are currently under way between both sides under President Yasir 'Arafat and PPP Secretary General Bashir al-Barghuthi, who is currently in Tunis at the head of a large PPP delegation. 'Amirah described the talks as "positive and constructive," adding that they are being held in a "cordial and fraternal atmosphere." However, he has not set a date for signing this program. In a statement to a QUDS PRESS correspondent, 'Amirah said that the bilateral talks are focusing on the delineation of a higher Palestinian authority, a comprehensive negotiating strategy, and the criteria to be heeded when the future Palestinian National Authority is formed. This authority, 'Amirah noted, must represent all colors of the Palestinian spectrum. The citizens of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, women, and clergymen must be involved in this authority. The composition of this authority must also heed the factor of territorial representation, as he put it. 'Amirah said that a detailed discussion of the formation of this authority has been postponed pending the signing of the program of action by both sides. He added: "Both sides must now reach such an agreement to settle all contentious political issues." The Palestinian official ruled out the PPP's possible participation in the Palestinian committees negotiating with Israel at present, saying: "This is contingent upon the Palestinian leadership's compliance with the recent PLO Executive Committee decisions, which spelled out the bases of negotiations." The PPP is considered Fatah's major partner in the negotiations with Israel. However, it has suspended its participation in the negotiations since the ninth round of the Washington talks due to substantive differences on the bases of the negotiating process. The PPP, along with other Palestinian factions, is demanding democratic reforms in the Palestinian decisionmaking process. It is also demanding changes in the way the negotiations with Israel are being conducted. Palestinian reformists fear that these secret negotiations could be a mere attempt to fragment their ranks, particularly in the aftermath of their launching a follow-up committee to press ahead with their demands with the Palestinian leadership.
