Security Council over the nuclear crisis, government officials said. "On the whole, (the proposed sanctions) are close to what Japan thinks proper, so we will in principle accept them," Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa told reporters after attending an emergency meeting of government leaders on the nuclear standoff. The United States plans to propose a sanctions resolution to the Security Council over the nuclear standoff triggered by North Korea's refusal to allow International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) checks of its suspected nuclear arms development program. Japanese U.N. Ambassador Hisashi Owada will inform his U.S. counterpart of Japan's acceptance of the draft early Thursday [16 June], the officials said. They declined to disclose, however, if the draft sanctions would include an order to halt bank remittances of cash from pro-Pyongyang Koreans living in Japan to North Korea. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai only said the sanctions would "not be easy" for North Korea. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata discussed the nuclear crisis with Kakizawa, Kumagai and senior foreign ministry officers in the meeting at his official residence. In the meeting, Hata said there are three principles on which Japan should act in dealing with the sanctions, the officials said. These are imposing sanctions step by step as a means of maintaining dialogue with the North, keeping close contact with the U.S., South Korea and other permanent Security Council members, and doing whatever is possible within the framework of the Constitution. Also present at the emergency talks were Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito and the ministry's director-general of the Foreign Policy Bureau, Shunji Yanai. The Foreign Ministry officials were quoted as saying there is a feeling even among the 10 nonpermanent Security Council members that the nuclear issue cannot be left as it is. The Security Council consists of five permanent members -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the U.S. -- as well as the 10 nonpermanent members.
