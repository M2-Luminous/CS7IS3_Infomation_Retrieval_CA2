It should be mentioned that Mr. Sifi's government consists of 29 ministers, and among its priorities are the consolidation of the state institutions, reviving the national economy, and promoting national solidarity. Concerning the issues tabled at the meeting of the Council of Ministers today, the official spokesman for the presidency, Mr. Mihoub, said the following: On the occasion of this first meeting with the government chaired by Mr. Mokdad Sifi, the head of state, made the following guideline address: In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. On the occasion of this meeting of the Council of Ministers, I cannot, to begin with, but greet and express my personal gratitude to Mr. Redha Malek, the previous prime minister, and all the members of his team for their commitment and loyalty in serving our country. In addressing you, ministers, I congratulate you for your selection, and I express to you and the prime minister my sincerest wishes of success in the mission entrusted to you. The appointment of your government comes within the framework of establishing the institutions that will be in charge of the realization of the objectives of the transitional stage, the objectives mentioned by the platform agreed by the national conference. In this framework come all the activities already started in the recent weeks, as well as the directives I gave at the two previous meetings of the Council of Ministers, which I recall today. I have already had the occasion to define the problems that were the cause of the crisis faced by our country. In addition to the known political causes and the deterioration of the foreign monetary resources, there was a laissez-faire in management and lack of clarity of objectives. Such deviations faciliated the emergence of calamities in the apparatus of the state, such as bureaucracy, despotism, injustice, and nepotism. Such deviations also reduced contact between officials and permitted the absence of officials in the field of work, as well as the marginalization and instability of the cadres. The break with past practices, which remain our basic objective, lies in eliminating these manifestations and practices, and this can be brought about only with the carrying out of a radical change in the state's structures which, in the future, must obey new rules. Effectively, the work we are doing to bring about national reconciliation and definitively uproot terrorism and violence from our society must be necessarily accompanied by the strengthening of the state's institutions, the rehabilitation of the civil service, and the setting up of sound relations between the citizens and the administration, which must be in their service. In this respect, the mobilization of officials at all levels is an urgent necessity to guarantee the follow-up and the realization of decisions, and to perform the job of control, and therefore restore full credibility to the public institutions. In this respect, there must be reforms that give a fresh breath to the civil service sector. The credibility of the public institutions also requires them to lead by example in reducing the state's expenditure and practicing austerity. This credibility also requires combating bribery, speculation, and smuggling with seriousness and determination. The law must be implemented strictly within the framework of the respect of individual and collective liberties. In the field of communication, the government has got to exert a considerable effort. The media, which will receive a lot of attention, should be mobilized so as to carry out its fundamental role, which consists in serving the higher interests of the citizens and conveying their concerns to the state. The media, whose variety is considered as one of the gains of democracy, should play its role in consolidating this achievement and defending the higher interests of the homeland, whatever source is harming them. Freedom of expression means the responsible transmitting of sincere information away from any deceptions and conspiracies. It is also our duty to devote a bigger share of attention to promote our national culture. It is indisputable that our deep-rooted cultural heritage is considered a property of the Algerians and a strong factor in the unity and progress of our people. A comprehensive program for our national culture must be set up to recover the true position of this sector in our society. The success of all these tasks demands the utmost care in choosing officials at all levels of the state apparatus. As you know, the state has concluded an agreement with the IMF. We will be vigilant in implementing this agreement in our concern that it should bring benefits to citizens and in reviving the national economy. Within this framework I accord every importance to the temporary burdens ensuing from this agreement will be borne equitably by all strata of society and to implementing social protection programs that are accompanied by effective implementation. The national solidarity, which constitutes a tradition and is one of the demands of our people, must be reinforced more and more particularly for the benefit of the most deprived groups. Within the same context, some sectors of the national economy that I have previously touched upon must receive special care and be given priority in the government's efforts. This matter is related to the hydrocarbons, housing and agriculture sectors, small and medium enterprises, and trade. These priorities will allow the exploitation of the positive effects of the agreement with the IMF to activate the national economic apparatus, meet the requirements of the citizens, and create new jobs. We must also work to mobilize as many as possible of the country's resources, including the tourism sector, which will play a considerable role in developing the national economic wealth. Furthermore, the implementation of the agreement with the IMF comes within the framework of a structural reform process in connection with the national economy. This process should be continued and consolidated, especially in the sphere of industrial restructuring, and this sector should be opened up to partnership. It is obvious that all these operations, which require the government's utmost attention, will be better implemented by delegating them to the local authorities. The state is also represented by the wali, the head of the district, and the head of the municipal executive body. Within this framework we should rehabilitate the local communities, whose contribution to a coherent development of the country is indisputable. These tasks will achieve better success if they are carried out within the framework of an intensive consultation with social partners. As far as this is concerned, the creation of the National Social and Economic Council, which should be initiated as soon as possible, will contribute to promoting consultation between the state and its social partners. Finally, this program will receive more popular support if it is effectively explained to show clearly that this program requires temporary sacrifices, and that its aim, in the final assessment, is to revive national development and to produce opportunity for the creative resources, particularly the youth, to whom the horizons of the future will be opened, and toward which they can legitimately aspire to. Those are some of the directives your government program will focus on. The program should be prepared as soon as possible, because the state will not restore the citizens' trust unless it honors the commitments it undertook and provides tangible deeds. No doubt that consultation, unity of action, consistency of address, and the daily follow up of major issues are among the requirements for the success of your program, and of the materialization of the objectives which we have set for ourselves. Solidarity and harmony will be two conditions necessary in order to carry out our task. Here ends the directives of the head of state presented before the Council of Ministers. Thank you.
