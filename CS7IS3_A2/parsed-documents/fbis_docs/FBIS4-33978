It is small-scale smuggling." Mota downplayed the importance of weapons trafficking, saying he did not believe it was serious but, rather, just "something normal, as it is in all countries of the world into which many types of articles, such as food or clothing, are smuggled. Weapons are also smuggled in, but this is something that has always existed, and all countries take measures to try to stop it." He said there have been no indicators leading one to believe there has been some truly heavy weapons trafficking; "there has been just the normal amount, the amount that has always existed, the small-scale smuggling, as we call it." Shortly before attending yesterday's meeting of the recently created Consultative and Social Participation Commission of Civil Protection at the Government Secretariat, the division general, who is also a deputy, confirmed "the weapons smuggling that exists (in the country) is on a small scale. It is the common smuggling that exists in all countries that share borders, and there is no need for alarm or anything." When questioned on the front steps of the Government Secretariat at approximately 1100, the following questions and answers ensued: [EL FINANCIERO] Is the Chamber of Deputies Defense Commission conducting any investigation into the recent reports there is a trafficking of large amounts of weapons? [Mota] The commission has nothing to do with that. The corresponding authorities are the ones who have presented the reports, and they are probably conducting investigations, which they do on a permanent basis. [EL FINANCIERO] How serious is weapons trafficking? [Mota] I do not believe it is serious. I believe it is something normal, as it is in all countries of the world where there is arms trafficking, and many types of articles, such as food, clothing, and so forth, are smuggled in. Weapons are also smuggled in, but this is something that has always existed, and all countries take measures to try to stop it. [EL FINANCIERO] Our society, then, should not be worried about weapons trafficking? [Mota] I do not believe so because the information (which was leaked about a possible heavy trafficking of weapons and which authorities are investigating) is from February. From February to the present, there has been no event, no indicator that would lead one to believe there has been some truly heavy weapons trafficking, just the normal amount, the amount that has always existed, the small-scale smuggling, as we call it. [EL FINANCIERO] Who generally engages in trafficking? [Mota] All types of people who travel, especially, to the United States and return with some type of weapon. This is why I call it small scale. [EL FINANCIERO] Do you have any statistics to report on arms seizures? [Mota] The Defense and Government Secretariats have just published this report. I do not have the figures on hand, but they are significant, especially those on drug trafficking. The civil protection programs of the Government Secretariat, which is headed by Government Under Secretary Socorro Diaz Palacios, were analyzed at the meeting Mota attended. People from various sectors that form part of the National Council of Civil Protection also attended this meeting. The objective of this council is to provide elements of analysis to the Government Secretariat so that its civil protection activities will reach more people.
