The IEC said in a statement that the counterfoil of the ballot paper had a serial number, but that there was no mark on the ballot paper itself. It said that no inscription would be made on the counterfoil by an electoral officer. The voter would have his knuckles sprayed with invisible ink, and his document marked with invisible ink to control voting.
