He cordially visited NPC deputies from the two delegations, held discussions with them, and seriously heard their opinions and suggestions. The NPC deputies spoke one after another on various subjects from seizing opportunity to deepening reform and opening up wider, and from accelerating development to maintaining stability. The deputies of the Guizhou delegation centered their discussions on how to revitalize Guizhou's economy, and jointly talked about achievements and satisfactory changes in Guizhou over the past years. When the deputies expressed their hope that the party Central Committee and State Council would further support tobacco and wine production in Guizhou, Zhu Rongji said: "You must not further develop tobacco and wine production on a large scale. The issue you should consider now is not whether to receive support. You should change your concept and study how to maintain the existing production capacity and scale. You should proceed from the reality in Guizhou and take advantage of local resources to vigorously develop other industries." Zhu Rongji added with a smile: "You all know that the number of Chinese smokers ranks first in the world, and no other country can exceed us in this respect. You cannot say it is not related to the large number of tobacco plants and their excessive output. Up until now, there was a large overstock of tobacco products. If we continue to vigorously develop tobacco and produce more cigarettes, must we even ask small children to smoke?" "This is the tobacco issue. Now let us talk about wine." Zhu Rongji stated: "Guizhou's Maotai wine is the best in the country and is well known throughout the world. However, there must be a limit on wine production. The problem now is too much Maotai wine in too many places, and there are many fake products. People don't know what is the matter." He then asked Deputy Zou Kailiang, secretary of the party committee of the Maotai Winery: "Don't you think the situation is so?" Deputy Zou Kailiang nodded his head and replied: "There are indeed too many fake Maotai products in the market. We hope concerned departments will take effective measures to solve this problem." Other deputies grinned at his words. Zhu Rongji said: "Fake and shoddy products are market behaviors. This problem is quite serious, and we must rely on the efforts of all of society to solve the problem and strengthen people's concept of the legal system." He added: "You should also adopt measures to tackle the problem. For instance, you can improve the trademark on your wine bottle to prevent imitation." Deputy Zou Kailiang replied: "We are doing precisely this, and we have undertaken research on integrating wine bottles and covers." Zhu Rongji said: Guizhou's economy has two pillar industries, namely tobacco and wine. However, we must not produce tobacco and wine in a blind manner, and must have a new understanding and thinking. You should change your concept in tobacco and wine production. The key lies in how to strengthen management, raise quality, and suit the need of the market instead of expanding the scale of production. The bankruptcy of some tobacco plants in Guizhou can explain this. He added: "Guizhou does not lack resources like some have said. Guizhou has its own advantages. It has strong military industrial technologies and many natural resources. So long as you proceed from reality, adjust the production structure of the entire province according to market needs, attach importance to developing communications and transportation, and work hard in a solid manner, Guizhou's economic development has great hopes!" His words received warm applause. Zhu Rongji smilingly said to the deputies: "You must all remember--the development of Guizhou's economy must not merely rely on tobacco and wine. We must not fix our eyes only on these products." In holding discussions with NPC deputies from the Jiangxi delegation, Zhu Rongji repeatedly stressed the importance of agriculture and grain production. He asked cadres and masses in Jiangxi to strengthen agriculture and rural work as well as promote economic and social stability. During the meeting, Zhu Rongji answered questions raised by the deputies. He also introduced to the deputies the current economic conditions at home and the situation of reform and opening up. Zhu Rongji successively told NPC deputies from Guizhou and Jiangxi: Guizhou and Jiangxi have both made great developments in various fields, and have achieved major progress and achievements in various undertakings. The party Central Committee and State Council have fully affirmed their progress and achievements. He hoped people in Guizhou and Jiangxi would work together with people of the entire country, unite as one, work with concerted efforts, continue their efforts, and further improve their work in a solid manner in order to promote the national economy. Zhu Rongji encouraged comrades of the two provinces: Presently the situation in our country is excellent. We must seize opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, and maintain stability. We should correctly handle relations between reform, development, and stability in order to promote a sustained, rapid, and sound development of the national economy so as to further push forward the great cause of socialist modernization in our country.
