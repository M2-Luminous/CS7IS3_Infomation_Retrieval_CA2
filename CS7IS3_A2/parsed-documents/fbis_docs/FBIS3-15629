The group discussed the issues of legalization of transit regulations. The group made a conclusion that common regulations on the dangerous and military transit through Lithuanian territory for all the countries should be established in accordance with the international conventions. They decided to form a group of experts which would draft a law on dangerous and military transit through Lithuanian territory. The working group also got acquainted with the draft on transit presented by Russia and decided that it could be considered just after Seimas [parliament] enacted the law on transit.
