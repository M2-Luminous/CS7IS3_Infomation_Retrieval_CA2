SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This notice announces that the FAA finds that the noise exposure maps submitted for Minneapolis-St. Paul International (Wold-Chamberlain Field) Airport are in compliance with applicable requirements of part 150, effective December 10, 1993.

Under section 103 of title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''), an airport operator may submit to the FAA noise exposure maps which meet applicable regulations and which depict noncompatible land uses as of the date of submission of such maps, a description of projected aircraft operations, and the ways in which such operations will affect such maps. The Act requires such maps to be developed in consultation with interested and affected parties in the local community, government agencies, and persons using the airport. An airport operator who has submitted noise exposure maps that are found by FAA to be in compliance with the requirements of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) part 150, promulgated pursuant to title I of the Act, may submit a noise compatibility program for FAA approval which sets forth the measures the operator has taken or proposes for the reduction of existing noncompatible uses and for the prevention of the introduction of additional non-compatible uses. The Minneapolis-St. Paul Metropolitan Airports Commission submitted to the FAA on March 30, 1992, noise exposure maps, descriptions and other documentation which were produced during the FAR Part 150 Noise Compatibility Study from March 1991 to March 1992. It was requested that the FAA review this material as the noise exposure maps, as described in section 103(a)(1) of the Act, and that the noise mitigation measures, to be implemented jointly by the airport and surrounding communities, be approved as a noise compatibility program under section 104(b) of the Act.
