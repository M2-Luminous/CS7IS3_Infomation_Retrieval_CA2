Yesterday, the CAR sent us a statement relating to the situation. It was read by Afan Houenoumadje: [Begin Houenoumadje recording] The CAR steering committee met on 21 March in the presence of its 36 members elected to the National Assembly and expressed grave concern over the reasons for the present controversy over the choice of the prime minister expected to form the first government of the Fourth Republic. The CAR recalls that, according to a democratic principle in tune with the expression of the people's will and the spirit of our Constitution, the choice of a prime minister from a parliamentary majority is, first and foremost, left to the party that obtained the highest number of seats in the elections, and it is up to that party to look within its ranks for the person who can occupy that function. Furthermore, the CAR makes it a point to stress that before the first round of the legislative polls, the CAR chairman and his UTD counterpart agreed, in the presence of a witness, upon the way the prime minister would be chosen. Under this agreement, it was understood that should the opposition win the legislative elections, the party that would obtain the highest number of seats would choose candidates for the post of prime minister, speaker of the National Assembly, and president of the Constitutional Court. The CAR remains convinced that everything will be done to ensure that the new institutions that are put in place are in line with the will expressed by our citizens during the 6 and 20 February legislative elections. Issued in Lome on 21 March 1994 by Yaovi Agboyibor, CAR chairman [end recording] After this statement by the CAR, the UTD reacted immediately. Edem Kodjo, the UTD leader who we contacted by telephone, said he had not signed any such agreement with the CAR and demanded proof of such an agreement. Let us listen to what he said: [Begin Kodjo recording] I find all this a bit deplorable. What I can tell you is that I have never signed any agreement with the CAR chairman on this issue. If there exists a signed agreement this should be produced. [end recording]
