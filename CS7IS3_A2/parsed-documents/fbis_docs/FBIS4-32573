The participants are in favor of following the spirit of the prewar Czechoslovak People's Party headed by Jan Sramek. Milos Hanak, former member of the People's Party and the current chairman of the Vyskov, Moravia District privatization commission, was elected the new chairman of the party. Four new deputy chairmen and a new central committee of the party were also elected. The congress stripped former party Chairman Frantisek Michalek of all party posts. According to its new chairman, Hanak, the KSU is currently operating within the framework of the so-called Realistic Bloc, considers itself to be a party of the center, and does not consider itself to be a regional party. On the contrary, it will attempt to address citizens of the whole Czech Republic. The party is based on the principle of Christian humanism, which is being perceived as an alternative to both dogmatic collectivism and unrestrained liberalism. It also emphasizes the social aspect of political life, and its political priority is to renew land-based administration [zemske zrizeni] in Moravia.
