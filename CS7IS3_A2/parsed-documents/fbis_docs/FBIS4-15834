FBIS4-15834 "drsov070_u_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-070 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 Latvia Bases Conflict With Russia Not Closed Bases Conflict With Russia Not Closed WS1104164294 Tallinn BNS in English 1256 GMT 11 Apr 94 WS1104164294 Tallinn BNS English BFN [Text] Moscow, Apr 11, BNS -- Russia holds the opinion that the incident over President Boris Yeltsin's order to establish military bases in Latvia was exhausted with Moscow's official apology. The Latvian side, on the other hand, is determined to achieve that the text of the executive order will be changed. "We've given the necessary explanations and see no reason why we should once more return to a closed issue," Sergei Prikhodko, a Foreign Ministry official in charge of Baltic affairs, said Monday [11 April] in a telephone interview to BNS. "Also, we've not been officially informed by Latvia that it holds a different view," he said. Latvian officials, however, state that the case hasn't been closed yet. The Latvian Foreign Ministry declared after Russia's explanations that, in view of Moscow having already partly acknowledged the error of Yeltsin's order, "a logical step would be to either revoke or amend it." "Under Russian laws, the order takes effect on April 13, with which Latvia of course cannot agree," Peteris Vinkelis, first secretary of the Latvian Embassy in Moscow, told BNS. Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis announced on Friday that he indefinitely postpones his visit to Moscow originally set for April 20. The two countries planned in the course of the visit to sign a package of bilateral agreements on the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia. Ulmanis also said the initialed agreements are "unfavorable for Latvia." BNS has information that the Russian side intends to work out an altered version of the executive order. Changing the text of the order is linked with difficulties, however, since the heads of the country's defense and foreign political departments as well as the president are absent from Moscow. The presidential staff are also determined to find out the reason for the mistake in the executive order. Sergei Krasavchenko, deputy chief of the president's office, even conjectured in an interview with the ITAR-TASS news agency that "the mistake was not technical but a political act with the aim of foiling the meeting between the two countries' heads of state."
