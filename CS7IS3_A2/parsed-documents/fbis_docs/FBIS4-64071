Rutskoy And Zhirinovskiy May Disagree With Him"] [Text] Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation [CPRF], while meeting with the public in Samara, divulged his views on what he sees as the most likely scenarios of sociopolitical developments in Russia. According to Comrade Zyuganov, at this stage there are three. According to the first scenario, the "merger" between the authorities and the criminal structures will continue. Gennadiy Zyuganov pointed out that this development of events is eliciting extreme concern among both Russian and foreign politicians. The second option, which envisions "a social explosion accompanied by mass protests of badly-off groups driven to despair," does not suit the CPRF leader, either, because, in his view, the current "top authorities" will definitely try to shift all the blame on to mid- level local leaders, thanks to whom, Comrade Zyuganov believes, Russia still "holds." The CPRF leader sees the best possible scenario as the coming to power of patriotic forces. Gennadiy Zyuganov pointed out that the opposition forces would like to start work on the restoration of the USSR (apparently, not in the capacity of non-government organizations) as early as by the 50th anniversary of victory in the Great Patriotic War. Comrade Zyuganov said that the congress of the "Accord for Russia" movement on 28 May will make a number of decisions that will help form a formidable and well-structured opposition. At the same time, the movement's relations with two other large opposition associations -- the "State" ["Derzhava"] movement being set up by Aleksandr Rutskoy and Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] -- are still uncertain. Presently they disagree at least on one thing. So, according to Gennadiy Zyuganov, "the presidency, as it stands now, is detrimental to the country." However, any attempts to weaken the presidency will evidently draw a disapproving reaction from Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. As for Aleksandr Rutskoy's stance, the Russian Social Democratic People's Party leader said recently that he "somewhat mistrusts the CPRF" because of its stance both in August 1991 and in October 1993. Moreover, Mr. Rutskoy is also unlikely to be very enthusiastic about the abolition of the presidency or any considerable restriction of his powers.
