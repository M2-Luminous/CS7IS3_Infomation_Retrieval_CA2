FR940616-1-00005 FR940616-1-00002 Section 1607.3(d). With respect to the ``other'' board members, i.e., those that are neither attorney members nor eligible client members, the proposal makes it clear that recipient boards are permitted to fill the remaining ``other'' slots. This gives recipients flexibility to include board members who can help them with fundraising, community relations, coordination with other social service providers, or any other locally identified need. Law school professors who cannot count as ``attorney members'' because they are not admitted to practice in a state within the recipient's service area, could be selected for this category of membership. Although there is no comparable language in the current regulation, this provision is consistent with longstanding LSC interpretations. In addition, the proposal includes language that makes it clear that ``other'' board members should be selected with the goals of diversity in mind. Section 1607.3(e). This proposal adds language to the ``domination'' provision in the current regulation to make it clear that the provision was not intended to prevent recipients from designating a single regional or statewide client council as the appointing organization for client board members, so long as that client council represents numerous smaller client groups. Section 1607.3(f). The proposal deletes language which could be incorrectly interpreted to give LSC authority to veto particular methods of selecting local board members. In addition, the proposal states affirmatively that recipients may recommend names to and consult with bar associations and other appointing groups to insure that appropriate appointments are made. This revision recognizes that bar associations or other groups may request information on who would make a good legal services program board member and may rely on input from the recipients in making the appointments. Section 1607.3(g). The proposed rule includes a new provision that is intended to establish standards for dealing with recipient board vacancies. It establishes a standard of reasonable and good faith efforts to insure that governing body vacancies are filled promptly, but recognizes that recipients often have no control over the appointment process other than to change the groups that they have designated to make the appointments if a particular group fails to make an appointment in a timely manner. In order to avoid the creation of vacancies, recipients, through their own by-laws or board policies, could take a number of actions when appointing organizations are slow in making appointments, refuse to make them, or are unable to make them for whatever reason. For example, a recipient's board could permit its members to hold over until replacements are appointed, or could make short-term interim appointments, if necessary, until regular appointments can be made. Section 1607.3(h). The proposed regulation includes a new provision that grants the recipient the authority to reject an appointment of a board member when the recipient determines that the person who has been appointed does not meet the criteria set out in the regulation, including financial eligibility for client board members, or where the person appointed has a significant individual or institutional conflict of interest with the recipient or its client community. The ABA's Standards for Providers of Legal Services to the Poor states, in Standard 7.2&hyph;5, that ``governing body members should not knowingly attempt to influence any decisions in which they have a conflict of interest with provider clients'' and Standard 7.2&hyph;6 states that ``members should not be selected by *␣*␣* any institution or agency which is in conflict with the provider or its clients.'' The Commentary to those standards contains discussions of both institutional and individual conflicts of interest and suggests that when such conflicts arise with respect to a sitting board member, the member and the recipient should be guided by laws of the jurisdiction regarding disclosure and recusal. While the Standards state an absolute rule prohibiting appointments by institutions or agencies that have a conflict with the recipient or its clients (e.g. a welfare department or county attorney's office should not make appointments to a recipient's board), they also note that: If a person is employed by or is otherwise significantly connected with an institution that is in conflict with the provider's clients, generally that person should not serve on the governing body. That person may serve, however, if there is evidence *␣*␣* that the particular individual is not in actual conflict *␣*␣*. Thus, the question of whether it is appropriate for government attorneys or other public employees or elected officials, or attorneys representing finance companies or real estate developers, to serve on recipient governing bodies as members appointed by a bar association as its representative is a factual issue. The Commentary recognizes that: (c)onflicts may arise in the representation by attorney board members of institutions or individuals who are in conflict with provider clients. Concern about the risks associated with conflicts should not exclude from the governing body every person identified with an institution or individual with an adverse interest. A strict rule could exclude persons with skills and experience of benefit to the provider and could inhibit development of an effective relationship between the provider and the private bar. In rural areas particularly, where the pool of potential members is relatively small, it may be impossible to avoid all conflicts. The provider, however, should assure that the presence of members with potential conflicts does not inhibit forceful representation of clients. The proposed provision suggests a way that, under appropriate circumstances, the recipient can assure that individuals with clear and substantial conflicts of interest do not serve on its governing body, while permitting it to seat other individuals who may have a less substantial or merely potential conflict, and leaving it to the guidance of the applicable rules of professional responsibility when actual conflicts arise.
