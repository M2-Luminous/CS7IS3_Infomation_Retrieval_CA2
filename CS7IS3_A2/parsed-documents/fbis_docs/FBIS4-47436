The outcome demonstrated the efficacy of 2-5 applications of the homogenate: patients in the experimental group were discharged from the hospital on an average of 13.0 +/- 0.1 days earlier than the control subjects. Cytologic and bacteriological workups demonstrated that in the experimental group pus disappeared within an average of 3.0 +/- 0.1 days and granulation tissue appeared in 4.0 +/- 0.4 days, whereas in the control group analogous manifestations required 9.0 +/- 0.4 and 8.1 +/- 0.2 days, respectively. In general, the effects were attributed to absorptive capacity of the homogenates for bacteria, their metabolites and cell detritus, as well as anti-inflammatory factors.
