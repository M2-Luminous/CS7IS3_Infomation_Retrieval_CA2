In an exclusive interview Lev Volkov, full member of the International and Russian Engineering Academies and corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, who was involved in drawing up the program, told IZVESTIYA's military correspondent about its contents. Under the Treaty on the Reduction of Strategic Offensive Arms, Volkov said, the Strategic Missile Forces, which perform the role of chief deterrent force, may comprise 1,300 launchers with single-warhead ICBM's by the set deadline. But the country's actual economic potential will allow us to possess just 900 launchers. Which missile is to be chosen for this? A number of Russian scientific collectives, independent ones included, have researched possible scenarios for strategic nuclear forces operations, modeled their dynamics, and come to the conclusion that the prospective Strategic Missile Forces grouping must comprise a standardized solid-fuel missile like the modernized SS-25 ICBM with two basing options: stationary, in launch silos; and mobile, on self-propelled launchers with a wheeled chassis. IZVESTIYA information: The SS-25 ICBM (in Russia it is called the Topol RS-12M) is considered one of the most successful off-road mobile missile systems. The missile is made in Votkinsk. It weighs 45 tonnes and its throw-weight is equivalent to one tonne. It has been on alert duty in the Strategic Missile Forces since 1985. The general designer is Boris Lagutin. Why has the SS-25 been chosen from among the six existing types of missiles? In Lev Volkov's opinion, there are several reasons for this. First, it uses solid fuel, which is safe in operation, and this in itself provides a substantial gain. Second, it is very economical. Given our infrastructure of existing and possible position areas, the road network in them, special geological features, the cost of capital construction, and the availability of housing for officers and their families, such a missile will be most affordable. At the same time the optimum ratio of stationary and mobile missile systems has also been established: 60-70 to 40-30. Specialists proceeded from an assessment of their combat efficiency and cost. It transpired that the average expenditure per warhead whose delivery to target can be guaranteed is for mobile-based single-warhead missiles practically coincident with the expenditure for stationary launchers with the now accepted degree of protection. If the silos' degree of protection is increased, their cost could end up almost twice that of mobile systems. Incidentally, Lev Volkov said, it is known that there have been eight disasters involving the operation of nuclear-powered submarines with nuclear missiles on board in the naval strategic nuclear forces of our country and the United States. Nuclear munitions have been lost and people have died. There have been similar occurrences with aircraft, but God has spared the Strategic Missile Forces. According to specialists' calculations, the probability of an incident involving a mobile launcher is estimated at one in 100,000 in the course of a year; that is, if 500 SPU's [self-propelled launchers] are operated for 10 years, there could be a 5-percent probability of an incident involving one of them. In industry such a probability is considered safe. I asked Lev Ivanovich why the Americans abandoned the Midgetman land-based mobile system if they are so efficient and safe to operate. The reason is simple: By the year 2005 the United States will have 18 nuclear-powered submarines with powerful and highly accurate Trident-2 missiles (1,728 warheads in all) capable of hitting both pinpoint and area targets. This is more than enough for a deterrent. They have no need to spend money on new development. We will not do this either.
