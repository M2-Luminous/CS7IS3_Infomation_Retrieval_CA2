The aims is to make it a pillar of the regional economy by the turn of the century. The money will be used to start more petrochemical businesses and launch six major petrochemical production centers in the region during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-95) and the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000). According to Li Fulin, director of the Petrochemical Industrial Bureau of Inner Mongolia, during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period, the petrochemical industry of the region is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 17.5 percent. By the year 2000, total output value of the petrochemical industry is expected to hit 8.844 billion yuan. The petrochemical industry has been developing rapidly over the past years in the autonomous region, known for its vast grassland and well developed animal husbandry. In 1993, the petrochemical industry in the autonomous region generated 2.335 billion yuan in output value. As one of China's leading pastoral areas, Inner Mongolia also abounds in petrochemical resources, with reserves of major raw chemical industrial materials of coal, petroleum, natural gas, trona, salt and mirabilite. The autonomous region has 13 large natural gas fields and its verified oil reserves are estimated at 21 billion bbl [barrels] and natural gas, 150 billion cu m [cubic meters]. The rich petrochemical industrial resources and the implementation of various reform measures have given rise to the quick development of petrochemical industry in this north China autonomous region, said local officials. At present, Inner Mongolia, which used to rely heavily just on animal husbandry, has now 132 enterprises engaged in petrochemical industrial production, turning out 28 categories of products, such as basic chemical raw materials, organic chemicals, synthetic materials, and chemicals for agricultural use.
