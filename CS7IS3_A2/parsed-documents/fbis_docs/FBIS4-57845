U.S. President Bill Clinton sent to the U.S. Congress a number of suggestions for changes in the law that regulates the Panama Canal. The proposal includes changing the Panama Canal Commission into a government corporation, making the requirements for the composition of its Board of Directors more flexible, and permitting the participation of international advisers in board meetings. In Panama, the president is studying the proposal. [Begin Endara recording] I am not familiar with the details of Bill Clinton's proposal. From what I understand, President Clinton's proposal stems from a senator's proposal, which was studied by Panamanian authorities, and, in general, we agreed with it. Nevertheless, I am going to ask the five [number as heard] Panamanian members of the Panama Canal Commission's Board of Directors and the Presidential Commission on Panama Canal Affairs to undertake a study to enable the Panamanians to respond to the proposal. In general, I understand it is a good proposal. [end recording] The changes suggested by Clinton include the review of tolls and the strengthening of the Panama Canal Commission regulations. In our country, sectors such as the Interoceanic Region Authority [ARI] agree with these changes. [Begin ARI member Carlos Mendoza recording] The goal is to more smoothly, expeditiously, and functionally conduct the transition of the U.S.-administered Canal to a Panamanian administration, which begins on the first day of the year 2000. [end recording] While officials evaluate the proposal, President Endara will discuss this topic with U.S. Vice President Al Gore in Honduras on 24 May.
