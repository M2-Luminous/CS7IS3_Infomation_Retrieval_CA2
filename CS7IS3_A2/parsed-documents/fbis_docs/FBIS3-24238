Everything is much simpler now. One only needs to observe the Constitution, and fame along with a position will cover you. Aleksey Kazannik, Valeriy Zorkin and, incidentally, even Valentin Stepankov proved that brilliantly. Unfortunately, another question has remained opened: In today's Russia, can one combine observance of the law with a high position? Following the logic of the radical reformers and their popularizers, one cannot. During a recent television broadcast about A. Kazannik, they literally passed sentence -- a political Don Quiote -- with some sympathy for the former general procurator. He did not understand that they had brought him "upstairs" not for his professional qualities but only because he once did the president a good turn -- namely, a service. Personal devotion is the priority requirement for an official. What does this mean in the judicial system? With the departure of people dedicated to the law from its "upper" stories, a complete failure awaits the system. Those who keep to the letter of the law will help. Already, there are not enough judges and people's assessors now. They are on the run under the threats of corrupted bureaucrats and legalized criminals. Only, where should the main mass of the population, from whom they have consistently and step by step taken away all the departments for protecting them beginning with our almost home-spun local trade union committees and ending with the opportunity to achieve justice in a court where one had not come with a purse, run? This summer, I had an occasion to ask V. Zorkin how he would have acted if something similar to the celebrated OPUS [Osoboye Poryadok Upravleniya Stranoy--play on word "opus", meaning "work"] appeared again? The answer was: "I would have acted according to the constitution." V. Zorkin proved this in the fall which does not now make him completely happy. The Constitutional Court is still closed down. An individual, who is personally devoted but undergoing a libel case, is performing the duties of general procurator. The Constitution, even if it is a presidential one, leaves too broad a field for interpretation.
