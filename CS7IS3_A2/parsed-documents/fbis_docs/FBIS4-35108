Nevertheless, skepticism is starting to develop in many camps in regard to the tapes, and there is speculation about the real intention behind the mailing of the tapes. Another narcocassette appeared today and included recordings of two conversations and a communique pointing to alleged conversations between Cali Cartel members and journalist Alberto Giraldo. After being analyzed by the authorities, it was disclosed that one of the tapes is a copy of tapes made public last week. The content of the second tape is still being investigated. According to authorities, the tapes, communique, threats, and rumors of terrorist attacks in the country are being disseminated by groups seeking to promote chaos in the country for unknown reasons. This afternoon, the government, via the Government Ministry, reminded the media of the ban currently in effect barring the transmission of communiques or messages originating from guerrillas or terrorist groups. The minister stressed that it is also prohibited to disseminate through radio or television any interviews with members of criminal organizations.
