This program bears two distinct characteristics: First, it gives full expression to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as its guidance and to the principles and policies set by the Central Committee and the State Council for deepening rural reform and attaching importance to and supporting agricultural development. Second, it makes an overall plan for national agricultural development with stress on developing productive forces. In light of the demand for setting up a socialist market economy at a greater pace, it clearly defines the ideological guidance, objectives, and specific tasks of developing agricultural production, so it will serve as an important guide in our efforts to improve our capacity in comprehensive agricultural production and to elevate our agricultural production to a new level and will prove highly operational. Agricultural and rural economic development involves many quarters and requires great attention by the whole party, and powerful and coordinated support by all departments concerned. In carrying out the program, it is necessary to focus on and make a success of the following six tasks: 1. Under the new situation of setting up a socialist market economy, to meet the party Central Committee and the State Council's demands, it is necessary to firmly carry out the principle of taking agriculture as the foundation of our economy, putting agriculture in the first place of our economic work. This is the prerequisite for ensuring overall implementation of the program. Agriculture serves as the foundation of economic development, social stability, and national independence. This is the scientific summation of our experience in economic construction over the last several decades and a fundamental principle we must always uphold in economic work. As compared with the 1980's, our present tasks of developing agricultural production are more arduous. Agricultural production will need not only to meet the demands of the people's relatively comfortable life and of accelerated economic development in terms of quantity, quality, and variety, but also to create favorable conditions for economic development in the next century. In light of these requirements, the program sets principal targets to be attained in rural economic development by 2000. These targets were based on the results of overall balance and repeated calculations. They are fundamental targets which must be hit and also serve as conditions for attaining the strategic objectives for national and social development in 2000. It is possible for us to attain these targets as scheduled but it also involves considerable difficulties. Therefore, we must not be content with issuing general calls for action, instead, we must truly putting agriculture in the first place of our economic work in line with the Central Committee and the State Council's demands. We must not be satisfied with putting down on paper the principle of giving top priority to agriculture or with agreeing with it in words, but must really carry it out in our economic work. Just as General Secretary Jiang Zemin said at the national rural work conference held last year: "It is necessary to strengthen agriculture, which serves as the foundation of our economy, truly rather than superficially, in deeds rather than in words, and whole- heartedly rather than half-heartedly." 2. While enabling the market mechanism to play a leading role in allocation of agricultural resources, we must attach great importance to macro guidance for agricultural development and accelerate adjustment of agricultural structure and layout in an appropriate way so that agricultural development will meet the demands of national economic development. Grain and cotton are necessities for the people's life. Whether there is a steady development of grain and cotton production has a great bearing on the overall situation. As compared with production in other fields, grain and cotton production, grain production in particular, have greater social effect but lower economic efficiency. Over the last few years some regions excessively reduced the area sown to grain and cotton during economic restructuring. The Central Committee and the State Council have accorded considerable attention to this problem and have formulated a series of policies to promote grain and cotton production. To ensure a steady development of grain and cotton production, it is essential to pay attention to the following points: 1) If the yield per-unit area is not raised by a big margin, the area sown to grain and cotton should basically remain unchanged. Given our present capacity in comprehensive agricultural production, at least 1.65 million mu of land should be planted with grain and 900 million mu with cotton nationwide, and these two figures should be treated as security lines. If the total areas under grain and cotton are smaller than these figures, timely measures against the tendency must be taken. 2) National grain production and marketing should follow the principle that each province (autonomous region) should be more than self-sufficient or basically self-sufficient in grain and should transfer grain to or from nearby areas. By the end of this century, most provinces (autonomous regions) must be basically self-sufficient in grain. A few provinces (municipalities and autonomous regions) which have to transfer grain from other areas must establish long-term relationships with nearby provinces with superfluous grain, in terms of grain production and sales. 3) Continued efforts should be made to set up marketable grain and cotton bases in areas with great production potential to stabilize the overall situation. 4) The greatest possible number of grain- and cotton-producing areas should be helped to develop a diversified economy to put an end to the situation in which "some counties are big ones in terms of grain and cotton production, small ones in terms of industrial production, and poor ones in terms of financial status." The central government has decided to make concentrated efforts to support 500 select counties producing a great amount of marketable grain and 150 select counties producing a great amount of quality cotton by providing special loans and appropriately increasing investment in infrastructure. From now on, governments in all localities should try their best to support grain- and cotton-producing areas in their efforts to increase production and develop the economy. 3. While persisting in developing agricultural production, we should ensure a constant increase in peasants' income so as to arouse their enthusiasm for production. The peasants play a decisive role in agricultural production so we must arouse their enthusiasm for production to stabilize agricultural production. To enable the majority of the peasants to live a relatively comfortable life by the year 2000, we must ensure that the peasants' per-capita net income will increase by at least 5.8 percent annually. What merits our attention is: Despite rapid growth in agricultural production and the rural economy over the last few years, the peasants' actual income has gone up slowly, resulting in a greater income gap between residents in rural and urban areas. If things go on like this, the peasants' enthusiasm and rural stability will be affected. Therefore, we must guarantee a steady increase in peasants' income, regarding this as an important measure to stabilize agricultural production and the rural situation and to attain the objectives for agricultural development set for 2000. One, while stabilizing principal agricultural products including grain and cotton, vigorous efforts should be made to develop a diversified economy, including the breeding industry, and enterprises engaged in processing mainly agricultural and sideline products, in a bid to extend agricultural production links and to add value to farm produce. Two, the peasants should be encouraged to develop a highly efficient agriculture that provides greater and better yields in accordance with market needs. To develop a highly efficient type of farming that provides greater and better yields, the central government has decided to set up a number of relevant demonstration zones with different characteristics in different areas in a planned way, supplying them with technology, funds, materials, and other essential factors of production. The project is also designed for in-depth development of agricultural products in terms of variety and quality. Various localities can follow this example by setting up their own demonstration zones. Three, it is essential to continue developing township enterprises and the tertiary industry in rural areas to increase employment opportunities for surplus rural labor. At present, there is a total of 100 million unemployed peasants throughout the country and this figure will increase to 200 million by the year 2000, so the situation with employment in rural areas is desperate. If we can create new outlets for surplus labor on the land, we will greatly increase the productivity of agricultural labor and peasants' income. It is essential to attach importance to economic development in central and western regions. After making an additional special loan of 5 billion yuan to support the development of township enterprises in central and western regions in 1993, the state has decided to increase the same loan every year from 1994 on to support the development of township enterprises across the country. All localities should try their best to provide technology, funds, and materials to support the development of township enterprises. Four, further effective measures should be taken to lighten the peasants' burden and to protect agricultural production. The price increase of farming means should be controlled and the prices of farm produce adjusted in line with the gap between the prices of industrial and agricultural products. A grain relief fund for natural disasters should be set up, prices set for major farm products to protect the interests of the farmers, and measures taken to ensure the peasants will benefit from state policies to the full. Again, laws and regulations and a mechanism for protecting the peasants' interests should be set up. Five, poor areas should be further helped to shake off poverty and to boost economic development. The state has set about making a plan, under which 80 million poor people will shake off poverty within seven years beginning 1994. 4. We must make concentrated efforts to promote agricultural education and scientific and technological progress so as to elevate the overall quality of agriculture and rural economic development to a new level. We must mainly rely upon increasing per-unit output to hit the target for agricultural growth for the 1990's, raising the per-mu yields of grain and cotton by 50 and 12 km respectively within 10 years, which nears the growth rate in the 1980's. To achieve this, we must promote scientific and technological progress and improve conditions for agricultural production. In the next few years, while continuing to promote basic agricultural scientific research, we must vigorously spread the use of scientific research achievements which have proved remarkably effective in raising per- unit yield and quality of agricultural products. First, we should select, cultivate, and spread improved strains of crops, timber, animals, poultry, and aquatic products. The plan for using strains related to grain and cotton production nationwide should be updated once or twice in the 1990's and the good strains of animals, poultry, aquatic products, sugar-yielding bearing crops, timber, and fruits should be spread to a wider area than they are now. Second, appropriate agricultural technology should be vigorously popularized. The growing industry should focus on spreading such technologies as extensive model cultivation [guang mo shi hua zhai pei 1639 2875 1709 0553 2707 1014], dry agriculture [han zhuo nong ye 2487 0155 6593 2814], plastic film sheeting, soil conservation cultivation [bao hu di zhai pei 0202 6233 0966 2707 1014], and forecast and comprehensive prevention and elimination of damage done by plant diseases, pests, rats, and weeds. The breeding industry should focus on popularizing such technologies as optimized rearing of animals and poultry; mixed feed; plant stem ammonification; efficient breeding in fresh and sea water; resources proliferation [zi yuan zeng zhi 6327 3293 1073 2994]; and prevention, control, and elimination of epidemic diseases. Efforts should also be made to spread the advanced technologies of keeping fresh, processing, preserving, and shipping agricultural products. By the year 2000, 50 percent of agricultural scientific research achievements should be transformed into actual productive forces. Third, such water-efficient irrigation technologies as piped water supply [guan dao shu shui 4619 6670 6551 3055], irrigation canal lining [qu dao chen qi 3255 6670 6000 4265], antiseepage [fang shen 7089 3334], spray irrigation, and drip irrigation should be spread in line with actual conditions to gradually raise the utilization ratio of irrigation water to 50 percent from the present 40 percent. Fourth, scientific methods of applying fertilizers and pesticides should be popularized to raise the utilization ratio of fertilizers and to bring about better results in preventing, controlling, and eliminating plant diseases and pests. And fifth, farming technique should be improved in line with local conditions to raise the multiple crop index. By the year 2000, the national multiple crop index should reach 160 percent, 10 percent over that in the late 1980's. 5. It is necessary to further promote comprehensive agricultural development to tap agricultural production potential. The government has decided to further nationwide comprehensive agricultural development in a planned way and clearly set the tasks for nationwide comprehensive agricultural development through the year 2000. All development zones have decided on their own focal points of work. The central government has continued to stabilize and improve the policies for comprehensive agricultural development as follows: The additional grain output brought about by upgrading farmland that formerly provided only low and medium yields and grain produced on newly reclaimed land are not subject to state purchase within five years. Newly reclaimed land is exempt from taxes within five years, the state will provide loans with discount interest to agricultural development zones, the state will build more major water conservancy projects, and the state will grant preferential treatment to agricultural development zones in distributing farming means including diesel oil, chemical fertilizers, and insecticides. All localities must conscientiously implement these policies to speed up comprehensive agricultural development. 6. Vigorous efforts should be made to build more projects supporting agricultural production so that fundamental conditions for agricultural production will be improved and greater power for sustained agricultural development will be built up. Projects supporting agricultural production provide guarantees for steady agricultural development. To hit the target for agricultural expansion, we must build more supportive projects. The supportive projects comprise three major parts: One, fundamental facilities for agricultural production including mainly water conservancy projects and projects guaranteeing stable and high yields. Two, industries supporting agricultural production which mainly include enterprises producing chemical fertilizers, farming machines, farm- oriented plastic film, feed, pesticides, and vaccines and medicines for animals and poultry against diseases. Three, a socialized service system providing weather forecasts, technical advisory service, and information about rural finance; farming materials; purchasing and marketing of agricultural products; storage, transportation, and processing of agricultural products; and others. To attain the fundamental targets for the development of agricultural production and the rural economy set by the program, governments at all levels must strengthen leadership over agricultural production and rural work. They should also formulate and carry out their own plans for implementing the program in line with the spirit of the "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure" adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC National Congress, with the guidelines laid down by the national rural work conference held by the central authorities not long ago, and with actual local conditions. Various departments under the State Council must make concerted efforts to ensure that the targets for agricultural development for the 1990's will be attained.
