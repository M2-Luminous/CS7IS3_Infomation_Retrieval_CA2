FR941107-1-00024 FR941107-1-00007 As a result of the proposed amendments, disclosure would be required of any order or sanction resulting from proceedings brought under the federal securities laws, including court-imposed civil money penalties and judicial orders temporarily barring an individual from serving as an officer or director of a public company, as authorized by the Remedies Act. 79 Disclosure of such orders or sanctions would be required, whether or not the court makes a finding that securities laws were violated. 80 79 See, e.g. , Section 20(d) and 20(e) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77t(d) and (e)]. 80 While courts may issue orders upon a proper showing without finding securities law violations, all administrative orders issued by the Commission contain findings of a violation or violations of securities laws and regulations, even when the order is the result of a settlement agreement. Consequently, disclosure of all orders or sanctions issued by the Commission, such as cease-and-desist orders, pursuant to the enforcement provisions added by the Remedies Act would be required under both current and proposed provisions. Similarly, disclosure explicitly would be required of any judicial or administrative finding, order or sanction issued or imposed against the designated person under the enforcement provisions of the federal laws and regulations governing financial institutions, as amended by the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (``FIRREA''), 81 as well as under similar state statutes and regulations. 82 For example, the proposed disclosure requirements would reach a civil money penalty imposed pursuant to a settlement agreement between a designated person and a bank regulator, where the final order neither included findings of violations of the law nor imposed any limitation on that person's acting in any capacity related to banks or savings and loan associations. 81 Pub. L. No. 101&hyph;73, 103 Stat. 183 (1989). FIRREA amended the enforcement provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (``FDIA'') [12 U.S.C. 1811 et seq. ], the Federal Reserve Act [12 U.S.C. 221 et seq. ], the Home Owner's Loan Act of 1933 [12 U.S.C. 1461 et seq. ], the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 [12 U.S.C. 1841 et seq. ], the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 [12 U.S.C. 1971 et seq. ], the Bank Protection Act of 1968 [12 U.S.C. 1881 et seq. ], and the Federal Credit Union Act [12 U.S.C.A. 1751 et seq .]. The enforcement provisions relating to the Farm Credit Administration are found in the Farm Credit Act of 1971 [12 U.S.C. 2001 et seq. ]. 82 E.g., Cal. Financial Code §§5000&hyph;12000 (California laws governing savings and loan associations); N.Y. Banking Law §§10&hyph;46 (New York laws establishing the New York Banking Department, the Superintendent of Banks, and their supervisory and regulatory powers). b. Fraud in connection with a financial institution, insurance company, or other business entity. The proposals would expand current provisions by requiring disclosure of legal proceedings involving alleged violations by a designated person of any law or regulation prohibiting fraud in connection with a financial institution, insurance company or other business entity. Disclosure of legal proceedings involving fraud currently is limited to criminal fraud proceedings, civil and administrative actions involving fraud in connection with violations of securities or commodities laws, and orders restricting the designated person from acting as a director, employee or affiliated person of a bank, savings and loan association or insurance company or from engaging in related activities based on that person's fraudulent conduct. Consequently, in addition to the actions for which disclosure is currently required, the proposals would require disclosure of a court order enjoining the designated person from knowingly defrauding a financial institution, whether or not the court imposed restrictions on the person's future business relationship with the institution. 83 Another example of required disclosure would be a court judgment against a designated person for violating consumer fraud statutes in connection with that person's business. 84 83 See 18 U.S.C 1345 (allowing civil actions by the United States to enjoin the execution of a scheme or artifice to knowingly defraud a financial institution, as prohibited by 18 U.S.C. 1344 [Bank fraud]). 84 See, e.g. , Del. Code. Ann. tit. 6, §§2513 et seq.
