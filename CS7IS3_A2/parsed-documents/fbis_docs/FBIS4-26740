A senior Chinese arbitrator said the Model Law, which was adopted by the UN Commission on International Trade Law (Uncitral) in 1985, would help bring the Chinese law closer to international practices. The draft version of the law is being discussed by China's highest legislative body, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. But some sensitive issues are yet to be resolved before the law is approved. First, there is the question whether ad hoc arbitration will be allowed in China, where disputes have up until now been settled by institutional arbitration. Ad hoc arbitration costs less money and time for feuding parties than institutional solutions. Second is whether China should adopt a uniform arbitration law for both international and domestic commercial disputes. Despite these issues, there seems to be a general consensus that arbitration should be independent from administrative organizations to ensure fairer judgments. At the moment, the country's arbitration regulations are part of the Law of Civil Procedure. But the first national arbitration law will be separate from the civil procedure law. Tang Houzhi, vice-chairman of the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (Cietac), said China can learn from advanced international experiences. Cietac and the International Council for Commercial Arbitration (Icca) organized the International Commercial Arbitration Conference in Beijing last week. It was the first time an Icca meeting was held in a developing country. But developing countries are playing a more important role in international commercial arbitration, said Tang. Last year China topped the world's 80 arbitration centres in terms of numbers of cases handled. Arbitration awards made by Cietac must be enforced by countries that adhere to the 1958 New York Convention. China joined the Convention in 1958 but did not implement it until 1987. Xu Dayou, another Cietac vice-chairman, revealed that the biggest dispute handled by his organization so far involved $30 million. Cietac, China's sole international commercial arbitration body, has dealt with disputes arising from a growing number of sectors, including real estate, leasing and joint venture contracts. Unlike most Western centres, Cietac combines arbitration with conciliation. The disadvantage of arbitration is that an award can leave a lasting bitterness between the disputing parties. But successful combination of arbitration and conciliation can satisfy both sides. Tang said China's model can be spread throughout the Asia-Pacific region.
