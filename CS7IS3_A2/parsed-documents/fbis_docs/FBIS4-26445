What image has Taiwan conjured up in the international community? What impact will it exert on cross-strait relations? People might size up the situation and make a judgment on it by linking it to the Taiwan authorities' past behavior. The deepest impression the four-country trip left us is precisely that this Taiwan leader "tossing silver dollars along his way" -- was giving dollar-alms to some economically underdeveloped impoverished and small countries to buy their popular support for Taiwan's "return to the United Nations." Last year, the Taiwan authorities' attempt to "return to the United Nations" met with the opposition and resistance of the international community and went bankrupt, but they would not let the matter drop. Since the beginning of this year, the Taiwan authorities have stepped up their activities, with some prominent figures made frequent trips to visit some foreign countries to demonstrate Taiwan's status as a "sovereign state." During the spring festival this year, the Taiwan authorities' leader went to some Southeast Asian countries on "holiday calls"; an important purpose of which was precisely to rely on its "strength in economy and trade" "to expand its international living space," in an attempt to become a dialogue partner with ASEAN countries so as to obtain its status of a political body and thus squeeze itself into this regional international organization, thereby laying a foundation for its future "return to the United Nations.". To achieve this purpose, the Taiwan authorities have provided several Southeast Asian countries with $150 million low-interest loans in the form of aid. During his four-country visit this year, he was playing the same old trick, and continued to buy popular support with huge sums of money. In Nicaragua, he forgave its $17 million loan, in addition to providing it with a $30 million low-interest loan in exchange for Nicaragua's support for Taiwan's "return to the United Nations." In Costa Rica, he provided the country with a $15 million low-interest loan in exchange for the country's guarantee to support Taiwan's "return to the United Nations." In South Africa, he provided the country with $15 million to consolidate "diplomatic relations" between the two sides. In Swaziland, he also provided the country with a considerable loan. To accomplish certain political aims, the Taiwan authorities also provided funds for the candidates in some countries' general elections, which can be likened to placing bets on those who had greater probabilities to win, aside from giving alms in public. Such improper practices already have aroused reproaches and repugnance from political circles and the masses in some countries. The Taiwan people have long expressed their resentment of the authorities' squandering money. They indicated that "dollar diplomacy" was like taking a stimulant that had only a brief effect, but would not effect permanent cure." A major Taiwan newspaper expressed doubt as to what role such countries' accepting aid could play in Taiwan's "return to the United Nations." The paper said, compared with over 100 UN members, the strength of the friendly Central and South American countries was limited, even insignificant. The important task in the four-country visit by the Taiwan leader was to consolidate "diplomatic relations" with South Africa through the swearing-in ceremonies for newly elected South African President Mandela. For this reason, aside from providing the loan, he expected the new South African administration would develop its relations with Taiwan and PRC according to the "dual recognition" pattern. In coordination with this, some Taiwan officials, media, and hired scholars once again raised a hubbub concerning the theory of "dual recognition." Some high-ranking responsible persons openly asserted that Taiwan was ready to accept "dual recognition," regardless of the one-China principle. In fact, reviewing the various tricks to which the Taiwan authorities have resorted since the 1960's in their fight for "international living space," it is not difficult to see that the "dual recognition" attempt has never succeeded, but some decision-makers among the Taiwan authorities have failed to realize their errors and mend their ways, while increasingly distancing themselves from the "one-China" principle. In the 1960's, France, the Congo, and Dahomey established diplomatic relations with PRC; at that time, Taiwan's embassies tried to stay in those countries and would not leave. At last, they had to lower the flag, remove the embassies, and leave those countries. In late 1980's, the Taiwan authorities set out the principle of "pragmatic diplomacy," and changed from "swearing not to coexist with the enemy" to "staying put when the enemy comes." Regarding "dual recognition at that time, the Taiwan authorities adopted the practice of doing it, but not saying it aloud. In the early 1990's, the Taiwan authorities dished up the "Program for National Reunification," announcing that "under the prerequisite of one China, Taiwan and Mainland China should show respect for one another without rejecting each other in international affairs." When this program was presented, it came under fire from Mainland China and form figures who showed concern for the reunification of the motherland, while indicating that in the program the adherence to one China was false, the truth was to deepen the split between Taiwan and the motherland. Under such circumstances, the Taiwan authorities dare not announce openly that their pursuit in promoting "dual recognition" is the goal of their "diplomatic policy"; in practice, however, they have never given up the opportunity and attempt to promote it. Recently, a responsible person of Taiwan's "Executive Yuan" stated: By "dual recognition" we mean a sort of parallel relation, not one of opposition. Therefore, he had to admit that Mainland China would by no means agree to such a concept. It follows that Taiwan is to face lots of difficulties in "diplomatic work." Obviously, the resolute opposition to "dual recognition" on the part of Mainland China is based on the fundamental interests of the entire Chinese nation, and on firmly safeguarding the "one China" principle. As adherence to the "one China" principle is an important tie to maintain the fresh-and-blood relations of the compatriots in Taiwan and China Mainland, any speech or action deviating from or shaking this important principle will seriously affect the healthy development of interactive cross-strait relations. An increasingly growing number of facts demonstrated that in handling foreign relations or relations with the mainland, some decision-makers among the Taiwan authorities are dangerously moving further from the path of the "one China" principle. Recently, a person in office representing the Taiwan authorities said that the concept of "China" is vague. It would not be strange if this statement had been made by some Taiwan Democratic Progress Party member, but it was made by none other than a person in office representing the Taiwan authorities, and that has given us much food for thought. How can he adhere to the "one China" principle? What position has he placed himself in before the righteous cause of the Chinese nation and history?
