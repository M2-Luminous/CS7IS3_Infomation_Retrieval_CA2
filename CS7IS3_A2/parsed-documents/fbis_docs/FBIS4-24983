Over the past 11 years, about 50,000 ships from more than 50 countries and regions in the world have docked at the 13 ports along the Chang Jiang River. Foreign ships with displacement of up to 10,000 tons can sail to the ports from Shanghai to Nanjing in the lower reach of the Chang Jiang River, and ones with displacement of up to 5,000 tons can get to the ports up to Wuhan from Nanjing in the medium reach of the river. In the first three months of this year, the ports along the lower and middle reaches of the Chang Jiang have served more than 3,000 foreign ships. More than 50 ports along the Chang Jiang River in Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi and Hubei Provinces have set business relations with more than 50 countries and regions in the world. The ports also opened up more than 30 international transport routes to foreign countries. The export cargoes at Wuhan port, such as steel and fertilizers, can be shipped to more than 20 countries.
