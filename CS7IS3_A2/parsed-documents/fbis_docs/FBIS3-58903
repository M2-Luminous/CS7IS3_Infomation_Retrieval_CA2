The Federal Government expects conditions comparable to those existing for Asian products and businesses in Germany, the FDP [Free Democratic Party] chairman said today in opening a conference attended by 21 German ambassadors in Bonn. He promised "political support" for German companies, which want long-term involvement in Asia. The promotion of economic interests in the region has priority in Germany's Asian policy. In Kinkel's view, Germany and Europe should have access to the growth markets of Asia in order to retain their competitiveness. "We are faced in our country with the challenge of achieving a necessary thrust for modernization through restructuring and innovation." More intensive contacts on a political level are also required, however. On the grounds of their economic strength, the major Asian states are in the process of asserting their right to have a say internationally . Kinkel said the Bundeswehr would continue to be involved "in an appropriate manner" in international operations in the region, as in Cambodia most recently. Bonn would also comment in future on gross violations of human rights in the region. The main points of future German Asian policy are to be set out at the three-day conference, which is also attended by German industry representatives.
