[passage omitted] Kanther told the congress participants that the German government would be on their side whenever "it was a question of moving the right to homeland a step forward towards its full recognition and realisation." He said that Germans wanted to live with Czechs as peaceful neighbours. It was thus necessary to solve problems together, and this also meant together with the Sudeten Germans. "Sudeten Germans have to be integrated into future German-Czech relations with great calm and matter-of-factness, in a spirit of friendship and reconciliation and the abandoning of revanchism," Kanther said. It would help attempts at understanding when "those responsible in the Czech Republic recognise it as a priority of mutual relations." "I know that dialogue between Sudeten Germans and our Czech neighbours will not be simple," Kanther said. He also stressed that normalisation of the situation in Central and Eastern Europe was in the German interest. He omitted from the prepared version of his speech, which met with only measured applause, a more vigorously formulated passage addressed to the Czech government. Stoiber's speech was clearly motivated by the June elections to the European parliament and the September elections to the Bavarian Land Assembly. He praised Czech-Bavarian cooperation, but said it was lacking in discussion between Prague and the Sudeten Germans. "What is missing is political dialogue between the Czech government, the Czech parliament, and elected representatives of the Sudeten German Landsmannschaft (countrymen's association)" he said. "Rejecting dialogue is not politics," he said, adding that he believed this policy "harmed a good neighbourly relationship." He also called upon German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel to "put this dialogue on to the German-Czech agenda," and spoke in favour of the abolishment of the Benes decrees of "lawlessness" by which the Sudeten Germans were expelled from Czechoslovakia (after the Second World War) which "are no longer suitable for the European landscape of the end of the 20th century. Stoiber denied using the planned oil pipeline from Ingolstadt, Bavaria to the Czech Republic as a means of putting political pressure on the Czech Republic. "The pipeline project is another sign of our good neighbourliness," he said, adding that Czech leaders recognised that Bavaria was not only talking, but was also acting in favour of bilateral cooperation. Yesterday, Federal Finance Minister and chairman of Bavaria's Christian Social Union (CSU) Theo Waigel had also called upon the Czech Republic to hold dialogue with Sudeten Germans. Another speaker today was Imrich Kruzliak, introduced as an adviser to Slovak President Michal Kovac. "The Sudeten question cannot be swept under the carpet because of political calculations," he said. The congress, which takes place every year, was attended by several tens of thousands of people. The organisers are talking about a figure of 100,000. According to information from the Landsmannschaft, 3.8 million people now declare themselves to be Sudeten Germans, of whom 3.4 million live in Germany, 160,000 in Austria and 100,000 in the Czech Republic. However, in the last census in the former Czechoslovakia in 1990, only 50,000 people declared themselves to be of German nationality. [passage omitted] The Nuremberg meeting was not attended by official representatives of the Czech Republic. Until 1989, in fact, the Czechoslovak ambassador used to leave West Germany in protest every year for the duration of the congress. In 1990, however, the ambassador came to the congress, and in 1991 it was attended by a group of Czech parliamentary deputies. [passage omitted]
