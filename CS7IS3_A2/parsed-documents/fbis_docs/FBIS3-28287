As for the stock market, share prices began the decline from early 1990 ahead of the real economy and subsequently, though trading is more active that at one time, the turnover is approximately 300 million shares (daily average trading volume during September) or less than one-third of that during the peak period. Thus, the stock market is still in the wintry season, but there are encouraging signs. Subscriptions to JR [Japan Railway] East Japan shares surpassed initital estimates and showed a glimpse of the potential investors' strength. One would like to blame the current recession of the real economy as the main and sole reason why the stock market has been sluggish for such a long period, but if the developments leading up until now are analyzed carefully, one notices that many causes lie in the securities sector itself, and they have been contributing greatly to market stagnancy. Overshadowed by the severity of the economic recession, these problems are becoming less noticeable, but to recall potential investors to the exchange and build a strong market, the problems of the stock market itself must be resolved fundamentally. At the request of the Tokyo Stock Exchange Regular Members Association, this research institute organized the "Research Committee on the Future Securities Market and Securities Industry" (chairman, Osaka University Professor Shoichi Royama) in October 1992 and had been conducting discussions and research, and the results have now been compiled into a report for release. The report points out the problems of the securities market and proposes measures that should be taken to develop the market and also presents a view of the future securities market and industry. Portions of the report are presented below. Future Stock Market as Seen From Qualitative Standpoint In the report, the future image of the stock market is visualized from both the qualitative and quantitative standpoints. The future stock market, as seen from the qualitative standpoint, is discussed first. Changes in the Trading System Heretofore, the securities trading system followed by the main advanced capitalist countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany, has centered on stock exchanges and was generally similar to Japan's trading system. However, in recent years, this traditional trading system has been undergoing drastic changes on a worldwide scale. As causes for the change, the growth of institutional investors, development of electronics, competition among exchanges, etc. can be mentioned. The growth of institutional investors has caused changes in the rules affecting fixed commissions, market concentration requirements, restrictions on dealings by brokers, etc., while the development of electronics has made possible transactions that do not require a trading floor. Also, the trading system is changing drastically because of competition among exchanges, whether domestic or foreign, to attract transactions. Japan is not an exception. These changes will probably have various effects on the securities industry in the future. For example, the execution function in dealer operations might become less important, the management service function might become more significant, and the importance of the dealer's role as a market maker, which was not seriously regarded up until now, might increase in the future. Expand Business Sphere of Securities Industry Through advancement of liberalization, the business sphere of the securities industry might expand. As reasons for the potential expansion, first, the development of financial transactions in the form of negotiable securities to preclude assumption of indirect financial institutions' operational costs can be considered. Other reasons that can be mentioned are: Through mutual entries permitted by financial system reform, commercial products which could not be handled up until now can be offered; since the definition of securities was widened through revision of the Securities and Exchange Law, the development of new securities is possible; because of complete liberalization of deposit interest rates, investment trusts and bonds have become relatively advantageous; and, through functional diversification of financial services, the fields in which securities companies can participate will expand. On the other hand, however, liberalization will bring to the securities sector competition that differs from the past. Business strategies important to "normal industries," such as pricing and marketing, which had tended to be ignored in the past will have to be taken seriously by brokerages in the future. Also, through liberalization, securities companies will acquire the freedom to engage in various types of operations but to survive, the selection of business activities (freedom to reject) will probably become an important point. Stock Market--Little Hope of Continuous Growth During the phase of spiraling stock prices until late 1989, the increase in stock prices was not founded on expansion of the real economy; investment activities as well as fund procurement operations based on optimistic expectations for the future were noticeable in the market. Subsequently, with late 1989 as the historic peak, stock prices declined steadily until August 1992 and turned slightly upward as comprehensive economic measures were undertaken. However, the drop in corporate profits caused by the rapid yen appreciation subsequently thwarted the rise in stock prices and a long-term stalemate has emerged. From the standpoint of long-range price fluctuations, the time is judged to be favorable for a swing upward, but, reflecting stagnant real economic growth, a continuous rise as in the past is probably too much to expect. Bond Market--Increased Ratio of Local Government Bonds Because the organization and buildup as well as the deregulation of Japan's bond market started with national bonds, a market that is extremely slanted to government bonds was created. However, in recent years, because efforts were placed on the growth of the corporate bond market and also because of banks' reluctance to extend loans and the sluggishness of equity financing, the standing of the corporate bond market rose rapidly in the bond and debentures market. Through further deregulation, the issuance of ordinary corporate bonds will probably increase even more in the future. Also, as the role played by regions increases in public investments, the ratio of local government bonds is expected to increase. Activating the bond market means increasing bond circulation and, to accomplish that, it is important to organize and strengthen the market as well as revise various procedures and simultaneously enhance the marketability of bonds. As measures to revise local government bonds, the following can be considered: simplify name transfer procedures; increase the issuance lot; employ the lump sum redemption system at maturity; issue tax-exempt bonds; and issue variable interest bonds as in public offerings. As for ordinary corporate bonds, measures to energize the market are producing results, but further deregulation and strengthening of market-making operations are desirable. Derivative Market--Needs Continue To Increase As evident today, the growth of the derivative market has been impeded temporarily by stricter controls but if the highly unstable environment continues, new innovations will probably appear to circumvent the regulations and neutralize the controls. The derivative market is a market that emerged in response to the demands of the age. The conditions which made the derivative market necessary, such as the globalization of financial markets, progress of institutionalization and increased need for risk management, might continue to intensify, but they will not weaken. In addition, prerequisites to development of the derivative market, such as elevation of financial skills in risk management, computerization, etc., are in place. Nevertheless, the derivative market is not entirely free of problems. Though charges that it is the hotbed of market manipulations and illegal transactions are not founded on firm evidences, such criticisms have a certain persuasiveness and the fact that they have been circulating for a long period creates a problem. The market must be able to give the confidence to participants that "this is the arena for fair games played under specific rules." Regulatory agencies, exchanges, and independent governing bodies should establish rules based on actual conditions and supervise their enforcement. Institutional Investors--Reassessing Systematic Investments In Japan's stock market, there had been hardly any institutional investor in the traditional sense of the term. By traditional institutional investors we are referring to financial brokerages, in a broad sense, which collect funds from ultimate investors, like individuals, and invest in portfolios with the optimum risk-and-return combination suited to the investment goals. Today, the stock investment environment surrounding banks, life insurance companies, etc., is changing noticeably. Because the risks of stock investments were revealed by the bursting of the "bubble," and banks and insurance companies, which had depended on assets like Japanese stocks for most of their earnings through capital gains, are losing the income base to retain them, systematic investments prioritizing dealings with corporations are being reassessed. As a result, these investors are reemerging as institutional investors in the traditional sense. The activities of these institutional investors will probably exert a strong influence on the future stock market. Individual Investors--Possess Investment Reserve Individual investors are being eagerly awaited because of the expectation that individuals have steadily accumulated financial assets and they make investment decisions that are different from those made by institutional investors and that widens the scope and increases the efficiency of the stock market. The table compares the percentages of monetary asset accumulations and equity investments between Japanese and American individual investors. Judging by this table, it can be said that considering the monetary asset accumulations, stock investments by individual investors in Japan are at a low level. In short, there is believed to be an adequate reserve for investments. Table 1. U.S.-Japan Comparisons of Individual Monetary Assets and Stock Investments Japan United States Individual savings 1960 17.4% 5.0% rate 1970 18.2 8.2 1980 19.2 6.2 1990 14.1 7.3 Individual monetary 1960 0.82 times 1.90 times assets (versus GNP) 1970 0.98 1.96 1980 1.39 1.72 1990 2.18 2.53 Savings (versus 1960 47.2% 17.3% individual monetary assets) 1970 51.8 22.0 1980 60.6 29.9 1990 50.8 20.2 Stocks (versus 1960 11.0% 41.2% individual monetary assets) 1970 6.4 38.3 1980 2.0 26.2 1990 8.9 14.4 Note: Prior to 1980, Japanese stocks at book value. Then, how can individual investors be persuaded to participate in the stock market? As incentives, the elimination of double taxation of dividends or the introduction of the imputation system as an easing measure and the lowering of commissions for individuals or drastic reductions in minimum investment requirements, etc., can be mentioned. Corporations--Information Disclosure Encouraged Criticism is heard from various quarters about the fund procurement activities of corporations during the "bubble" period, but, from the standpoint of cost of funds, one can say that those operations had been rational. In retrospect, the responsibility for the causes of excessive investments should not be placed only on corporations but on the entire market organization which continued to hold misplaced expectations for a long time. When similar situations arise in the future, it can be fully anticipated that corporations will take identical actions (as judged, too, by the actions now being taken by U.S. corporations). A step that can be taken is to prevent faulty expectations from dominating the market for a long period. To accomplish that, it is essential to fully disclose to investors, in an easily understandable form, correct information on future corporate earnings. Future Stock Market as Seen From Quantitative Standpoint The scale of the stock market in the year 2000 was estimated using an econometric model. Estimates were made in two steps. In the first step, the six macro variables of GNP, money supply, current account balance, stock prices, long-term interest rates, and exchange rates were estimated according to the Bayes multivariate time-series analytical method. Next, in the second stage, the structural equation was projected from past data into which estimates of macro variables predicted in the first step were inserted and numerical values associated with the stock market were forecast. Relative to results of the first step, as for the nominal GNP, an average annual growth of 3.8 percent is estimated from 1992 until 2000, and for M2 + CD, which is the representative index of money supply, an average annual rise of 4.8 percent is predicted. To point out the main item among the estimated values related to the stock market in 2000, TOPIX (Tokyo Stock Price Index) will be at the level of 2,061. This is equivalent to 80 percent of the 1989 average, which was the highest level recorded. Also, stock transaction volume will amount to approximately 320 trillion yen, about the level of 1988. Bond trading will amount to approximately 7,000 trillion yen, equivalent to the 1987 level, which was the historic high. In the forecasts, dummy "bubble" variables were used, so when the "bubble" period is used as the base, there is a possibility of underestimation. Also, the effects of listing JR East Japan stock were not considered so, after it is put on the market, that aspect should be taken into consideration. Develop Acceptable Stock Price Mechanism One of the conclusions reached by this research committee is that, "in Japan's stock market, a mechanism that will enable stock prices to reflect the real economy has not been fully established." To establish prices that conform to actual conditions--for example, so that price levels will not be determined by only relative relations between land and stock prices or futures and spot prices--a market that will properly evaluate stock price levels in relation to other economic variables must be developed. As shown by the response to public offerings of JR East Japan stock, investors have considerable interest in and reserve funds to invest. There should be many investors who want to invest in stocks if they find the price mechanism acceptable. Furthermore, as pointed out earlier in the section on liberalization and transaction system changes, the securities business sphere is expanding and development of new operations is possible. On the other hand, however, the reassessment of past operations is deemed to be necessary. For example, this comment was heard recently. "In the sales of JR stock, brokerages are paying for such expenses as the distribution of applications out of their own pockets." Heretofore, dealings that might be considered coercive were being transacted to attain the quota; however, it appears that business was being conducted loosely with the attitude that nothing more needed to be done as long as the balance was in the black. Presently, what the securities circle should do is not to adopt a passive attitude of only awaiting the recovery of corporate performance, but to draw blueprints of the future stock market and translate them into actions which will make the image a reality. In that event, we hope that this report will serve as a reference.
