A. Zakharenko, plant protection division, RASKhN: ``Under Discussion in the Russian Academy''] [Text] In light of the abrupt decline in industrial production of pesticides and microbiological plant protection resources, the plant protection division of the RASKhN [Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences] raised the question ``On the Status, Prospects for Development and Organization of Low-Volume Regional Production of Microbiological Plant Protection Resources'' before the bureau and the presidium of the RASKhN. It was discussed thoroughly on 28 September and 15 October 1992 respectively. Organizing regional production of microbiological resources for Russia is important in connection with the departure of the Progress Plant (Kazakhstan), the Zaporozhye and Novgorod-Volyn (Ukraine) and Ungeny (Moldova) plants, and some scientific research institutions--the VNIIBMZR [All-Union Scientific Research Institute for the Biological Method of Plant Protection] (Moldova), and the VNIIGINTOKS [All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Hygiene and Toxins] and the Biotekhnika VNIITs [All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Ecology Center] (Ukraine)--to other sovereign states, resulting in a worsening of scientific support and deliveries of biopreparations. Given an annual demand of 35,000-40,000 tonnes, Russian agriculture receives 10,000 tonnes from biological plants and laboratories and uses biopreparations over an area 5.5-6 million ha, corrected to a single application per ha--that is, only around 5 percent of the area of plowland and perennial plantations. Under the conditions of a market economy, in the absence of proper consideration of natural and economic conditions and the health of plants on agricultural land, the monopoly on industrial production of biopreparations has been found to be insufficiently effective. Difficulties in determining marketing strategy and studying the demand for biopreparations resulted in the fact that even with extremely low production volumes, unsold biopreparations that are losing their potency have accumulated at warehouses of Russia's sole plant in Berd, and at warehouses of the Selkhozkhimiya Association. The noted shortcomings of monopolistic, large-scale industrial production could be surmounted by combining it with more-flexible regional production adapted to local conditions and producing in low volumes. The concept of such production was developed by scientists of the Russian Agricultural Academy, the Ministry of Agricultural Production, the Russian Ministry of Health and specialists of the GKNT [State Committee for Science and Technology]. The planning and establishment of low-volume production on standard equipment using standard procedures in industrial-type biological enterprises is proposed by this concept. The scientific and organizational groundwork for reaching these objective has been laid in Russia. 1. Scientific institutions working in the field of plant protection have developed new, promising preparations corresponding to or exceeding the best foreign analogues in their effectiveness, and the technical conditions of their production and use were developed on the basis of the results of research carried out within the framework of the ``Biopesticide'' project of the GNTP [State Scientific-Technical Program?] ``Agricultural Production Processes of the Future,'' and within the framework of fundamental and priority applied programs. For example jointly with other organizations the VIZR developed mikoafidin T, entoks, afidol, verticillin M and aleytsid, which are highly effective in protecting plants from aphids, the spider mite and whiteflies; alerin B and C for protection against agents of root rot, blight, fuserial head blight and powdery mildew. These preparations have no analogues in world plant protection practice. 2. Original procedures have been developed for making fungal preparations--boverin, verticillin, trichodermin and rizoplan, bacterial preparations based on Bacillus turingiensis baktorodentsid, and viral preparations. Production procedures have been introduced in biological production laboratories. In particular, trichodermin is being produced by 90 laboratories, verticillin by 35, and boverin by 5 with a production volume of up to 5 tonnes. However, the absence of equipment is reducing the quality of the procedures for producing the biopreparations. 3. Experimental industrial production of practically all known means of obtaining biopreparations (subsurface, surface-subsurface, surface) on standard equipment at pilot plants using progressive procedures is being perfected. Production of metabolite preparations is being organized at the Etoks Experimental Production Enterprise (St. Petersburg), production of the biopreparations alerin B and alerin C obtained by a subsurface procedure is being organized at the Shchelkovo Biological Works (Moscow Oblast), and production of preparations obtained by a subsurface-surface procedure is being organized at an experimental production operation of the VNIIF [All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Phytopathology] (Moscow Oblast). Production of viral and microsporidial preparations (out of parasitic protozoans) is to begin in 1993 at experimental plants of the SK NIIF [not further identified] and the VNIIF; production of preparations consisting of entomopathogenic nematodes and their symbiotic bacteria (nemobakt) is to begin at the Kolpino EPP [not further identified] (Leningrad Oblast). Pilot facilities were introduced in 1992 at the Kolpino EPP to perfect production of mikoafidin and entoks out of entomopathogenic fungi for use against aphids; of aleytsid and verticillin against the orange whitefly at the Leto PNO [not further identified] (Leningrad Oblast); of the viral preparation virin-GYaP against the coddling moth at the SK NIIF; of trichodermin in the city of Kirshi (Leningrad Oblast). Experimental industrial production of the indicated preparations at pilot facilities is the first phase of establishing standard low-volume production of microbiological plant protection resources. 4. Seventy-nine biolaboratories, 13 biofactories, 41 oblast plant protection station shops, 159 greenhouse laboratories, 56 farm and interfarm laboratories, 13 small enterprises and 10 cooperatives are functioning within the Ministry of Agricultural Production. The Russian Ministry of Agricultural Production has begun the work of providing modern equipment for low-volume production of biopreparations to biolaboratories and biofactories. In 1992 the Sochi, Voronezh, Krasnodar, Mary and Kirov biolaboratories were equipped with fermenters with capacities of up to 1 m[.sup]3[/], separators, and other equipment for the production of liquid fungal and bacterial preparations. This work would have been more effective, had there been closer contact between specialists and scientists of the Russian Ministry of Agricultural Production and the Russian Agricultural Academy, and had they carried out coordinated programs. The presidium of the Russian Agricultural Academy has determined the direction of scientific and technical support to organizing regional low-volume production of microbiological plant protection resources. Reaching scientific objectives in stages was proposed within the framework of the GNTP ``Agricultural Production Processes of the Future'' and the ``Plant Protection'' sector program of fundamental research. And namely: - conducting marketing research to substantiate the demand for microbiological resources for agriculture, and feasibility studies on low-volume production and its location; - searching for and creating promising strains of microorganisms producing microbiological plant protection resources, and developing new preparations on their basis; - developing the principles of creating all-purpose mechanized lines (units, modules) for large-scale breeding of insects; - creating genetic selection methods of selecting fungal producer strains that would work under the conditions of subsurface fermentation; - creating artificial nutrient media for entomopathogenic microorganisms; - developing the methods and principles of creating optimum preparative forms; - developing regulations on producing new microbiological resources adapted to regional production of agricultural crops; - improving and creating commercial forms of biopreparations intended for specific purposes--for seed treatment, for plant spraying and for soil application; - developing methods by which to assess the quality of microbiological resources, and unified standards in application to regional production; - planning individual, basic and standard models of regional low-volume production operations; - developing ecological and economic criteria of using microbiological preparations and regional procedures of their use. Fundamental research aimed at finding microbiological resources is to be continued in scientific research institutes of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Russian Ministry of Health, as is applied experimental design work aimed at creating microbiological preparations at the State Scientific Research Institute of Applied Microbiology. There are plans for supporting specific financing of fundamental research aimed at creating experimental industrial low-volume production operations, and for revamping the research base and developing experimental industrial facilities for low-volume production operations in the VIZR, VNIIF and SK NIIF.
