"Gypsies and Turks are not my brothers, they are killing, raping, robbing, and trying to split our fatherland," Gelemenov said in the previous installment of his TRUD interview. Our editorial board is in possession of a recorded transcript and would like to hear the opinion of the Prosecutor's Office on the matter. [Krusteva] Mr. Gelemenov, do you admit that some ethnic Bulgarians are also guilty of rape, robberies, and murders? [Gelemenov] Bulgarians who are stealing, robbing, and raping automatically belong to the category of criminals who are violating the law, public order, and discipline; hence I do not distinguish between them and other criminals. [Krusteva] Why did you choose Plovdiv for your headquarters? [Gelemenov] Because the ethnic spectrum of that city is the most colorful. Plovdiv has the largest number of Gypsies, Turks, but also Armenians and Jews, whom I have nothing against, of course. However, the triple agglomeration, namely of Bulgarians, Turks, and Gypsies, prompted me to select that city. The United Bulgarian Soldiery is expected to establish armed militant units with the cooperation of the police and the Armed Forces. Naturally my "Rebirth" Organization is aimed at establishing its own, unarmed units. I do not approve of the use of weapons, because I do not wish to get involved with the law. I rely on the mass character of the units which I am planning to establish. I would like my people to assist the police in coping with the Gypsies, so that the crime rate may be reduced to 2 or 3 percent. I expect them to cooperate in protecting law, order, and discipline. [Krusteva] It is strange that you do not comply with the Bulgarian Constitution, but are ready to cooperate with the police forces. [Gelemenov] It is because the police force is a law enforcement institution in charge of introducing public order. The constitution is a document of a certain value, but is not as effective as the penal code. The constitution is not without flaws. It contains some pompous postulates, which, we Nazis of Bulgaria, do not wish to comply with, because it bans all organizations based on ethnic principles, and so forth. The constitution does not serve our purposes, on the contrary it restricts our freedom of action. [Krusteva] Are you not afraid of conflicts involving bloodshed? How would the ethnic minorities react to a new national rebirth process? [Gelemenov] Precisely as they reacted in the 1984-85 period. They rose against the forces of law and order in Bulgaria, and were immediately crushed, of course. I do not understand why monuments should be erected in their memory today, why prayers and speeches in the Turkish language should be recited for them -- which is in contradiction with the constitution, as a matter of fact. As long as they are violating the constitution, we should be also entitled to do so. Violence is called for in the purpose of introducing law and order in the country. What they are trying to present to us as democracy is nothing but anarchy and disorder. As long as the state is unwilling to apply even methods of force against the violators of public order, I am willing to organize a bunch of decent boys who shall introduce law and order all over the country, and to become their leader. [Krusteva] Do you think that anyone would support you? [Gelemenov] What do you mean support me?! Young people are already following me everywhere, people are calling me from all parts of the country announcing their eagerness to work with me. I am expecting the 30 boys, who are currently trying to introduce law and order in the Burgas area, to call on me. I could be useful to them with funds for gasoline. [Krusteva] Do you have any political ambitions? [Gelemenov] The whole thing is actually the rudiments of a party which we intend to register after the New Year and which will be called the Nationalist Socialist Vuzrazhdane Party. I am convinced that National Socialism is the only idea capable of guaranteeing Bulgaria's progress. [Krusteva] It is a theory which was rejected and condemned by the whole world, Mr. Gelemenov. [Gelemenov] This does not frighten me. If we should accept that history is developing in the form of a spiral, I am convinced that the idea of national socialism is being revived. I am not the first one to adopt it for the sake of helping my country. The idea is not dead, it is acquiring new roots. This is precisely the right moment for its development in Bulgaria. [Krusteva] I understood that you felt insulted by being called the "Bulgarian Zhirinovskiy." Why? [Gelemenov] Prior to Zhirinovskiy's arrival in our country, I was willing to meet him, in a way. However, as soon as he stepped onto Bulgarian soil, he started talking such nonsense, that I immediately unmasked him as the great Russian clown who came here to spread unrest and provoke internal conflicts. Speaking about the annexation of Mizia, Thracia, and Macedonia to Bulgaria, he forgot to mention Dobrudzha. The idea of annexation is good, but it should be promoted through diplomatic channels. I am convinced that Zhirinovskiy is a paid "agent provocateur" who was sent on a performing tour. He is a CIA agent [as published] and his purpose is to provoke bloodshed and armed clashes in the Balkan peninsula. I insist that Mr. Tatarchev, the chief prosecutor, should immediately expel Zhirinovskiy from Bulgaria, that he should be fined at the border, and should no longer be permitted to step on our territory. [Krusteva] Like yourself, Zhirinovskiy does not like the president. Why did you declare Dr. Zhelev as an accomplice of crimes committed in our country? [Gelemenov] With the moratorium on capital punishment which he issued, he acted as an accomplice of bloody murders, chiefly committed against Bulgarians, because the criminals are no longer afraid. I approve Zhirinovskiy's idea that the president should be replaced, but this is none of his business. It is an internal Bulgarian affair. [Krusteva] However, you are expecting some financial support from Russia for your "United Bulgarian Soldiery." Whom exactly, are you relying upon? [Gelemenov] I am expecting financial aid from the organization called "Russian National Unity" and from the Slavonic Assembly. Being the cofounder of a bank in Russia with capital investments amounting to 10 million rubles, this is where I am expecting the resources to come from, but it will not be today or tomorrow. It is an organization headed by Aleksandr Barkashov, whose whereabouts are unknown today, and who was actually backed by Rutskoy. Considering that Rutskoy was prevented from running for the elections, the roving mountebank Zhirinovskiy exploited his votes. According to my own information, seven of my boys, I mean our boys, were killed in the attack against Ostankino. This was actually Yeltsin's fault. [Krusteva] Has anybody told you that you are mad? [Gelemenov] Everyone is more or less mad, because no criteria exist for a normal state of mind. I do not consider myself mad, because I would not have obtained a certificate of mental sanity when I got married. I now intend to purchase a license to carry firearms, hence I can hardly be considered mad. I think that I am a normal Bulgarian citizen who is planning to lead the country into the open space. Bulgaria's situation could be improved on the basis of a simple political scheme -- without a parliament and without a government. A council of ministers, subordinate to a strong personality, would be competent enough to rule the country. [Krusteva] You are talking about a strong hand, one-man power, and so forth, is that so? [Gelemenov] A very strong hand, an iron-strong hand, is required, as a matter of fact. The Bulgarian people, just like the Russian people, are used to it. [Krusteva] What do you think about Adolf Hitler? [Gelemenov] He was the man who helped the Germans to regain their self-confidence, who showed the common German citizen that he is the master of this earth. He fully eradicated crime, he did away with unemployment. His mistake was to wage a war against Poland and Russia. He was a brilliant politician, but an evil man. Nevertheless, his economic methods and those of his supporters could be successfully applied in contemporary Bulgaria. We could also work hard if someone would guide us and show us how to do it.
