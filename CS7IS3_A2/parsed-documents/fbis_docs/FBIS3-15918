Speaking at a news conference in Moscow on Thursday, Ukolov said that the court, as a body which applies the law, could not disobey the decision of the Russian Parliament on amnesty. Asked about how the decision on amnesty was applied to former Soviet Vice-President Gennadiy Yanayev whose case was considered separately and Aleksandr Tizyakov, a large industrialist, whose case was suspended, Ukolov said that the military board of the Russian Supreme Court adopted a decision to amnesty them on March 2, the next day after the original decision on amnesty was passed.
