FBIS4-29820 "dreas120_m_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-120 Daily Report 22 Jun 1994 Thailand Government Urged To End Controversy Government Urged To End Controversy BK2106121694 BK2106121694 BFN [Editorial Report] Two Bangkok dailies, NAEO NA and THAI RAT, carry editorials discussing the current political crisis initiated by Chalat Worachat's hunger strike and worsened by rallies in support of Chalat's demands, a motion proposed by Phalang Tham MP's seeking to draft a new Constitution, and the controversy over the role of the Phalang Tham Party as a partner in the coalition government. NAEO NA of 21 June carries on page 3 a 600-word editorial entitled: "The Government Should Make it Clear." It asks the government to make uncertainties clear by telling the people what it is going to do -- resign, dissolve the House of Representatives, reshuffle the cabinet, or pursue the administration without making any changes. The editorial says "The government should make clear to the public what the option is and provide reasons instead of leaving the people guessing." If it does not want to resign, dissolve the House, or reshuffle the cabinet the government must arrange for a discussion among the coalition parties in order to determine the Phalang Tham Party's role. "If the majority wants the Phalang Tham Party to be left out, the government must then expel the party from the coalition as soon as possible in order to end the ongoing confusion. But if the government believes the Phalang Tham ministers are capable and cannot afford to lose them, the government should be bold enough to inform everyone. The current political confusion will never end unless the government acts decisively," the editorial says. THAI RAT of 21 June carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled: "Let the Parliament Settle the Controversy." It states that activists backing Chalat's cause are entitled, under democratic freedom, to pursue the struggle to support the motion of the Phalang Tham MP's. There are others, however, who think differently. "In a democratic society, conflicts of opinion should be settled through compromise. It is impossible for a certain group to win without giving concessions. In the present situation, we think there are still several options available. Regarding the Constitution, the parliament has already set up a special committee to scrutinize proposed amendments. The committee is doing its duty now; MP's can propose whatever amendments they deem appropriate," the paper says. Besides, the president of the parliament has formed a democracy development team comprising representatives of the people from all walks of life to plan a more democratic Constitution. This committee should be able to work with the parliamentary committee. Meanwhile, the motion of 21 Phalang Tham Party MP's could be tabled on the parliament agenda for debate. "This is the best way to achieve a compromise to solve the problem. The parliament is thus given the role of ruling on the Phalang Tham motion. Its ruling should be final," the paper says.
