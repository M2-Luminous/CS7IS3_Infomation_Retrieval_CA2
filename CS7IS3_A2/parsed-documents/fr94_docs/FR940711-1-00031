FR940711-1-00031 FR940711-1-00003 20. The Commission solicits comments on the two proposed alternatives regarding retail stranded costs. The first proposed alternative provides that if in a specific circumstance an appropriate State authority explicitly considers and deals with retail stranded costs and there is no conflict within or among State regulatory bodies regarding a State's disposition of the issue, this Commission will not entertain a request for retail stranded cost recovery. However, in the absence of a clear expression by an appropriate State authority that it has dealt with the issue, or in the event of a conflict between States or among State officials within a single State, the Commission proposes to entertain requests to recover retail stranded costs. Is this proposal reasonable? Is it preferable to the second alternative proposal? 21. Should there be limited exceptions to the second alternative rule? 22. As to both alternatives, the Commission further solicits comments on the following questions. Are there circumstances under which it is not necessarily appropriate to defer to the States ( e.g., where one State takes an action regarding retail stranded costs which has adverse consequences for another State)? Are there circumstances under which a State may not have an adequate mechanism for addressing retail stranded costs, and may want the Commission to provide a forum? If a State does not explicitly address stranded costs resulting from an action that allows retail customers to purchase from a supplier other than the franchised utility, should this Commission entertain requests from the utilities left with the stranded costs? Beyond silence from the State, are there other factors that the Commission should consider before accepting requests for retail stranded cost recovery? Specifically, would financial health and possible adverse impacts on reliability be sufficient reason for Federal action? The Commission further solicits comments on the following questions: (1) Does the Commission have legal authority to allow retail stranded costs in rates for wholesale transmission services? Should the Commission do so as a matter of policy? If so, which costs? (2) Does the Commission have legal authority to allow retail stranded costs in rates for retail transmission service? Should the Commission do so as a matter of policy? If so, which costs? (3) Does FPA section 212 give the Commission legal authority to allow recovery of retail stranded costs in rates for wholesale transmission services under FPA section 211? (4) Are there legal or policy reasons why in Scenario 2, the Commission should entertain requests for recovery of retail stranded costs in wholesale transmission rates, but should not entertain requests for recovery of retail stranded costs in retail transmission rates in Scenario 3? 23. Are the Commission's assumptions concerning the reasonable expectations of utilities with respect to retail customers correct, i.e., is the reasonable expectation test inapplicable to retail stranded costs? Are there situations, for instance, in which utilities could have expected municipalization to occur based on an established course of dealing? 24. The Commission requests comments on how to determine retail stranded costs as a general matter. Is there a future time when a retail customer's action of leaving a local franchise no longer has any adverse economic consequences on the franchise utility? If so, what is an appropriate way to make such a determination? [FR Doc. 94&hyph;16626 Filed 7&hyph;8&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;P
