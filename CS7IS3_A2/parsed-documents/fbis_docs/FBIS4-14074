Are you still insisting on not participating in the talks? [Buwayz] Not only are we still insisting but we are also more convinced than ever before that it was premature to embark on multilateral negotiations before the bilateral negotiations made tangible, essential, and decisive progress. We are insisting that participation in them is a mistake. Lebanon was the first country that warned against joining the multilateral talks. I remember that I made this warning when I chaired the Arab League Council meeting in Cairo in 1990 before the Madrid conference. I said then that we are reading in the press and hearing from some sources that multilateral talks are being proposed on the issues of water, armaments, the environment, transportation, communications, etc. I also said: While firmly convinced that these are essential issues, that we cannot be forgiven if we ignore them, that these issues have to be discussed when peace comes, and that an agreement must be reached on them because they are common problems, we cannot embark on discussing these issues if they are proposed to us--and at that time they were not officially proposed--before we are certain that peace is coming and on the details of this peace. Why? First, because I regarded the multilateral talks as complementary to peace and to the peace decision. How can we complement a decision that has not been made yet? Second, I said that these multilateral talks are like someone who tries to furnish a house before it is built or the shape is known. How can we choose the furniture for a house that has not been built? This is why I say that the multilateral talks involve complementary issues that presuppose the existence of peace. We must be certain that the peace decision has become inevitable and that its aspects and shape have become clear before we enter into multilateral talks. We have no reservations about the issues being discussed at the multilateral talks but about the mechanism. We even welcome international participation in them. But we have reservations about their timing. We say it openly--and time has proved that we are right--that the multilateral talks have not made progress because the bilateral ones have not made progress. Those who have been tempted to take part in these talks admitted to us later that they were tempted by the promises made from outside the multilateral talks framework. Some Arab countries have admitted to me later that they joined the multilateral talks not out of conviction but on the basis of foreign promises to improve their relations with a certain country. Where have the multilateral talks gone now? The question is how could the negotiator sitting at the multilateral talks table make progress when he knows that the principal negotiator involved in the bilateral talks is stalled? [AL-SAFIR] It appears that the dead end is a dual one? [Buwayz] In addition to what I have already said, the most important consideration for us is that the multilateral talks must be in the interest of everyone in the region. For Israel it is of an additional interest. How can we pay a price to Israel when the latter has not yet agreed to implement the Madrid agreement principles and the international resolutions that were supposedly used by the Madrid conference as a basis for shaping the implementation mechanism? [AL-SAFIR] Israel alone is not responsible for the dead end in the talks but is jointly responsible for it with the United States, which is managing the negotiating process? [Buwayz] Like in criminal law where there is a positive and a negative responsibility, I believe that Israel is responsible for not abiding by the Madrid agreement and for not seeking to implement the Madrid decisions. It is prevaricating on implementing what was decided on in that conference. It tried to prevaricate when it sought to gain six additional months during the U.S. elections and when it procrastinated with all the Arab countries as it was working to push the Palestinian negotiator into certain positions while refusing to make progress on the other tracks. Between the policy of isolating the other parties, the policy of the Israeli Governments' internal weakness, and the policy of wagering on the change in U.S. Administrations, Israel has squandered much of the years since the peace process started. I say that this is a positive responsibility, that is, it practiced this responsibility intentionally and negatively. That was a positive responsibility done to serve a negative objective. Regarding U.S. responsibility as cosponsor of the conference, we did not enter the peace process believing Israel really wanted peace and would quickly embrace it. We did not enter an ambiguous peace process either; we entered a process with well-defined features, goals, mechanisms, and roles. The goals were clear and frank. They were represented by the principle of land for peace, the principle of the implementation of UN resolutions, and the principle of the restoration of lands and the Palestinian people's political rights. A major reason for our participation in the conference was our belief that the U.S. role would be an influential one. We believed that Israel on its own would not move toward peace. We took into consideration the U.S. and Soviet assurances. The Soviet Union still existed then. We particularly depended on the U.S. assurances, believing that the U.S. commitment to this conference would result in pressure being applied on Israel to move in the required direction. I cannot say that the successive U.S. Administrations have fully played this role. I cannot say that the United States has played this role from the beginning, that is, the role of an honest broker or a driving force. I believe that the United States has so far sufficed itself with playing a role of a logistical nature or that of a technical broker. It has not undertaken dynamic and strong mediation as envisaged in the peace process. Hence, its responsibility is negative, the responsibility of someone who has not fulfilled his obligations. [AL-SAFIR] Israel claims that the Lebanese delegation is not negotiating with it. At the same time, Rabin stresses that there is no full withdrawal from the Golan in return for a full peace. How can this vicious circle be broken? [Buwayz] This question consists of two parts. Regarding the negotiations with the Lebanese delegation, what do they want the Lebanese delegation to negotiate? There are certain Lebanese principles. Lebanon clearly says that Israel must implement Resolution 425, which calls for Israel's withdrawal to the internationally recognized border, and for the Lebanese state to establish its authority. In return, Lebanon pledges to assume its responsibility as a state and to ensure that security and stability prevails in the area that the state will receive. We tell the Israelis that this resolution is independent of the Middle East conflict. Let them accept the principle of its implementation and we will then be ready to form a joint military commission that will adopt the executive steps, programs, and timetables. Afterwards, in solidarity with the other Arab states, we will move forward with the peace talks until a comprehensive and final peace is achieved. We have proposed progress in two phases. The first phase is purely Lebanese and is through the implementation of Resolution 425. The second phase is on the regional level. What did Israel do? It linked the Lebanese dossier with the other dossiers, especially the Syrian dossier. First, as a precondition Israel demanded that the Lebanese state control the resistance when it knew that this was impossible. Israel knows that the resistance is the result and not the cause of the occupation. The result cannot disappear as long as the cause remains. Israel knows that the Lebanese Government cannot drop the principle of resistance as long as it does not have definite assurances that its territory will be restored. Therefore, Israel is imposing impossible conditions while we have pledged to establish peace and security when Israel withdraws from the south. Second, Israel links its withdrawal to the signing of a comprehensive peace treaty under which all Arab rights are supposed to be restored. Hence, it is Israel that is linking the problem of the south with the regional problem. This is not the first time it has done this. In the 17 May [1983] agreement, which was signed after one and a half years of talks, Israel linked the outcome of the talks with Syria's commitment to the security of the south. Therefore, if Israel is accusing us of linking our dossier to Syria's dossier, it is doing that itself. If it is accusing us of linking it to the regional problem, it is also doing that itself. [AL-SAFIR] In the beginning you stated that Israel is seeking to deal unilaterally with the Arab states. Now you are saying that it is linking the Lebanese dossier with the Syrian dossier. [Buwayz] In the Lebanese dossier, instead of accepting the spirit of Resolution 425 and acknowledging the need for the implementation of this resolution in return for security and stability and then moving on to the regional level, Israel is linking this subject with the regional topic. One of Israel's conditions for withdrawal is the signing of a comprehensive peace agreement. [AL-SAFIR] The Madrid conference was launched on the basis of land for peace. The Lebanese translation of the conference is the implementation of Resolution 425 in return for what? [Buwayz] Well, we have told Israel to please declare its readiness for complete withdrawal. This would justify forming a military committee, which would work out a timetable for a withdrawal and then we could proceed together toward a comprehensive peace. However, Israel is proposing forming a military committee with an as yet unidentified purpose. We have asked Israel about the purpose of a military committee. If the purpose is to maintain the prevailing truce, then we say that there is a truce committee, so why this new committee? If the goal is to maintain the current situation, we say that there are UN forces doing that. Let us do their job. However, if the purpose is really to reach a full withdrawal from south Lebanon, then let Israel declare this and there would be justification for forming a military committee. [AL-SAFIR] We are currently in a dormant stage that may last for a long time. Can Lebanon tolerate such a situation? [Buwayz] For us to say whether this situation will continue or not we have to pinpoint responsibility for it. It was very obvious in the latest round of talks, the 12th round, that Israel deliberately refused to make any progress for three reasons: 1. It wanted to frustrate all results of the Geneva summit between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton to negate any possibility of an Arab-U.S. agreement that might be imposed on it and to show that nothing positive can be done without taking the Israeli factor into account. 2. It believed that it could not make progress on a track as long as the Palestinian track had not run its course, so Israel deliberately prevaricated to foil this round in the hopes of reaching certain agreements with the Palestinians. 3. It used the pretext that the government's internal situation at the time did not allow it to make certain decisions and that it had to secure certain domestic alliances before making new decisions. Israel used these three reasons directly or tacitly to prevent any progress. So, who is responsible for the stagnation in the negotiations? [AL-SAFIR] There is no doubt that Israel is responsible, but the Arab party has no other option than negotiations. [Buwayz] I would not say that the Arab side has no other options, but that the Arab side is trying to give the peace process every chance. I would also like to maintain that the Arab side refuses to bear the responsibility for the failure of the peace process, should it fail. Therefore, despite the difficult negotiations and Israeli stalling, the Arab side wants to ensure all chances for these negotiations to succeed. Should the negotiations fail, the Arab side does not want to look negative before the world. If a party does not mind looking negative and bearing the moral and political responsibility for the peace process, let it be Israel. [passage omitted] [AL-SAFIR] One of the issues that shows the extent of Arab solidarity is that of the Palestinian refugees in the Arab countries, which is being discussed at the multilateral talks. For example, Jordan, which you said will not sign, said that it will resort to international law and not Resolution 194, which provides for the return of refugees to their land. What about the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon and how will you deal with this issue? [Buwayz] When Jordan chooses a certain legal or any other framework to deal with the Palestinian refugee problem, it means the problem of Palestinians on its territory and not elsewhere. Regarding Lebanon, we believe that there can be no possible solution to the Palestinian refugee problem in the context of the multilateral negotiations outside the bilateral talks. Regarding the Palestinian presence in Lebanon, we are proceeding from the points outlined in our Constitution: We reject settling the Palestinians in Lebanon in any way, and all Lebanese concur on this issue. We believe that there is no one radical solution to the Palestinian refugee problem. Anyone who believes that there is one prompt solution is mistaken. I believe that solving this problem must follow four lines: First, recognizing the right to return and consolidating the UN resolution on the right to return. What do I mean by the right to return? Of course, Israel will not agree to the Palestinians returning to the territories that will remain under its authority. But what about Israel's stance on the return of Palestinians to the territories that will be regained--Gaza and Jericho--and to more areas that may be regained later? The right to return to the Palestinian territories that will be under Palestinian authority in the future must be entrenched, particularly those Palestinians who have connections there such as material, property, or relatives. I believe that if we work seriously to emphasize this principle, some 20 percent of Palestinian citizens in Lebanon could be assimilated there. Second is the principle of the family reunion return. The world has the humanitarian responsibility to allow those who have family members anywhere in the world--whether it is Egypt, Syria, Jordan, the Gulf, Palestine, Canada, or the United States--to join their families, that is, family reunion by having the minority join the majority. If we can shape this idea and adopt it, it can solve 25 percent of the problems of the Palestinians in Lebanon. Third, I believe that there are countries with many immigrants. There are countries that are large and rich but suffer from the weakness of their human resources and low populations. These countries have let in a number of expatriates. They include Australia, Canada, and possibly the United States. I believe that these countries that continue to accept a large number of immigrants should give priority to the Palestinians who want to settle in them. And last, I believe that the Middle East region is also a very extensive area. Some of its areas have huge resources and need manpower and certain human resources. I also believe that some of these countries have the moral, political, and ethnic responsibility of tackling even the problem of the Palestinian refugees. How can we continue to import Asian laborers when we have Palestinians who cannot enter and work in these countries? Hence, I believe that if we deal seriously with these four solutions, they can solve a major and radical part of Lebanon's problem with the Palestinian presence. While this presence might be normal, acceptable, and "easily digested" in other countries of immense size and huge population and where the absorption of 400,000 or 500,000 Palestinians will not affect them, this presence in Lebanon will have deep and fundamental consequences. First, Lebanon's geographic size is very small compared to its population. Second, the Lebanese area that can be inhabited or is fit for investment--if we take away the high mountains and deep valleys-- remains very small. Third, everyone knows that the Lebanese structure is a very complicated one and any imbalance in it will have political social, economic, and security consequences. Fourth, we believe that the conditions of the Palestinians in the refugee camps in Lebanon radically differs from those in a number of countries where they have settled down, are working, and are enjoying health care and education. It is impossible to ask Lebanon at present, when it has emerged from war and is incapable of satisfying the social needs of the Lebanese, to take care of the Palestinians' needs, too. [AL-SAFIR] But the state has banned the rebuilding of the camps from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency funds and not from Lebanon's funds. What exactly is going on? What is being planned for the camps? [Buwayz] If this were allowed, you would have said that resettlement is already taking place. What is required here to keep the Palestinian issue alive and keep it the responsibility of everyone or to absorb and resolve it here in Lebanon? I believe it is impossible to reconcile these two notions. If you want to allow the Palestinians to build wherever they want and if you want them to be included in social security and to enjoy all the rights of Lebanese citizens, then I believe that you are moving, intentionally or unintentionally, toward bringing resettlement about. [AL-SAFIR] Mr. Minister, it is clear that Israel will not allow the Palestinians back and is raising the issue of the Jews in Arab countries. [Buwayz] I don't think that the problem lies with Israel only. I don't believe that there are Palestinians who want to live in the State of Israel. This issue is not under discussion in the first place. We are talking about the Palestinians' return to the territories that will be retrieved and placed under Palestinian authority. [AL-SAFIR] Your words imply that Lebanon does not want to keep the Palestinians already here and will work to reduce their numbers because, as you just said, it cannot tolerate such a number. [Buwayz] I am not saying that Lebanon cannot tolerate that number now because this implies that it could tolerate that in the past. I am saying that Lebanon has never tolerated such a number and cannot tolerate it. We do not accept or allow a solution to the Palestinian problem to be made at the expense of creating a Lebanese problem. We also do not want or accept the exchange of the Palestinian identity for another one, including a Lebanese identity. [AL-SAFIR] But Lebanon has shouldered responsibility for some of the Palestinians and must continue to do so at least temporarily. [Buwayz] Lebanon and other Arab countries have temporarily received a number of Palestinians until solutions are found. The solutions have not been forthcoming. Does this mean that Lebanon must shoulder the responsibility alone for these Palestinians? This is an international responsibility resulting from the creation of Israel at the expense of the Palestinians, and an Arab responsibility from the perspective of blood and brotherly ties. Accordingly, this subject concerns the host states. [AL-SAFIR] In any case, we retain our viewpoint regarding what you are saying. [Buwayz] What is the problem? [AL-SAFIR] Matters might not be explained only on the basis of the options you have spoken about. There is a problem. [Buwayz] You have convinced me that there is a problem. Has anybody said there is no problem? If this problem did not exist, you would not have asked me all these questions. I agree with you that there is a problem. You have asked me how it can be solved. I have given you the realistic and possible solutions for this problem. [AL-SAFIR] Are the ideas that you have aired personal or part of arrangements being prepared for the region? [Buwayz] They are a kind of evaluation of the approaches that we can adopt. We have discussed this topic with international and other quarters. These quarters are now discussing this topic. [AL-SAFIR] Do these ideas apply to Syria, Jordan, and Egypt? [Buwayz] No, this solution applies to Lebanon. Perhaps the Palestinians in Egypt are not facing a problem. Egypt, with a population of 60 million, might not have a problem in assimilating 500,000 Palestinians. Syria does not have a problem with large refugee camps. The Palestinians in Syria benefit from free medicine and education. They enjoy almost all rights, except political rights. I have explained Lebanon's special character. It is a small country with a sensitive social structure. [AL-SAFIR] If the Palestinians refuse to leave Lebanon, will they be forced to leave? [Buwayz] The Palestinians have so far proved their adherence to their identity. I believe a large number of Palestinians want either to return to Palestine or to go to another country where the conditions for living and working are better. I believe the opening of these options does not conflict with the Palestinian people's rights to return, to family reunions, or to choose the country in which they want to live. [AL-SAFIR] Is there a possibility of discussing other options for the Palestinians in Lebanon that will provide better conditions for them? [Buwayz] Under no circumstances will Lebanon accept the naturalization of the Palestinians. [AL-SAFIR] We did not mean naturalization. [Buwayz] Lebanon may accept gradual solutions. The residence of some Palestinians might be organized in accordance with solutions that will require some time. However, there is a firm national principle. Lebanon cannot assimilate the Palestinians and melt them into the Lebanese identity.
