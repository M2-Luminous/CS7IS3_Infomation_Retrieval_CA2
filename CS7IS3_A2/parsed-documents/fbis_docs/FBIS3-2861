Ruan, who is here attending the annual session of the National People's Congress, said that the Hainan Provincial authorities have asked local government leaders to devote more efforts and time to improving their duties of managing social affairs, in a bid to promote the creation of a market economy. The island province of Hainan is also China's largest special economic zone, where special and flexible policies are being pursued to encourage investors from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and overseas. "Under the conditions of a market economy, manufacturers should be able to decide on their production according to market demand," the governor said. Therefore, government departments must always follow this basic law of the market economy and should never interfere in normal commodity production and exchanges, he noted. "We have taken a series of major measures to reduce government interference since the beginning of last year," he said. For example, all check posts on roads in Hainan were removed last year, thus facilitating the free movement of commodities provincewide. Moreover, all government-assigned tax supervisors in enterprises were recalled in 1993. According to Ruan Chongwu, the government is duty-bound to create a fine environment for the effective operation of commodity markets, labor markets and production factor markets. "Of course, market forces are not all-powerful," he said, "so the government must exercise necessary intervention in economic affairs." The government must perform its duty of arousing the initiative of all sectors of society, and must coordinate and balance the interests among various sectors so as to protect the interests of society, he said. Under a market economy, he said, the government must undertake major projects that are beneficial to the whole society but have low economic returns. These include water conservancy facilities, schools, hospitals and environmental protection facilities. Furthermore, the government is duty-bound to effectively manage unrenewable resources, particularly land. It must also exercise macro-economic controls by drawing up construction plans, releasing information and formulating industrial, fiscal and financial policies, he said.
