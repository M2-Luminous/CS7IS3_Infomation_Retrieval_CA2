Local officials said that the relations have promoted the province's opening to the outside world. Last year, Sichuan Province received 85 delegations with 1,200 people from its sister cities and sent 45 visiting groups to the cities abroad. Sichuan and its sister cities jointly held 11 trade fairs or cultural exhibitions and concluded 65 economic and trade projects with cooperation funds of 70 million U.S. dollars. Last September, North Rhine-Westphalia State of Germany sent a business group with more than 40 entrepreneurs to visit Sichuan Province and investigate its investment environment. The group made inspections in the sectors of environmental protection, energy, mining, machinery and metallurgical and light industries. Since Sichuan and North Rhine-Westphalia formed friendly relations, more than 60 students have gone to study in the state, majoring in agriculture, industry, environmental protection, tourism and finance. Of the groups from Sichuan's sister cities and states in foreign countries, the group from Hiroshima, Japan, was the largest. In 1992, the Diet of Hiroshima started a "Green Program" to support Sichuan's afforestation. By the end of 1993, donations from the program amounted to more than 100 million yen (about 7.5 million yuan). Chongqing City in the province resumed its sister-city relations with Toronto in Canada, and now the two cities have signed nine agreements involving urban construction, communications and transportation, entertainment facilities, light industry and education. Chengdu City, capital of Sichuan Province, has sent 258 students to study at her sister city in Japan and now 120 have returned to Chengdu to make remarkable contributions.
