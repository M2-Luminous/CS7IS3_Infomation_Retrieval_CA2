Reception is fair to poor. The studio announcer introduces the block of fighting reports with a warning to the citizens of Sarajevo "to observe strictly all the measures in line with the general alarm, as the chetniks have been shelling the city heavily since early morning." Reporting from Olovo, Velid Djindo says that "last night was marked by loud explosions of shells fired from the heavy artillery of the [Serbs and Croatian Defense Council -- HVO] occupying forces. Olovo was fiercely shelled just after midnight, but fortunately that attack as well as the bestial ones this morning passed without human casualties." The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 3d Corps reports that "following the report by Croatia Radio Television about the fighters of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army having massacred 74 civilians in Krizancevo Selo, the members of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] British Battalion yesterday visited this area. In front of the BBC and Reuter cameras, everyone could see that the graves contained bodies, not massacred, of the HVO fighters killed in the latest Ustasha offensive on the Vitez front." In his report from Brcko, Hamiz Deronjic says that "it was a very dramatic night. The Serb aggressor shelled the defense positions heavily, also activated his sabotage groups, and used his aircraft intensively for the transportation of men and equipment. At about 2100 last night, an enemy reconnaissance-sabotage group tried to break through our lines in Lipovac. The defenders responded quickly, however, and forced the enemy saboteurs to pull back. This was followed by barrages of 82-mm and 120-mm mortars fired from enemy positions." He says that "last night was one of the busiest ones along the air corridor. In groups of two and three the enemy transport helicopters kept flying back and forth from (Razljevo) to Pelagicevo between 1800 and 2200. At about 2200 one enemy aircraft turned from the usual Bijeljina-Brcko-Pelagicevo direction and flew from Lopari to Srebrenik. According to further information, the aggressor's helicopter then headed toward Maglaj." Describing the situation in Maglaj, Hajrudin Sermic says that "yesterday evening was extremely hard for the citizens of the town. Maglaj was exposed to pounding by the heaviest artillery and tanks, while the drunk chetniks helped along by [HVO commander] Lozancic's fighters fired dum-dum and incendiary ammunition from antiaircraft machine guns and guns." He says that "last night the chetniks again made fools of the Security Council and NATO. One of the aggressor's helicopters infiltrated the group of transport planes airdropping aid to the population and carried out its combat mission unhindered." Izudin Durakovic reports from the Gracanica front that "all night the chetnik forces fired at the defense lines and residential areas in the zone of responsibility of the Gracanica Operative Group. On the Doboj front, the chetniks from Lipac and Radici used 82-mm and 120-mm mortars against (Sanicvisi) and Klopotnica, while from (Prenja) they fired with a 155-mm howitzer at Velika Brijesnica." He says that "since 0400 this morning the chetniks have been pounding the defense lines on the Gracanica front." During the night, he adds, "the aggressor carried out an intensive regrouping of his forces. Three truckloads of men arrived in (Palezica) from Doboj and another four in Stipovac. Their helicopters were also flying along the Bosansko Petrovo Selo-(Kagmus)-(Boljenic) route, and along the (Hrtova)-Rosulje-Vijenac route."
