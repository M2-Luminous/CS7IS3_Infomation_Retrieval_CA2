During the meeting, Dr. al-Iryani spoke about the situation in our country and its developments. He said: We are eager to meet with members of the diplomatic corps in Sanaa to brief them on the Republic of Yemen's stand toward previous cease-fire appeals and the subsequent move at the UN Security Council. I believe that parties to any war anywhere in the world appeal for cease-fires. There is nothing strange in that. What is peculiar in Yemen's case is that such cease-fire appeals do not offer an adequate solution to the other party. In other words, everyone says: Stop fighting, but they do not give any guarantees to prevent the resumption of fighting. The farthest such appeals could go was to say: Stop fighting and resume dialogue. Our colleagues in the diplomatic corps in Sanaa are familiar with the nine-month crisis. During that period, we did not stop dialogue. Yet, appeals say: Stop fighting and resume dialogue. If any guarantees are made at all, what about the aftermath of the cease-fire? Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani said: You all remember that a few days after the beginning of clashes, an Arab League delegation came and met with the brother chairman. The brother chairman told them: If you obtain guarantees from the other side that they will not harm unity, legitimacy, and the unity of the Armed Forces, we will halt fighting. When it left Sanaa, the delegation was supposed to hold contacts with the other side to secure those guarantees. However, no sooner had the delegation arrived in Cairo than the mass media began to say that Sanaa rejected a cease-fire. Moreover, the Arab League delegation that visited Sanaa has so far said nothing about what the other side said about the required guarantees for cease-fire or for halting fighting in such a manner that maintains unity and constitutional legitimacy, or whether they have made any guarantees for ensuring the results of the April elections. Those were the conditions that were conveyed to the Arab League. Dr. al-Iryani said: During my recent visit to Saudi Arabia, I met with the custodian of the two holy mosques. We requested good offices within the framework of the same conditions that were conveyed to whoever appealed for a cease-fire. At the end of our discussions, I felt that there was readiness to exert all possible efforts. The custodian of the two holy mosques proposed a temporary cease-fire on the occasion of the blessed 'Id al-Adha. I carried the proposal to Sanaa. After elaborate discussions, a three-day cease-fire on the occasion of 'Id al-Adha was approved. That was the most visible evidence that when Sanaa is asked to cease fire for a logical reason, this only leads to a bigger problem than the fighting itself. Sanaa responded to that request. Addressing the heads of diplomatic corps, brother Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani continued: You all are aware that days--or rather hours--after that, al-Bid declared secession. He foiled that attempt, which could have served as a 72-hour chance for good offices to secure the guarantees that we had demanded and to make sure that the cease-fire would hold. Therefore, the first to abort any serious cease-fire attempt were the secessionists, for they do not want to cease fire. The brother minister of planning and development added: What is new about this crisis is that it has become of topic of interest to amateurs in international law. Some say: No unity is imposed by force. I ask: How was the Yemeni unity achieved? Did it take place four years ago through mutual consent or by force? Two days ago, al-Bid acknowledged that the unity took place through mutual consent. Now it is said that we are going to impose unity by force. Such are the views of international law amateurs. I remind you that we fought in 1972 to impose unity by force. Then, it was the right of every state to object to imposing unity by force. In 1973, the north wanted to impose unity on the south. In the 1979 war, it was the opposite; the south wanted to impose unity by force on the north. Then, every state had the right to oppose imposing unity by force. But unity now has been achieved and approved by the Yemeni people. The Constitution of the new state has been approved through a referendum. Legislative elections were held and the world testified to their fairness. Yet, we are asked not to impose unity by force. By all standards, this calls for amazement. To say that Sanaa wants to impose unity by force calls for amazement. The demand for new unity formulas is a foreign rather than a Yemeni demand. The secessionists themselves have declared secession. So, why the talk about a new unity formula? They demand a new unity formula, while the secessionists have already declared secession. He added: Suddenly, the Security Council moved. I would like to affirm that the republic respects international organizations and their charters and abides by all legitimate resolutions. I believe that even at the peak of crises, we did not hesitate to comply with pertinent resolutions although we had reservations about them. I said that we had asked the Arab League to provide guarantees to us complying with legitimacy, the existence of the Republic of Yemen, international law, and rules pursued in any unified state in the world. However, the Arab League disappeared completely. We heard nothing from them, until the issue appeared at the Security Council. Our objection to raising this issue at the Security Council proceeds from the Paragraph Seven of Article Two of the UN Charter, which says that nothing in this charter justifies UN intervention in any state's domestic affairs. The UN Security Council's move, as we heard, proceeds from Article 34, which says: The Security Council is entitled to identify any conflict or any position which might lead to international altercation or dispute. This is in order to decide whether the continuation of this dispute or position may jeopardize international peace and security. Thus, the Security Council has the right to identify, but not to debate and decide. It must determine whether what is going on in Yemen is a source of threat to international peace and security. However, we are amazed to hear that what is being proposed is a draft resolution regarding which even Yemen has not been consulted or advised.
