These inhomogeneities occur in the stream beyond a specific nozzle. The degree of curvature of the two-dimensional edge as radiation passes through the medium determines optical quality. This paper studies the optical quality of the stream beyond flat nozzles typically used in gas dynamic lasers and cellular nozzles used in chemical and gas dynamic lasers. Phase distortions occur in both regular and turbulent structures. The stream in the resonator cavity was sampled with a small diameter beam. The focal point method was used to study the effect of stream features beyond flat and cellular nozzles on the optical quality of the medium. Light scattering occurs in turbulent wakes. Phase changes in the light beam are due to the structure and size of the wakes. Flat nozzles provide no advantage over cellular nozzles for resonators with a stream of around 80 m or greater.
