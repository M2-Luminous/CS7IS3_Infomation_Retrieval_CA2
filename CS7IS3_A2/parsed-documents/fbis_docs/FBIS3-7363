The poem of the song was written by Ni In-mo, the incarnation of faith and will. It represents the unshakable idea that the cause of socialism is invincible as long as it is guided by the Dear Leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. The Korean people are firmly defending the cause of socialism, holding General Kim Chong-il, the great iron-willed brilliant commander, in high esteem as supreme commander of the Korean People's Army. General Kim Chong-il is a great military genius endowed by nature with the resourcefulness and personality of a brilliant commander. Possessed of flawless quality and traits of an iron-willed brilliant commander and ever-victorious military strategist, he has strengthened the people's army and increased the might of socialism to be invincible with his unrivalled military intelligence, matchless grit and distinguished commanding art. Under his guidance today the Korean People's Army has grown into ever-victorious revolutionary armed forces equipped with modern offensive and defensive means and the entire people have been armed and the whole country has been fortified. The Dear Leader is a great brilliant commander who is possessed of iron will not shaken by any roar of thunder. Whenever the situation was carried to the brink of war in Korea by the aggressive war moves of the U.S. imperialists, he dealt a bitter defeat to the enemy in the spirit of decisive and fierce attack, without a moment's hesitation and vacilation. When the U.S. imperialists and their stooges ran riot last year to stifle the DPRK, resuming the frantic team spirit joint military exercises and demanding "a special inspection" of it, the supreme commander instantly proclaimed a semi-war state and powerfully aroused the whole party, the whole country and the entire people in defending the dignity and sovereignty of the country and the nation. Now the U.S. imperialists are rendering the situation of the Korean peninsula extremely strained, after massively bringing to the Korean peninsula and its surroundings new-type fighter planes, warships and other means of nuclear strike of different types and Patriot missiles, totally reversing the agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York. The United States is trying to bring the Korean people to their knees with a strong arm and pressure. But it is a mistake. Nobody is equal to the strength of the singlehearted unity of the Korean people rallied closely behind the great brilliant commander.
