Opening the new Johannesburg Press Club venue in Johannesburg, he said he believed that a growth rate of above 6 percent and not artificial factors such as a rise in the gold price or commodity prices was needed to revive the economy. Mr. Keys said 6 percent was critical and that everything had to be done to try to achieve such a growth rate.
