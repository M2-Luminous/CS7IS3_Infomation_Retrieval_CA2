FR940303-2-00108 FR940303-2-00062 [Investigation No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;641 (Final)] Ferrosilicon From Brazil Determination On the basis of the record 1 developed in the subject investigation, the Commission determines, pursuant to section 735(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1673d(b)) (the Act), that an industry in the United States is materially injured by reason of imports from Brazil of ferrosilicon, 2 provided for in subheading 7202.21.10, 7202.21.50, 7202.21.75, 7202.21.90, and 7202.29.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, that have been found by the Department of Commerce to be sold in the United States at less than fair value (LTFV). The Commission also unanimously determines, pursuant to ยง735(b)(4)(A) of the Act, that critical circumstances do not exist with respect to ferrosilicon imports from Brazil; thus, the retroactive imposition of antidumping duties is not necessary. 1 The record is defined in sec. 207.2(f) of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR 207.2(f)). 2 For purposes of this investigation, the subject product is ferrosilicon, a ferroalloy generally containing, by weight, not less than four percent iron, more than 8 percent but not more than 96 percent silicon, not more than 10 percent chromium, not more than 30 percent manganese, not more than three percent phosphorus, less than 2.75 percent magnesium, and not more than 10 percent calcium or any other element. Background The Commission instituted this investigation effective August 12, 1993, following a preliminary determination by the Department of Commerce that imports of ferrosilicon from Brazil were being sold at LTFV within the meaning of section 733(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673b(b)). Notice of the institution of the Commission's investigation and of a public hearing to be held in connection therewith was given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington, DC, and by publishing the notice in the Federal Register of August 26, 1993 (58 FR 45120). The hearing was held in Washington, DC, on September 14, 1993, and all persons who requested the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel. The Commission transmitted its determination in this investigation to the Secretary of Commerce on February 18, 1994. The views of the Commission are contained in USITC Publication 2722 (February 1994), entitled ``Ferrosilicon from Brazil: Investigation No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;641 (Final).'' Issued: February 28, 1994. By order of the Commission. Donna R. Koehnke, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;4879 Filed 3&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7020&hyph;02&hyph;P
