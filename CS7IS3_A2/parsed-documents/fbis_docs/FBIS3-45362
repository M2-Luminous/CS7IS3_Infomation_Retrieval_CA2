Braving heavy snow earlier today, Bush inspected the Pudong new area of Shanghai, on the eastern bank of the Huangpu River. He also had his picture taken on the newly-built Yangpu Bridge -- which has the longest span in the world. The administrative committee, the highest executive body of the Pudong new area, briefed him on the development and construction of the area. Twenty of the world's 100 big transnational companies have invested in the Pudong new area. Bush showed great interest in the investment environment and the potential of development in the Pudong new area. He said he would come to invest in the area if he were younger. In the afternoon, Bush and his party visited the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the largest one in China. Bush was seen off at the airport by Liu Huaqiu, Chinese vice- foreign minister, and Shanghai officials.
