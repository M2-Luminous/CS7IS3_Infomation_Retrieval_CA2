During a three-day debate the congress stressed the need to be independent and define its place in the coalition of groupings forming the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD). One of the seventeen resolutions adopted by the third congress recommended that the union deputies circle be set up within the SLD caucus. Spychalska said in her address that the union is not going to "unfold any umbrella over any government." Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, who was the congress guest on Saturday said, commenting Spychalska's statement, that "I am glad the government will not be under the umbrella, we will have to be careful so that we are not out of the frying pan into the fire." He added that the government will be fulfilling the coalition promises and another revaluation of pensions and retirement benefits will be carried out in June. Another congress guest Grzegorz Kolodko, the deputy PM [prime minister] and finance minister presented the government-prepared plan of Poland's long-term development, entitled "The Strategy for Poland." Kolodko said that when implemented, the programme may bring about a 22 per cent growth of gross national product (GNP) within four years and a 15 per cent growth of consumption in real terms. Commenting on Ewa Spychalska's statement that "the OPZZ does not have any obligations to the Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland (SDRP), Aleksander Kwasniewski, the SDRP leader said that none of his statements about the OPZZ suggested unilateral obligations of the alliance towards the SDRP. "We have mutual obligations because we participated in the (September 19) elections together," Kwasniewski argued. In adopted resolutions, the congress delegates demanded a 100 per cent revaluation of pensions and retirement benefits, based on the average wages' growth. They also demanded that government take immediate measures aimed at solving the crisis in housing construction. The congress protested against "the hitherto passive policy" of the government in fighting unemployment. Spychalska told newsmen after the conclusion of the congress that the OPZZ authorities are considering whether to sign contracts with political parties in order to be able to withdraw union deputies from parliamentary work as their union activities are restricted closely as if they were "in a corset". Spychalska also stressed the need to strengthen the trade union movement in the private sector. Alfred Miodowicz, the first OPZZ chairman has been chosen head of the committee for the preparation of the celebrations marking the tenth anniversary of the organisation's activity.
