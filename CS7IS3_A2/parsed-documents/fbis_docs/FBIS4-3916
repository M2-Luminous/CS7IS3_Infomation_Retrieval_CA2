From now on, work units with a reputation for wrongdoing will be disgraced by a black sign hung at their front gates. The new system was initiated last week in Haikou, the capital of Hainan province, where signs reading "bad social order work unit" were hung outside seven government departments and enterprises. Among the units forced to advertise their own shortcomings were the provincial Goods and Materials Bureau, the Haikou branch of the Agricultural Bank of China, and the Hainan Fertilisers Factory. "It's a way of putting social pressure on them to improve their behaviour," Xu Wei, secretary to the mayor of Haikou, said. "The police cannot exert this kind of pressure by themselves." Wen Guangshou, deputy director of the Haikou committee for comprehensive management of social order, adds: "The police had many talks with these units but they did not take any preventive measures." "We have no choice but to hang the black signs," he said. Most of the work units had been found guilty of embezzlement several times over. Other black-listed units had suffered from "social chaos incidents", Wen said. He did not elaborate. "By hanging the black sign over the door, we are saying that if more cases keep occurring the top leaders of the units will be personally disciplined," he said. It is probably no coincidence that the system has taken off in Hainan first. The island was considered to be rife with corruption and vice even before it became a province with special economic zone status in 1988. It has been called the "Wild West of of China". Watching street brawls is regular entertainment for the pineapple-munching citizens of Haikou, whose police force often respond by joining the crowd of enthusiastic onlookers, or else accepting a small consideration to forget the whole affair. The Haikou police dismissed 41 officers in the first half of last year for accepting bribes. Wen said the black signs will be removed if the behaviour of the seven work units improves in the second half of the year. "At the end of this (lunar) year, we will select another group of work units with social order problems and hang signs on their gates," he said. Wen said those which depend on their reputation with the public were least likely to get black plates. "When we threaten a hotel with a black sign, it always acts quickly," he said. "Otherwise nobody would want to stay there." The system rings eerily similiar to the Cultural Revolution, when "big character posters" were posted outside the homes and work units of suspected wrongdoers. "The central government made a decision last year to begin this system," Wen said. "It's part of our national campaign to deal with certain outstanding problems." From a distance, the signs look like the ubiquitious wenming danwei (civilised work unit) signs which the Communist Party has handed out by the stackful since nationalising the economy in the mid-1950s. "No, those signs are red. They are meant to praise, not criticise," Wen explained. "Besides, the red signs are usually hung inside the office where the workers can enjoy them. With the black signs, they have no choice."
