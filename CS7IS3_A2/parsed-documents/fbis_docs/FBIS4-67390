Health Minister Torben Lund has dusted off the environmental guarantee and has been advocating use of it in connection with the food-coloring directive. In other places -- particularly in the central administration -- there is very little enthusiasm for turning this kind of political leverage into a legal proceeding. There was no hesitation in the voice of Prime Minister Poul Schluter when on 28 January 1986 he rose from his seat in the Folketing and ascended the podium: "Many spokesmen have said: We wish to make our own decisions in the environmental sphere, and I well understand this. We will achieve this, and will achieve it in a better way than before. ``But now we will have a different system, a system that enables us to make our own national regulations. It is unprecedented in the EC for this to be acknowledged in EC law. It is incorporated into the treaty itself in Article 100 A.'' The prime minister played his trump. At that point, it was just a month until the Danish people were to go to the polls and accept or reject the so-called EC package. The prime minister and his enthusiastically pro-EC foreign affairs minister had serious domestic problems. A majority of the Folketing was opposed to Danish acceptance of the "package." There were two parts to the EC package, in particular, that had caused a majority in the Folketing to urge a no vote. The first was the additional power the European Parliament would assume, and the other was the fear that the environment would take second place to harmonization of the inner market. While the issue of the European Parliament's role was a very technical matter, the discussion around the so-called environmental guarantee evolved in 1985 into an orgy of Danish assurances about the guarantee's merits. The guarantees for Danish health and the future of the environment were touted within the Folketing, the Marketing Committee, in statements issued by the Foreign Affairs Ministry, and in commentary from the daily press. Yet, it is interesting to note that after eight years, it has never yet been "necessary" to invoke those guaranties. This despite obvious problems in the EC related to solvents, cancer-causing agents, and the most recent issue on food coloration. The cause: Nearly every case in which the environmental guarantee might be invoked provides an opportunity for exposure of the fact that the Danish interpretation of the environmental guarantee is not viable. Negotiation Problems It is not exactly a well-kept secret that Denmark employs a much wider interpretation of the use of the environmental guarantee than that laid down by the European Commission's legal services. Or compared to the other EU [European Union] nations. Even before the national referendum in February 1986, the question of Denmark's interpretation was raised and later discussed. One place it was discussed was at the conference held in Copenhagen in April 1987, in which the general directors of both the Council of Ministers and the Commission's legal services, Dewost and Ehlermann, clearly laid down a ruling that made the guarantee less usable than the Danish interpretation would have it. The fact that there is a discrepancy in the interpretations is not unusual, but the very strict Danish interpretation of the environmental guarantee has ultimately become a problem for Denmark in the negotiations in Brussels. A number of centrally placed Danish diplomats have admitted to INFORMATION that the Danish interpretation is a distinct inconvenience when Danish officials and ministers in Brussels must fight to maintain Danish standards on environmental and health issues. These officials argue that if those in Brussels could "threaten" the Commission with the idea that Denmark might invoke the environmental guarantee, such a threat could influence the Commission to alter its proposals in a direction more favorable to Denmark. Guarantee or Sop? The basic difference in the interpretation of treaty Article 100 A, which contains the environmental guarantee, is largely a matter of the extent to which this article is a genuine guarantee for a better environment and the extent to which it is a kind of sop to those countries who are likely to vote against the directives on the inner market when they are put to a vote. In 1985/86, there was no question in the Danish mind that the article was a real guarantee. "In those instances in which the uniform technical regulations do not adequately safeguard health, work environment, or the environment in general, a member nation may introduce national measures with the object of fulfilling this goal," Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, then foreign affairs minister, assured the Folketing on 28 January 1986. He was backed up by a number of statements issued by the Foreign Affairs Ministry in the period before the national election. However, in at least four areas, the Danish interpretation of the guarantee diverges from the interpretation in other places. This concerns: - Regulations established in committee procedures. - The extent to which a nation must vote negatively in order to invoke the environmental guarantee. - The extent to which a nation has the right to invoke the environmental guarantee for the purpose of introducing stricter regulations at a later date, after an EC regulation has already passed. - Which party should bear the burden of proof when the EC Court is called upon to determine whether a nation may set higher standards for the environment and health. Food Coloring Of these, the final point is the crucial reason why Denmark on a number of occasions has refrained from invoking the environmental guarantee. Both in the case of warning labels for cancer-causing substances and in the present case of the so-called food-coloring directive, problems have arisen because there is disagreement among the technical experts on the inherent danger of the substance. While, in Denmark, it is regarded as a fact that a number of substances allowed by the directive are dangerous, a number of experts from other countries consider these substances to be harmless. Therefore, if Denmark is to invoke the environmental guarantee with any effect, a crucial question must be who would have the burden of proof if such a case should go before the EC Court. The European Commission does not hesitate in this matter. According to the Commission, the country that wishes to invoke the environmental guarantee has the burden of proof before the Court to substantiate its claim. The Danish interpretation is exactly the opposite. "It is obvious that if the Court is to render an opinion on the allegation of misuse, it is incumbent upon the party bringing the complaint to substantiate it. The burden of proof on the member nations will as a result be lighter," wrote Kent Kirk, the current Conservative EU spokesman, in a commentary in INFORMATION on 24 February 1986. Should Denmark invoke the environmental guarantee in conjunction with the food-coloring directive, the fact that Denmark overinterpreted the guarantee in 1986 would in all likelihood be revealed. Freedom of Action And, if at a later point, it could be shown that some of the substances that are now permitted by the food-coloring directive in Denmark were dangerous, it would not be possible to tighten up on Danish regulations by invoking the environmental guarantee without the risk of raising a conflict over interpretation. "It must follow that even if the Council has passed joint regulations, a member state can retain more comprehensive pre-existing regulations; that a member state can choose directly at the time of passage and implementation of the EC regulation to impose stricter national regulations, or else choose in the first instance to utilize the joint regulations, but later -- in light of developments -- choose to tighten these through the use of national regulations," wrote the Foreign Affairs Ministry in a statement issued 30 January 1986. Evidence that the Commission does not agree with this interpretation can be found, among other things, in an answer given by the Commission in the European Parliament on March 1987 to Else Hammerich, a member of the EC Parliament at that time. One problem with the food-coloring directive is that, once the directive is passed, a special committee will continually revise the list of substances that are allowed or prohibited. In the debate on the directive, former Industry Minister Jan Trojborg has put a great deal of emphasis upon the fact that Denmark was able to insert a clause to the effect that in the period before the directive goes into effect this committee should evaluate a number of substances again. The Danish interpretation of the environmental guarantee suggests that Denmark could also avail itself of the environmental guarantee with regard to the committee's later work, while the Commission in its answer to Hammerich clearly said no to that kind of use of the guarantee. The EU Court has, as a result, decided that if Denmark wishes to invoke the environmental guarantee on the food-coloring directive, it must occur immediately after the passage of the directive. The environmental guarantee has again been dusted off by, among others, Health Minister Torben Lund who has urged using it in connection with the food-coloring directive. But, in other places -- especially in the central administration -- there is very little enthusiasm for turning this kind of political leverage into a legal proceeding. Denmark has too many potential skeletons in the closet for that.
