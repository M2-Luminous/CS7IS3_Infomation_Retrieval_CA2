That was in 1990. Schroeder, now 50, had just succeeded Christian Democrat Ernst Albrecht as minister-president. Four years later, a little more than a month after his reelection (44.3 percent), the Social Democrat's pronouncements sound a lot more muted. The former visionary, who can now govern without the Green partner, now only tries to secure what has been achieved. His most exciting goal for the chronically debt-ridden land is "Molav." This government in-house shorthand stands for "modernization of the land administration." For over a year, the Interior Ministry has been collecting proposals on how to clean up the civil service apparatus--whether the chambers of agriculture could do with less personnel, or if road construction offices could be closed down. The first success: Last week, the cabinet eliminated the superfluous position of land mandatary for the disciplinary system. The Green's top woman, Andrea Hoops, says spitefully that Lower Saxony's policies in the future will be "a good deal more provincial" than in the days when the Greens still cogoverned in Hannover. Schroeder's reform zeal is being checked by the tight situation in the land parliament. Although the SPD [Social Democratic Party] has an absolute one-vote majority in the parliament, it is awfully close. Controversial plans from the red-green times, such as introduction of a local transport levy, are simply being dropped. In such ideologically burdened projects, Schroeder cannot be sure of all his followers. True, left Social Democrats such as representative Heinrich Aller, 46, and Wolfgang Juettner, 46, head of the Hannover SPD bezirk, admonish that the new government must not leave "ecology to the old coalition partner" (Aller). But the head of government no longer seeks his salvation in nature: Just now, of all people he praised the "amigos" of the Bavarian CSU [Christian Social Union] for their industrial policy. The comrades swallowed it without a murmur. Not even Environmental Minister Monika Griefahn dared any criticism. For that, she--the most popular SPD figure in Lower Saxony after Schroeder--is allowed to stay in office. Agriculture Minister Karl-Heinz Funke also can keep his post. Although he failed in his fight with the Brussels EU [European Union] headquarters over swine fever, he gained great popularity with Lower Saxony's farmers for his pithy sayings. Schroeder's simple personnel policy maxim: Whoever is popular--and knuckles under--is allowed to stay on. So the new cabinet will be largely identical to the old one. Only in the succession to the Green Women's Affairs Minister, Waltraud Schoppe, Schroeder had to give in to the party's will. Originally, the chief of government simply wanted to abolish the Women's Ministry. But the few SPD women in parliament managed to have deputy land chairman Christina Buehrmann become Schoppe's successor. The new cabinet member is too much of a feminist for Schroeder. The Ministry for Federal and European Affairs, up to now headed by Green Juergen Trittin, will definitely be dissolved. Although this impresses the citizens, the savings effect for Molav is small. Asylum-seekers, resettlers, and civil war refugees, for whom leftist Trittin had been responsible, are now under the charge of conservative Interior Minister Gerhard Glogowski--that, too, is a signal. Schroeder himself will administer the most important part of the Trittin ministry so that those in Bonn will not forget him: representation of Lower Saxony in the Bundesrat. The comrade has announced that, from now on, he will "massively intervene" in federal affairs--hard times for his rival and party friend, Rudolf Scharping. Only a few days after his reelection, Schroeder showed Scharping what he has in mind: He stated in Bonn that there is not going to be any generally observed speed limit on the pace set by SPD. Three days later, at the official presentation of the SPD election platform, Scharping was allowed to confirm what the man from Lower Saxony had already announced previously.
