Tunisia, which had always stood by the causes of right, liberation, and justice, strongly condemns the policy of ethnic cleansing that blatantly contradict not only the right of the peoples to self-determination but also the most basic of human values and the most sacred of human rights -- namely the right to life. Tunisia, which had blessed the accord concluded in Washington between the Croats and the Bosnian Muslims, demands an immediate end to this campaign and addresses an urgent appeal to the international community, particularly to the Security Council, to carry out a speedy and decisive action to halt this aggression against the innocents and to provide the circumstances that ensure security and peace in the region.
