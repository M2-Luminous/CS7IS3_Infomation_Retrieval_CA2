Seen as a close ally of the late President Habyarimana, who was killed in a plane crash on Wednesday [6 April], the rebels said they would continue their march to capture the capital, Kigali, where some of their fighters are trapped. [passage omitted] Just as we were about to go on the air, we received a call from the information spokesperson of the RPF rebels. Wilson Wutasira is in Mulindi. Alice Martin asked him what news he had of their forces march to the capital: [Begin recording] [Wutasira] The latest information I have just got is that some of our troops are just between 10 to 15 km from the capital, Kigali. [Martin] How many troops? [Wutasira] Well, there are two units, two units, all fighting units, which have gone along the Wumba-Kigali axis. [Martin] And what is happening at the moment? Are they fighting all the way or are they just walking in? [Wutasira] Yes, they are fighting all the way as they come across the government forces. [Martin] Has there been much fighting? [Wutasira] Well, there is a lot of fighting along the way but some have managed to go through. [Martin] So you say that two battalions have crossed through the so-called demilitarized zone and they are within 10 to 15 km of the capital. [Wutasira] That's right, that's right. [Martin] Now, why should I be sure that you are telling me the truth? [Wutasira] Well, it is good that we give information as to the progress of the forces as they advance. [Martin] And who is leading the forces? Is Paul Kagame at the head of the battalion? [Wutasira] Well, he is with the troops. [Martin] What do you intend to do? [Wutasira] Well, we intend to....[pauses] Those two forces are supposed to go and reinforce our battalion which has been locked in fighting for the past two days. [Martin] So, you are going to relieve a battalion of 600 who are in the center of Kigali. [Wutasira] That's right. [Martin] And what else will you do when you are in Kigali? [Wutasira] Well, we could also assist the UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] and those other forces there who want peace and security restored in Kigali. [Martin] Aren't you going to try and take over? [Wutasira] Well, if that is necessary to regain security for Kigali, then it can also be considered. [end recording]
