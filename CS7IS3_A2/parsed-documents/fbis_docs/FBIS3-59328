To earnestly implement the guidelines laid down by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System has decided to coordinate with related departments to select about 100 pilot state-owned enterprises to carry out experiments in establishing a modern enterprise system. A modern enterprise system is one which reflects the socialized mass production and meets the requirements of the market economy. Its rights and responsibilities are clearly defined. The enterprise management is separated from government administration and carried out scientifically. By establishing a modern enterprise system, state-owned enterprises must fundamentally change their operation mechanism and genuinely become independent legal entities and main bodies in market competition. The establishment of the modern enterprise system shows that China's enterprise reform has entered a new stage of focusing on creating a new enterprise system from the stage of attaching importance to the policy of delegating more decision-making power to the lower-level units and letting them have more profits. To establish a modern enterprise system, we must proceed from the state of affairs in China, sum up our experience in successfully reforming our enterprises, and actively learn from the scientific approach of the enterprise system of the Western developed countries in forming the enterprise system with Chinese characteristics. It is reported that the pilot enterprises will be selected from the large enterprises in various areas under the relevant departments of the State Council. Headed by unified leading groups these enterprises should have steadily scored outstanding achievements in management for three or more years and demonstrated high awareness in reforming themselves. Some of them will be industrial enterprises, while others commercial establishments. Still others will be enterprises in the field of science and high technology. Therefore, they will be large in number but they will cover all fields of work. Their major tasks are to straighten out relationship between ownership and management of state-owned enterprises, set up a system of properties for enterprises who are legal entities, separate administrative and economic management functions of the enterprise and government, establish a diversified form of organization for enterprises to keep pace with the development of the productive forces, foster a scientific internal management system, implement a new accounting system, and so on. On the basis of their different characteristics, the pilot enterprises will formulate their own experimental plans to carry out all reform projects gradually and in a planned manner. To carry out experiments in establishing the new modern enterprise system, we must not only solve problems in going through the transition period from the stage of the existing enterprise system to the new enterprise system, but also exercise the macro-control of the state well so that the reform projects in controlling state-owned properties and others will keep pace with other programs for enterprise reform. Thus, in carrying out experiments in selected enterprises, we must strengthen our leadership, do a good job in coordinating and organizing all pilot enterprises, work out our plans carefully, and give the enterprises the proper guidance. We must not only carry out reform and create the new, but also boldly carry out our experiments energetically, steadily, and reliably and in strict accordance with the standard. The State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System will convene a national conference on the work of restructuring the economic system in early December to work out concrete plans for carrying out the aforementioned experiments in selected enterprises.
