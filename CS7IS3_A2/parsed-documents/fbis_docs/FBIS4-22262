What is happening in the old and glorious Volga city, why are the inquisitive and the curious flying here from all nearby krays and oblasts and from distant countries across the ocean (they have even begun to publish a local newspaper in English, NIZHNIY NOVGOROD TIMES--so what, there is a demand)? Nemtsov, the Governor It is clear to everyone that the reforms came from Nemtsov. A senior scientific associate at Gorkiy Scientific Research Institute, the radiophysics techie occupied a main Nizhniy Novgorod office on the wave of the antinuclear rally movement. In August 1991 a remarkable photograph was published throughout the world press--next to the favorite of the Russians and our first president was a tall person with white teeth wearing the most fashionable long coat and a no less fashionable scarf. They said that it was he, Nemtsov, who had come on Yeltsin's behalf to reach an agreement with the Taman Division concerning support, and they did agree. The Taman members turned away from the supporters of the State Committee for the State of Emergency. Thus Nemtsov became Yeltsin's local representative in Nizhniy Novgorod and then at the same time head of the administration, and the session of the oblast council decreed that he be called governor from then on. Nemtsov passed the test of power. Moreover, in the opinion of the majority of people who know him, he grew into a serious politician far above the local level. Three important things took place with him. He did not stagnate, he did not cease to be the people's favorite, and he did not dress himself in the armor of a highly placed boss surrounded by a retinue of yes men (in Rus', alas, there have always been as many examples of this as you may wish). That is the first thing. He did not become the mouthpiece, the arm, the eye, and everything else of the Moscow leaders, afraid of his own opinion and his own obstinacy. And, third, he is constantly growing, seeking, and he is not afraid of trying things. I will not say that among the Russian governors, provincial presidents, and members of the Council of the Federation, Boris Nemtsov is the most respected. But that he is the most noticed and, perhaps, the most energetic--there is no doubt. Yavlinskiy, the Reformer People speak about the great friendship between Boris Nemtsov and Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, which goes back almost to before they can remember. This is hardly true. The distance between the deputy chairman of the Silayev Council of Ministers and the young Nizhniy Novgorod deputy was fairly significant in those days. But they felt a sympathy for one another. They even look a little bit alike, not to mention the similarity of their manner of thinking, communicating, and making decisions. Therefore it was no accident when Yavlinskiy's ideas were not called for after the first visit of Gaydar and his team of "Chicago boys" that the theretofore fashionable economist with a group of his own "boys" from the "EPItsentr" which he organized set out for Nizhniy Novgorod. "Capitalism with a Yavlinskiy face" was constructed in Nizhniy in a year and a half and the program called "Nizhniy Novgorod EPIlog" was implemented. The experiment in small-scale and medium-scale privatization in the Nizhniy Novgorod area was deemed most successful. The privatization of the trucks was especially successful. At the time when the State Automotive Inspection had not introduced the new Russian numbers and it was possible to tell from the combination of numbers and letters who owned the motor vehicle--a private party or the state--and the travelers along the local roads were struck by the abundance of "private" numbers on the trucks. And here, unlike other Russian oblasts, they rejected the coupon system for distribution of products. The prices were liberalized. They turned out to be higher than their neighbors' and the "product delivery line" was spontaneous, changing according to the laws of the market, turned in the direction of Nizhniy. But at the same time in the oblast wages remained about 10-15 percent higher than their neighbors'. The neighbors complained, groaned about "local prejudice" and "selfishness," but because of this Nizhniy lived better than the others. There were mistakes as well. For instance, they decided to introduce something like their own money--this was when Russia was gripped by the "cash" crisis, to which the Gaydar government proceeded deliberately, trying thus to control the operation of the printing press. The oblast money, which even before it appeared was christened "Yavlinki," fortunately, was not needed. They did without it. Attracted by Yavlinskiy's name, foreign specialists were also drawn to the city, first simply to look, and then to help. Anthony Doran, `Missionary' All right, Yavlinskiy did not go very far when he left Moscow. Specialists came here from America and England to help "push" the reforms. Anthony Doran, a specialist from the International Financial Corporation, lived in the Volga city for almost a year. He had a whole group of advisers along with him. Practically free of charge, which Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin emphasized, and sometimes, to be honest, at their own expense, the Englishmen and Americans helped to privatize the sovkhozes and kolkhozes in the remote Nizhniy Novgorod area. You might say that things were not going very well in Russia. Yes, the former sovkhozes and kolkhozes were transformed into joint-stock companies and limited liability partnerships, and farmers appeared in some places. But so what? The farmers were moaning and groaning and even intending to leave. The joint-stock companies and limited liability partnerships were new in name only--they used the former methods and the results were lamentable. And here another good friend of Chernomyrdin (apparently for this reason), the country's chief agrarian, Aleksandr Zaveryukha, almost caused the relations that had developed in rural areas to break down prematurely. It was a matter of acting without thinking. The Russian individual is special, and our path is special. So just give us more credit for the branch and we will respond with a harvest. The credit was given. This kept Zaveryukha quiet for a time. Then they asked for some more. They did not give him enough, and so the harvest did not turn out. Chernomyrdin took Zaveryukha along with him to Nizhniy Novgorod. But he also took the minister of agriculture, Viktor Khlystun, a person who was undoubtedly more progressive. What did the "missionary"--and you could not call him anything else--Anthony Doran, show them? In the village of Kovrigno the Kolkhoz imeni 60-Letiye Oktyabrya was coming off the auction block. The auction was conducted according to a plan developed by Doran and his men. First they divided all the kolkhoz land and all the property together into actual land and property shares. Everyone living on the kolkhoz received equal rights to shares of land. Depending on their work tenure and wages, each one received a property share as well. And the old pensioners became almost the richest ones when things were divided up--they had been working there for decades. Then they began to combine the shares. Anyone who wanted to work as an individual--who was tired of cooking in the common pot--he kept his share. Anyone who was thinking about a farmer-run or peasant farm, joined together with relatives or close friends. The rest of the people were divided into three groups. They turned their shares over for leasing or to the former chairman, or to the chief agronomist and economist. It was possible to reach an agreement on money as well, but the villagers preferred payment in kind--wood for a year, milk every week, a worthy burial. That was also possible. This was not the first privatization according to the new plan in the oblast. One kolkhoz and one sovkhoz had been transformed this way before that. And if in Kovrigno there was not a single person who would sell his share forever, in other villages there were also "seasonal workers." They were tired of being tied to the land. One old lady sold here certificates (they were given to everyone) for so many cases of vodka. That was her right. Makarycheva, the Chairman Eight potential buyers came to trade at the auction, which was attended not only by the government, but also by 37 governors and administration chiefs from regions of Russia. There were two private property owners. Two farmers. Three future leaders of mixed companies (those same chairmen, agronomists, and economists) and the chief specialist of a former kolkhoz who was thinking about creating the limited liability partnership Tekhservis. The land was divided up peacefully and, from all indications, long before the auction itself took place. But at the property auction they were pounding the gavel constantly. They were vying, as it were, for each tractor and each truck. There was bidding for the cow barn, the sheep farm, the cows, and the sheep. Whoever offered more, whoever was more resolute, whoever had calculated more precisely the package of property shares. The economist Yekaterina Nikolayevna Makarycheva, now chairman of the mixed partnership Moshkinskoye, left the auction satisfied. She did not manage to buy everything she wanted; there were not enough warm garages for agricultural equipment, but, all right, it was possible to reach an agreement to pay for their use. But Chernomyrdin was perhaps even more satisfied with the auction than Makarycheva was. Thus he said, looking the representatives of the other components of the Federation in the eyes: "We shall use the Nizhniy Novgorod experiment as a basis for a Russia-wide national program for privatization in rural areas." Yefremov, the Economist Big-time politics had turned Yavlinskiy's head. He left Nizhniy Novgorod. Some of his team also took deputy seats in the State Duma. The reforms in Nizhniy Novgorod were now in the hands of the deputy leader of the oblast department of economics and prognostication, Vladimir Yefremov. The boy from Vyatka (the neighboring oblast), he received his professorial robes in the American city of Springfield. Yefremov links his views on the reforms and their success primarily to the rise of industry. They had already determined their priorities for the development of the oblast economy. They "went" to the government with a proposal to grant the oblast "defense industry" an investment tax credit for payments into the federal budget, they developed a system of bills of exchange for Ministry of Defense debts to the enterprises, and they are beginning to create a fund for supporting the enterprises on the basis of commercial banks for financing the development of production in keeping with the established priorities. And there are many more proposals. The oblast administration has already adopted decrees regarding all of them. Chernomyrdin read it, shook his head--interesting!--and suggested: Get together with Shokhin and Soskovets and think about what can be used at the federal level. After the departure of the Moscow guests, the telephone in the office of affairs of the oblast administration started ringing off the hook with long distance calls: We are coming to see what interesting things you have there.
