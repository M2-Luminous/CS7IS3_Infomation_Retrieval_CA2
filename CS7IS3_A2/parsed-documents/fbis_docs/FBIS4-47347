Finogenov, N.S. Rogov, All-Russian Institute of Aviation Materials, Kiev; UDC 620.192.46:668.31] [Abstract] The utility of long-term crack resistance measurements during stress-induced aging, usually accompanied by the development and realization of several combinations of adhesive and cohesive glued joint failures as a result of cracking, and the relative ease and accessibility of the wedge method for crack resistance testing in an aging-inducing environment, e.g., for glued rectangular slabs, prompted the selection of the crack propagation work in the glued joint per unit of linear measure or the energy release rate at separation as the crack resistance criteria. The energy release as measured by the wedge method rate is calculated and a formula is derived whereby the crack resistance criterion is expressed as a function of the wedge and slab thickness, crack length, and the slab metal modulus of elasticity. The proposed criterion and testing method make it possible to analyze the crack resistance of virtually any structural adhesive and determine its compliance with the safety requirements which ensure the operational reliability of the glued structure. It is noted that in mechanical engineering, the energy release rate in machines at which the crack virtually does not grow is used as the long-term crack resistance criterion.
