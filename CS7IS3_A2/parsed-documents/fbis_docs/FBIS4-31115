Last week the British press announced that Markovic had met in an embassy in Belgrade with the Kosovo ethnic Albanian representatives. "The Kosovo Albanians are still unwilling to take part in a dialogue. They continue nurturing hopes that the big powers, primarily the United States, will give them their own state, but nothing will come out of that. The prevailing stand is that minorities cannot secede and this also refers to the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo," Markovic told a meeting of young socialists in Jagodina, town in central Serbia. He said that before long they (ethnic Albanians) will have to sit down at the negotiating table if they want something to change in their favour, because they have excluded themselves from the political and economic activities of Serbia and Yugoslavia. A strong separatist ethnic Albanian movement has for decades been active in Kosovo. The separatists advocate the province's secession from Serbia and Yugoslavia and its annexation to neighbouring Albania. Since they refuse to accept Serbia as their mother country, the separatist leaders over the past four years pressured the people to boycott the parliamentary and presidential elections in Serbia. The talks will take place, but whether they will be held in the form of informal and not-binding talks between intellectuals, or at the official level, will shortly be announced, Markovic said.
