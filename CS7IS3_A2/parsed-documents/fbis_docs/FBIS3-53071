Following is the text of the cable: In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. Your Excellency President Saddam Husayn: Greetings. I have received with great appreciation your brotherly, sincere congratulation on the 29th anniversary of the launching of the Palestinian revolution. I am pleased in the name of our Palestinian people and my brothers, in the name of the members of the PLO Executive Committee, and in my own name to thank you, your esteemed government, and the fraternal Iraqi people very much and to wish you all the best. I will also seize this opportunity to express to your excellency, dear brother, our mujahid Palestinian people's feelings of solidarity with and gratitude to the fraternal Iraqi people under current circumstances and the unjust blockade that is imposed on them and that is targeting the food and medicine of their children. We also express our deep belief that fraternal Iraq will be able, thanks to its great efforts and capabilities under your brave leadership, to overcome this ordeal, difficulties, and conspiracies surrounding it and to restore its prominent role in our glorious Arab nation's march toward freedom, development, and prosperity, which our people lack at this decisive and crucial stage of their history as a result of the great difficulties they are facing in their fateful negotiating battle to regain their freedom and independence and to start building their national and economic institutions as a basis for their independent state with holy Jerusalem as its capital. I beseech Almighty God to guide our steps in our efforts to unify the ranks of our nation, restore its unified position, and overcome its wounds in the interest of its generations and it dignity. I thank you again and wish your excellency good health, happiness, and success, and I hope that the fraternal Iraqi people will overcome the ordeals surrounding them and resume their march toward progress, development, and prosperity under your wise leadership. We will march together to Jerusalem, with Almighty God's help. [Signed] Yasir 'Arafat, president of the state of Palestine and chairman of the PLO Executive Committee
