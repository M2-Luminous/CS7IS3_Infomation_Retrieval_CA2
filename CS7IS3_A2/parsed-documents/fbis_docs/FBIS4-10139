This means that the truth about Cuba is prevailing. In an article published on 7 April, GRANMA journalists Leon Nicanor Cotayo mentions the specific dates of the U.S. State Department reports on this issue: 7 March 1991, 12 April 1993, and 4 April 1994. It is interesting how in the last report, the U.S. Government notes that Cuba's efforts against drug trafficking have not been more extensive because of the effects of the more than 30-year-old U.S. blockade. In this regard, the document states that the shortage of fuel and essential spare parts somewhat limits the Cuban Government's capabilities to intercept drug traffickers. Leon Cotayo adds that Miami's far right and other conservative sectors in the United States frequently unleash smear campaigns, tying Cuba to drug trafficking. This is the third communique issued by the U.S. State Department, which once again putting objectivity before any propagandistic defamation, seems to add an element of significant value to anyone pondering the seriousness of Cuba's arguments when it comes to explaining its actions, or when it comes to repudiating those who around the clock, try to distort Cuba's reality.
