Granic, in talks with the Bosnian Government in the fourth day, said the parties could be signing a preliminary agreement this afternoon on the confederation, which will then be linked to the Bosnian Serbs to form a two-republic Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, U.S. officials appeared less optimistic. "They are still engaged in talks and we are relatively hopeful there might be something this afternoon," one officials said. "They may get there and they may not," he said. The plan, initiated by the United States, would require economic ties between the Muslim-Croat federation to the Croatian Republic, the reason why the Granic was here. Meanwhile, U.S. President Bill Clinton and visiting British Prime Minister John Major said they would work together "for a resolution of the crisis" in the Balkan republic where ethnic war had raged for 22-months, killing tens of thousands of civilians. They said a "joint civil planning mission" would be sent to Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, to help revive the city's basic facilities.
