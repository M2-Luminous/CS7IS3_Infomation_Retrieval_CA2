The Turks will immediately arrive in Sarajevo in response...." The very next day, Muslim leader A. Izetbegovic protested to all and sundry against the arrival of the Russian "blue helmets," who, in his opinion, cannot be neutral, since they are the Serbs' allies. And then he asked the question: "If Russia has arrived in Sarajevo, why can Turkey not do the same thing?" And so, in violation of the unwritten UN principle not to send military subunits from neighboring countries or former occupaniers to Bosnia, its secretary general has given the Turks permission for this. First it was a question of 200 servicemen. Then it was reported: Ankara is sending 2,700 men. The reaction of Belgrade and the Balkan countries was not long coming. Here are just a few headlines: "Janissaries Again," "Turkey -- Threat to Peace," "Return of the Ottoman Empire." The Turkish foreign minister commented as follows on the UN decision to allow Turkish troops to be part of the "blue helmets": "This is a triumph for Turkish policy." The Bosnian Serbs, Belgrade, Athens, and Sofia do not think so. Their opinion is unanimous: Turkey was an occupier for many years, and it is not at all appropriate for it to be involved in peacekeeping actions in Bosnia since it is a prejudiced force. By and large it is impossible to get rid of the idea that on every occasion, as if deliberately, the West and the United States think up "solutions" with one aim alone -- to add fuel to the smoldering fire. And what about Moscow? The Greek newspaper TA NEA, which is close to government circles, writes that only Russia could hinder the dispatch of Turkish troops. However, its UN representative, Vorontsov, has stated that the Russian Government is in agreement with the Turkish proposal.... Naive Athens observers: Moscow has already congratulated Athens on its peacekeeping contribution, and, for the purposes of balance, is sending another 300 servicemen to Bosnia who include representatives of Muslim nationalities. Speaking at a parliamentary sitting, the leader of the Bosnian Muslims, touching on the UN decision to involve Turkey in its operations, stated in particular: "The conditions for a major war are thus being created." If the Turks arrive, he said, then the armed forces of Yugoslavia, as a member of the United Nations, will enter the Serb Republic. The UN Security Council has adopted the following decision: The city of Mostar, which the Croats and the Muslims can in no way divide up between themselves, will be under the control of the European Union in the next two years. To accomplish this its leaders have instructed...Germany. And one of the fathers of the city of Bremen has been appointed Governor of Mostar. He will bring with him his own administrative officials and police.
