Kazimirov left Tehran for Baku on Saturday evening, where he has discussions in Iran Foreign Ministry for the settlement of Armenian-Azeri conflict. During the meeting Aliyev noted that Azerbaijan states the continuation of mediatory activity with satisfaction. "But this work should not stop and ceasefire should be used for completion of negotiating process", noted President. According to Aliyev, contacts of Jan Eliasson -- head of CSCE Minsk group, Kazimirov, Vladimir Shumeyko -- head of Russia's Council of Federation and Anatoliy Adamshin -- deputy of Russia's Foreign Ministry in Moscow are of great importance. "It is a good moment in negotiating process and it is necessary to join efforts of CSCE Minsk group, CIS and Russia to make this process more efficient", noted Aliyev. Eliasson's and Kazimirov's joint appeal to the Presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan was appreciated by Aliyev. "This appeal meets our interests, we think it was right and we accept it", noted Aliyev. According to him Azerbaijan will firmly support ceasefire. "According to Eliasson, who was in Yerevan, Armenia also insists on active participation of CSCE Minsk group in the conflict's settlement and stands for ceasefire. But Armenian troops attacked towards Sadarak region (Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic) and in a few days attacked borders of Kazakh region on June 19-20. In result, six Azeri soldiers were killed and there were a lot of wounded", noted Aliyev. "Such incidents are unavoidable and each time they should be localized in order not to impact the situation", said Kazimirov. He also noted that the incidents on the borders anxired [made anxious] mediators. "The joint appeal to the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan, as well as to Robert Kocharyan [Karabakh leader] was caused by these incidents. We appealed to them in order not to sharpen the situation", told Russian diplomat. According to Kazimirov, Russia supports consultations with Iran Foreign Ministry. "We will have consultations also with Turkey in near future" he noted. Aliyev named these consultations "natural moment in negotiating process". According to him, two countries neighbouring with Armenia and Azerbaijan, can not be indifferent to the events in the region. Kazimirov told Aliyev that his meeting with Eliasson, within the framework of the "nine" of Minsk group together with participation of representatives of warring parties will take place, in early July in Vienna. Then, meeting of CSCE Interparliamentry Assembly will take place on July 4 in Vienna and during the period from July 5 to July 8 a session of CSCE Minsk group for the conflict settlement will take place. "It is very important to move towards the Big Political Contract during this period. If this time is used for propagandic war, that time will be wasted and will cost people a pretty penny", noted Kazimirov. According to Kazimirov, the attempts to contradict CSCE to Russia is also a waist of time. "But we don't see any contradictions in the settlement plans of CSCE and Russia, there some contradictions not in the essence, but in the details", said Kazimirov. He noted that Russia is ready to mutual cooperation with CSCE. According to Aliyev, Azerbaijan's terms in the settlement process remain unchanged. "The withdrawal of Armenian troops from the captured territories and return of the refugees to their houses is the very important term. After that, restoration of communications and security of Armenians of Nagorno Karabakh, as well as discussion of Nagorno Karabakh's status will have some logical meaning", noted Aliyev. Kazimirov had negotiations in the Turkish embassy in Azerbaijan late at night yesterday. The negotiations lasted more than three hours. On June 27 Kazimirov left Baku for Yerevan.
