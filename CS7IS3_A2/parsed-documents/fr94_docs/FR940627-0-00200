FR940627-0-00200 FR940627-0-00019 ␣ Table F 94&hyph;5._ Methane Base Fuel Specifications 1␣ 1␣ Methane, mole%, min 89.0 Ethane, mole%, max 4.5 Propane and higher HC, mole%, max 2.3 C6 and higher HC, mole%, max 0.2 Oxygen, mole%, max 0.6 Sulfur (including odorant additive) ppmv, max 16 Inert gases: Sum of CO 2 and N 2 , mole%, max 4.0 (g) Propane Base Fuel . (1) The propane base fuel is a gaseous motor vehicle fuel, marketed commercially as liquified petroleum gas (LPG), whose primary constituent is propane. (2) The propane base fuel may contain no elements other than carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. The fuel shall contain an odorant additive for leak detection purposes. The added odorant shall be used at a level such that at ambient conditions the fuel must have a distinctive odor potent enough for its presence to be detected down to a concentration in air of not over 1/5 (one-fifth) of the lower limit of flammability. After addition of the odorant, the propane base fuel shall contain no more than 120 ppm sulfur by weight. (3) The propane base fuel shall meet the specifications listed in Table F94&hyph;6.
