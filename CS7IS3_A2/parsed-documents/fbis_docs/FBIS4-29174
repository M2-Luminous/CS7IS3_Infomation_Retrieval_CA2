THE WASHINGTON POST of the United States last autumn made a satirical comment on Japan's indifference to the security matters in connection with the North Korean problem: "When confronted by danger, a coward ostrich digs its head into the sand and pretends not to have seen the danger." With this comment in mind, I am concerned whether "Japan's domestic readiness is all right," as debates at the UN Security Council [UNSC] are now going in earnest. Japanese Foreign Ministry sources consider that it will "require some time" before the UNSC comes up with certain measures. Toward the end of the current Diet session scheduled on 29 June, situations are looming that the head-on clash between the ruling and opposition parties over the presentation of a no-confidence vote in the cabinet and the last-minute decision of the measure in relation to the North Korea problem will have to be made at almost the same time. Because of this, not only overseas but also within the Japanese Government, there are persistent apprehensions whether or not the minority Hata regime is fully prepared to act when sanctions against the DPRK are imposed. Prime Minister Hata's North Korean strategy can be summarized as: first, to make the utmost diplomatic efforts to settle the problem peacefully; second, to insist on a gradual enforcement of sanctions under a UN resolution, when sanctions become inevitable; and third, to commit Japan to independent sanctions in concerted efforts of three nations -- Japan, the United States, and the ROK -- even devoid of a UN resolution. However, it became apparent that the three nations are not necessarily in monolithic unity when they met 4 June. Japan's Shunji Yanai, director general of the Foreign Ministry Consolidated Foreign Policy Bureau, made an opening proposal to adopt "a resolution of warning before anything else." To this, Robert Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary of state, and Kim Sam-hoon, ROK ambassador for nuclear problems, showed strong irritation, saying "such time has already gone," and demanded Japan stop remittances from Japan to North Korea, quoting the concrete amount to be "500-600 million yen." As a matter of fact, the Japanese Government has completed checks on ministry ordinances to make possible an immediate response to concrete sanctions, while pursuing dialogue. With reference to two precedents of past sanctions on the DPRK and the recent one on Iraq, the government finished working out the measures, except restriction on the reentry of temporary visitors to the DPRK in view of human rights. Foreign Ministry sources say: "The present ordinances are sufficient in view of the past experience of economic sanctions." For Japan, however, it really needs a just cause -- a UN resolution. At the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee on 3 June, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa was asked what sort of measures Japan, the United States, and the ROK will take if the United Nations failed to adopt the sanctions resolution. He indicated Japan's intention of making maximum efforts to cooperate and listed stopping remittances to the DPRK from Japan and trade between the two countries as concrete measures to be taken. At about the same time, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai replied: "It is improper to comment when there is a possibility of having a dialogue," when he was asked the same question at the House Cabinet Committee. He was said to have frowned at hearing the foreign minister's answer: "How can he answer like that while I was trying to make it as ambiguous as possible." As for stopping remittances, sanctions effectiveness will be greatly hampered without a UN resolution, because money can be sent through third countries. The Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is certain to oppose such measures if a UN resolution does not come along. With the political situation getting more and more fluid, Prime Minister Hata, who wishes SDPJ's eventual return to the coalition can hardly decide on the North Korean problem that may delicately affect his future plan of reshuffling the cabinet. The Japanese Government has not made its position clear on the matter of logistic support, such as fuel supply, of U.S. Navy ships on the sea blockade mission to insure the effectiveness of sanctions, because it foresees an inevitable controversy over the constitutionality of the rights to collective self-defense. Comments are being made about the possible amendments to the Self Defense Forces and Commodities Control Laws, but Defense Agency sources see the situation as: "The hurdle to be cleared is high and the political situation does not attest to entering into debates on the subject." The 7 June HERALD-TRIBUNE of the United States made a severe comment on that matter: "The Hata cabinet's vulnerability makes us dubious about Japanese cooperation to make the sanctions effective. The Hata regime has its hands full of domestic problems." Despite debates based on the past experience of ministries that imposed sanctions, it is doubtful if a unified cabinet program can be worked out. The crisis management over the neighboring Korean peninsula carries incomparably heavier weight than that during the Gulf War days. Though a minority government leader, Prime Minister Hata cannot escape from reality.
