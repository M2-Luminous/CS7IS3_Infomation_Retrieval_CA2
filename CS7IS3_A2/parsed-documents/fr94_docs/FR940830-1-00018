FR940830-1-00018 FR940830-1-00002 This proposed rule would also add a new §124.611 that would make SBA Small Disadvantaged Business status decisions issued pursuant to §7(j)(11)(F)(vii) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 636(j)(11)(F)(vii), available in full text. The decisions would be available for review in the law library located in SBA's central office. This new section would implement the requirements imposed by section 221 of the Small Business Credit and Business Opportunity Enhancement Act of 1992, Pub. L. 102&hyph;366, 106 Stat. 986, 999. Compliance With Executive Orders 12612, 12778, and 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.), and the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Ch. 35) This rule was not reviewed under Executive Order 12866. SBA certifies that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq . This rule is necessary to resolve several points relating to eligibility for SBA's Section 8(a) program and the procedures relating to appeals of denials of eligibility. It would also clarify/amend the requirements by which an 8(a) concern could obtain an exemption to the Miller Act bond requirements. The contracting opportunities offered to the 8(a) program should not be affected by this proposed rule. Whether a particular 8(a) concern would be eligible for participation in or, once in, could receive a bond exemption (and, therefore, whether it, as opposed to another 8(a) concern, would be awarded a particular 8(a) contract) could be affected by the rule. The rule would have no effect, however, on the amount or dollar value of any contract requirement or the number of such requirements reserved for the 8(a) program. Therefore, it is not likely to have an annual economic effect of $100 million or more, result in a major increase in costs or prices, or have a significant adverse effect on competition or the United States economy. For purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. Ch. 35, SBA certifies that this proposed rule, if adopted in final form, would contain no new reporting or record keeping requirements. For purposes of Executive Order 12612, SBA certifies that this rule would not have any federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For purposes of Executive Order 12778, SBA certifies that this rule is drafted, to the extent practicable, in accordance with the standards set forth in Section 2 of that Order. List of Subjects 13 CFR Part 121 Government procurement; Government property; Grant programs_business; Loan programs_business; Small businesses. 13 CFR Part 124 Government procurement; Hawaiian natives; Minority businesses; Reporting and record keeping requirements; Technical assistance; Tribally-owned concerns. For the reasons set forth above, SBA hereby proposes to amend part 121 of Title 3, Code of Federal Regulations, and subpart A, part 124 of Title 13, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), as follows: PART 121_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for 13 CFR Part 121 would continue to read as follows: Authority: 15 U.S.C. 632(a), 634(b)(6), 637(a) and 644(c); and Pub. L. 102&hyph;486, 106 Stat. 2776, 3133. 2. Section 121.906(b)(1)(iv) would be revised to read as follows: §121.906 Manufactured products under small business set-aside procurements. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (1) *␣*␣* (iv) Represents that it will furnish an end product that was manufactured or produced in the United States, unless the procuring agency makes a non-availability determination pursuant to §25.102(a)(4) of the Federal Acquisition Regulations. * * * * * §121.1103 [Amended] 3. Section 121.1103(b) would be amended by adding the words ``sole source or competitive'' after the word ``particular'' and before the phrase ``section 8(a) contract.'' 4. Section 121.1104 would be amended by revising paragraph (a), the introductory text of paragraphs (b) and (b)(2), and paragraph (f) to read as follows:
