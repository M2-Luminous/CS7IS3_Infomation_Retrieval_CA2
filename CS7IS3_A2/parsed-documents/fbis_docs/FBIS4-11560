The latest news regarding the situation in Le Borgne is that the Army is allegedly in control of the situation, according to the report given to our correspondent in Cap-Haitian by the military head of the city. Military units sent to the spot are allegedly in control of the situation after chasing away a group of armed rebels, supporters of President Aristide, according to statements by the military commander of the North Department. No official report has been provided, however, since the confrontations between the military and the group of armed civilians led by the North Department delegate, according to information provided by the North Military Command. Our correspondent, Jean-Claude Larousse, has details: [Begin Larousse recording, in Creole] In Le Borgne, Boucan Michel, the Haitian Army is in control of the situation after several days of lavalas insurrection led by Marc Lamour, former member of the Constituent Assembly in 1987, vice delegate under the overthrown Aristide government. We learned from military sources that the Army seized stocks of weapons, explosives, and ammunition which were at the disposal of the terrorists, according to the commander of the North Military Department, Lieutenant Colonel Claudel Josaphat. The same sources also say that many of the rebels were killed; they do not specify the number nor mention whether the leader of the group, Marc Lamour, was alive, under arrest, or in hiding during an Army raid early last week. Another source, however, said the only casualty on the military side was a soldier who was shot in the foot. According to the same source from the North Military Department, the weapons that the terrorists had were guns, 40-mm grenade launchers, AR-15 antitank rifles [as heard], and 9-mm pistols. According to information circulating in Le Borgne, a lot of damage was done after the raid. Meanwhile, we learned that there were many arrests in Le Borgne, Port Magot, and even in Limbe, including the Le Borgne mayor elected 16 December. According to military sources, he was charged with plotting against state security. It is very difficult for a journalist, however, to find and verify information on the development of the situation in Le Borgne. Meanwhile, according to Lt. Col. Claudel Josaphat, the military raid continues. Let us point out that the incident began, according to military authorities, on the evening of 7-8 April when two of Marc Lamour's men attacked the outpost of Petit-Bourg in Le Borgne, a region about 50 km west of Cap-Haitian.
