It is semaks, developed by the Institute of Molecular Genetics [IMG] and the Biology Faculty of Moscow State University. In terms of its structure semaks is a synthetic analogue of a short fragment of the stress hormone--adrenocorticotropic hormone. This short fragment is interesting because of its clearly expressed stimulating influence on the highest forms of activity of the central nervous system: the formation and reproduction of a memory trace, motivation, attention, and emotional state. The analogue synthesized at the IMG possesses the same range of physiological action, but it takes tens of times longer to take effect than the prototype. The analogue synthesized at the IMG has traveled the long path of essential preclinical trials and the development of the technology for producing the substance and its medicinal form. This has resulted in the creation of a medicinal preparation in a form convenient to use--nose drops--which has been named semaks.
