FBIS4-67166 "jptdd021__l94019" JPRS-TDD-94-021-L JPRS Narcotics 11 May 1994 LATIN AMERICA MEXICO Former PGR Adviser Labels Country a `Narcodemocracy' Former PGR Adviser Labels Country a `Narcodemocracy' PA1505143894 Mexico City REFORMA in Spanish 11 May 94 p 1a PA1505143894 Mexico City REFORMA Spanish BFN [By Juan Jose Coello] [Text] Mexico is living a narcodemocracy and narcotraffickers have achieved socioeconomic influence, Eduardo Valle Espinoza, former adviser to the Attorney General's office [PGR] of Diego Valades and Jorge Carpizo, has stated. Valle, who resigned on 1 May, stated the foregoing in his resignation letter. "After learning of the above, I ask: When will we have the courage and political maturity to tell the Mexican people we are living in a narcodemocracy? Will we have the intellectual capability and ethical strength to say that Amado Carrillo, Arellano Felix, and Juan Garcia Abrego are, inconceivably and degradingly, the promoters and even pillars of our socioeconomic growth and development? In his resignation letter, the official briefly explained the narcotrafficking problem in Mexico and he recognized his failure to dismantle the Matamoros Cartel led by Juan Garcia Abrego. This was a task which had been assigned to him by Valades. "I recognize that I did not have the capability to apprehend the public leader of the Gulf of Mexico Cartel. I truthfully did all that I could within my means. I failed and regrettably admit it," the former PGR adviser stated. His resignation had been kept silent for unexplained reasons. "I am leaving as I entered. I have no money, but I have gained knowledge and experience. Nobody can say I harmed anyone without a true juridical basis. I can look anyone in the face and feel no shame," he stated in his letter. Valle Espinoza also questioned the programs and plans to fight narcotrafficking and raised the possibility that the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio may have been drug-related. "Nobody can conceive of a political project in which the narcotrafficking lords and financiers are not included, because if he does so he is dead." Perhaps evidence of that will be found in relation to the 23 March incident in Tijuana. Although, I warn, I don't have any more information about that infamous act than that which is publicly known. In the last part of his letter, Valle Espinoza thanked Carpizo and the president for their trust, which he claims he never failed. Valle Espinoza was appointed to his post in early 1993. Valle Espinoza began to hunt down Garcia Abrego with the support of 30 agents, all heavily armed and recruited by himself. He was also provided with communications equipment, vehicles, two helicopters, an aircraft, and a big budget. According to official investigations, the Gulf Cartel, known previously as the Matamoros Cartel, has $10 billion in resources, heavy political and police influence, and an "Army" of over 500 men. The PGR is investigating since last week the transfer of Garcia Abrego and his principal deputies. Valle's actions resulted in the arrests of 10 drug traffickers and the confiscation of at least 50 properties in various states of the republic.
