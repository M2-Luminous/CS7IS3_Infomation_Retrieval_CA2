FR941130-0-00017 FR941130-0-00002 In that connection, as noted above, the FDIC received 3 comments that a mutual holding company should not be prohibited from waiving rights to dividends paid by its subsidiary insured depository institution. Retaining at the insured institution level dividends that otherwise would go to the mutual holding company increases the ownership interests of the minority owners of the depository institution. Conversely, the owners of the mutual holding company lose an interest in dividends that otherwise would be paid to them. This raises a conflict-of-interest issue where the directors/trustees of the mutual holding company, who request the dividend waiver, also are the minority shareholders of the subsidiary depository institution inasmuch as they will personally benefit from the waiver. The Board believes that an effective way to address this apparent conflict of interest is to condition the FDIC's decision not to object to a proposed mutual holding company reorganization (of a State Savings Bank) or deny a deposit insurance application (in proposed mutual holding company reorganizations of savings associations) on such waived dividends not being available for any distribution to minority shareholders. The FDIC intends to consider, on a case-by-case basis, imposing such a condition in all mutual holding company reorganizations of State Savings Banks, as well as in all deposit insurance applications filed in connection with mutual holding company reorganizations. 12. Securities Disclosure and Proxy Statement Issues The FDIC received a few comments suggesting that the FDIC indicate the standards it uses in reviewing the securities disclosure documents and proxy materials involved in conversions of State Savings Banks. The Board believes that full and meaningful disclosure to all parties is a critical element underlying the fairness of a proposed conversion. Existing depositors and potential investors should be provided with readily understandable disclosures of material facts and information as a basis for reaching an informed decision to vote or participate in the conversion. It is the responsibility of the State Savings Bank proposing to convert to stock form to prepare offering and proxy materials in accordance with acceptable disclosure standards for the industry. At a minimum, the notice of proposed conversion filed with the FDIC should include offering and proxy materials that disclose the facts and considerations sufficient to allow an interested recipient to make informed decisions on voting on the plan of conversion and/or purchasing stock in the conversion. The State Savings Bank may choose whether to provide to the FDIC the minimum disclosures in separate documents or in a ``wrap around'' form with the proxy statement attached. The disclosure materials provided to the FDIC generally should consist of: (1) A proxy statement to solicit proxies for a depositors' or members' special meeting to vote on the plan of conversion, and (2) an offering circular to be used in a subscription and community offering of the newly created stock institution's common stock. In addition, the FDIC staff reviews financial disclosures to check conformance with generally accepted accounting principles. Also, the FDIC reviews disclosure materials for several different types of mutual-to-stock conversions and mutual holding company reorganizations. These include: (1) The formation of a new stock financial institution which is the successor to the mutual financial institution, and which conducts a subscription and community offering of its common stock; (2) The formation of a stock holding company which is the owner of a newly created successor stock financial institution and which conducts a subscription and community offering of the holding company's common stock; and (3) The formation of a mutual holding company which owns a majority interest in a newly created successor stock financial institution and which generally conducts a subscription and community offering of a minority interest in such subsidiary's common stock.
