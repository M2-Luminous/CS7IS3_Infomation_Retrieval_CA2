It was only weather conditions that prevented NATO aircraft from delivering a new and this time massive strike against Serb positions. Russian diplomacy is desperately trying to save the situation. President Yeltsin's special representative Vitaliy Churkin went to the Bosnian Serbs' capital, Pale, while Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev paid an emergency visit to Belgrade, where on Saturday night through early Sunday morning he met with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. According to the original plan, Kozyrev was to have flown to Yugoslavia no earlier than Sunday. The rapid deterioration of the situation forced him to act without delay. The members of the Russian delegation discovered that the visit had been switched to Saturday only two hours before the flight out. Addressing the press after the talks with Kozyrev, the Serbian president was unperturbed, repeating again that both Belgrade and the Bosnian Serbs favor a peaceful solution and the only reason for the deterioration of the situation around Gorazde is provocations on the part of the Muslims. But in private conversations Yugoslav officials admit that there is another reason -- the implacable stance of General Ratko Mladic, commander in chief of the Bosnian Serbs. Neither Radovan Karadjic, leader of the "Serb Republic" in Bosnia, nor Milosevic himself can control this man's actions. What with his powerful friends in the Yugoslav army's top leadership, Mladic is to a large extent invulnerable, even where the all-powerful Serbian president is cocnerned. According to information from reliable sources, two years ago, during Kozyrev's first visit to Belgrade, Russian diplomats pressed the Yugoslavs to get rid of Mladic, who was obsessed with the idea of creating a "Greater Serbia" and was prepared to enter into confrontation with the whole world in order to realize his dream. But Milosevic made it plain that he could do nothing. Now he is reaping the fruits. The belief among Kozyrev's entourage is that Milosevic's promise to influence the Bosnian Serbs and persuade them to cease firing on Gorazde was entirely sincere. As were Karadjic's assurances, when he swore to Churkin that he would immediately halt the offensive against the Muslim enclave. Despite this, the attacks continued and Serb tanks captured the suburbs of the city that had been declared a "safe area" by the United Nations. "The Serb military is acting independently, often ignoring the will of the political leadership," a Russian diplomat dealing with the Balkans, who wished not to be named, told IZVESTIYA. "Mladic is a sinister figure. He will not have any compromises. It is his profound belief that neither NATO nor the United Nations is prepared to take decisive action and all their threats are empty ones. Our main task was to convince Milosevic and Karadjic that the situation was far more serious and that events might take a very nasty turn if the Serbs did not respond to the UN demand and pull back from Gorazde." "In conversation with Milosevic Kozyrev voiced our concern, to put it mildly, over the Bosnian Serbs' behavior. He took a very tough stance," Galina Sidorova -- the minister's political adviser -- said after the talks. If Belgrade helps to defuse the situation in Bosnia, Kozyrev promised to demand a relaxation of international sanctions against Yugoslavia. There is information that suggests that the Americans were prepared to join the Europeans in supporting Russia's initiative, having hitherto opposed any concessions to Belgrade. But this can only happen in the event of the normalization of the Gorazde situation. The latest reports from the area do not provide any grounds for optimism, unfortunately. Battles between Serbs and Muslims are continuing and NATO air strikes could be launched at any moment. Even Vitaliy Churkin, who tends not to be pessimistic about things, on this occasion acted out of character, declaring that he did not believe a ceasefire in Gorazde was possible. If the Serbs continue the offensive, Gorazde is bound to fall. Militarily the enclave is doomed -- the Muslim army is incapable of defending it. The capture of the city would be a public slap in the face not only for the United Nations, but for the North Atlantic bloc as well, which would have demonstrated its impotence. Neither Butrus-Ghali, nor the leaders of the Western states can accept this. It would jeopardize the prestige and political future of many Western leaders -- and Russia's protests would no longer stop them in that event. The question for NATO now is not whether to launch another strike against the Serbs, but how to make it as effective as possible. According to information at the disposal of people in Smolenskaya Square, NATO headquarters is working on plans for a ground operation in Bosnia. But that would require a massive amount of preparation and a great deal of time. NATO will obviously have to confine itself to an aerial war in the foreseeable future. Experts believe it would be futile to go hunting for Serb tanks and mortars in mountainous and wooded terrain. A strike against Serb units attacking Gorazde would not have any significant effect either. The Serbs are employing ideal tactics: Rapidly breaking through the enemy's line of defense, they are mixing with the civilian populace, which makes them invulnerable to NATO aircraft. If Western leaders decide to switch from a show of force to major combat actions, they will be forced to attack the Bosnian Serbs' strategic facilities -- headquarters, communications centers, ammunition dumps, and, most important, several bridges over the Drina River, linking the "Serb Republic" in Bosnia to Serbia. The destruction of these bridges would be a terrible blow to the Bosnian Serbs, because it would mean that Belgrade would be unable to come to their rescue. In that case the conflict would be in danger of developing into a military clash between NATO and Yugoslavia. Belgrade has repeatedly made it clear that it would regard the bombing of the bridges as a declaration of war... For Russian diplomats this prospect is a nightmare they want to avoid. Unfortunately, the current situation is such that none of the potential scenarios, including that one, can be dismissed. The efforts of Kozyrev and Churkin have given a ray of hope of a peaceful resolution of the crisis. But the situation as a whole remains critical. According to UN spokesmen, a Serb shell was fall on Gorazde every 20 seconds on Monday morning.
