Governor Tian Chengping summed up the meeting. Provincial party and government leaders Yin Keshing, Wang Hanmin, and Yao Xiangcheng attended the meeting on 24 January. Vice Governor Ma Yuanbiao chaired the meeting. After reviewing the province's achievements in agriculture and animal husbandry and analyzing existing problems, Governor Tian Chengping pointed out: More than 70 percent of the province's population is in rural and pastoral areas, this is Qinghai's basic situation. Strengthening the basic position of agriculture and animal husbandry and bringing about overall economic development in rural and pastoral areas will help resolve the masses' inadequate food and clothing and enable them to move toward moderate prosperity. This also serves as a basis for social stability. [passage omitted] Governor Tian Chengping pointed out: In the course of developing the socialist market economy, we should help the peasants and herdsmen with their production and operations according to market demands. This is our basic task at present. All levels of party committees and governments should help optimize the distribution of resources, adjust the production structure, develop rural and pastoral area economies, and increase the peasants and herdmen's incomes. They should take this as the departure point in their work. Energetically developing township and town enterprises is a strategic point in invigorating rural and pastoral area economies. In development of township and town enterprises, attention should be paid to two points: The first is increasing the aggregate amount, and the second is improving economic returns. In market competition, agriculture and animal husbandry are very weak in withstanding the pressure of competition. Therefore all levels of governments and departments should work out measures to protect them, formulate rational grain price protection policies, form a grain reserve system and a grain risk-bearing fund, and control and regulate markets by economic means.
