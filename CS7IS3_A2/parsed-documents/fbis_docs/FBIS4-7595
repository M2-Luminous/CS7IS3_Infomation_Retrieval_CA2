Reports confirm dozens of arrests and cases of maltreatment, as well as many raided homes. Here is a telephone report by Mehmet Haziri from Prishtina: [Haziri] The raiding of Albanian families in Kosova under the pretext of searching for arms has intensified in the last few months. Punitive expeditions have been more frequent in the Llape and Drenice regions. During the last five months alone, under the pretext of searching for arms, Serbian police raided 530 Albanian families in the Podujeve commune, 230 of which were raided as of 1 March. The Information Commission of the Kosova Democratic Alliance [LDK] branch in Podujeve informs that during March, approximately 50 persons were brutally maltreated at the city police station, while 80 others received summons to appear at the police station and hand over weapons. LDK activists and Albanian teachers were targets of the police. Lessons were interrupted many times due to police intervention, while many elementary school headmasters were summoned to the police station. The LDK also reports that 22 peasants from Strovci in Vushtrri were summoned to the police station for such talks under the pretext of handing over weapons. Raids and harassments have been reported in the villages of Skenderaj, Gjilan, Prishtina, Kline, and Prizren communes. In Qubrel in Skenderaj, Serbian police attempted to recruit four Albanian youths for the Serbian Army. The Albanians consider the Serbian Army foreign and did not respond to the recruiting summons.
