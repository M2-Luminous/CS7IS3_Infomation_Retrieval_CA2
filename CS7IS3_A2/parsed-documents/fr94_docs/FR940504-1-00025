FR940504-1-00025 FR940504-1-00005 Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;25&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion On March 3, 1994, the FAA issued AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10, Amendment 39&hyph;8849 (59 FR 11531, March 11, 1994), applicable to certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes, to require inspections to detect damage of the ball bearings in the aileron quadrants, replacement of damaged ball bearings with new ball bearings, and adjustment to the secondary stops. That action was prompted by a report that an in-flight failure of a ball bearing in a quadrant in the pilot's aileron control system caused abnormal backlash of the pilot's aileron control. The requirements of that AD are intended to prevent reduced controllability of the airplane. Since the issuance of that AD, Jetstream has developed new swivel bearings that allow greater swivel action, which would significantly decrease the likelihood of abnormal backlash of the aileron control due to bearing failure. Bearing failure in the aileron quadrants, if not corrected, could result in reduced controllability of the airplane. Jetstream has issued Service Bulletin J41&hyph;27&hyph;027, dated January 17, 1994, that describes procedures for installation of swivel bearings in the left and right aileron quadrants (Modification JM41307A). Jetstream has also issued Revision 2 of Service Bulletin J41&hyph;A&hyph;27&hyph;026, dated January 17, 1994. The inspection procedures described in this revision are identical to those described in Revision 1 of the service bulletin (which was referenced in AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10). The only change effected by Revision 2 is to reference the modification described in Service Bulletin J41&hyph;27&hyph;027 as terminating action for the inspections of the bearings in the aileron quadrants and adjustment to the secondary stops described in Service Bulletin J41&hyph;A&hyph;27&hyph;026. The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom. This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would supersede AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10 to require installation of new swivel bearings in the left and right aileron quadrants (Modification JM41307A) as terminating action for the currently required inspections. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this proposal have been revised to reference Revision 2 of Service Bulletin J41&hyph;A&hyph;27&hyph;026, dated January 17, 1994, as an additional source of service information for accomplishing the inspections of the bearings in the aileron quadrants and adjustment to the secondary stops. The FAA estimates that 8 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD. The inspections that were previously required by AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10, and retained in this proposal, take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of these inspection requirements on U.S. operators is estimated to be $440, or $55 per airplane, per inspection cycle. The adjustment to the secondary stops that were previously required by AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10, and retained in this proposal, take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this adjustment requirement on U.S. operators is estimated to be $440, or $55 per airplane. The FAA estimates that all affected U.S. operators have already accomplished this action; therefore, the future cost impact of this requirement is minimal. The installation of new swivel bearings (Modification JM41307A) that would be required by this proposal would take approximately 10 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts would be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to the operator. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the modification requirement of this proposal on U.S. operators is estimated to be $4,400, or $550 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
