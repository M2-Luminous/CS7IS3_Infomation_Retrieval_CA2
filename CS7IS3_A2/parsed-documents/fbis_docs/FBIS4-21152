He stressed: While Iran has come under strong Western criticism for taking strict antinarcotics measures, the United States accuses Tehran of procrastination in the matter. Referring to data and statistics and a report by the International Narcotics Control Board, our country's permanent UN representative said: The Islamic Republic of Iran has taken extensive measures to control narcotics, not only in the region but also globally. Tehran's investment in the matter is of the highest level. The U.S. assistant secretary of state claimed last Monday that the Islamic Republic of Iran is taking no measures to fight narcotics smuggling.
