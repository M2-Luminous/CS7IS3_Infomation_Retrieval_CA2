A regular meeting of the board has ruled its adoption impermissible. This is due to the fact that the draft does not reckon with the interests of smaller nationalities and envisages the possibility of Dagestan's future secession from Russia, which contradicts the Constitution of the Russian Federation and is fraught with tragic consequences. If the new constitution of the Republic of Dagestan is adopted in its present form, the Cossack board will rule it invalid on the left-hand bank of the Terek river and will demand the annulment of the decree of the RSFSR [Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Reoublic] Supreme Soviet of January 9, 1957, placing the Kizlyar, Tarum, and Nogaysk districts under Dagestan's jurisdiction. The Cossacks have informed the president, the parliament, and the government of Russia about their decision, as well as the leadership of the Dagestan republic and the local organs of power.
