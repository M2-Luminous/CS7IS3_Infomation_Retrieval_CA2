A description of any other rental housing projects and/or medical facilities, sponsored, owned and operated by the Sponsor including a description of experience in providing housing and/or medical facilities to the elderly and/or families and minorities. 11. A description of the Sponsor's past or current involvement in any programs other than housing (including its provision of services) that demonstrates the Sponsor's management capabilities and experience, including a description of the Sponsor's experience in serving the elderly and/or families and minorities. 12. A description of the Sponsor's experience in contracting with minority and women-owned businesses, including a summary of the total amount awarded in each of the two categories for the preceding three years and the percentage that amount represents of the total contracts awarded by the Sponsor in the relevant time period. 13. A certified Board Resolution, acknowledging responsibilities of sponsorship, long-term support of the project(s), willingness of Sponsor to assist the Owner to develop, own, manage and provide appropriate services in connection with the proposed project, and that it reflects the will of its membership. Also, evidence, in the form of a certified Board Resolution, of the Sponsor's willingness to fund the estimated start-up expenses, the Minimum Capital Investment (one-half of one percent of the HUD-approved capital advance, not to exceed $10,000, if non-affiliated with National Sponsor; one-half of one percent of the HUD-approved capital advance, not to exceed $25,000, for all other Sponsors; see 889.250), and the estimated cost of any amenities or features (and operating costs related thereto) which would not be covered by the approved capital advance. 14. A list of the applications, if any, the Sponsor has submitted or is planning to submit to any other Field Office in response to this NOFA or the NOFA for Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities (published elsewhere in today's Federal Register ). Indicate by Field Office, the proposed location by city and State, and the number of units requested for each application. A list of all FY 1993 and prior year projects to which the Sponsor(s) is a party, identified by project number and Field Office, which have not been finally closed. 15. HUD&hyph;2880, Applicant/Recipient Disclosure/Update Report, including Social Security Numbers and Employee Identification Numbers. 16. Evidence of need for supportive housing. A description of the category or categories of elderly persons the housing is intended to serve and evidence demonstrating sustained effective demand for supportive housing for that population in the market area to be served, taking into consideration the occupancy and vacancy conditions in existing Federally assisted housing for the elderly (HUD and FmHA) ( e.g. , public housing), state or local data on the limitations in activities of daily living among the elderly in the area, aging in place in existing assisted rentals; trends in demographic changes in elderly population and households; the numbers of income eligible elderly households by size, tenure and housing condition, and the types of supportive services arrangements currently available in the area and the utilization of such services as evidenced by data from local social service agencies or agencies on aging. 17. Evidence of site control and permissive zoning. (a) Evidence that the Sponsor has entered into a legally binding option agreement to buy or lease the proposed site; or has a copy of the contract of sale for the site, a deed, long-term leasehold, a request with all supporting documentation, submitted either prior to or with the Application for Capital Advance, for a partial release of a site covered by a mortgage under a HUD program or other evidence of legal ownership of the site (including properties to be acquired from the Resolution Trust Corporation). The option agreement period must extend through the end of the current fiscal year and contain a renewal provision so that the option can be renewed for at least an additional six months. The Sponsor must also identify any restrictive covenants, including reverter clauses. In the case of a site to be acquired from a public body, evidence that the public body possesses clear title to the site, and has entered into a legally binding agreement to lease or convey the site to the Sponsor after it receives and accepts a notice of Section 202 capital advance and identification of any restrictive covenants, including reverter clauses. However, in localities where HUD determines the time constraints of the funding round will not permit all of the required official actions ( e.g. , approval of Community Planning Boards) which are necessary to convey publicly-owned sites, a letter in the application from the Mayor or Director of the appropriate local agency indicating approval of conveyance of the site contingent upon the necessary approval action is acceptable and may be approved by the Field Office if it has satisfactory experience with timely conveyance of sites from that public body. In such cases, documentation shall also include a copy of the public body's evidence of ownership and identification of any restrictive covenants, including reverter clauses. For properties to be acquired from the RTC, include a copy of the RTC prepared Transaction Screen Checklist or Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, and applicable documentation, per the RTC Environmental Guidelines. [ Note: A proposed project site may not be acquired or optioned from a general contractor (or its affiliate) which will construct the section 202 project or from any other development team member.] (b) Evidence that the project as proposed is permissible under applicable zoning ordinances or regulations, or a statement of the proposed action required to make the proposed project permissible and the basis for belief that the proposed action will be completed successfully before the submission of the commitment application ( e.g. , a summary of the results of any recent requests for rezoning on land in similar zoning classifications and the time required for such rezoning, preliminary indications of acceptability from zoning bodies, etc .). 18. Narrative description of site and area surrounding the site, characteristics of neighborhood, how the site will promote greater housing opportunities for minorities, and any other information that impacts on the suitability of the site for the elderly. 19. A map showing the location of the site and the racial composition of the neighborhood, with the area of racial concentration delineated. 20. Provision of supportive services and proposed facility.
