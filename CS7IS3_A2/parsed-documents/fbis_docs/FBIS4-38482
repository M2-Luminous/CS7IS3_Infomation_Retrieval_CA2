It was elaborated by an interdepartmental working group at the Security Council with the participation of specialists from ministries and departments, leading criminologists, and practical workers in law enforcement organs. The process of the formation of a program was accompanied by a broad discussion of its provisions both in the center and in the regions. Over 1,000 proposals were submitted to the Security Council. The program is based on Russia's existing legislation. It takes into consideration our state's international-legal commitments, the results of a comprehensive analysis of the state and forecasting of the development of crime, and domestic and foreign experience of the elaboration and implementation of programs for fighting against it. The implementation of the program presupposes the pooling of the efforts of law enforcement organs and other state institutions and the whole of society. It presupposes the interlinking of economic, political, legal, educational, organizational, and other measures while relying on giving consideration to and organically combining the interests of the citizen and society. The program defines the following spheres as the most important ones in fighting against crime: the formation of legislative and organizational-legal principles; preventive measures against crimes; the fight against crimes against the life, health, and property of citizens; the fight against malfeasance and economic and organized crime; the fight against crime in the Armed Forces; the development of international cooperation in the sphere of the fight against crime; the improvement of resources, including cadre, scientific, and information backup for the fight against crime. The edict of the Russian Federation president envisages concrete measures for the implementation of the federal program.
