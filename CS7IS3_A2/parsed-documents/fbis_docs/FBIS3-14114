A very high percentage of our private sector and business sector factories could be exporting their products. As long as they export their products, what better testimony do they need? [passage omitted] [Rahmi] Do the things you saw during your tour today reflect the state of stability in Egypt? [Mubarak] Egypt is stable. Incidents that occur here and there are no big issue. Such things happen daily in the world. But some parties blow things out of proportion. We also used to exaggerate the issue. To increase their circulation, our newspapers used to carry banner headlines about incidents not worth such headlines. Every day I see incidents happen everywhere that are hundreds of times more frequent than the incidents in our country. I declare that Egypt is secure and stable, despite the minor incidents, which, God willing, will disappear. I hope that the youths who accept a little cash to do these silly things will regain their senses and realize that their actions do not serve the country's interests or their own or their families' interests. All industry, investment, tourism, and similar projects create jobs for people. When they carry out these actions, they are costing people's livelihood. Thank you. [Rahmi] Thank you, sir.
