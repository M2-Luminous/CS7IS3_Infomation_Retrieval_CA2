In his speech first Vice-chairman of the Central Standing Committee of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) Yi Chin-kyu condemned the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique for entreating the United States to restart the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises, desperately trying to introduce Patriot missiles into South Korea and openly inciting war fever, by opening to the public even a new war plan against the North dubbed "New Operation Plan No. 5027". He branded these moves of the puppet clique as a treacherous act against the 5,000-year-long history of the nation and a crime which can be committed only by the enemy of peace and reunification. He said: "The United States, which totally reversed the DPRK-U.S. agreed conclusions at the New York contact and unilaterally broke up the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks, is now scheming to unleash another war, while crying for `sanctions' and `blockade.' This fully shows that it is still watching for a chance to provoke a new war in Korea." He strongly demanded that the Japanese authorities no longer join the United States and the South Korean puppet clique in their nuclear war provocation moves but promptly renounce the hostile policy toward the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Chongnyon. Solidarity speeches were made by Japanese public figures and indignation speeches by Chongnyon officials at the meeting.
