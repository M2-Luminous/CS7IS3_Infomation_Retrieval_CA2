The order was approved after it was learned that the mosque served as a Hamas base. Students from two Bethlehem schools stoned IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers, but there were no casualties. The students hurled the stones because they failed in their matriculation examinations. Police Commissioner Rafi Peled said that the police plan to increase supervision of residents from the territories crossing the Green Line to work in Israel, and if needed approval of entry into Israel will be made tougher.
