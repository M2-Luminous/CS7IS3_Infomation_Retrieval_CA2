Hashimoto said at the Foreign Corrrespondents' Club of Japan that the ruling coalition has not demonstrated support for the idea, which has been pressed by the LDP. He also said it would take considerable time for the next general election to be held if it is conditioned on firm establishment of the new electoral system and sufficient promotional activities targeting public opinion. He said no one should completely rule out the possibility of the House of Representatives being dissolved and new elections being held under the current electoral system. Asked about Japan's chronic and mounting trade surpluses, Hashimoto suggested it could be ameliorated somewhat if Japan were to procure materials from Europe and North America to use as aid for particular regions of the world.
