FR940318-2-00005 FR940318-2-00004 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Foreign-Trade Zones Board [Docket 8&hyph;94] Foreign-Trade Zone 82_Mobile, AL Application for Subzone Status Peavey Electronics Corporation Plant (Electronic Audio/Acoustical Products) Foley, AL An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) by the City of Mobile, grantee of FTZ 82, requesting special-purpose subzone status for the electronic audio and acoustical products manufacturing plant of the Peavey Electronics Corporation (PEC), located in Foley, Alabama. The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a&hyph;81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR part 400). It was formally filed on March 3, 1994. An application for subzone status at PEC's Meridian, Mississippi, facilities is pending with the FTZ Board (FTZ Doc. 47&hyph;93, 58 FR 46628, 9&hyph;2&hyph;93). PEC's Foley plant (10 acres) is located at 410 East Section Avenue, within the Foley Industrial Park, Foley (Baldwin County), Alabama, some 35 miles southeast of Mobile. The facility (90 employees) is used to produce a variety of electronic hi-fidelity audio and acoustical products for the U.S. market and export, including amplifiers, loudspeakers, musical instrument processors, mixers, microphones, musical instruments (guitars, keyboards), public address systems, lighting equipment, and related accessories. Components and materials purchased from abroad include: loudspeaker parts, diodes, capacitors, resistors, printed circuit boards, electric motors, musical instrument parts, and wiring harnesses (duty rate range: free_10.0%). Zone procedures would exempt PEC from Customs duty payments on the foreign components used in export production. On its domestic sales, PEC would be able to choose the duty rates that apply to finished electronic audio and acoustical products (5% average rate) for the foreign components noted above. The application indicates that the savings from zone procedures would help improve the company's international competitiveness. In accordance with the Board's regulations, a member of the FTZ Staff has been appointed examiner to investigate the application and report to the Board. Public comment on the application is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and three copies) shall be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is May 17, 1994. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during the subsequent 15-day period to June 1, 1994. A copy of the application and the accompanying exhibits will be available for public inspection at each of the following locations: Office of the District Director, U.S. Customs Service, 150 North Royal, Mobile, AL 36602 Office of the Executive Secretary, Foreign-Trade Zones Board, U.S. Department of Commerce, room 3716, 14th Street & Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230 Dated: March 6, 1994.
