In a speech during the meetings, the minister said that the Iraqi people are determined to realize final victory and to end all the chapters of aggression. He said victory is an inevitable, unquestionable fact, despite the effects of the continued unjust blockade imposed on the Iraqi people. An INA correspondent in Cairo cited the minister as saying that by imposing the unjust blockade and preventing Iraq from acquiring medicine, food, and other living requirements, the United States and Zionism want to harm Iraq after the failure of the military aggression. He said this has caused the death of hundreds of thousands of children and women. He said the Arab nation possesses all the required economic, political, and human resources that qualify it to become a vanguard member of the international community and to seriously and capably confront challenges and dangers. He indicated that a common Arab market is an appropriate starting point for the realization of an Arab economic integration. He stressed that some parties' separate proposals under the so-called new world order calling for the so-called Middle East market or regional blocs are basically a U.S.-Zionist project to fragment the Arab nation and grant Zionism an opportunity to control the Arab economy and steal Arab resources. Concluding his speech, the trade minister stressed the importance of bolstering the role of economic unity and Arab economic agreements within the framework of the Arab League. He emphasized the need for supporting the joint Arab market and the joint Arab action strategy that was approved in Amman in 1980 to confront the challenges facing the Arab nation.
