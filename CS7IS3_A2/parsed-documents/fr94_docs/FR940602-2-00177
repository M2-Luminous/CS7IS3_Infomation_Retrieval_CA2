FR940602-2-00177 FR940602-2-00094 2. During Forest plan amendment or revision and project analysis, seek full involvement of holders and their representatives in public involvement opportunities and activities. Encourage and solicit their input and comments. Meet with holders and their representatives to discuss any issues or concerns arising in the planning and analysis processes and explore opportunities to resolve those issues prior to issuing a decision. 3. If a decision is appealed, utilize the opportunities provided in the appeal rules (36 CFR part 215, part 217 and part 251, subpart C) to discuss the appeal with the appellant(s) and intervenor(s) (and/or their representatives) together or separately to explore opportunities to resolve the issue by means other than review and decision on the appeal. 2721. 23i_Noncompliance. Give written notice and provide a reasonable opportunity for holder to correct special use permit violations before terminating the use for noncompliance with the permit conditions (36 CFR 251.60(e)). Revocation for noncompliance shall be only for a breach of a permit provision(s) that continues after notice and a reasonable opportunity for correction has been given (FSM 2347.1, para. 5). 2721.23j_Lot Restoration. On expiration of a permit which will not be reissued or revocation or termination prior to expiration (FSM 2721.23a(10), 2721.23a(16)), except for revocation in the public interest, require the holder to restore the property to a condition acceptable to the Forest Supervisor (36 CFR 251.60(j)). The holder may relinquish the improvements to the Forest Service upon approval of the Forest Supervisor. Terms and conditions for lot restoration are given in the term permit issued for recreation residences. Forest Service Handbook 2709.11_Special Uses Chapter 40_Special Uses Administration 41.23_Recreation Residence Use. 41.23a_Permit Continuance. When a Forest plan is amended or revised and recreation residence use remains consistent with management direction given in the Forest plan, issue a new permit to the same holder in accordance with the following: 1. Since recreation residences have been in place for many years, and experience in administering this use has shown that continuing the use does not cause significant environmental impacts, issuance of a new permit can be made without further environmental documentation (FSM 2721.23e), except when the following situations are present: a. If the use has been analyzed sufficiently as part of an EA or EIS completed within 5 years of permit expiration, but not specifically addressed in a decision document, confirm the consistency of the use with the management direction in the Forest plan by issuing a record of decision or a decision notice and finding of no significant impact. b. If the use has not been analyzed sufficiently as part of an EA or EIS completed within 5 years of permit expiration, complete the appropriate environmental analysis and documentation (FSH 1909.15). c. If an EA or EIS indicating the use is consistent with the Forest plan was completed more than 5 years prior to permit expiration, additional environmental documentation may be necessary (FSH 1909.15). d. If there are changes in the use and the changed use has been analyzed sufficiently as part of an EA or EIS completed within 5 years of permit expiration and approved in the appropriate decision document no further action is required. If the changed use has not been analyzed sufficiently as part of a completed EA or EIS and approved in the appropriate decision document, environmental documentation may be necessary. Such documentation may be accomplished by categorical exclusion (FSH 1909.15). 2. Initiate the analysis and action to issue a new permit 2 years prior to expiration of the current term permit and notify the holder of the outcome of the action.
