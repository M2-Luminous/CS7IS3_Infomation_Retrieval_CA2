"There will be no problems between the two countries," Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin said when asked by journalists whether Karimov had expressed his "concern" over the presence and activities of an Uzbek opposition leader in Turkey. "Good ties between Turkey and Uzbekistan are very important for the region," Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said following a luncheon she had with Karimov and Turkish businessmen. Karimov asked Turkish businessmen to "invest more" in Uzbekistan. Rising to this request, Turkish business tycoon Sakip Sabanci declared that he would send a delegation to that country in the coming days. However, Turkish sources said that Karimov had raised the issue of his country's discomfort at the activities of opposition leader Muhammed Salih and was told by the Turkish government "not to worry as Turkey would not allow anti-Uzbek activities from its territory." Uzbek Communications Minister Kamilzhan Rahimov has suggested that Uzbekistan could use Turkey's satellite, Turksat, after it is launched. President Suleyman Demirel is expected to visit Tashkent in October.
