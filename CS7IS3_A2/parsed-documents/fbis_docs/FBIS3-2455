The proposed amendment, the first since 1982, has been tabled at the opening of the second plenum of the Eighth Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held at the Great Hall of the People yesterday. The amendment says the struggle between Chinese and "hostile forces in and out of the country" will be a long-term task. "Class struggle within a certain area will exist over a long period of time. But [it is] no longer the major contradiction of the society," it says. The CPPCC constitution will state clearly the primary task of the country is modernization in accordance with the theory of Chinesestyle socialism and the "preliminary stage of socialism." Elaborations will also be made on the system of "political consultation" and "democratic supervision" over the party and Government. The system forms a major component of the Chinese-style democratic political structure under Communist Party leadership. For instance, it spells out that the major function of the CPPCC is to organize political consultation and democratic supervision and the political participation of other sectors. Ruling out the possibility of a multi-party system, the Communist Party has offered the CPPCC as well as the National People's Congress, nominally the highest power organ in China, greater say in national affairs. Delivering a work report of the CPPCC Standing Committee yesterday, Vice-Chairman Ye Xuanping reminded the 2,000- odd deputies of their vital role in the "historic period of vigorous development." He asked members, however, not to "go beyond their terms of reference" when monitoring the government. Mr Ye maintained that the united front organ dubbed by cynics a "political vase" had made new progress in the first year of the current five-year session. He said the CPPCC's Standing Committee had taken part in the making of public policies on major issues facing the country such as corruption and inflation. Warning that the enforcement of successive reform measures this year would inevitably lead to fresh social disputes, Mr Ye said in the report deputies should strive to help maintain political stability and unity. "[You should] mobilize all positive factors and transform negative factors into positive ones, so that the government can successfully implement its reform packages. "All CPPCC affiliates sub-committees and general membership should excel themselves in preserving the overall interest and in maintaining stability without doing anything prejudicial to unity and stability." Mr Ye urged deputies actively to listen to and pass on the grievances of the populace and suggest effective solutions. "When a problem is not amenable to a quick solution, we should assist the government to plead for understanding by the public so as to defuse a crisis," he said.
