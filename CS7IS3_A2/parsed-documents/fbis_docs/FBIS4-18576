Papoulias said the time available for reaching a solution is diminishing, and the delay, due to Skopje's continuing intransigence, benefits no one. The foreign minister did not rule out meeting with UN mediator Cyrus Vance in New York, not next Monday, but later within the framework of Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's visit to the United States. In the talks Vance will hold next Monday [11 April], Greece will be represented by Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis, director general of the Foreign Ministry. In his statement, the foreign minister also referred to Greek-Albanian relations, which he described as good, because the Greek side starts from the basic principle that relations must be good for the sake of peace and stability in the region. Answering a correspondent's questions seeking information on the settlement of Albanians in Greek-speaking areas, Papoulias said the wrong impressions are being created. He added that the Greek Government follows any move by the Albanian side carefully, especially with regard to inviolable minority rights.
