However, new party Sakigake, another member of the seven-party coalition, criticized the move as a betrayal of an agreement it reached with the JNP eight months earlier to form a new party. Hosokawa, who is JNP head, swiftly responded to Sakigake's criticism and said he has never talked about such an alliance plan with Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, who is regarded as the chief coalition strategist. "I have never discussed (with Ozawa) a plan to form a large parliamentary group," he said. On Tuesday, coalition sources said the JNP and Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) have agreed to form a single parliamentary group in the House of Representatives in late April. Kozo Watanabe, Shinseito's deputy secretary general, sought to salvage the alliance plan, telling reporters, "We intend to aim at forming such a group, although it may not be called an agreement." "It is desirable for coalition parties to form a unified new party, so we want to strike a merger deal primarily with the Japan New Party and Sakigake," he said. Ozawa's close associate Keisuke Nakanishi, who was former Defense Agency director general, agreed with the secretary general of another coalition party, the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), to initiate talks among rank-and-file legislators from the two parties with an eye to forming a large parliamentary group inside the lower chamber, the officials said. Earlier this month, Hosokawa said the coalition would be at a disadvantage in the next general election unless it overcame internal rivalry and agreed to file a joint candidate in each of the 300 newly created single-seat constituencies in the lower chamber.
