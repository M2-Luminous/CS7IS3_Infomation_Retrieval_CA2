In a letter to the head of state, General Sani Abacha, he said his inability to personally attend was due to commitments at the national level. The letter was read by the leader of the Cameroonian delegation to the summit, Mr. Augustin Kodock, at the state banquet held in honor of the visiting heads of state in Abuja. State House correspondent Oje Ogbonaya Oje was there: [Begin recording] [Oje] Mr. Augustin Kodcok, who is also the Cameroonian minister of state in charge of planning and regional development, said it was necessary to make the letter public to reduce speculation and mutual suspicion on why President Biya was not attending the summit. [Kodock] My president and dear brother, you kindly invited me to participate in the summit of heads of state of the Lake Chad Basin Commission scheduled in Abuja on 21 to 23 March 1994. Commitments at the national level unfortunately made it difficult for me to honor your kind invitation, and believe me, Mr. President and dear brother, I do regret this sincerely. [Oje] President Biya appealed to the head of state to extend the usual Nigerian hospitality to the Cameroonian delegation to the summit. He has reaffirmed his country's interests in the activities of the Lake Chad Basin Commission. In a three-page address delivered at the dinner, Gen. Abacha described the Lake Chad Basin Commission as a forum to promote development in areas of agriculture and water resources among member countries through regional cooperation: [Abacha] Our commission is one of the pioneers in this field. It is, therefore, imperative that our efforts toward integrated planning within the Chad Basin were in the advantage of all concerned. However, as members of an organization grouping brotherly neighbors, we cannot restrict our views only to the issues of economic development and the [word indistinct] of the environment. Our commission will also increase its role as a forum for the enhancement of peaceful coexistence among the member states. We all know that no serious economic development can take place without peace and security. [Oje] The state banquet, also attended by Presidents Idriss Deby of Chad, Mahamane Ousmane of Niger, and their entourage as well as members of the Provisional Ruling Council, ministers, and members of the diplomatic corps was full of glamor. Traditional dances from Sokoto, Borno, Kano, Plateau, and Benue also added color to the occasion. [end recording]
