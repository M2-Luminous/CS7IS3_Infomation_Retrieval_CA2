FR940513-2-00191 FR940513-2-00091 Programming Suggestions The proposed project should include at least one phase for African participants in the U.S. and at least one phase for American specialists in Africa. The following ideas should serve not as a blueprint, but as a stimulus for development of an original program design. The project should include formats which maximize interaction between the delegates and the speakers/presenters. The program design should provide adequate time for delegates to meet individually with American professionals who have similar interests and specializations. It is preferred, though not essential, that presenters be familiar with issues pertaining to the political process in the participating African countries. U.S. Study Tour Phase The U.S. study tour (approximately 3&hyph;4 weeks) could begin with an introduction to the U.S. Congress and its relationship to the other branches of the national government. However, the program should focus on one or more state legislatures whose scope and structure offer comparisons more relevant to African legislative bodies. Participants would learn about the professional duties of various legislative aides, as well as support staff including legal counsels, researchers, analysts, archivists, clerks and administrators. Participants might also benefit from observing the activities of lawmakers' personal staff who perform functions such as constituent services and media relations as well as committee staff who assist in setting agendas, organizing hearings and drafting legislation. Activities should stress the importance of professionalism in enhancing the long-term viability of the legislature and consider the impact of partisan politics on the professional staff's pursuit of its responsibilities. Participants also should study a variety of archival materials and their usage in supporting the legislative process and establishing the official record. Activities should help guide efforts to formulate appropriate strategies for handling archival materials in the participants' home countries. Phase in Africa It is recommended that the grantee institution organize a series of workshops to be conducted in the participating African countries. The workshops would bring together legislators and legislative staff to develop strategies aimed at strengthening the institutional capabilities of the legislature. This might include creating new staffing patterns, improving communication techniques, or revising job responsibilities. The U.S. presenters would also examine archives and advise participants on developing appropriate archiving systems. The U.S. presenters would conduct activities in French. The themes, objectives and design of the activities in Africa would most likely be based on discussions among the grantee institution, E/P, USIS posts and key players in the legislative process in the participating countries. This multi-phased exchange program should promote development of institutional linkages designed to advance the study of the legislative process. E/P encourages applicant institutions to consider strategies to facilitate access to information resources focusing on democratic institution building. This material might include reference books, periodicals, bibliographies, handbooks for elected representatives and lists of organizations that could offer assistance. Program Responsibilities The grantee institution's responsibilities include: selecting speakers, themes and topics for discussion; organizing a coherent progression of activities; orienting and debriefing participants; providing any support materials; providing all travel arrangements, lodging and other logistical arrangements for the African participants, escort interpreters and U.S. presenters who travel to Africa; and overseeing the project on a daily basis to achieve maximum program effectiveness. The grantee institution is responsible for coordinating plans and implementation with P/E, participating USIS posts, and any African co-host institutions. At the start of each phase, the grantee institution will conduct an orientation session for the delegation. At the conclusion, the institution will conduct participant evaluations and submit to E/P a final program report summarizing the entire project and resulting organizational links. To prepare the participants for their U.S. experience, E/P encourages the grantee organization to forward to participants a set of preliminary materials outlining the basic principles of representative government, the role of professional legislative staff and other appropriate background information about the project. E/P will ask African participants to prepare brief outlines describing their own particular interests in these areas. The grantee institution should brief the American presenters on the African delegates' backgrounds, interests and concerns.
