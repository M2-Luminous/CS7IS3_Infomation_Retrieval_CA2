The interview begins with Yeoryiadhis explaining how he got involved with the Kurdish problem, saying he became interested in it after learning the Turkish language and dealing professionally with Turkish issues. He and some friends, such as Lakis Pingouras, established the Committee of Solidarity With the Kurds in 1988. The correspondent asks what the committee has done for the Kurds and Yeoryiadhis answers that it has done many things but he cannot say it has done what it should have done. Responding to a question on how Cyprus can help the Kurds and how the Kurds can help Cyprus, Yeoryiadhis says: "The Kurds are already helping Cyprus by maintaining a war that keeps 350,000 Turkish soldiers occupied. Two weeks ago, we saw the Turkish military service extended by four months, proving that there is a lack of personnel. Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller last week said that Greece is creating problems, therefore, it cannot pull its forces from the Aegean and move them to Kurdistan. This shows that the Turkish Army has its hands full with the Kurds and is not capable of making a second war against either Greece or Cyprus. "Furthermore, the Kurdish revolution has blocked Turkey's dreams of resurrecting the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans and Central Asia following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Kurds help Cyprus by keeping the Turkish Army busy, that is by making the Turks incapable of expanding the invasion or starting a second war in Cyprus. "Our help has been multifold. Beginning with the political aspect, friendly countries, such as Cyprus, must raise the Kurdish problem at international forums and condemn Turkish terrorism and violations of human rights. The international community must press the Kurdish issue. Parties, organizations, and the people in general must give practical and financial help to a nation that fights and safeguards our security. "The Kurds in Turkey even attack the tourism industry and, as a result, we benefited last year. Our hotels were full last September and October with German tourists who would have gone to Turkey but finally came to Cyprus. This indicates that even our tourist sector benefits from this war." Asked to compare the Kurdish and Cypriot struggles, Yeoryiadhis says: "You have answered this question yourself ... [ellipsis as published] There is no struggle and this is why I insist that since we are not fighting, we must at least help those who fight for us. It may seem unlikely that the Turkish Army in Cyprus will either be blocked because of an expansion of war and Turkish domestic problems or will have to withdraw. The latter option is possibly more unlikely because the reservists can cover their needs, but the possibility that the Army will stay blocked remains. "We must see this and understand that our only way out is to respect the political factor that, on the one hand, causes Turkey's financial bankruptcy--the Turkish pound was devalued 20 percent during a stock exchange crash--and, on the other, causes a political crisis. There is no government that can make a decision on a Cyprus solution. There is no willingness and this is the most basic issue." Yeoryiadhis is then asked which countries support the Kurds and who helps them. He answers: "The Kurdish people, the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan], which was established in 1978 is based on a basic principle, the people's self-rule. It does not try to secure help from foreign countries so it does not become dependent. Foreign help causes dependence. We have the example of the Iraqi Kurds. Their continuous dependence caused the Kurdish people in Iraq to be destroyed. "Kurdish assistance mainly comes from the Kurdish people themselves, the immigrants. There are about 1.5 million Kurds in Europe alone. Kurdistan's National Liberation Front has some 300,000 active members in Europe who contribute to the Kurdish struggle. Assistance from others in the international community is not ruled out." Discussing which countries are friendly toward the Kurdish people, Yeoryiadhis remarks: "There is a significant opening in Europe. Greece is friendly toward the Kurdish struggle, as is Cyprus, Belgium, the Scandinavian countries, Austria, Italy, and Spain. Basically, the only countries that oppose the Kurds are France and Germany, which follow the Turkish policy on the Kurdish issue because of interests in Turkey." Asked how the Americans see the Kurdish struggle, Yeoryiadhis replies: "The Americans oppose Turkey's division because they consider it a factor of stability in the Middle East, a factor against Iran and Islamic fundamentalism. But, they obviously favor the creation of a political state, particularly in northern Iraq." Asked to comment on the declaration of war against the Kurds by Turkish Prime Minister Ciller, Yeoryiadhis says that such declarations are common but various Turkish officials give different dates as to when a new offensive will begin. Yeoryiadhis adds: "There is some confusion on an exact time because they try to hide the real picture and avoid world reaction. The developments, though, show the opposite. Turkey's economy is continuously being destroyed and there is a political crisis." Furthermore, Yeoryiadhis says: "It seems that Turkey will not make it [against the Kurdish uprising] to the year 2000. This year, the Kurds will strongly attack tourism in Turkey, aiming at exhausting its economic resources, mainly foreign currency, so that it will not be able to finance the war against them." Yeoryiadhis is then asked to explain why there are so many Kurds in the occupied part of Cyprus, since the Kurds are at war with the Turks. He responds: "The Turks' basic policy is to evict the Kurds from the Kurdish areas to minimize the war. They have emptied and destroyed more than 800 Kurdish villages in Kurdistan. They do the same thing with the other nationalities in Asia Minor. There have been forceful movements of people since the Ottoman Empire. There were many nationalities that simply disappeared with these movements. The same thing happened in the genocide of the Armenians. In addition to those they slaughtered, one million Kurds were moved to the Syrian desert to be destroyed. The Turks are nomadic people. They moved from Central Asia to Asia Minor and also within Asia Minor. Movement is something natural for the Turks and the Kurds. They do not react to the movement. They do not understand the characteristic of localism and are not bound to the land in the way we say, `this is my village.' Anyway, the basic problem of the Kurdish people throughout history has been the lack of national consciousness. Their ancestors were the Medians [from Media, ancient name for the mountainous area in Asia between Armenia, Assyria, Persia, Parthia, and Ukraine]. "Indeed, there are Kurdish settlers in the occupied areas of Cyprus who came after the 1974 war or fought in this war. However, many Kurds go there to find work or because of their expulsion from Kurdistan. However, this should not be used as an excuse against helping the Kurds because there are only a few settlers the Kurdish movement condemns as associates of the Turkish state. On this issue, there is a relevant statement by PKK General Secretary Abdullah Ocalan to Greek Cypriot correspondents who visited their camp in the al-Biqa' Valley in 1991. These settlers actually are fanatic Muslims, belonging to the fascist party of Alpaslam Turkes. However, these people were used for settling the occupied areas at the beginning, even before the Kurdish movement was founded in 1978. The mass settlement of Kurds was based on a plan in 1974-76. But there are also Greek-speaking Pondians in the occupied areas. This could be a positive thing, as a base for us in the occupied areas. There are also Kurdish soldiers in the occupation army because military service is obligatory. Unfortunately we do not capitalize on this."
