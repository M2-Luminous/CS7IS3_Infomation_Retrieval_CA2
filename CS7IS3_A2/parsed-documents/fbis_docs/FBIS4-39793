Europe Vice Premier Landyk for Economic Unity of CIS, E. Europe LD0906183894 Kiev Radio Ukraine World Service in Ukrainian 1500 GMT 9 Jun 94 LD0906183894 Kiev Radio Ukraine World Service Ukrainian BFN The former USSR countries and the East European states -- Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary -- should unite economically with the aim of protecting their markets. Ukraine's Deputy Premier Valentyn Landyk said this in an interview for the mass media. He pointed out that the West European markets are not waiting for Ukrainian products, but at the same time everything possible is being done by Western firms to conquer the CIS markets. In the opinion of Valentyn Landyk, Ukraine's export potential today is not as high as one would like it to be -- mainly raw materials are offered for export. Our state can sell its industrial products to Russia and other Commonwealth countries. The Ukrainian deputy prime minister emphasized that our state's accession to the CIS Economic Union with the rights of an associate member is an important move. An associate member is even in a better situation as it has more freedom and elbow room, underlined Valentyn Landyk.
