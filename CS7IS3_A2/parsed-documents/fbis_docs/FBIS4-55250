"This once again proved us right in insisting that our corridors be sufficiently deep from the strategic point of view ... to make our borders easy to defend," Karadzic said early on Wednesday during a visit to the victims of the attack in Brcko hospital. "These civilians have paid dearly for their freedom and the right to hold political meetings in their town," he added. During the attack, mounted at 7.30 p.m. local time (5.30 p.m. GMT) on Tuesday, the Bosnian Serb parliament was in session in Brcko. A statement issued by the hospital in Brcko said the attack left three people dead, including one child and one pregnant woman, and 13 others wounded. Bozo Isailovic, 61, his daughter-in-law Svetlana, 27, who was in advanced pregnancy, and her two-year daughter Bozana were killed at their home which sustained a direct hit from a tank shell. Two of the wounded are in intensive care, six with severe wounds are undergoing hospital treatment and five have been discharged after receiving medical help. Karadzic told reporters that Bosnian Serbs had always granted passage through their territory to Croat and Moslem deputies. "Otherwise, their joint parliament would be unable to hold any sessions in Sarajevo." Bosnian parliament Speaker Momcilo Krajisnik, who visited the wounded together with Karadzic, said that what had happened last night in Brcko was the crime against the Serb people and an anticivilizational act.
