The Second Session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee continued panel discussions this afternoon. Hong Kong members of the CPPCC National Committee were divided into two panels, and Qin Wenjun, as convener of the first panel, presided over the discussion of the first panel together with Xu Simin. In the panel discussion, Qin Wenjun said: During today's discussion, many members have proposed that the CPPCC should set up a branch organization in Hong Kong, and in recent years some members have kept making such a proposal. We will relay your ideas and suggestions to the senior levels and will ask them and the relevant departments to study and consider them. He said: In my opinion, it is not very suitable to establish a branch organization of the CPPCC in Hong Kong under the current conditions, and there are three main factors, which are provided for the members' reference. First, the CPPCC is a political organization in which China's CPPCC members participate in government and discuss government matters, whereas Hong Kong is still under the administration of the British Hong Kong authorities, so it is not suitable to establish such an organization in Hong Kong. Second, after 1997, the Chinese Government will practice "one country, two systems" in Hong Kong, therefore it is believed that the way such an organization will be established at that time is a problem that is being deliberated by the relevant quarters. The third point is that the Basic Law has relatively clear stipulations on the issue of establishing Hong Kong branches or offices by the organizations inside the country (including government departments and power organs). He said that therefore, judged from the current situation, it is not very convenient to set up a branch organization of the CPPCC in Hong Kong.
