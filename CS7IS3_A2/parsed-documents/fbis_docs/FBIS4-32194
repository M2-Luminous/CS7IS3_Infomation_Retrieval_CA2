He proves this with an invitation to visit Trieste that the neofascist party's councilor Sergio Giacomelli has extended to the Petrinja usurper, Boris Mikelic [prime minister of the republic fo Serbian Krajina, RSK]. The Italian Foreign Ministry rules out any possibility of Mikelic holding talks with the representatives of the Italian Government. The Italian neofascists are of the opinion that Knin has the right to self-determination and that the recognition of independence of the so-called Knin Krajina would open possibilities for the autonomy of Istria, DELO writes.
