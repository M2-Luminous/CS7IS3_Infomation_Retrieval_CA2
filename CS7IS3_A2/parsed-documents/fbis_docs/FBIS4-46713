I want to say that if we cannot halt the inertia of the old thinking, dismantle the old management structures, institute broad reforms in the agrarian sector, implement mass privatization of all means of production, and boost agriculture and put that sector's big reserves to work, we are not going to be able to avert famine, let alone consolidate the country's financial situation, to which the agrarian sector can make a major contribution. Georgia's agriculture today is in total ruins; in my opinion, this is the bitter result of launching reforms without enough preparation. There are those who think that agricultural reform involves land privatization only. Let me remind them that despite the major shortcomings that came from increasing the amount of the people's household land, more than half the cultivated farmland was turned over to the private sector--and still crops are less than they were five or ten years ago, when the private sector owned less than 15 percent of the cultivated land. The fact is that, along with land privatization, agricultural reform equally requires the establishment of market forms, the nurturing of independent entrepreneurs, the creation of a modern system of relations between them and the state, the expansion of free communications, the fostering of a new spirit of proprietorship, and, most important, protection of the peasant. Unless these market levers are adopted and put to work, it will be impossible to nurture the new-type farmer, who will remain trapped in the habits of the state farm worker or kolkhoznik. Naturally, one-sided reform (which is what is happening now, if you can even call it reform) has only served to worsen our situation. The way out of the predicament is to implement reforms rationally and to support the development primarily of private structures (i.e., entrepreneurs) and create the necessary conditions for them to operate, in order to solve the food crisis swiftly. We also need to keep in mind that while the old collectivization deflected agriculture from its normal path of development, indiscriminate privatization today will end up making the same mistake. I don't share the widespread notion that Georgia is a country that is poor in agricultural resources. If we use our land and resources wisely, they can feed the country and even enable us to help others. How can we speak of making productive use of our land when we have never managed to have a hectare produce an average of more than 26 quintals of grain, 60 quintals of fruit, 130 quintals of potatoes, and so on. Yet with progressive forms of management our fertile land could easily produce 40 to 50 quintals of grain, 150 to 200 quintals of fruit, 250 to 300 quintals of potatoes, and so on. To confirm this, just remember the abundant and bountiful lives of our German colonists before the war. Again, future generations are not going to think we acted wisely when we frittered away the assets of the kolkhozes and state farms at the behest and under the leadership of those pathetic representatives of the national movement. It was their stupid doctrines and actions that resulted in the looting of agriculture equipment, vehicles, livestock, crops and produce, monetary resources, and the wealth built up by the rural population's joint efforts. The people who created this monstrosity are basically those who have done nothing to create social wealth and only care about getting rich without working. We have to face the truth and admit that the old structures of agricultural proprietorship have been destroyed, and those who destroyed them have created nothing new; destruction and construction are different things. Not only that, we do not yet even have in place the legal base necessary to design the strategy and tactics to convert agriculture to the market economy. Well, why don't we? It wouldn't have required capital investment for fuel and lubricants, would it? You have to agree that one reason why we don't have proprietary farmers (of either the old or the new type) is that agricultural productivity has dropped drastically. How are we going to produce anything if we have given land to the rural population in an unsystematic manner and nobody has even thought to create the essential conditions for the use of the land that feeds us? The results are there for all to see! Over the past two years, many thousands of hectares have remained uncultivated, and, sad to say, it looks as if things will get no better this year. I simply don't understand why no land tax system has been worked out yet, and the state has been losing large amounts of revenues for three years--quite apart from its role as an incentive to encourage the owner of the land to produce goods. How can we excuse the fact that, on the pretext of privatization, we have divided up large tracts that would have provided excellent conditions for the use of mechanization? Also, the small plots have been given out in many places, creating chaos. Hundreds of hectares of farmland have been stolen; in many places, even the rayon authorities don't know whose hands they are in. How can we excuse the fact that local agricultural agencies, farm managers, and farm specialists have been left out of land privatization policy? These and many other violations have brought us to our present predicament, and if we don't realize the danger today, tomorrow it will be too late. In order to get out of this grave situation, it is essential to put a stop to methods of land privatization which have a bad odor because of the incompetent intervention by certain dilettantes in agricultural matters, especially considering that it is taking place under conditions of complete chaos and dereliction by the authorities. As for instituting taxes this year on lands distributed to the population, an intermediate way has to be found which will maximally enhance every citizen's responsibility and will frankly recognize all of the land area actually in his possession, in order to avoid expectable difficulties which, very likely, the law ought to take into account. The way to do this, I think, is to formalize citizens' possession of their land by way of declaration and levy taxes on that basis. I believe that this move will do much to promote abundant agricultural production. At the same time, the Georgian Parliament must speed up the creation of the legal base for comprehensive agricultural reform, and the executive branch will have to see that it is properly implemented. Laws passed by the Parliament must be used to check on the legality of the lands that have been already been issued, in order to rectify violations. It is painful to see the present government's failure to take care of the land, which is costing our people dearly. It is criminal how hasty privatization of the land has resulted in mass giveaways and fragmentation of the land, the uprooting of orchards and vineyards, neglect and deterioration of croplands, missed opportunities to set up individual-proprietor farms, conflicts between individuals and villages, and many other misfortunes which have done great harm to the state. The people want to know who the main culprits are and whether they are being called to account. Another essential condition is to reorganize the kolkhozes and state farms in such a way that formations of independent entrepreneurs take shape based in them in accordance with market relations, formations which are the owners and proprietors of their means of production and the goods they produce. Each farm, village, district, resident, and individual must find a place and role in a reformed agriculture; the confusion, misunderstanding, and mistrust that have ravaged the countryside for the past three or four years must come to an end. Land areas which remain after privatization but which are not large enough for collective farm management must be transferred immediately to the population on the basis of mutually acceptable agreements and obligations. Large tracts, moreover, must not be broken up into smaller ones, and we must strictly comply with principles of land use and compactness. Instead, because of slipshod privatization measures, disreputable and incompetent people have largely taken over the privatization commissions. Their criminal actions have promoted giveaways, and much of the land has wound up in the hands of people who don't care about farming and are just waiting for a chance to sell it off and get rich. The Cabinet of Ministers has done wrong to pass decrees by which local commissions have been given unrestricted rights to allot land to the population, and the government can't interfere (or at least isn't interfering) even when the commissions' decisions are clearly in conflict with governmental decrees and the interests of the country. What is essential, then, is to re-inventory the land, not only with the participation of the village commissions, which will definitely have to be reconstituted, but also by representatives of state agencies. Their figures alone must be used in continuing privatization and rectifying mistakes. We must register every square meter of land with the state. The government has to know who owns the land and pays the taxes. As far as possible we must provide production services for farm entrepreneurs, especially in the case of household peasant and individual farm operations, which have been left on their own--yet it is they who are best able to produce a fast return. Because of the fact that the managers of kolkhozes and state farms (in most places) have, on purpose or not, ended up distant from agricultural reform, they are no longer providing any help in working the land that has been given to the rural population. In places where social-sector farms no longer exist, their tractors, motor vehicles, farm equipment and other assets have been sold off wholesale, written off, or stolen. A wise proprietor would have created formations to service household farm operations, on a cost accounting basis, to do farm work for the population for an appropriate fee. Hence, conditions today demand that we create a system to provide services to household farm operations using locally existing farm equipment. Where kolkhozes and state farms still exist, they should take over this duty; where they no longer exist, we should create specialized links to provide the services, for which we should bring together the equipment that has been sold off through various machinations. That's just for now; in the future, it will not be sufficient, and we must immediately undertake to create a broad network of state, commercial, and private sectors to service farm entrepreneurs. It should be in charge not only of tractor operations but also the whole cycle of production services. This will free the entrepreneur from all kinds of extraneous worries so that he can devote his energy to boosting production. Let me say at this point that instead of helping, the finance and credit system (which, we can say confidently, no longer exists now) forced many to give up on commercial farming and to take up occupations that are easier. It's true we are hard-up ourselves, but if we are to improve things we must find ways and means to give farmers a break. During parliamentary discussions of this question I have been surprised by some of my colleagues' opposition to credit for agriculture, although I fully share their doubts over the proper use of allocated funds, of which there are plenty of bad examples. We think agriculture needs to be granted immediate preferential credit in the necessary amounts; in turn, the government and the Agriculture Ministry must work out specific mechanisms to ensure proper use of the credit. We must immediately implement privatization in livestock farming, because the chaos which we have created is doing irreparable harm to this sector, and one of the best ways to get out of this predicament, I think, is through well organized privatization. Buildings and structures, livestock, tools and equipment, and feed croplands also need to be privatized. It should, moreover, be on the basis of competition. I really don't understand why it's taking so long to privatize livestock farming. Privatization will give each livestock operation a true proprietor and put a stop to thievery. Why are we dragging our feet? Can it be that certain people will not benefit from stability, law, and order in the sector? Another thing is that we have been harmed greatly by the mass blackmailing of professional, experienced and competent workers in agriculture in the past three or four years. A lot of worthy and highly qualified specialists have quit the field as a result. All of you know who took their places and what that has cost the people.... The time is late, of course, but we must help the countryside by turning things over to worthy people who understand reform and know how to implement it. The people will certainly trust and follow them. At the same time, the one to be considered the winner in the competition should not be the one who pays the most but rather the citizen or group that submits the best program for the operation of the livestock farm or complex in terms of its rated capacity and pledges to implement that program meticulously. I would not only support the sale but even the free transfer of all the above assets under that procedure. To illustrate the importance of the village leader I will cite one example: on Gorskiy Rayon's Kintsnisi State Farm, which has been under the leadership of Batoni Mikheil Koblianidze for a long time, not a single farm window was smashed during the events in Samachablo (the farm is located near Tskhinvali). The tractor fleet and farm equipment there have been preserved intact, whereas in many other places which were relatively calm, everything has been wrecked. Even sadder is the fact that many farms have been looted with at least the connivance if not the actual participation of village leaders. But for some reason, enforcement of the law, which would inspire hope and trust in the working people of the village, has been delayed or dragged out. I spoke out more specifically on all the above recently in Parliament, but unfortunately no one showed much interest in these problems. I, on the other hand, feel these things very deeply. I feel the pain of the countryside, because my own family lives in a typical Georgian village and has never abandoned the land. My family is still considered an ordinary village proprietor. Last year, we had per-hectare yields of more than 100 quintals of corn, 150 quintals of fruit, 700 quintals of beets, 500 quintals of vegetables, and so on. Let me say in conclusion that we seem to have forgotten the countryside while playing at democracy, and we've been reaping what we deserve. This reproach probably applies equally to all levels of government in the past five years, and to today's Parliament as well, which has failed to create the necessary legal base for agriculture reform. It also applies to the Cabinet of Ministers, which has failed to protect village proprietors; it applies to local authorities, who have turned their backs on the plight of the peasant; and it applies to us, together and singly, because we have done nothing effective to preserve and enhance this vital sector. Given its predicament, the countryside has turned its back on us; today it is powerless, it cannot feed the country or contribute anything to the state budget. Yet it could fill half the budget. If we want to have our daily bread in abundance we will have to come to the aid of the countryside and support it. This is the only way to achieve bountiful agricultural production.
