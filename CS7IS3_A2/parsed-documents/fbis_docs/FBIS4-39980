"After the situation stabilizes, after regions give their full support, it will be possible to take more resolute and tough steps," he said. He pointed out that the course of resolving problems by the president's decrees will be continued. In reply to a question asked by ITAR-TASS, Filatov pointed out that he is a delegate of the congress and was one of the party's organisers at the first stage of its creation. But it's too early to speak about membership in the party yet, since practically, it has not yet been created, he said. According to Filatov, the president did not express his attitude to the newly created party on the eve of its founding congress.
