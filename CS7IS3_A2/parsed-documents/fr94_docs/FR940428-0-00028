FR940428-0-00028 FR940428-0-00011 33 CFR Part 167 [CGD 90&hyph;039] RIN 2115&hyph;AD43 Traffic Separation Scheme; In The Approaches to Chesapeake Bay AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard amends the traffic separation scheme (TSS) in the Approaches to Chesapeake Bay by realigning and reconfiguring the Southern Approach to incorporate a deep-water (DW) route. The Coast Guard suspended the Southern approach lanes on October 15, 1988, because the water depth was too shallow to accommodate the deeper draft vessels which were able to call on the port after completion of a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) channel deepening project in Hampton Roads. The realigned and reconfigured Southern Approach utilizes naturally occurring deeper water and incorporates the proposed Atlantic Ocean Channel, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers navigation improvement project. EFFECTIVE DATES: May 31, 1994. ADDRESSES: Unless otherwise indicated, documents referred to in this preamble are available for inspection or copying at the office of the Executive Secretary, Marine Safety Council (G&hyph;LRA/3406), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW., room 3406, Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001 between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Drafting Information The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Margie G. Hegy, Project Manager, John R. Walters, Project Officer, Fifth Coast Guard District Portsmouth, VA, and Helen G. Boutrous, Project Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel. Regulatory History On September 6, 1990, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled ``Traffic Separation Scheme; In the Approaches to Chesapeake Bay'' in the Federal Register (55 FR 36666). The Coast Guard received six letters commenting on the proposal. A public hearing was not requested and one was not held. Background and Purpose The Ports and Waterways Safety Act (PWSA), 33 U.S.C. 1223 authorizes the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating to establish TSSs and shipping safety fairways, where necessary, to provide safe access routes for vessels proceeding to or from United States ports. A TSS is an internationally recognized routing measure that minimizes the risk of collision by separating vessels into opposing streams of traffic through the establishment of traffic lanes. To be internationally recognized, a TSS must be approved by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). IMO approves a TSS only if the proposed routing system complies with IMO principles and guidelines on ships' routing. Vessel use of a TSS is voluntary; however, vessels operating in or near an IMO approved TSS are subject to Rule 10 of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS), 33 U.S.C. foll. 1602. The TSS in the Approaches to Chesapeake Bay was established on December 1, 1969, and was adopted by IMO on October 12, 1971. In consists of three parts: Part I, Precautionary Area; Part II, Eastern Approach; and Part III, Southern Approach.
