Klaus says that the Czech side is neither an organizer nor an initiator of the Prague talks between President Clinton and political representatives of the four countries of Central Europe. The Czech side is merely happy to accept the U.S. initiative and welcomes the fact that these important talks will take place in Prague. At the same time, Vaclav Klaus sees no reason for the failure of these talks. As he went on to say, the offer for him to deliver the joint viewpoint of the four countries mentioned by President Walesa was not made to Vaclav Klaus, and that is why he could not reject it. I would be a very bad Czech politician, the prime minister continues, if I did not put Czech interests above the joint aims of the countries of the Visegrad Group. President Walesa is right about that. But I believe that he does not do that sort of thing. [as heard] The joint interests of the Visegrad Group countries are the highest common denominator of the interests of the individual countries, nothing more and nothing less. We would only make a mistake if we incorrectly interpreted our own long-term interests, Vaclav Klaus stresses in his viewpoint on Lech Walesa's LIDOVE NOVINY allegations. President Vaclav Havel will not make any statement on the interview granted by Polish President Lech Walesa to LIDOVE NOVINY.
