Work has to be done in several sectors to achieve this end. -- The primary market where the transfer of land is possible has to be put under proper administration. The amount of land supply, location and purpose have to strictly observe the planning. The purpose and nature concerning the use of land have to be clearly defined. The practice of administrative allocation of land has to be reduced to the minimum while the transfer of land with payment has to be employed. -- The transfer and management of land has to be strengthened. Before enforcement of the "Real estate law" the ministry will make known as soon as possible regulations on land transfer, sales of commodity housing and the transacting of real estate. They cover rules and procedures for real estate trading as well as punishment for violation of the regulations. -- The taxation system for real estate has to be improved with the interests of and rights enjoyed by the parties concerned taken into consideration. -- The market function has to be strengthened and intermediary service has to be exploited to cover information, consultation, assessment and the role of agent. Professional workers in these sectors have to be trained. Requirements will have to be set for entry into this profession. The state will soon promulgate regulations on the evaluation and registration of real estate. -- A price system for real estate has to be set up and principles for prices for commodity housing, welfare housing and standard housing have to be confirmed. Land price and corresponding taxation policy have also to be formulated. -- Administration of foreign investment in real estate has to be strengthened. Foreign capital is allowed to be involved in general residential housing, a great potential market featuring a relatively short period for the input of investment. International practice has to be employed in the administration of foreign investment in real estate. -- The government must not apply excessive intervention in the real estate sector. Land prices have been decided not by the market but by the government in the past and the blind establishment of development zones is attributed to such practice. Administrative functions and standardization by the government has to be properly handled. -- The "Real estate law" has to be made public and brought into force as soon as possible. Loss of control of real estate last year was mainly due to the weak legal system. The law drafted by the ministry has been submitted to the State Council for appraisal and approval and it is expected that the law will come into force shortly.
