However, in Milan, your men, Roberto Maroni, [League lower house floor leader] and Speroni, are meeting with [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi. Which of the two is the real negotiating table? The Roman or the Milanese one? [Bossi] Everything is useful. I do my share. The League wants to understand and assess the maturity of the various political forces. We are living through an emergency situation which is dangerous for democracy. [Passalacqua] What do you mean by dangerous? [Bossi] Do you realize that the winner may be a nonexistent political force, Forza Italia -- an invented force -- and, moreover, that the winner may be a single man, Berlusconi? We do not want to be polemical, but we must be intellectually honest. Democracy is in danger, we had never before faced this kind of situation. Moreover, where can we go from here? [Passalacqua] If, however, the League is forced to form a government with Berlusconi, will such a decision make sense? [Bossi] Of course, in order to save democracy. [Passalacqua] How is this? First you form an alliance, then you attack him. It is not very clear. [Bossi] You see, people are asking us to be both the hangman and the victim. [Passalacqua] How do you mean? [Bossi] I could form a government with "Napoleon" [Berlusconi nickname] and then, since my hands would be tied, I would have to bash him with my head. I would have to do so every five minutes. I would have to act as democracy's custodian. In such a case, the League would be democracy's guarantor for the country. [Passalacqua] If Berlusconi is Napoleon, who are you? [Bossi] I am general Kuznetzov. He is Napoleon, but Kuznetzov won. [Passalacqua] However, the Knight [Berlusconi nickname] is granting you federalism, which is your main objective. [Bossi] It is not mentioned even once in his platform. I think that he does not even know what federalism means. It is not enough to say "yes." I will continue to highlight the Left's responsibility in this respect. It was Achille Occhetto [secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left, PDS] who legitimized him on television -- anything to defeat the League. [Passalacqua] Many believe that you are saying all this in order to get a higher price. [Bossi] It would be simpler for us not to have any ties -- very little would be enough. [Passalacqua] Meaning? [Bossi] It is apparent from everything I have said that the League is the only political force that can guarantee democracy, the only political force that can hem in Berlusconi, that can stop him, that can block the technocratic machinery set up by Berlusconi. [Passalacqua] In short, are you the only person who can do all this? [Bossi] The Left preferred to serve as a rival attraction to Forza Italia, it preferred to attack the League in the election campaign, without thinking of the consequences. [Passalacqua] However, you have set up two negotiating tables, one in Milan and another, as of Wednesday, in Rome. Why is this? [Bossi] I am in favor of a broad constituent government, as broad as possible. [Passalacqua] What does as broad as possible mean? [Bossi] It means as broad as possible. I think I am speaking clearly enough. I want to understand. I want to see who will agree to this. I need to muster quite a lot of support in parliament. The question is to start from the platforms, rather than from "I won, I lost." [Passalacqua] But are you still insisting on the prerequisite that President Scalfaro entrusts you with the exploratory task? [Bossi] I believe so. I think that the League is the first party in the Chamber of Deputies. [Passalacqua] The president of the republic said that, in a democratic system, you must know how to talk things over. [Bossi] Scalfaro must entrust us with this task for two reasons: a formal one, and an essential one. We are the first party, and people have voted for us as the guarantors and custodians of the Constitution. Berlusconi won, OK, but we know that behind him, the winners are Craxi and Andreotti. The other, formal, reason, is that we have the greatest number of deputies in the lower house. [Passalacqua] What happens if Scalfaro does not entrust you with this task? [Bossi] What can I do? You must make people understand what is happening. Each is staking his own credibility before his conscience. [Passalacqua] Deputy Bossi, during the election campaign you repeatedly put forward two slogans, two conditions, at every rally: the first was "no" to Berlusconi as prime minister, the second was "no" to the MSI [Italian Social Movement] in government. [Bossi] These are still our prerequisites. They remain intact. The problem can once again be posed in terms of federalism. We have seen the MSI opposing the regional governments in parliament. What sort of federalism do you think they could possibly favor? And Berlusconi -- are you aware of what he stands for? I believe the real prerequisite is not to give a mandate to anybody who represents all this. [Passalacqua] In other words? [Bossi] People have not understood the situation properly. For example, the Mammi law [on broadcasting] must be redrafted, we must clarify matters in this field. [Passalacqua] You are saying that Forza Italia does not share a "common outlook" with the League. Berlusconi for his part is taking you to task, he is threatening you with the possibility of a split. [Bossi] In this respect, Berlusconi is mistaken. Let him grasp this: We have no allies. Let him grasp this: We reached an agreement with him only to knock him down. [Passalacqua] Berlusconi is saying that you are rehashing the Cencelli manual [power-sharing system]. [Bossi] What right does this guy have to say anything, seeing that he is only interested in sharing power. He, of all people, who proposed a new twenty years [of fascist rule] when I spoke to him? [Passalacqua] You claim the League played a decisive role in destroying the old system. Today Berlusconi is saying the opposite. Who is right? [Bossi] What can I say -- these guys are just a recycled bunch. [Passalacqua] In short, what is your opinion of Forza Italia? [Bossi] Forza Italia does not share our outlook. It was born over a period of two years. Contrary to what is being said, it was a longstanding project. It then found its men within a period of 15 days, but there is nothing behind it. Forza Italia is not even a tool in anyone's hands. We should be calling Occhetto to account, given that he launched Forza Italia on TV together with [MSI Secretary] Gianfranco Fini. A nonexistent party was less frightening than a party like the League, that had shattered the establishment. [Passalacqua] So, Occhetto is to blame? [Bossi] They turned a blind eye. They sniggered, "Ha, ha," now we will pull a fast one on the League, we will now share its votes. [Passalacqua] And now? [Bossi] They are now confronting an uncontrollable phenomenon -- something dangerous enough, at times, to cause serious concern. [Passalacqua] Serious concern? [Bossi] Anybody controlling TV changes the normal course of events. [Passalacqua] Meaning? [Bossi] The risk is that this may become a technocratic mechanism capable of interfering with the normal course of democracy. [Passalacqua] But could you govern together? [Bossi] I do not know whether anybody can govern with that bunch. What people are asking the League today is not to give in as far as federalism is concerned. [Passalacqua] You insist on a federal constitution, something which at least on paper, both Berlusconi and Fini are prepared to grant you. However, what will this constitution retain from the past? Many on the Left are demanding that the Resistance should not be disowned. For years you have been repeating that the League is anti-fascist. What have you got to say now? [Bossi] I am saying that, as a continuation and at the same time as an overcoming of the constitution which was born by the people's struggle against the fascist dictatorship, what we need today against the partyocratic dictatorship is a federalist constitution. [Passalacqua] As a continuation? [Bossi] As a continuation.
