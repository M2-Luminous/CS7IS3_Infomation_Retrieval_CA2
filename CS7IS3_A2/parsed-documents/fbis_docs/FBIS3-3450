"Chinese-Filipinos have help build this country -- with their blood, their toil, their resources, and their enterprise," the president said during his speech at the 40th anniversary celebration of the Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FCCCI), an umbrella organization of Filipino-Chinese corporations. Ramos cited what the FCCCI have done in improving education infrastructure, reducing impact of natural and man-made calamities and providing free medical aid to poor residents. "I must also acknowledge your contributions to help improve peace and order, especially in Metro Manila," he added. Ramos pointed out that the FCCCI have made contributions to peace and order in the country by donating police patrol cars and other equipments to the police and stabilizing prices of basic goods through its influence on businessmen during abnormal times. "Your most important contribution, however, has been to help develop our economy and generate jobs," the president stressed. Despite accounting for only one percent of the country's 65 million population, he said, "Chinese-Filipino companies generate a full third of the sales of all domestically owned firms." The president also reiterated his government's efforts to level the playing field of business competition for all businessmen, including Filipino-Chinese. While praising the FCCCI's "sterling service" to the country during the past 40 years, Ramos urged the federation to play "a lead role in moving our nation towards our shared vision of 'Philippines 2000'." The president has issued a proclamation declaring March 23 to 29 of every year as the "Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry Week." "It is but fitting that it should be given a period within which to focus public attention to the role being played by the federation in national development," Ramos said in his proclamation.
