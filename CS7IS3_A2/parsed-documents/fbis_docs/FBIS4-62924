He believes that, in his words, his least successful day was when he was "stabbed in the back," i.e. when the Ukrainian president appointed his representative to Crimea. If Leonid Kravchuk does listen to opposition and introduce presidential rule after all, in Yuriy Meshkov's view, he will violate the constitution and laws of Ukraine, "Which violations have become a tradition for the current leadership of Ukraine." Relations between official Kiev and official Simferopol, the Crimean president said, must be different from what they have been up until recently. "Yukhym Zvyahilskyy's visit has changed the climate of these mutual relations and confirmed that the influence of the forces of reason in Ukraine is quite strong, and it is they who will determine the state's domestic and foreign policy."
