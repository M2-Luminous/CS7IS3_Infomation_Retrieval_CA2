"We now have firm control of our army and we can guarantee the safety of foreigners in our republic, but in the event of an attack elements of chaos would emerge and I am not sure that any foreigners in Bosnia-Herzegovina would be safe -- not because we would issue such orders, but because the people would treat foreigners as enemies, which they really would be, in a way," Karadzic said. Speaking about the letter sent to NATO by UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, Karadzic said that such a reaction in fact encouraged the Muslims to reapply the same war methodology, for -- as he put it -- this was not the first massacre, and it was established that some had been committed by the Muslims themselves [sentence as received]. Karadzic said that the Serbs completely understand the emotional side of this tragedy, which they have condemned in the most vehement terms. "We demand a rigorous investigation to identify the perpetrators of the crime -- once that has been done the international community will not have to grope in the dark. This is why this case should be investigated in great detail, not only from the ballistic, but also from the forensic aspect for there are some indications that this was another case of a stage-managed event," President Karadzic said.
