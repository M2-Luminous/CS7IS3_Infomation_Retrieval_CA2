FR940216-0-00010 FR940216-0-00006 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Bureau of Land Management 43 CFR Part 4700 [WO&hyph;200&hyph;4370&hyph;02&hyph;24 1A; Circular No. 2631] RIN 1004&hyph;AB81 Protection, Management, and Control of Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros; Prohibited Acts, Administrative Remedies, and Penalties; Administrative Remedies AGENCY: Bureau of Land Management, Interior. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule allows the authorized officer to place in full force and effect decisions to cancel a Private Maintenance and Care Agreement to allow immediate repossession of animals found to be subject to abuse or neglect. This final rule also makes technical amendments to regulatory text relating to the use of full force and effect decisions pertaining to the removal of wild horses and burros. EFFECTIVE DATE: February 16, 1994. ADDRESSES: Inquiries or suggestions should be sent to: Director (200), Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Department of the Interior, 1849 C St. NW., Washington, DC 20240. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Vernon R. Schulze, Division of Wild Horses and Burros, Bureau of Land Management (NV&hyph;960), Wild Horse and Burro National Program Office, (702) 785&hyph;6583. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This rule was published on an interim final basis on January 9, 1991 (56 FR 876), effective on that date, to allow immediate repossession of adopted wild free-roaming horses and burros and cancellation of Private Maintenance and Care Agreements (PMACAs) in cases where abuse or neglect are found to endanger the life or health of adopted animals. Horses and burros for which title has been passed to private individuals do not qualify as ``wild free-roaming horses and burros'' pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 1333, and, therefore, will not be affected by this rule. The interim final rule allowed 60 days for public comment. One public comment was received. This comment supported the interim final rule. Accordingly, the interim final rule is now adopted and published in final form. The wording of the interim final rule has been modified somewhat to ensure consistency with the Departmentwide full force and effect rule located at 43 CFR 4.21, which was issued in final form on January 19, 1993, after the publication of the interim final wild horse and burro rule. These technical amendments are needed to make 43 CFR part 4700 consistent with the Departmentwide full force and effect rule. The rule does not in any way limit the right of appeal of persons whose PMACAs are revoked, and allows such persons to petition for a stay of such decisions. It merely allows animals to be repossessed for their protection until issues raised on appeal can be considered. Technical amendments to paragraph (c) of ยง4770.3 are also being made in this final rule to reflect the amendment of the Departmentwide full force and effect rule. Paragraph (c) was added to ยง4770.3 on July 6, 1992, to allow the authorized officer to place wild horse and burro removal decisions in full force and effect. The technical amendments to paragraph (c) are being made in this final rule to provide consistent wording within ยง4770.3, and to make the provisions of ยง4770.3 consistent with the procedural requirements of 43 CFR 4.21. The amendments will not affect the way in which the substance of paragraph (c) is implemented. Paragraph (c) of this section was not included in the interim final rule published January 9, 1991. The principal author of this final rule is Vernon R. Schulze, Wild Horse and Burro Program Specialist, assisted by the staff of the Division of Legislation and Regulatory Management, BLM Washington Office. It has been determined that this rule does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment and that no detailed statement pursuant to Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) is required. This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The Department of the Interior has determined under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ) that this rule will not have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Additionally, as required by Executive Order 12630, the Department has determined that the rule would not cause a taking of private property. This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.
