"The Chisinau authorities, which work hard to ruin our national prospect on this territory, would like someone to pay for their debts. They take advantage of Turkey's interests in this segment of the East European political space. At the same time, Turkey's intentions to use in its interests the situation, which was created by the process of creating the second Romanian state, are more than obvious. Turkey at last will set a strong control over this area." The strongest move the Turkish president has made in this political chess game is the use of the Gagauz problem, says the newspaper, adding that Suleyman Demirel considers Gagauzians "the representatives of a distinct branch of Turkish peoples," which "were the first to settle on this land." Thus, declaring that "Gagauzians will respect the territorial integrity of Moldova and welcoming the elaboration of the special juridical status for the southern Moldova, Suleyman Demirel is contributing to the annihilation of separatism, requesting in his turn the official recognition of Gagauzians as a native people of Bessarabia." Referring to the policy promoted by the present leadership, considered by the FPCD antinational, the article concludes: "Today this territory is mined with controversial geopolitical interests. We can soon live the frightening forecast of Mrs. Catherine Lalumiere, ex-secretary of the Council of Europe, who declared that Bessarabia, belonging a little to Russia, a little to the Ukraine and a little to Turkey, could be an area of interference of spheres of influence of these three states."
