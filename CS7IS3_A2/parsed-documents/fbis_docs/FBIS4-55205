Therefore, what I am writing now is only valid if the quick summaries presented to us on Sunday evening at least slightly reflect the future official results. Thus, let us stay in the realm of supposition -- namely that the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] has achieved a landslide victory. Starting from this premise, and also avoiding any special pathetic formulation, let me say quite dryly that we cannot find an independently chosen step backward of similar proportions in Hungarian history. By electing the MSZP, the Hungarian population has proven that they do not deserve freedom. They do not know what to do with it; or if they do, this is the result. The coalition has not brought a Canaan to Hungary in four years and, therefore, it fell due to something that it often mentioned as inevitable -- namely that the first steps of restructuring will be a burden to everyone. Our society did not understand that dealing with the debt inherited from those who are now delighted in mischief was not an empty slogan, that it is impossible to extricate the country in one or two years from 40 years of mud, and that the long debates in Parliament, which everyone was fed up with in the end, are natural things in a democracy and not something that proves the inadequacy of the legislators. No: Hungary's citizens turned away from genuine politics and gave up the luxury of thinking, and they voted in a way in which it appeared to them in some of their sober moments, namely that things were better then. The MSZP deserves to celebrate. Their deputies not only return but are brought back on the shoulders of the dissatisfied masses. We do not need Europe, and we spit on 1956; if one is a former policeman, so be it. Hungary voluntarily returned to the feet of its former masters. This gesture shows an immeasurable moral distortion: From its own will, our society absolved the socialists from their moral burden of destroying this country. There are responsible people and victims of this act. And there are people who are both responsible and victims: the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]. The MDF is a victim because it was unable to get closer to the society in four years; it is also a victim because the dream of Western European integration and NATO membership proved to be at an unattainable distance; the MDF is a victim because the coalition engaged in politics on a moral basis and failed; it is a victim because it counted on the people's common sense and, disregarding the mass media, it tried to influence the people in a weak election campaign. I do not want to write all this in detail again, although I should do so because the MDF is also responsible for all of this. The overwhelming majority of deputies in Hungary's second freely elected Parliament will be communists. One does not yet know much about the strategy of the old-new masters, but one can presume that they will maintain the playful formalities of democracy. For example, there will be other parties there: an MDF that will succumb to the defeat and rapidly disintegrate from within; the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], a party forced to continue on a wild goose chase for another four years, at least; the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP], a party unable to break out of mediocrity; the Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP], a party that so often used the anti-communist rhetoric, with which it discredited both this rhetoric and itself; and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], a party that, well, always falls on its feet. There will also be a free press: It will not be able to cause half as much damage as it has already caused. In view of the statements made in the last four years, there will be no unemployment, price increases, strikes, inflation, privatization, national minorities living beyond our borders; and the Hungarian soccer will flourish again. This is only natural; this is why we reelected them. Three out of the four Visegrad countries have collapsed. The Czech Republic no longer has an opponent in the race to catch up with Europe. It is true that capital -- or, using the old-new terminology, the robbing imperialist capital -- will continue to trickle for a while, then it will stop. We will then take up loans -- some 22 billion, for example. And before the House collapses on our heads, we will again hand over the government helm and the bills to others; there will always be honest and romantic people. Then we will again be able to relax for four years while they play democracy. What problems could we have? In its often-mentioned former electoral slogan, the MDF promised a thorough cleanup. This has failed to materialize ever since. We will get it now for sure.
