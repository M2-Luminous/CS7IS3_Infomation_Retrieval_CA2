Kooijmans during his visit in Indonesia gained the impression that much progress has been made in the country's political development, particularly where political openness is concerned, an Indonesian human rights official said. Marzuki Darusman, member of the National Commission on Human Rights, said Kooijmans spoke about Indonesia's political development at an informal meeting with representatives of a number of Indonesian non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Jakarta Thursday. "There has been a wind of change in Indonesia which could be clearly observed. It is certainly a good sign for the country's future," Darusman quoted Kooijmans as saying. According to Kooijmans a change for the better was noticeable in the country's political atmosphere compared to the time when he visited Indonesia a few years ago as a representative of the UN secretary general, Darusman said. Kooijmans arrived in Jakarta on Monday as a member of Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers' party for a four-day state visit. Lubbers had meanwhile suddenly cut short his visit by one day and left Jakarta on Wednesday. Referring to Lubbers' shortened visit, Kooijmans said at the meeting with the Indonesian NGOs, the Dutch prime minister had to return home sooner than planned because of an emergency stemming from a conflict in the Dutch Parliament. Kooijmans expressed the hope Indonesian NGOs would be able to see to it that the wind of change in Indonesia's political life would benefit the efforts to create better human rights conditions, Darusman said. The Dutch minister had concluded there was more political openness in Indonesia among other things from the "more democratic" way in which the Indonesian press was reporting events, according to Darusman.
