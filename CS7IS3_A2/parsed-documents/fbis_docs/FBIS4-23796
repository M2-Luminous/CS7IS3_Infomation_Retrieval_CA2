FBIS4-23796 "drafr116_a_94010" FBIS-AFR-94-116 Daily Report 15 Jun 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda RPF Comments on Killings in Border Refugee Camps RPF Comments on Killings in Border Refugee Camps EA1506171594 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura in English to Rwanda 1100 GMT 15 Jun 94 EA1506171594 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura English BFN [Text] Government backed militias, Interahamwe, have extended their killings to neighboring countries. The militias, apart from the killings within Rwanda, are now also killing people in refugee camps, mainly in Tanzania and Burundi. The militias have organized gangs with code names and use whistles as their signals when carrying out their murderous plans. Before the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] took up control of areas bordering Tanzania, the militias killed thousands of people, mainly the Tutsi and some Hutu in the opposition. Those who managed to escape these killings took refuge in Tanzania, making the first batch of refugees going to Tanzania since the war resumed in the month of April. When the RPF forces advanced and took over the areas of Kibungo, the militias also took to their heels, and sought refuge in Tanzania as the second batch of refugees. Thousands of pangas [machetes] that were used for killing were abandoned by the militias at Rusumo on the Rwandan side. The militias came to live in the same refugee camps with people who ran away from their acts of murder. Known militias, like Gatete, the former leader of Commune Murambi, and Mpambara, of Commune Rukara, who fled after untold mass killings in churches, are among the people who went to the refugee camps in Tanzania, and the Tanzanian authorities know very well that these militias are in their country. The Tanzanian Government should be able to give security to the refugees and stop the killings done by militias in the refugee camps. Militias have killed people in the refugee camps at Ngara, but surprisingly the district commissioner of Ngara, Brigadier Alexander (Henedi) refuses to accept this. The UNHCR should do everything possible to save these people whose lives are threatened in countries of asylum. Occasionally, the refugees in Tanzania have been stopped by local authorities there, to go back to their country. Some have had to pay bribes and others robbed, so as to be allowed to cross the borders to return home. It is a right of every person who seeks asylum in another country to go back to his own country the moment he feels that his life is no longer threatened. The Tanzanian authorities therefore and the UNHCR should facilitate people who want to go back to their country, instead of leaving them to be killed by the very people they ran away from. The killing of the Tutsi in refugee camps in neighboring countries is a plan by the Hutu exteremists who through their radio RTLM [Radio-Television Libre Des Milles Collines] call for the extermination of the Tutsi and Hima [Tutsi clan] people in the region. The authorities in refugee camps in Tanzania and Burundi should crack down on these gangs of militias, apprehend them, and bring to justice the criminals.
