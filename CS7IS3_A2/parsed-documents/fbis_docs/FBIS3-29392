Deputy Foreign Minister Hiroshi Fukuda and Russian Vice Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov are scheduled to meet in Moscow Monday and Tuesday to discuss both nations' claims to a handful of Russian-held islands off the eastern tip of Hokkaido. It will be the first working-level session to be held since last September's visit to Tokyo by Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Fukuda and other Japanese negotiators are expected to propose expanding visits to Japan by the residents of the disputed islands and to let citizens of both countries know about a jointly-edited collection of historical materials regarding the territorial dispute, the sources said. If the talks progress, Hata will probably visit Moscow on March 19-21, the sources said. Tokyo will also be watching to see what influence Russian conservatives and rightists, who are opposed to the reversion of the islands to Japan and who did well in last December's parliamentary elections, have on the territorial discussion. Both sides are also expected to exchange views on bilateral trade, North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development program, and strife in the Balkans, the sources said. Tokyo claims Kunashiri, Etorofu, Shikotan and the Habomai group, which were overrun by the army of the former Soviet Union at the end of World War II.
