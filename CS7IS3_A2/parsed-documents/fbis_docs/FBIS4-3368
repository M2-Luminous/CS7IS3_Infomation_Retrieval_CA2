During the meeting, provincial party committee Secretary Pu Chaozhu once again emphasized the importance of in-depth reform in rural areas at and below the county level. Vice Governor Huang Bingsheng delivered the concluding speech. Pu Chaozhu said: To deepen the reform in rural areas at and below the county level, we first need to properly adjust the ownership structure. The reality in Yunnan is that the province has an underdeveloped economy and a simple ownership structure both of which are unfavorable to development of the productive forces. Pu Chaozhu stressed that it is necessary to start the adjustment of the ownership structure from the following aspects: First, it is necessary to transform small state-owned enterprises at and below the county level into collectively-run or private enterprises through auction, sale, lease, or contract for private management with the ownership retained by the state. Second, it is necessary to go all out to develop the individual and private economies. Third, it is necessary to vigorously introduce the joint-stock cooperative system. Fourth, it is necessary to contract out uncultivated hilly land, slopes, and plots of land on river banks or in valleys to individuals for management. Local residents, people from the vicinity or from other provinces, and foreign investors are all welcome to contract for the management of all sorts of wasteland. To deepen the reform in rural areas, we must also thoroughly change the form of production and management, promote socialized large-scale production, expand the socialized service system, and run the businesses at an appropriate scale of operation. With regard to the management system, we must introduce the system of integration of agriculture, industry, commerce, technical services, and trading, as well as the production-supply-marketing integrated system. By and large, we must go all out to further the rural reform in depth and to vigorously promote the productive forces in rural areas. In his concluding speech Vice Governor Huang Bingsheng said: During this meeting we have conscientiously discussed such issues as the tasks regarding rural reform, the adjustment of the rural production structure, and the plan to strive for a bumper harvest this year. The participants now have a better understanding, reached a consensus, and have clearly defined the targets, tasks, measures, and methods regarding the future development of agriculture and the rural economic reform in our province. Some requirements have been set on this year's spring farming. The meeting commended 57 advanced localities which had upgraded their agriculture to a new level in 1993, of which Eryuan County, Dali City, Puer County, and Luchun County were awarded first-class prizes, Qujing Prefecture and 22 other localities won second-class prizes, and Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Nationality Autonomous Prefectures plus 29 other prefectures, autonomous prefectures, cities, and counties won third-class prizes. Vice Governor Yang Jianqiang presided over the meeting. Present at the meeting were provincial party, government, and army leaders Liang Jinquan, Zhao Shumin, Zhang Baosan, Meng Jiyao, Bao Yongkang, Zhao Tingguang, Qiu Chuangjiao, and Li Jie; former leading members of the provincial party committee Sun Yuping and Liang Jia; party and government leaders from all prefectures, autonomous prefectures, cities, and counties; as well as the people in charge of all the departments and committees of the provincial party committee, state organs at the provincial level, the provincial commissions, committees, departments, and bureaus, various public organizations, and all colleges and universities.
