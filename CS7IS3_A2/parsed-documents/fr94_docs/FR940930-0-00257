FR940930-0-00257 FR940930-0-00031 13. Other recommendations included wider circulation of the program's Information Sheet [one mortgagee]; quicker nationwide implementation of the program [one mortgagee]; greater publicizing of the PFS alternative to maximize the number of participants [one mortgagee]; combining mandatory notification by lender with other mandatory HUD correspondence that gets sent to mortgagor [one mortgagee]; and relying on the lender for homeownership counseling [one mortgagee]. Response: A new PFS Information Sheet will be distributed, and be generally available, to real estate brokers, housing counseling agencies, mortgagees, and local HUD offices. Although nationwide implementation of the PFS option is now imminent, during the Demonstration all local HUD offices other than those ``officially'' designated as being involved in the PFS Demonstration were nonetheless able to activate the pre-foreclosure sale procedure ``unofficially'' in their jurisdictions, and a significant number did. There will be more publicizing of the nationwide PFS procedure as it starts up. Many forms have been eliminated or streamlined, and the mandatory notification forms have been combined with other correspondence that mortgagees must send to mortgagors. While it is not appropriate to depend exclusively on lenders to provide homeownership counseling (there is a network of HUD-approved housing counseling agencies whose duties include homeownership counseling), lenders are free to provide homeownership counseling and other information related to pre-foreclosure sales if requested by the mortgagor to do so. 14. Other recommendations also included allowing participants to select their own brokers independently [one national association of real estate sales professionals], and also deciding on how HUD will determine ``qualified'' real estate brokers to put on the program's referral list [one HUD field office]. Response: PFS participants are permitted to select their own brokers_the required list of cooperating brokers has been eliminated as too cumbersome for mortgagees to produce and update, and also as possibly confusing to some PFS participants. Thus the issue of whether and how ``qualified'' are the brokers on the list is rendered moot. This Interim Rule This interim rule takes into consideration the public comments received on the notice announcing the PFS demonstration published on May 29, 1991, 56 FR 24324. It also incorporates changes in the PFS requirements and procedures based on the Department's experience under the Demonstration.
