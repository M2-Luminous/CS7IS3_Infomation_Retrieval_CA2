This report sums up the diplomacy of 1993 and elucidates diplomatic goals for 1994. This report says that the greatest diplomatic tasks for this year are improving U.S.-Japan relations and dealing with North Korea's nuclear issue. In particular, if North Korea agrees to accept the International Atomic Energy Agency's complete inspection at the U.S.-North Korea negotiations, Japan and North Korea will resume working-level contacts in Beijing which was suspended since the eighth Japan-North Korea negotiations in November 1992. The Japan-North Korea talks which started in January 1991 discussed issues including the issue of compensation for the war crimes committed by Japan. These issues were discussed prior to discussing the establishment of diplomatic relations. When the Japanese side brought up the issue of Yi Un-hye (the Japanese instructor to former North Korean terrorist Kim Hyon-hui who was responsible for the bombing of the Korean Air Lines plane in 1983), the North Korean side left the negotiating table and talks have been suspended since. Japan proposed resuming talks on many occasions, but the North Koreans rejected it each time. A Japanese source in Seoul said: ``The Japanese Embassy in Beijing frequently telephones the North Korean Embassy in Beijing on meeting, but the North Korean side continues to reject our proposal.'' A Japanese diplomat who assumed office in Beijing in July 1993 has not yet exchanged greetings with the North Korean side. North Korea only recognizes the United States as a counterpart to dialogue and has even left out the ROK. Therefore, the Japanese Government is not hastening to resume the Japan-North Korea talks and is maintaining a position of observing U.S.-North Korea negotiations. However, the Japanese side is becoming active again. On 28 December 1993, Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata revealed a desire to resume negotiations with North Korea by using the issue of compensation as a starting point. Also on 9 January, on his way home from visiting China he held a news conference and openly proposed to the North Korean side that negotiations be resumed. Compensation is an issue because North Korea demands compensation for Japan's illegal colonialization of Korea which Japan insists that the Japanese annexation of Korea was legitimate and will only recognize property rights and claims of unpaid wages. Japan has been experiencing difficulties in the talks because of North Korea's nuclear issue. It also revealed that if North Korea is willing, talks with North Korea may be resumed at anytime. However there are doubts on whether Japan truly wants to achieve talks to establish diplomatic relations with North Korea. Kim Pong-chin, professor at Japan's North Kyushu University, is in agreement with this claim. In a paper written for a scientific journal published at the National Unification Research Institute, he analyzed: ``The greatest agenda in the Japan-North Korea negotiations to establish diplomatic relations is the issue of liquidating the past. The reason that North Korea is rejecting the talks is that Japan is intentionally neglecting internal tasks such as the issue of compensation by putting forth external elements such as the nuclear issue.'' Professor Kim continued: ``Based on the Cold War era way of thinking, Japan is playing the role of proxy for the U.S. policy toward North Korea and is trying to advance its own interests to the utmost by taking advantage of the weak points and limitations of the ROK's North Korea policy.'' Japan's situation on the issue of North Korea's nuclear issue is summarized as 'accepting reality as it is to establish countermeasures.' This theory is that a countermeasure must be provided to prevent nuclear development since a war may break out if sanctions are carried out toward North Korea. More than any other country, Japan is a country that generates the most rumors of danger on the Korean peninsula. Therefore, it is peculiar for Japan to reach such a leisurely conclusion. What Japan is promoting from the level of 'taking measures' for nuclear development is the Theater Missile Defense plan. Japan claims that this is the interceptor system of North Korea's NODONG No. 1 missile, but the ROK experts think that Japan is using North Korea's threat to form a nuclear weapons transportation system. With North Korea's nuclear problem an issue, Japan is able to favorably lead the Japan-North Korea negotiations towards establishing diplomatic relations and is using the nuclear issue to promote arms proliferation. Once the nuclear issue moves toward settlement, Japan will once again resort to liquidating the past to promote economic relations. Thus, Japan is showing flexibility in adapting to reality. This is the true nature of Japan's practical diplomacy toward the Korean peninsula. The National Unification Board presented a report entitled ``Current Situation and Prospect of Economic Relations Between Japan and North Korea'' during parliamentary inspections of government offices last year. According to this report, Japan's post-war policy toward the Korean peninsula was fixed within the framework of U.S. policy on Korea. Since the mid-eighties, however, Japan has pursued practical diplomacy based on a policy of maintaining equal distance towards both South and North Korea under the pretext of the slogan, ``Post-war liquidation with North Korea.'' This report assesses that Japan's strategy toward the Korean peninsula has two parts -- the first aims at expanding political influence on the Korean peninsula by normalizing relations with North Korea, and the second aims at promoting economic infiltration with capital and technology in the initiative to reorganize order in Northeast Asia. North Korea and Japan have virtually restored relations although they have yet to formally establish diplomatic relations. In 1992, a government inspection team presented a surprising report after visiting various places in Japan to inspect cooperative relations between Japan and North Korea. This report reads: ``Japanese businesses have already completed the planning and survey stage and have gained an understanding of North Korea's industrial situation, examined main projects for important areas of North Korea, and studied conditions for investment in North Korea. They are believed to have established personal relations with leading figures in North Korea -- influential figures, provincial party officials, and managers of local industrial complexes. It is a matter of concern that the North Korean economy may become subject to that of Japan once diplomatic relations between the two are established.'' Japan's Foreign Ministry Concerned About Information Leakage Japan's East Asian Trade Institute and the Japan-North Korean Trade Association visited Pyongyang together on two occasions in April 1991 and July 1992 to discuss items that North Korea may want to develop and import. Experts are saying that the ``tripartite trade route'' connecting North Korea and Japan through the former Soviet Union and Hong Kong in the fifties and the sixties has been revived as the ``tripartite investment route.'' Likewise, Japan is disregarding the nuclear issue and steadily pushing ahead with work to expand its own interests in North Korea. The United States and the ROK will not intervene in Japan's affairs as long as Japan cooperates in the resolution of the nuclear issue and the improvement of South-North relations. In the beginning of the new year, ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said that he would establish various diplomatic measures in preparation for the North Korean establishment of diplomatic ties with the United States and Japan. Regarding this, a ROK diplomat in Seoul said, ``Japan must obtain ROK and U.S. consent before establishing diplomatic ties with North Korea. North Korea is well aware of this. Minister Han's remarks on ROK support in the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two means that the ROK is willing to conciliate North Korea with the Japan card in the last stage of negotiations for resolving the nuclear issue, and not that it will actually help in the establishment of North Korea-Japan diplomatic relations.'' Reaching a resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue means the beginning of a new diplomatic war. Japan is preparing for a new strategy towards the Korean peninsula while ROK leaders dream sweet dreams of South-North dialogue, whose resumption remains distant. On 28 December 1993, a visit to North Korea by a delegation of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDP] led by dietman Hajime Hukata, director of the Organizational Department of the SDP Central Committee and executive officer of the Japan-DPRK Friendship Promotion League at the request of the Workers Party of Korea [WPK] generated interest from diplomatic circles. Hukata is a typical pro-North Korea politician who had visited North Korea on 28 September 1990 with Kanemaru, then-vice president of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, to realize the joint tripartite declaration. He met Hwang Chang-yop, secretary of the WPK and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, on 30 December. Hwang Chang-yop leads the work to establish diplomatic ties with Japan as the head of a special agency recently established by North Korea on re-establishing diplomatic relations with Japan. Hukata's visit to North Korea, however, failed to interest ROK and Japanese media because an SDP dietman's visit to North Korea is not meaningful under the situation, in which the coalition ruling party's future is unclear. An official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, ``I observed Hukata's visit to North Korea with interest, but didn't find anything worth noticing.'' Ever since the pro-North Korean SDP became the ruling party, the Japanese Foreign Ministry has become deep suspicious of the coalition ruling party's policy toward North Korea. An influential dietman of the Japan Renewal Party, Hajime Isihi, was the executive officer of the team to visit North Korea in 1990, and Chief Cabinet Secretary Kajimura, who controls key departments of the cabinet such as the Intelligence Office, the Foreign Policy Deliberation Office, and the Security Office, was the deputy executive officer of the delegation to North Korea. An unidentified Japanese foreign ministry official told the Japanese press that ``It [the Foreign Ministry] cannot help but worry about possible information leakage since most of the Hosokawa regime's members are pro-North Korea.'' Japan's diplomatic policy is influenced by government officials. Regarding this, an observer well-versed in Japanese affairs, said to keep an eye on Yutaca Kawashima, minister at the Japanese Embassy in the ROK from July 1992 until November 1993, when he was appointed director of the Foreign Ministry's Asia Department, the hub of Japan's foreign policy.
