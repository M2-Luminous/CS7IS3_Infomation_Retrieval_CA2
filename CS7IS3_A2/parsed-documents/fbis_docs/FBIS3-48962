Matczak, including recorded remarks by Marek Borowski, deputy prime minister and finance minister] [Text] The government has prepared a diary of this year's price rises. It has done this to ensure budget revenues and to avoid springing surprises on the public. According to [Deputy] Prime Minister [and Finance Minister] Marek Borowski, the planned rises are lower than assumed in the agreement with the World Bank. [Matczak] According to the authors of the official inflation index, there are few countries which have a totally free market. For instance, in Germany six years ago the state controlled more prices than in Poland at present, but no one used to deny there was a free market in Germany.

After electric power and gas, fuel prices will go up in March, while those of central heating, hot water and medicines will go up in April.

An increase in housing rents, which have been postponed since last September, will be introduced in July. Also power and gas prices will go up again.

If we were to say: Let the prices be whatever the producers want them to be, then it is very likely that with our state of the market we would have greater price increases than the ones we prescribe, if I may put it thus. [Matczak] According to the budget, next year prices will go up by 27 percent. The biggest rises will apply to housing rents, central heating and hot water, gas, power, and medicines. Excise tax will be increased, which will affect the prices of fuels, alcohol and cigarettes. But it is not known when the latter two commodities will go up.

[Matczak] The zloty [Z] will be devalued by 1.6 percent a month and by the end of the year we will be paying Z26,300 for one dollar. But at the end of 1993 the dollar cost Z1,000 more than planned.
