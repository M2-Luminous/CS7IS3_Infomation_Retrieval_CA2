"It is crucial in this critical moment to exclude a possibility of any provocations and sabotage of the peace process. Not only Sarajevo's fate but the fate of Bosnian peaceful settlement on the whole depends on this", the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement distributed in the United Nations on Tuesday [22 February]. Russia called on the West "to exert the necessary pressure on the Bosnian Government to make it cooperate with the United Nations in unblocking and demilitarizing Sarajevo", according to the statement circulated as a U.N. Security Council document. If the U.S.A. and the European Union member countries press on Bosnian Muslims to make them help unblock Sarajevo, the West would act "on the same lines it declared while saying that political settlement of the conflict would be preferable", the document says. It recalled the Russian initiative which made Bosnian Serbs pull back heavy guns from Sarajevo and added that Russia's "consequent line which excludes any unilateral ultimatums has yielded results". "We are accounting that goodwill which was shown by one of the conflicting sides in the moment critical to the (conflict's) settlement will evoke equally concrete responsive moves", it reads. Russia also proposed that after unblocking Sarajevo, the United Nations urgently consider ways of establishing its administration in the city and measures to stregthen other safe areas on the Bosnian territory.
