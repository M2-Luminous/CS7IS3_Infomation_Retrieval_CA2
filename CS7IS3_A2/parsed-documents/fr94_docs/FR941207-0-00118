FR941207-0-00118 FR941207-0-00021 50 CFR Part 675 [Docket No. 931100&hyph;4043; I.D. 112394A] Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Modification of a closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is opening directed fishing for pollock in the Bering Sea (BS) subarea of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI) by vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component. This action is necessary to fully utilize the allowance of the total allowable catch (TAC) of pollock for the offshore component in the BS. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), December 5, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, 907&hyph;586-7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by NMFS according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. The directed fishery for pollock in the BS by vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component was closed on September 24, 1994, in order to reserve amounts anticipated to be needed for incidental catch in other fisheries (59 FR 49032, September 26, 1994). NMFS has determined that as of November 12, 1994, 18,550 mt remain unharvested. The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined that the allowance of the TAC of pollock allocated to the offshore component in the BS has not been reached. Therefore, NMFS is terminating the previous closure and is opening directed fishing for pollock in the BS for vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component effective at 12 noon, A.l.t., December 5, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. All other closures remain in full force and effect. Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at ยง675.20(h). Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR 675.20 and is exempt from review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: December 2, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
