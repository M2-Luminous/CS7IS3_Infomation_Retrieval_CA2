Officials said the British Government, in consultation with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, had halted the convoys as a "prudent precaution." They said: "We suspended our aid convoys and we gave advice and assistance to aid workers to make sure that they made their way to safe locations against the possibility that they might find themselves in danger." The suspension took place from Monday and the decision was taken as part of contingency arrangements for the safety of aid workers delivering supplies. Officials said: "With any luck we shall be able to start them again as we have in the past." But they refused to speculate on the role now of British troops in Bosnia, who are there to provide protection escort to the humanitarian operation.
