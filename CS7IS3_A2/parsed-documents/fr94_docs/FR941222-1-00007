FR941222-1-00007 FR941222-1-00003 (b) This section and §§3001.57a through 3001.57c are initially to be effective for the limited period of five years from the date of their adoption by the Commission. During that period the Commission will continue to analyze the need for these rules to enable the Postal Service to respond to changes in the market for expedited delivery services, and the impact of these procedures on Postal Service proposals. These rules will cease to be effective at the end of this period unless they have been reissued by the Commission following a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published in the Federal Register which provides an appropriate opportunity for public comments. §3001.57a Market Response Rate Requests_data filing requirements. (a) Each formal request made under the provisions of §§3001.57 through 3001.57c shall be accompanied by such information and data as are necessary to inform the Commission and the parties of the nature and expected impact of the change in rates proposed. Except for good cause shown, the information specified in paragraphs (c) through (i) of this section shall also be provided with each request. (b) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this section, the information required by §3001.54 (b) through (r) must be filed only for those subclasses and services for which the Postal Service requests a change in rates or fees. Test period volume, cost, and revenue estimates presented in satisfaction of rule 57a shall be for four postal quarters beginning after the filing date of the request. The cost roll-forward may be developed by extending the cost forecasting model used in the last omnibus rate case (utilizing available actual data). Volume and revenue estimates required by these rules shall utilize, to the extent practicable, the factors identified in rule 54 (j)(6), and must be fully explained, with all available supporting documentation supplied, but they need not be econometrically derived. (c) Every formal request made under the provisions of §§3001.57 through 3001.57c shall contain an explanation of why the change proposed by the Postal Service is a reasonable response to the change in the market for expedited delivery services to which it is intended to respond. (d) Every formal request made under the provisions of §§3001.57 through 3001.57c shall be accompanied by the then effective Domestic Mail Classification Schedule sections which would have to be altered in order to implement the changes proposed by the Postal Service, and, arranged in a legislative format, the text of the replacement Domestic Mail Classification Schedule sections the Postal Service proposes. (e) In addition to the required test period cost estimates, every formal request made under the provisions of §§3001.57 through 3001.57c shall be accompanied by a statement of the attributable costs by segment and component for Express Mail service determined in accordance with the attributable cost methodology adopted by the Commission in the most recent omnibus rate case, for the base year used in that case, and for each fiscal year thereafter for which cost data is available. If the Postal Service believes that an adjustment to that methodology is warranted it may also provide costs using alternative methodologies as long as a full rationale for the proposed changes is provided. (f) Each formal request made under the provisions of §§3001.57 through 3001.57c shall include a description of all operational changes, occurring since the most recent omnibus rate case, having an important impact on the attributable cost of Express Mail. Postal Service shall include an analysis and estimate of the cost impact of each such operational change. (g) Every formal request made under the provisions of §§3001.57 through 3001.57c shall be accompanied by a statement of the actual Express Mail revenues of the Postal Service from the then effective Express Mail rates and fees for the most recent four quarters for which information is available. (h) Each formal request made under the provisions of §§3001.57 through 3001.57c shall be accompanied by a complete description of the change in the market for expedited delivery services to which the Postal Service proposal is in response, a statement of when that change took place, the Postal Service's analysis of the anticipated impact of that change on the market, and a description of characteristics and needs of customers and market segments affected by this change which the proposed Express Mail rates are designed to satisfy. (i) Each formal request made under the provisions of §§3001.57 through 3001.57c shall include estimates, on a quarterly basis, of test period volumes, revenues, and attributable costs determined in accordance with the attributable cost methodology adopted by the Commission in the most recent omnibus rate case for each Express Mail service for which rate changes are proposed assuming: (1) Rates remain at their existing levels, and (2) Rates are changed after 90 days to the levels suggested in the request. (j)(1) Each formal request made under the provisions of §§3001.57 through 3001.57c shall be accompanied by the following information, for each quarter following the base year in the most recent omnibus rate case: (i) Estimated volume by rate cell, for each Express Mail service; (ii) Total postage pounds of Express Mail rated at: (A) Up to 1/2 pound, (B) 1/2 pound up to 2 pounds, (C) 2 pounds up to 5 pounds; and (iii) Total pounds of Express Mail and of each other subclass of mail carried on hub contracts. (2) In each instance when rates change based on a proceeding under the provisions of §§3001.57 through 3001.57c the Postal Service shall provide, one year after the conclusion of the test period, the data described in §3001.57a(j)(1)(i&hyph;iii), for each of the four quarters of the test period. (k) Each formal request made under the provisions of §§3001.57 through 3001.57c shall include analyses to demonstrate: (1) That the proposed rates are consistent with the factors listed in 39 U.S.C. 3622 (b), (2) That the proposed rate changes are in the public interest and in accordance with the policies and applicable criteria of the Act, and (3) That the proposed rates will preserve, or minimize erosion of, the Express Mail contribution to institutional costs recommended in the most recent omnibus rate case. (l) Each formal request made under the provisions of §§3001.57 through 3001.57c shall be accompanied by a certificate that service of the filing in accordance with §3001.57b (c) has been made. §3001.57b Market Response Rate Requests_expedition of public notice and procedural schedule. (a) The purpose of this section is to provide a schedule for expediting proceedings when a trial-type hearing is required in a proceeding in which the Postal Service proposes to adjust rates for Express Mail service in order to respond to a change in the market for expedited delivery services. (b) The Postal Service shall not propose for consideration under the provisions of §§3001.57 through 3001.57c rates lower than: (1) The average per piece attributable cost for Express Mail service determined in the most recent omnibus rate case, or (2) The average per piece attributable cost for Express Mail service as determined by the Postal Service in accordance with §3001.57a (e) for the most recent fiscal year for which information is available, whichever is higher. Neither shall the Postal Service propose a rate for any rate cell which is lower than the estimated test period attributable cost of providing that rate cell with service.
