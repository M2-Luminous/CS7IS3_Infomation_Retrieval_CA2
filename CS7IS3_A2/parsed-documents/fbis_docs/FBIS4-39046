He said "when practical work begins, even the existing agreements, let alone the notion of a Eurasian union, fail to work well." "Back in January we submitted to Kazakhstan our ideas concerning citizenship, but received a reply only yesterday, that is six months later. The two presidents must evidently punish us for this," Kozyrev said. There are also other problems requiring solutions, such as the issues of the Baykonur launch site and missile silos. "Can't we resolve them without third parties?" he asked. When the talks ended, Kozyrev's political adviser Galina Sidorova told journalists that Kozyrev and Saudabayev had focused on ways to bridge the "gap" mentioned by the Russian foreign minister, and translate the existing agreements into practical deeds. Sidorova said the two sides had formed a joint working group which will engage in drafting documents that would develop bilateral agreements reached on the highest level. During the recent visit to Moscow of President Nursultan Nazarbayev the two sides signed on twenty agreements, including a treaty on furthering economic cooperation, accords on military cooperation, an agreement on the use and lease of the Baykonur launch site, and a memorandum on the basic principles of resolving problems connected with citizenship and with the legal status of Russian and Kazakh citizens, she said. On the eve of talks between Kozyrev and Saudabayev Kazakhstan submitted to Moscow a draft agreement on the legal status of citizens, Sidorova pointed out. "Russia is particularly concerned over this issue. It stands for a unified and indivisible Kazakhstan, but it would like the Kazakh leaders to find a common language with their Russian-speaking population which numbers millions," she stressed. Sidorova said Kazakhstan also submitted a draft agreement on simplifying the procedure of acquiring citizenship, on the order of military service and on cooperation in the field of labor migration. "These agreements directly concern the problem of human rights. We hope that they will help ease our mutual concern and dissatisfaction caused by the fact that understandings reached on the highest level are not carried out quickly and effectively enough," she said.
