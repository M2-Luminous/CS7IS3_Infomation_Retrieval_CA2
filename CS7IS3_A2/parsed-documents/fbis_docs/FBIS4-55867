This was the essence of the most recent meeting between President Berisha and Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, president of the republic of Kosova. Rugova reaches this verdict three years after the proclamation of the republic of Kosova and about two years after the start of his political carreer under the title of president of a country that no European country recognizes. At every meeting with foreign diplomats, he has continually insisted on the independence and neutrality of the republic of Kosova and the need to place it under a civil protectorate of the United Nations, perhaps doing all that is possible to internationalize this issue, which in all probability will soon be put forward for a settlement. Meanwhile, Berisha, the Albanian nation's other president, comes to this point after his harsh statements about NATO forces bombing Belgrade and his flexible remarks in this context that "Albania is not in favor of changing borders by force, but of respect for the rights of Albanians wherever they are." Contradictions are noticeable in these two excursions of the two Albanian presidents toward a solution for the question of Kosova, which have perhaps resulted from the stagnation of European diplomacy over this issue. The entire international diplomatic commitment has remained stuck at the limits of the autonomy afforded by former Yugoslav President Tito in 1974, while Albanian diplomacy has committed itself much further to the idea of the republic. It is nevertheless indisputable that the two presidents have now reached a common denominator in the shape of dialogue with Milosevic. Did Rugova move toward Berisha or did Berisha move toward Rugova? It must be said that there has been a basic contradiction between the statements of the two Albanian presidents in recent years, which, although resolved, cannot fail to leave a scar. Berisha has continually declared that he supports Rugova's policy, which means he supports the idea of the republic of Kosova, at a time when at his meetings with leaders of foreign diplomacy he has said that "Albania is not in favor of changing borders by force but of respect for the rights of Albanians wherever they are," which can imply all sorts of things but not an independent and neutral Kosova. This is understandable. Rugova has sat longer in the chair given to him by his people than in the seats of European diplomacy, whereas Berisha, as the president of a country seeking to involve itself in European organizations, has necessarily taken up the seat given him by international diplomacy. One can therefore firmly say that it was Rugova who moved toward Berisha, which means that it was Rugova who could not overcome the barriers imposed by those who lead the world and decide what will happen to Bosnia. However, can it at the same time be Rugova, who mediates in the Albanian-Serbian talks, at a time when his theory has been shown to be obsolete and worthless in a dialogue with Belgrade, which does not recognize him in the capacity of president of Kosova? At a time when no fresh figure who could mediate the Albanian-Serbian talks is emerging in Prishtina, it seems that in Tirana it is the Albanian Socialists, who long ago came out in favor of dialogue with Belgrade, who are attempting to play this high-value card. Well-informed sources report that Luan Hajdaraga and Bashkim Zeneli, two of the Socialist leaders, held a meeting lasting more than two hours in the Yugoslav Embassy in Tirana, at which the central topic was precisely the problem of Kosova and Rugova's policies. With the help of the contradiction between the statements of the two Albanian presidents, the Albanian Socialists perhaps wish to acquire a proprietary interest in the cause of Kosova in Albania, hoping that, if the title-deeds can pass to them, early elections may become a reality.
