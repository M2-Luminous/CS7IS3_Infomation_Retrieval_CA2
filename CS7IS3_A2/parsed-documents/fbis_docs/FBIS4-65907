Nielsen by Ole Lorenzen and Rikke Andreasen; place and date not given] [Text] The possibility of a Liberal-Conservative-Progress Party majority that surfaces from time to time in the opinion polls is due to the voters' dissatisfaction that there was no major change in Danish politics when Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (Social Democratic Party) became prime minister. Therefore, it is not a good idea that the present government should continue after the next election even if all the four government parties manage to stay above the threshold for representation in the Folketing. This is the view of Socialist People's Party [SF] chairman Holger K. Nielsen. According to his timetable, at 1400 today he is to start the debate at his party's national conference. And with the European Union [EU] discussion behind it, the dominant item on the party's agenda is the Folketing election and the situation after it. Increasingly often in recent months, we have seen the government and the SF backing the laws that the Folketing has passed. After a year out in the cold, the SF has therefore come back into the warm. But this does not make Holger K. Nielsen keen to continue along this path after the election. [NIELSEN] "Nyrup is quite clearly trying to avoid situations where the voting split is 90-89. That is why the government tries to draw us in when things are tight. But this is still not satisfactory. "I also sense that there is so much dissolution in the government parties that this in itself will create an impetus that will mean that the Christian People's Party and the Center Democrats will not continue in the government after the election. ``So after the next election there will probably be negotiations with us about the shape of a government platform, and it seems to me totally improbable that we and the Center Democrats will be able to reach agreement. After all, the Center Democrats entered the government in order to keep us out." [DET FRI AKTUELT] Is it not better that the Center Democrats are part of the government and are therefore tied to it, than that the party is outside the government and is therefore able to do even more somersaults? [NIELSEN] "No, I am not so sure that it is. My point of departure is that I should defend the interests of SF voters. It is not our historic task to keep Poul Nyrup Rasmussen in power. Our task is to get as much SF policy through as possible. And in addition the present government is proof that there is not that much of an advantage in having the Center Democrats involved. "The government's profile is becoming so changeable that this gives rise to much more concern. At bottom the four parties want something different. The Center Democrats have entered the government and lost almost all their voters to the nonsocialists. And those voters they have have a more obvious orientation toward the nonsocialists than to us. That is why I believe that it would have been a much, much better solution in January 1993 if we had gotten a purely Social Democratic government. "It could have maneuvered quite a lot and quite effectively. The Center Democrats could have adopted a high profile on issues where they wanted to adopt a high profile without this causing any problems, and agreements could have been reached with us without this causing any problems." [DET FRI AKTUELT] Is this not because the Social Democrats, the SF, and the Radical Liberals today have a majority? After the election it looks as if this will not be enough. [NIELSEN] "There is a difference of course. But I still believe that a continuation of the four-party government is a pretty hopeless construction. Nor do I believe that they will all manage to stay above the threshold for representation in the Folketing. I also believe that the Social Democrats, the SF, and the Radical Liberals will attract quite a lot of votes and have a majority again if we state quite clearly what we want. There are quite a lot of stay-at-home voters in the opinion polls, and we should therefore not attach too much importance to them. A lot will happen in the election campaign." In the fall of 1992 the SF made public a government program in the expectation that a Folketing election was on the way. It never came. The SF negotiated with the Social Democrats about a government platform after the fall of the Schluter government, but drew a blank. That is why it is a more cautious chairman who will wait until after the election before he airs his hopes. [NIELSEN] "Not everywhere in the SF is there enthusiasm for the Radical Liberals, but I believe that people accept that a majority comprising the Social Democrats and the SF alone is not just around the corner. That is why it must be a case of the three parties' trying to create a base for some reforms in the field of green politics and in the field of increased democratization." [DET FRI AKTUELT] Is it really the case that you want to have the Radical Liberals involved in putting pressure on the Social Democrats rather than doing so alone? [Nielsen] "No, that is not the case. Despite everything the Radical Liberals are quite a problem in the field of economic policy. But there are many good prospects in a majority which also includes the Radical Liberals." There are six topics on the agenda when the weekend's national conference comes to put together an election program for the party. -- More must be done to bring down unemployment -- including reducing working hours to 30 hours a week. -- Higher environmental levies and other green proposals will reduce consumption. The environment comes before growth. -- Public services must be improved with more on offer for children and old people, and the disappearance of waiting lists for hospital treatment. -- Economic democracy must be brought back onto the agenda again -- in pension funds, too. -- A new security policy must be formulated, representing massive savings in defense. -- The efforts to get the EU to pursue a different policy will continue. Denmark's national compromise must be adhered to. [DET FRI AKTUELT] This sounds like a very expensive program. [Nielsen] "Yes, but the whole thing can hold together. We are not so keen that taxes should be brought down the whole time. Also, there are still places from which money can be taken. It is pointless for Denmark to have the lowest gasoline taxes. There is also scope for introducing an advertising levy." However, he is consciously low profile in his concrete demands on a Nyrup Rasmussen government after the election. For example, it is not a demand that the SF should be involved in the next multiparty defense agreement. "If Defense Minister Haekkerup would rather reach an agreement with the Conservatives, I think this will cause him bigger problems than being outside an agreement causes us," Nielsen said. Nor will the tax reform of which the SF has been highly critical need to be recast. The necessary redistribution to benefit those who are worst off will be achieved in other ways. The debate in Kolding over the next few days will show whether Holger K. Nielsen has the party with him on this.
