This, coming after other recent embassy advertisements for a car mechanic and several cleaning ladies who specialised in foreign languages. Such comic naivety on the Americans' part has given rise to lively commentaries in the local press. The Yerevan newspaper "LRAGIR" can just picture some university student or graduate from a foreign language department devoting his or her youth to freeing the U.S. Embassy from unpleasant toilet odors in flawless English. Why not, muses the author, introduce some new courses in the foreign language faculties of the republic's institutions of higher education: English Plumbing 101, Basic English Slang for Drivers, Watchmen and Laborers in Shakespeare's Works. The capital newspaper did not stop there. Why not begin intensive language courses in Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, and so on? For every language there should be at least one embassy, which, the paper concluded, would therefore be able to employ local language specialists looking for work as plumbers and cleaners. It just may be a solution for Armenia's college graduates searching for employment on the republic's difficult job market.
