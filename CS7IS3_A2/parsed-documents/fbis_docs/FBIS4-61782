Distressed by the political confrontation, escalation of violence, and exacerbation of relations among various social and ethnic groups in nearby foreign countries, as well as by the territorial claims upon Ukraine and adhering to democratic principles in resolving sociopolitical problems and defending human rights, we consider interethnic harmony in Ukraine to be one of the main preconditions for maintaining and strengthening our statehood. We also consider the provision of social stability and civic peace in our society to be one of the major task of all political forces of the country, especially during the period of the formation of new power structures. Proceeding from these principles, the signatories to this agreement have agreed on the following main principles in their policy in the sphere of development of interethnic relations and ethnic cultures: 1. Observation of the ethnic and religious rights of all citizens of Ukraine and the revival and development of all of its nationalities. 2. Opposition to all manifestations of chauvinism, xenophobia, ethnic prejudice, or disrespect for national dignity. Such phenomena must primarily be rejected by those organizations from whose national midst they originate. 3. Protection of the rights of the individual in harmonious combination with respect for his ethnic rights and satisfaction of his ethnic cultural needs. 4. Provision for the rights of all nationalities and ethnic groups of Ukraine in the new constitution. 5. Satisfaction of the needs of believers of all faiths and opposition to the incitement of interethnic hostility. We are ready to create a civic committee, composed of our representatives, to fulfill this agreement. The agreement is open to signing by all political forces and public organizations.
