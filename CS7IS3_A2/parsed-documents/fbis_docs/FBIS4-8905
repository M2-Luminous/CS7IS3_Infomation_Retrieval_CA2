[passage omitted] Meanwhile Pope John Paul II appealed to all sides to respect the ceasefire and resume peace talks. He deplored that the "assault on the martyred city could go on... despite the truce promised by the besieging forces." A statement from Karadzic's office said the Bosnian Serbs had Wednesday "unilaterally proclaimed peace at Gorazde, which ends the crisis around the town," the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA reported. This "act" was in response to statements Tuesday from the Russian and U.S. presidents, Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton, the statement added. [passage omitted] An UNPROFOR official here said Wednesday that under the truce agreement, signed with the UN late Tuesday night in nearby Pale, the Serb side agreed to stop firing "immediately" as long as they were not attacked. However shelling continued early Wednesday although with less intensity, UNPROFOR spokesman Major Rob Annink said. Several shells hit a building housing UN military observers but left no casualties, and it was dangerous to move around the town, he added. Meanwhile refugees continued to flood in, he said. Serb forces appeared to be trying to block the road leading west out of the town, on the left bank, he added. Under the temporary ceasefire, the Serbs had agreed to cease military activities over a three-kilometer (two-mile) stretch of land, starting from central Gorazde and running to the left bank of the Drina, which divides the town. UNPROFOR and other humanitarian groups could help civilians, and organize medical evacuations and prisoner exchanges in that area. [passage omitted] In Geneva, a spokesman for the UN High Commission for Refugees quoted their doctor in charge of medical evacuations, Gordona Stjepanovic, as saying "the situation is worse in Gorazde than it was in the worst moments in Sarajevo." Spokesman Ron Redmond said there was "nothing to eat" and people "risk their lives" trying to get water. On Tuesday, 43 people were killed, including six children, and 112 people were wounded, bringing the total since the Serb offensive began March 28 to 345 dead and 1,187 wounded, UNHCR said.
