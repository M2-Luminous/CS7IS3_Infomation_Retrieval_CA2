ACTION: Interim rule. SUMMARY: This interim rule sets forth the requirements and procedures for awarding Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds to Indian tribes and Alaskan native villages. Following issuance of a proposed rule on June 21, 1991, the Department issued an interim rule on April 7, 1992, regarding the criteria for awarding CDBG funding to Indian tribes and Alaskan native villages. The Department has decided to issue another interim rule to address the comments received on the April 7, 1992 interim rule and to allow the public to see how the rule works in conjunction with the latest Notice of Fund Availability (NOFA). This interim rule will enable Indian tribes and Alaskan native villages to meet with representatives of the HUD Office of Native American Programs (ONAP) field offices to make suggestions for modification of the regulation before it is issued in final form. DATES: Effective date: October 1, 1994. Comments due date: December 27, 1994. Expiration date: This interim rule will expire April 1, 1996. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dom Nessi, Director Office of Native American Programs, Room 4140, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410.

ADDRESSES: Interested persons are invited to submit comments regarding this interim rule to the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of General Counsel, Room 10276, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements contained in this interim rule have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and have been assigned OMB control number 2506&hyph;0043. Background The authority for the CDBG program for Indian tribes and Alaskan native villages was previously with the Office of Community Planning and Development; therefore, all previous issuances refer to it under 24 CFR part 571. However, that authority was transferred recently to the Office of Public and Indian Housing. Therefore, this interim rule is placed in 24 CFR part 953, and part 571 is removed. Section 105 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;235) (``Reform Act''), as amended by the National Affordable Housing Act (``NAHA''), amended Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (``1974 Act''), by transferring the authority for making grants to Indian Tribes from the section 107 discretionary fund to the allocation and distribution of funds provisions of Section 106 of the 1974 Act. Under section 106, as so amended, one percent of the title I appropriation, excluding the amounts appropriated for use under section 107, is allocated for grants to Indian Tribes. The allocated amount is to be distributed to Indian Tribes/Villages on a competitive basis in accordance with selection criteria ``contained in a regulation promulgated by the Secretary after notice and public comment.'' The Department issued the proposed rule on June 21, 1991, at 56 FR 28666, to comply with the requirement for publication for comment. The Department issued an interim rule, April 7, 1992, at 57 FR 11832, to give the public an additional opportunity to comment on the interim rule after it has been in effect for one round of competition. This revised interim rule is issued to address the comments and will allow the public to see how the interim rule works in conjunction with the latest NOFA. Section 102 of the Reform Act requires the Secretary to publish in the Federal Register a NOFA regarding funding that is available. In addition to announcing the availability of funds, the NOFA will further define application procedures and selection criteria. Relocation and Real Property Acquisition Policies
