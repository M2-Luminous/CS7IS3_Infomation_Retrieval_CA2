Our correspondent Istvan Szelloe reports: [Szelloe] It is no longer a question for Hungary whether we will enter NATO, the only question is when, Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky stressed. Hungary welcomes the Partnership for Peace cooperation, and we are of the view that it promotes joining the Euro-Atlantic security system. Our foreign minister added that relations between our country and NATO had been good up to date. The fact that Hungary opened its airspace for AWACS planes also proves it. Madeleine Albright, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, conveyed a message from President Clinton, according to which Hungary's security is very important for the United States and the Partnership for Peace cooperation can lay the foundation of security. However, as John Shalikashvili pointed out, it does not automatically mean [security]. It is NATO membership that can give full security. Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky added: There is virtually no difference of view in the most important issues between the Visegrad countries.
