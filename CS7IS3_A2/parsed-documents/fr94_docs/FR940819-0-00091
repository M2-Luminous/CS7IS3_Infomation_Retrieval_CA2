FR940819-0-00091 FR940819-0-00019 Commenters, including APA and individual flight attendants, indicated that the actual time available for rest during a rest period is often less than the scheduled rest period and may be as much as 2 to 31/2 hours less than the number of hours scheduled in the rest period. The commenters stated that this often occurs because of time lost due to assisting passengers in deplaning, travel to and from a rest facility, and other activities such as eating. One commenter stated that it may take 35 minutes to 1 hour for passengers to deplane, for the crew to gather its belongings, and for travel to the hotel; 1 hour to eat; and 1 to 11/2 hours to prepare for duty again and travel back to the airport. The FAA received several alternatives to the proposed rest requirements. APA recommended that a flight attendant scheduled for a duty period of 14 hours or less be given a scheduled rest period of at least 10 consecutive hours. The rest period could be reduced but not scheduled as a reduced rest period as long as the rest period is reasonably calculated to provide 8 consecutive hours at a suitable rest facility and the flight attendant is provided a subsequent rest period of at least 11 consecutive hours. Under the APA proposal, scheduled rest periods and reduced rest periods would have to occur during the 24-hour period preceding the scheduled end of a duty period. APA recommended that a flight attendant scheduled for a duty period of more than 14 hours but no more than 18 hours be given a scheduled rest period of at least 12 consecutive hours. This rest period could not be reduced and must occur after the completion of the scheduled duty period and immediately prior to the commencement of the subsequent duty period. The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions proposed rest requirements based on domestic and international operations (see the discussion of Domestic and International Operations). The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions' proposal recommended a minimum of 10 hours of rest following domestic flights, 12 hours of rest following international flights, and a rest period equal to twice the scheduled flight time for long-range international flights. The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions' proposal did not include a provision for reduced rest. RAA requested that minimum rest requirements for flight attendants be aligned with flight crewmember requirements. One commenter suggested that a rest period should be at least 91/2 hours at a hotel or 12 hours from the time of release to the beginning of the next report. Another commenter stated that the proposed minimum subsequent rest is satisfactory for domestic flights but not realistic for international flights. The commenter suggested that the rest period following international flights should be 24 hours. Several commenters recommended that the FAA establish provisions for on-board rest. APA recommended that a domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier or commercial operator be permitted to assign a flight attendant to a scheduled duty period of more than 14 hours, but no more than 16 hours, if the inflight duties assigned to flight attendants by the air carrier or commercial operator were such that each of the cabin crew could be free of all duty for ``25 percent of the scheduled block time less 1 hour.'' APA stated that reclining seats suitable for rest reserved for 25 percent of the assigned attendant complement would have to be available throughout the flight. APA also recommended that a domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier or commercial operator be permitted to assign a flight attendant to a scheduled duty period of more than 16 hours, but no more than 18 hours, if the inflight duties assigned to flight attendants by the air carrier or commercial operator were such that each of the cabin crew could be free of all duty for ``33 percent of the scheduled block time less 1 hour.'' APA added that reclining seats suitable for rest reserved for 33 percent of the assigned attendant complement would have to be available throughout the flight. The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions recommended that a flight attendant be provided at least 1 hour of continuous rest for any flight segment scheduled for 8 or more hours of flight time, and that a passenger seat or bunk be assigned for crew rest. FAA Response This final rule adopts the definition of rest period and the minimum rest requirements as proposed in the NPRM. The FAA has considered the various rest requirement alternatives proposed by commenters and has determined that the rest requirements proposed in the NPRM and adopted in this final rule are adequate to ensure that flight attendants are provided the opportunity to be sufficiently rested to perform their routine and emergency safety duties without imposing a significant burden on operators. A discussion of the comments recommending that reserve status be addressed in the definition of rest is contained under the heading, ``Reserve Status, Stand-by Status, or Similar Assignments.'' In response to Southwest Airlines' comment that rest should be ``actual'' hours of rest and not ``scheduled,'' the FAA considers that the opportunity to rest, as provided by the rest period, to be ``actual'' rest. As proposed in the NPRM, this final rule requires that a flight attendant ``be given'' a scheduled rest period. This provision makes the operator responsible for ensuring that a flight attendant is scheduled for and receives the scheduled rest period. The FAA recognizes that how the flight attendant utilizes this rest period cannot be regulated. Requiring operators to schedule rest periods ensures that flight attendants know in advance when rest periods will occur and that they will be of a specified duration. A minimum rest period of 9 consecutive hours is required for all duty period assignments of 14 hours or less, unless the rest period is reduced in accordance with ยง121.467(b)(3) or ยง135.273(b)(3). A flight attendant who reports for duty to find that the flight has been canceled would have begun a duty period and would require minimum rest. However, in response to RAA's concern, a carrier could either keep the flight attendant on duty for reassignment or release the flight attendant for a complete rest period. Rest periods are required to occur between the completion of a scheduled duty period and the commencement of a subsequent duty period. Consequently, this final rule does not require that a required rest period be given immediately prior to a flight assignment. Because duty periods are defined as assignments involving flight time, a rest period is not required following assignments that do not involve flight time, such as training or ground duty assignments. In response to commenters who indicated that the actual time available to rest is typically less than scheduled rest, the FAA considers a flight attendant to be free of all restraint or duty upon release from an assignment involving flight time. The FAA understands that the time available for sleep during a rest period may vary depending on the amount of time a flight attendant spends in other activities during the rest period. The FAA also recognizes that it cannot compel a flight attendant to use rest periods for actual rest.
