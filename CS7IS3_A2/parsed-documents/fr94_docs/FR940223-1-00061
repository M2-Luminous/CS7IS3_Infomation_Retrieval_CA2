FR940223-1-00061 FR940223-1-00011 Run-off Modeling pollutants in run-off from road surfaces requires estimating rainfall and run-off rates, accumulation rates of pollutants on the road surface, pollutant wash-off during run-off, and constituent loading at potential receptors. While the Agency often relies on standard techniques to predict rainfall and run-off ( e.g., see docket for approach used to estimate soil run-off in USDA Handbook, No. 282, 1978), accumulation of HTMR slags will depend on the application rates. The FHWA has also developed an approach that relates pollutant accumulation with traffic volume. Combining the FHWA techniques and the loading rates discussed above would yield an estimate of total accumulation of a constituent on a road surface. The FHWA also has estimated pollutant wash-off rates for various types of road surfaces, including rural roads with flush, unpaved shoulders. The Agency requests comment on this approach to estimate run-off rates and pollutant loadings. Once run-off reaches the side of a road, it can either flow along natural contours or be channeled by engineering controls. Many roads are constructed with catch basins, swales, or other structures designed to control water and sediment flow. (See docket for examples from Chapter 11 in Highway Engineering, by Oglesby and Hicks, 1982.) Engineered barriers may significantly retard or block the flow of constituents of concern from reaching receptors adjacent to the road or from nearby water bodies. The Agency requests comment on the prevalence and effectiveness of these controls. Groundwater If HTMR Materials accumulate on a road surface, the paving will likely block any leaching of constituents from the materials into the subsurface. However, if run-off transports the material off the road, constituents could leach into the subsurface. The Agency requests comments on how to estimate the flux rate of metals from the HTMR slag into the subsurface. The Agency would need adequate estimates of the above key parameters (particulate generation, run-off, and leaching rate), in order to apply fate and transport models to estimate potential concentrations at receptors. EPA also has limited information as to where HTMR residuals are applied as an anti-skid agent, and what potential receptors could be exposed. Further, were the Agency to develop generic exclusion levels for non-encapsulated uses, EPA would need to ensure that these levels would be protective in a wide range of potential settings. Therefore, the Agency requests data on likely receptor points (e.g., water bodies, residences) that would be affected by non-encapsulated uses of HTMR slag, and what, if any, exposure assumptions the Agency could use to ensure an appropriate level of protection. The Agency's present evaluation is that non-encapsulated uses of the slags may pose potential risks to human health and the environment that may warrant control, and that the Agency lacks the necessary information and time for assuring that these non-encapsulated uses are safe. If the Agency were to receive sufficient data that would allow EPA to carry out a more complete evaluation of non-encapsulated uses, EPA will reconsider its present decision to effectively prohibit non-encapsulated uses of HTMR slag. However, EPA does not anticipate being able to complete the evaluation of any new data and assess the risks posed by non-encapsulated uses until the second rulemaking that EPA agreed to conduct as part of the settlement with the NRDC petitioners ( i.e., the rule to establish generic exclusion levels for encapsulated uses of HTMR slags). The Agency also considered another important factor in making the determination to effectively prohibit non-encapsulated uses of HTMR slags. Information available to EPA indicates that most HTMR slags are in fact used in an encapsulated manner, for example as road-base material with some form of cover or ``cap''. Encapsulation may prevent dispersal of the slag through the exposure pathways noted above. Indeed, as the Agency noted in the August 19, 1991 rulemaking, use of these slags as road-base may be analogous to a capped disposal unit. (See 56 FR 41172.) In meetings with EPA, industry representatives indicated that non-encapsulated uses account for a relatively small fraction (less than 15%) of the HTMR slag used in a manner constituting disposal. (See memorandum of a March 30, 1993 meeting with Horsehead Resource Development Co., Inc. in the RCRA public docket for today's rule.) Therefore, the Agency believes that there should be adequate capacity for all of the slag to be used in an encapsulated manner. An important part of the basis for today's proposal is the expectation that a prohibition on non-encapsulated uses would result in a more environmentally acceptable means of reuse of the material without significant dislocations. This proposal would thus effectively prohibit non-encapsulated uses of HTMR slag, whether or not the slag meets the existing exclusion levels in ยง261.3(c)(2). As noted earlier in this proposal, the methodology EPA used to set the generic exclusion levels was based on potential risks posed by releases to ground-water from HTMR slag in a landfill setting. The existing exclusion levels do not consider other possible exposures (e.g., through air releases) arising from non-encapsulated uses. EPA is consequently proposing to amend ยง266.20 such that non-encapsulated uses of HTMR slag are no longer exempt from the Subtitle C standards applicable to land disposal. The Agency expects that this will have the effect of essentially prohibiting non-encapsulated uses of HTMR slags derived from K061, K062, and F006. With this proposal, the Agency solicits comment on possible means of demonstrating when these non-encapsulated uses do not pose significant potential risks to human health and the environment. In order to support such a demonstration, the Agency solicits comments on possible generic exclusion levels for HTMR slags used in non-encapsulated manners, and on the basis for setting these exclusion levels. The Agency will consider such comments in the context of the later rulemaking (which EPA also agreed to conduct as part of the settlement with the NRDC petitioners) to establish generic exclusion levels for encapsulated uses of HTMR slags.
