I, for example, recently got hold of a color booklet published by the Republic Health Center of the RSFSR Ministry of Health (?) [question mark as published] ``The AIDS Problem and Your Workplace,'' and I understood that ignoring haunts of vice will not save us from this foreign disease: The main danger is waylaying us everyday at ... work. The booklet clearly specifies that there are only four ways of transmitting the AIDS virus. So you only need to limit yourself in a few ways. In summary, at work you must not do the following: engage in sexual contacts with an infected person (and indeed, there are so many healthy people around!); use needles and syringes together with HIV carriers -- have some pride and bring personal ones; transfuse infected blood; and have children if you are already infected with AIDS. Adhere to the above norms and your safety is guaranteed. AIDS, while close by, will not sneak into the sterile workplace. All of this would be funny if it were not so sad. The valuable scientific material of a doctor of medical sciences has been clothed in such a strange form that one wants to respond to the publishers with some large-scale work of the type ``AIDS and the Absolute Blanks of History,'' ``AIDS and Actions During a Fire,'' and ``AIDS and the Causes of the Transport Workers Strike''... Possibly, only my sense of humor has atrophied, and the other 50,000 readers (that is the number of copies of the brochure printed) will obtain something useful for themselves. They will, for example, find out that fear of the illness passes when knowledge emerges. I don't know about others, but in my case, the fear emerged anyway: Somehow it has become frightening to go to work -- Will I suddenly fail to take some path of infection into account? And I was given this ``little booklet'' in the Central Palace of Children and Youth. This type of ``literature'' was also generously dispersed alongside a drugstore. And children hid the bright little papers in their schoolbags. And then what? School will be over soon, and I carry it to work. And there AIDS comes out and rages.
