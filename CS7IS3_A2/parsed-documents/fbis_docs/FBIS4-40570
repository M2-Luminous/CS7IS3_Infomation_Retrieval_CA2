Kozyrev, speaking at a foreign policy council meeting on Thursday, said civilised dialogue was being strengthened between Russia and the three Baltic states. The questions of human rights violations and the rights of the Russian-language population and other minorities in the Baltic region are still on the agenda, he said. The Russian foreign minister noted that the complete withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic countries would not lead to a decrease in attention paid to those questions.
