The statement said: The traitor Kim Yong-sam, a political charlatan and impostor, had once promised that he would "protect" the rice market by staking his "presidency". But, throwing away this promise like a pair of old shoes, he sold off the agricultural market vital to the South Korean peasants and people to the U.S. masters and is ruthlessly suppressing the struggle of students and farmers to defend it. What can be expected from such a renegade of democracy and traitor to the nation? The present reality shows that, with the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique left in power, the desire of the South Korean people and students for independence, democracy and reunification cannot be realised and their existence itself will be jeopardized. The traitor Kim Yong-sam should step down before he meets a miserable end, not forgetting what doom his predecessors met while brandishing the bayonet at the people. The statement called upon the South Korean students, peasants and other people to hold the flag of the patriotic struggle as high as ever to overthrow the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, guard the agricultural market and defend the dignity and interests of the nation.
