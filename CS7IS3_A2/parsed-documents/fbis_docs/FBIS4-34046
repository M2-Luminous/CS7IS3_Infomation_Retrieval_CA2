[Zedillo, interrupting] That is 14 million and an undetermined amount of other Mexicans, I do not think I would reach the 40 million figure, but there are many. Even if the figure were one, it would be too many. [Cardenas] In your economic proposal, however, which you presented on Monday to prominent members of your party and businessmen, you talked about a new economic position for sustained growth. But there is no talk of fighting poverty in specific terms. Have you planned to discuss this matter soon? [Zedillo] It is correct. [Cardenas] Or is it an omission? [Zedillo] Absolutely not. In the initial part of my speech, I said I was concentrating on purely economic matters; however, I did say that the country needs a very specific and well-designed strategy to fight poverty. In a few days, I stressed, I will give a speech on social development. In this speech, I will give details on my strategy to fight poverty in our country. I am working on that speech, and I estimate that I will give it in a few days. It is written in this document, and thus, there is no room for doubt; there is no omission. I said one of the country's most severe problems is poverty and that this problem calls for a specific strategy, like the one I will present in a few days. [Cardenas] Dr. Zedillo, many listeners have been calling since 0600. We announced in advance -- as we did with the other candidates -- that you were to be our guest today. The people sent us some questions which I am sure will be of interest to you. Perhaps some of them will be answered; unfortunately, there were many calls. But we hope to air as many as possible. [Buenol] We put them into groups because some of them are repetitious, and it will be easier to handle them this way. Dr. Jose Cultierro mentioned how badly paid doctors are in Mexico. Speaking of the economic proposal, Ruben Aguilar, Casimiro Barajas of Puebla, Miguel Angel Lucero of Puebla, Gilberto Tapia Salgado of Acapulto, Maria Refugio Hernandez of Mexico City, Rafael Mazon of Mexico City, and Mrs. Garcia of the Irrigacion neighborhood coincided in asking: Why should we believe in this economic plan when you designed the current one and it did not work? [Zedillo] I think that one must check to see whether it worked or not in the light of the magnitude of the problems Mexico had. Let us not forget that our country inherited a big economic crisis from the 1970's. In the early 1980's things became further complicated. Six years ago, our inflation rate was 200 percent, the economy was not growing, but collapsing. Our economic structure was obsolete, and, in the face of this problem, we had to reorganize, improve, and build new bases for the economy. Based on these new bases, we have to begin the stage of economic growth that we are proposing now. It would have been impossible, simply put, like an act of magic, to have been able to overcome, overnight, the problems we inherited for several decades. These were very serious problems, and it would have been impossible to switch to an economy with growth and jobs and no inflation. That simply does not exist in the realm of the possible. We had to reorganize the economy and the country. We have done it, and now we have to take advantage of the fruit of that effort through a congruent strategy. I think the value of this strategy must be taken into consideration because of its internal coherence. I insist that there are evident achievements, but there are also problems that persist. The achievements are obvious to everyone. Six years ago, the government's total debt was 70 percent of the country's production. Now, it is less than one fourth. Six years ago, the inflation rate was 200 percent, and now we have a one-digit inflation rate. Six years ago, we were experiencing a terrible financial crisis that scared away capital from our country and prevented us from growing. Six years ago, unemployment was destroying the country. Now, we are creating jobs, and, although in a very insufficient way, we do have the opportunity to make employment grow. It is a different world, but we are not happy with it. We have to work more to attain more. [Cardenas] Mr. Zedillo, you are a doctor of economics from one of the most prestigious foreign universities: Yale. You have a degree in economics from the National Polytechnic Institute. You are a man whose abilities in economics is beyond any doubt and your work is well recognized. Your devotion as an economist is unquestionable. You have proven this through your professional career. You are 43 years old. No, you are still 42, you will be 43 in December, that is correct. Undoubtedly, you are an economist; it is your devotion, but are you devoted to being a politician? [Zedillo] I believe my many years of work with the government can attest to the fact that my devotion is public service. I do not like to describe myself as a technician, a politician, this or that. But I can assure you that ever since I was a child, I had this devotion to public service. I wanted to serve my country. I have done that from positions that sometimes were purely technical and financial. Sometimes, I have had to do that from almost purely political positions, such as being education secretary, which meant heading the largest secretariat in the Mexican Government. I was in the midst of political problems that were very complex. I headed an activity that involved the federalization of education. It meant negotiating with Latin America's largest and most powerful union and the country's governors. I had to handle the federal government's relations with Mexican universities. I had to deal with many political problems, perhaps more than any other state secretary had to deal with. I would say that all that proves that I am very much attracted to public service. [Cardenas] What is the biggest problem that the Salinas de Gortari administration will bequeath to the next president, which could be you. [Zedillo] I do not think it is a problem of inheritance from one six-year term to the other. These are problems that exist in the country. The problems that seem more burdensome at a given time are those that get solved first. Six years ago, the most burdensome problem was the macroeconomy. It prevented the government from tackling any other problem. If the macroeconomy problem was not solved, we could not advance in the solution of other problems. In today's outlook, I have pointed out that Mexico's most important problems are: first, insecurity and injustice afflicting most Mexicans. It is a very grave problem. This is why I am talking about a thorough reform of our justice system. A reform that will include the laws, the Attorney General's Office, and the judicial branch. Another problem is that of unemployment. It is very grave. I have seen it. I have witnessed it throughout the country. There is the problem of the lack of income. This is what a doctor mentioned a few minutes ago. Salaries are insufficient. This is why we need the economy and productivity to grow. We need to make the economic pie bigger so we can all get a bigger piece and thus alleviate our situation. The other basic problem is poverty. Poverty is enraging because of its grave nature. These are the challenges of the coming year: justice, growth, and poverty. [passage omitted] [Cardenas] You mentioned a commitment that draws everyone's attention: the creation of 1 million jobs. You made that announcement at the National Auditorium on Monday. You talked about productive jobs, 1 million jobs each year. How have you planned this? How do you think this can be achieved with a recession? How can you create 1 million jobs? This is very costly. How can this be done without affecting the process to control inflation? There is a contraction in foreign investment. There are increasing pressures with regard to the type of exchange of the peso vis-a-vis the dollar. There is also commercial opening, globalization, NAFTA, the pressure on micro, small, and medium industries. How can you, with all this in mind, create 1 million jobs each year? [Zedillo] The answer was within the question. The economy is practically at a standstill nowadays. Thus, we must not be surprised that there are no more jobs. Simply, the economy is not absorbing more people to work, and, therefore, there is no possibility of improving the situation. What I am proposing is a strategy to achieve economic growth. Only with economic growth can we have more jobs. How will we attain economic growth? Spurring investment. What does it mean to spur investment? It means the opening of more businesses, more sources of employment in our country or expanding growing firms. The program that I explained to the citizens last week is aimed at reactivating the economy. Its goal is to have sustained growth. What for? To have the 1 million jobs you just mentioned. It is a program that does not contradict what has been done. Supposedly, we will be consolidating the economy's structural changes. It means that we will not lower our guard with regard to inflation. It means that, based on what we have done so far, we must go from a stage where emphasis was placed on stabilization and macroeconomy to a stage where economic growth must be the main concern in economic policy. The key task is the creation of jobs. If six years ago our need was to control inflation, now the emphasis must be placed on the creation and multiplication of jobs. This is the reason for the ten specific points that I announced to all. [passage omitted] [Buenol] Dr. Zedillo, one of the serious problems in our country is excessive centralism. Mr. Francisco Torres of Saltillo, Coahuila, wants to ask you how you are going to conduct an effective decentralization that can contribute to the economic reactivation of the various states if you reach the presidency. [Zedillo] We must do it by carefully reviewing our country's entire federal system. There is a huge concentration of responsibilities, resources, and authority in the federal government. This brings about inefficiency; it limits the capacity of the federal government itself, and it keeps the authorities removed from the citizens. I am proposing an effective decentralization of the country. I am not only speaking of [word indistinct]. I had the responsibility at the Public Education Secretariat to head the biggest decentralization process of our country and perhaps of all countries in the world. As public education secretary, I turned over three-fourths of the secretariat to the state governments; I turned over 100,000 schools, 700,000 employees, including teachers and support personnel. I turned over a large portion of the educational budget and 13.5 million students. If we did it in the education sector, we can do it in other fields too. We have to give them the authority and the resources because we believe that the government that is closest to the citizens has the greatest capacity to respond to the citizens. [Cardenas] The Teachers' Union complained about the decentralization process because the union lost the control it used to have. We have even talked about it with the union leader. If there is criticism to be made about your administration as education secretary, it is precisely that one. You obviously.... [Zedillo, interrupting] If you allow me, that is not the case. Decentralization was done based on a national agreement, which was signed by the Teachers' Union itself. The union played a very special and positive role, I would say the leading role, in drafting the agreement. Without their participation, it would not have been possible for us to carry out the decentralization of the education sector. The Teachers' Union has been demanding the fulfillment of each and every single one of the points of the national agreement, and they are right. They accepted federalization, and they are part of federalization. None of their union rights were adversely affected; the union's national status was not adversely affected. I would have never accepted to participate in a government action in which labor unions were adversely affected. I am a man with labor union convictions. What the labor union has been demanding is the fulfillment of the specific points of the agreement. [passage omitted]
