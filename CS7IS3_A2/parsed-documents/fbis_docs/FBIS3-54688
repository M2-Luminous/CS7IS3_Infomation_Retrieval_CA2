In its statement published today, the ministry points out that this "is another evidence of the annexationist policy" pursued by Yerevan. The ministry stated that "all responsibility for the new round of hostilities entirely rests with Armenia whose actions doom the people of Azerbaijan and its own people to new victims and sufferings" calling on the world community to condemn the Armenian aggression and impose efficient political and economic sanctions against it. The statement points out that the Armenian side neglects peacekeeping efforts by both international organizations and individual states attempting to seize more territories of Azerbaijan. The ministry said Armenians had been shelling and rocketing the bordering districts of Azerbaijan situated in the north-west of the republic since December 26 as well as the village of Sadarak belonging to the Nakhichevan autonomous republic. Armenian units undertook an attempt to launch an offensive on the north and south of Azerbaijan. The ministry said civilian villages suffered heavy damages from hundreds of shells and rockets leaving victims and destroying homes, schools, hospitals and transport communications.
