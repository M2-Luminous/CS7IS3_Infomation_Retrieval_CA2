Many Social Democratic voters are closer to us than they are to the Social Democratic Party [SDP] leadership." Kjell Dahlstrom, secretary of the Green Party, receives us in the library of the party headquarters at Kristineberg castle on Kungsholmen in Stockholm. He regards the percentagewise numerous Social Democrats as an overripe fruit, ready for picking. As party secretary, Dahlstrom is paid to be an optimist, and his confidence before the election is appropriately quite high. "We hold all the cards: the European Union [EU] issue, New Democracy is splitting up, and the other small parties are in a weak decline, while our curve is pointing upward." He studies the IMU poll, which shows that many who support the Green Party, 76 percent, also have a positive attitude toward the Social Democrats. Kjell Dahlstrom also says that the opposite is true. Excited Debate "We believe that many of those who say they want to vote for the Social Democrats would not be very well served by a Social Democratic majority government. It would be devastating; the party leadership would take over completely. They would build a bridge over Oresund and they would finesse nuclear abolition together with the Conservatives and industrial groups." On the other hand, a Social Democratic minority government would, it is thought, be forced to take its own voters' green values into account. The SDP leadership, which according to the Green Party's view of reality is cast in concrete, would be forced to listen to the environment- and solidarity-oriented party opinion. However, Kjell Dahlstrom is careful not to lock in the party as a bloc-tied government base. A heated debate was held before the last election on this issue. Now the message is the following before a potential return to the Riksdag: cooperation on issues of fact, with anyone at all. And the EU question is so good, according to Dahlstrom, that it alone should suffice to carry the party into the Riksdag. "Of course it will be an EU election. If the popular movement parties, the Center and the Social Democrats, think they can eliminate the issue from the election campaign, they are wrong." So there. But if the EU issue is to drive hordes of Euroskeptics into the Green Party camp, one wonders why it has not already done so? So far the effect of the EU question in the form of support for the Green Party is negligible. Political Superstores "It is obvious that the voters have not yet drawn a conclusion from their preferences on the EU issue. Further, both the Social Democrats and the Center Party have promptly opened branch offices for the no vote. Those parties have become political superstores: They offer everything." Dahlstrom believes in a quick dividend, however. "The convulsions we could possibly see here in connection with their conventions should be quite revealing concerning these parties not having a clear opinion about what they want for the future." The effect in the mass media in connection with the conclusion of the Swedish negotiations in Brussels should also soon be converted into beautiful, green percentage units. Experts seem to agree that the election will be about employment and the economy. Does anyone dare to vote for experimental economic policy from the Green Party? In Dahlstrom's opinion the voters do not regard the party's economic policy as a hazard. "Our ideas about shortening the workday, division of labor, and changing the tax base are well anchored in the discussion today. National economists are discussing these issues -- Jacques Delors talks about reducing working hours, and KDS [Christian Democratic Party] about changing the tax base." In the election campaign the Green Party will compete with the Left Party; the same disaffected Social Democrats are to be lured over, to a certain extent with the same bait. But Kjell Dahlstrom anticipates that history will set its communist trip wire for the left. The Green Party's phase of sectarian battles has simultaneously passed through a stage. The party has matured. Now it is just the voters who are missing.
