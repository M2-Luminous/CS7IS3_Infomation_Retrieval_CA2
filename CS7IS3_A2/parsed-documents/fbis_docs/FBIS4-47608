FBIS TRENDS-4MAY94-CHINA Beijing Announces Establishment of New Policy Banks Beijing Announces Establishment of New Policy Banks SUMMARY China's leadership is moving ahead with its strategy of creating "policy banks," recently establishing a State Development Bank and an Import and Export Bank as the first step in implementing banking reforms endorsed at the Third Plenum of the 14th Central Committee last fall. Although PRC media reports of the change have emphasized the use of bond issues to fund the State Development Bank, the leadership nevertheless appears not to have departed far from traditional financial practices in setting up the banks. PRC media, however, have failed to signal movement on another goal of banking reform, the transformation of state-owned specialized banks into market-oriented "commercial" lending institutions. END SUMMARY A Xinhua report of 13 April announced the establishment that day of the State Development Bank, describing it as a "policy- oriented" financial institution directly under the State Council. Consistent with previous media reporting on the purpose of the bank, the report said it will be responsible for the "overall regulation and control" of investment funds for "key state projects" and was established to "further deepen" reform of the investment system. On the 28th, Xinhua reported that a second policy bank--the Import and Export Bank of China--had been established on 27 April and claimed that the establishment of the bank was a "clear gesture" by the government to give "strong support" to foreign trade, in particular financing the "import and export of capital goods." First Step in Reform The creation of the two policy banks indicates that Beijing is moving ahead on the banking reforms approved by the Third Plenum of the 14th Central Committee last fall that called for separating more traditional "policy banks" from market-oriented "commercial banks." As envisioned by the plenum, commercial banks were to serve as the core of a risk-based investment system, granting loans on the basis of market assessments of project viability, while policy banks were to ensure funding for less profitable infrastructure projects deemed necessary by the state (Xinhua, 16 November 1993). Beijing's decision to move ahead first with the establishment of the State Development Bank appears to reflect in part the leadership's determination to impose central control over the unbridled investment that has resulted from senior leader Deng Xiaoping's fast growth policies and that the media have blamed for inflationary pressure and economic overheating. For example, the 13 April Xinhua report stated that, among the bank's other duties, it will "control and regulate" fixed asset investment and create a "responsible system" in the socialist market economy to "rein in excessive investment." Similarly, Premier Li Peng had linked the bank to what he said was the pressing need for regulation of investment in his Government Work Report to the National People's Congress on 10 March. He stated that the reform of the investment system this year "mainly involves" the State Development Bank, which will "check inflation and investment expansion" through the "balancing of capital" (Xinhua, 23 March). Mixed Financing Although Chinese media have reported that the new policy banks will raise capital both through direct state funding and the sale of bonds--an approach consistent with the reform postulates of the authoritative "decision" of the Third Plenum--they have attempted to give the impression that the issue of market-based bonds will be the major source of financing. For example, the 28 April Xinhua report declared that the sale of 20 billion yuan worth of bonds issued by the State Development Bank was a "success" and quoted bank president Yao Zhengyan as saying that a total of 65 billion yuan worth of three-year and five-year bonds will be issued this year. Despite efforts to emphasize reliance on this market-based approach to capital accumulation, PRC media have hinted that the purchase of the bonds by major state-owned financial institutions may not have been voluntary and that the leadership will continue to rely heavily on direct transfers from the state treasury to subsidize the development of the bank's operations. The 28 April Xinhua report, for example, quoted Yao as stating that the bonds will be purchased by state commercial banks and non-bank financial institutions "under quotas" set by the central bank. In addition, it noted that the treasury had issued a one billion yuan grant to the State Development Bank to subsidize the low- interest loans it had already extended to state projects. Similarly, Beijing's English-language paper China Daily reported that the "national treasury" had promised 50 billion yuan of registered capital to the State Development Bank "over the next four years" (24-30 April). Further demonstrating the new policy banks' dependence upon state appropriations, a 27 April Xinhua report said that the Import and Export Bank will depend upon "state financial appropriations" for its capital needs, issuing bonds only to "raise enough money" for the bank's "daily operations." Delays for Commercial Banks Despite these initial changes in the banking system, Chinese media have not been observed to report that the leadership is moving forward in remolding China's four "specialized" state banks into commercial banks along Western lines--the heart of the reformers' efforts to establish a risk-based investment system based on market principles. The China Daily report, for example, referred to such specialized state banks as the Bank of China, the Agriculture Bank, the Construction Bank, and the Industrial and Commercial Bank as purchasers of State Development Bank bonds but gave no indication that their status has been changed. The lack of progress in reforming these banks may reflect their heavy debt burden. In a speech at a national financial work conference in January, Politburo Standing Committee member and central bank chief Zhu Rongji had hinted that the specialized banks' bad loans to unprofitable state enterprises had delayed this reform. Zhu declared that specialized banks can only "begin their transition" toward commercial banks "once their policy-oriented businesses are divested" (Xinhua, 19 January). Implications Although Beijing has made a modest beginning in implementing plenum-endorsed banking reforms designed to move China closer to a market economy, the establishment of the two new policy banks appears designed as much to strengthen central control over investment through the traditional direct channeling of treasury funds as to allocate investment capital through market-based incentives. Possibly fearful of exacerbating current inflationary pressures, the leadership appears to have put the more risky banking reforms--the establishment of a market-driven commercial banking sector--on hold.
