Yixi lives in Nangxian County, Nyingchi Prefecture, in the eastern part of the Tibet Autonomous Region. Although Tibet is located on the roof of the world, Nangxian, Bowo, Mainling, Medog and other counties of the prefecture lie at an altitude of less than 3,000 meters above sea level. Farmers in the prefecture, known as the key regional production centers for fruit and pork, have a tradition of cultivating their courtyard economy. "I was inspired by the high cost of transport of dried fruit from outside to Tibet to expand my orchard and sell fruit on the local market," Yixi said. Almost all families in Nangxian County now have fruit trees and many bring the fruit to nearby counties to exchange for wool and meat. A survey shows that the income from the courtyard economy accounts for one fifth of the gross income in the rural county. Farmers in Bowo County, on the Sichuan-Tibet Highway, are more enthusiastic about raising livestock. Dogye, a farmer in Xumo Township, Bowo County, obtains more than 7,000 yuan a year from raising 40 pigs annually. "It is common for a family to raise some 50 pigs a year in my hometown, just like me," he said. In addition, farmers in this area have more than 30,000 apple and walnut trees and produce 550 tons of dried and fresh fruit a year. The gross income from the courtyard economy in Bowo County, with a population of less than 20,000, amounted to about six million yuan in 1993. An official of Nyingchi Prefecture said that the income of farmers and herdsmen in the prefecture averaged over 1,000 yuan per capita last year, twice as much as rural people in other parts of the region. The official attributed the rise of income to the courtyard economy. The Nangxian County government plans to increase the number of courtyard-planted fruit trees by 23,500 this year by offering saplings purchased from the interior parts of the country to farmers free of charge, as well as technical services. Gyaca County government has spent 100,000 yuan on buying 80,000 saplings of apple and peach from central Henan Province for its farmers. It also encourages and helps local farmers to raise pigs and chickens.
