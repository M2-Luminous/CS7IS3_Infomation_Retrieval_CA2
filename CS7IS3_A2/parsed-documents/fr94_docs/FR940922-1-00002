FR940922-1-00002 FR940922-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 9 CFR Part 92 [Docket No. 93&hyph;096&hyph;2] Horses From Mexico; Quarantine Requirements AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: We are proposing to amend the regulations regarding the importation of horses from Mexico to remove the requirement that such horses be quarantined for not less than 7 days in vector-proof quarantine facilities before being imported into the United States. We believe this action is warranted because Mexico has reported no cases of Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) in over a year, and it appears that horses imported from Mexico without a 7-day quarantine would not pose a risk of transmitting VEE to horses in the United States. DATES: Consideration will be given only to comments received on or before November 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: Please send an original and three copies of your comments to Chief, Regulatory Analysis and Development, PPD, APHIS, USDA, room 804, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782. Please state that your comments refer to Docket No. 93&hyph;096&hyph;2. Comments received may be inspected at USDA, room 1141, South Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays. Persons wishing to inspect comments are requested to call ahead on (202) 690&hyph;2817 to facilitate entry into the comment reading room. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Joyce Bowling, Staff Veterinarian, Import-Export Animals Staff, National Center for Import and Export, Veterinary Services, APHIS, USDA, room 764, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;8170. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The regulations in 9 CFR part 92, referred to below as the regulations, govern the importation into the United States of specified animals and animal products, including horses from Mexico, to prevent the introduction into the United States of various animal diseases. On August 27, 1993, we published an interim rule in the Federal Register (58 FR 45236&hyph;45238, Docket No. 93&hyph;096&hyph;1) in which we required that horses imported into the United States from Mexico be quarantined for not less than 7 days in a vector-free facility. Prior to our interim rule, horses intended for importation from Mexico were not required to be held in quarantine for any specified number of days, but were required, instead, to be quarantined only long enough to complete the testing required by the regulations. A 7-day quarantine became necessary when the government of Mexico reported that Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) had been detected in horses in that country. VEE is an equine viral disease, transmitted primarily by mosquitoes and other hematophagous (blood-feeding) insects, particularly flying insects, that results in a high mortality rate in animals infected with the disease. Although tests exist for the presence of VEE in horses, the tests currently available may yield positive results for horses that have been vaccinated for VEE but that are not otherwise affected with the disease. The most efficient method for initial identification of horses that may be infected with VEE is observation of the horses for clinical signs of the disease. A horse will usually exhibit signs of VEE within 2&hyph;5 days after contracting the disease. Seven days is considered the length of time necessary to ensure that any clinical signs of VEE manifest themselves. In this document, we are proposing to remove the requirement that horses from Mexico be quarantined for not less than 7 days. We believe the removal of this requirement is warranted because Mexico appears to be free of VEE. The last case of VEE in Mexico was reported in July 1993. Following the initial outbreak of VEE in the Mexican State of Chiapas in June 1993, the Government of Mexico instituted emergency measures to locate, contain, and eradicate the disease. These emergency measures included the following: Activation of the country's animal health emergency group; organization of groups such as regional livestock associations and State authorities; establishment of quarantines in areas in which the disease was known to exist; vaccination of horses in affected areas; traceback of horses that might have been moved from affected areas before quarantine measures were established; and increased surveillance in States surrounding the affected areas. Based on these considerations, the government of Mexico has requested that the U.S. Department of Agriculture consider Mexico to be free of VEE. Based on the documentation submitted by the government of Mexico, it appears that no horses in that country are affected with VEE. (This documentation is available, upon written request, from the person listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. ) Therefore, we are proposing to amend ยง92.324 of the regulations to remove the requirement that horses intended for importation from Mexico be quarantined for not less than 7 days before being imported into the United States. We are also proposing to remove the requirement in ยง92.324 that horses from Mexico intended for importation into the United States through land border ports be quarantined in Mexico at a facility approved by the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and constructed so as to prevent the entry of mosquitoes and other hematophagous insects. This requirement was necessary when VEE was known to exist in horses in Mexico, but we believe it is unnecessary now that Mexico appears to be free of VEE. Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, we have prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis regarding the impact of this proposed rule on small entities. We do not currently have all the data necessary for a comprehensive analysis of the effects of this rule on small entities. Therefore, we are inviting comments concerning potential impacts. In particular, we are interested in determining the number and kind of small entities that may incur benefits or costs from implementation of this proposed rule. In accordance with 21 U.S.C. 111, the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to promulgate regulations to prevent the introduction or dissemination of any contagious, infectious, or communicable disease of animals from a foreign country into the United States. In accordance with 21 U.S.C. 102, the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to quarantine livestock imported into the United States. This proposed rule would remove the requirement that horses imported from Mexico be quarantined for 7 days at vector-proof quarantine facilities. We believe this action is warranted because it appears that Mexico is free of Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE), and that horses imported from Mexico without a 7-day quarantine would not pose a risk of transmitting VEE to horses in the United States. Compared with the 5-month period from October 1992 through February 1993 (pre-interim rule), there was a significant decline in the number of horses imported from Mexico during the period from October 1993 through February 1994 (following publication of the interim rule). During the 1992/1993 5-month period, there were 3,772 horses imported from Mexico, compared with only 125 during the 1993/1994 5-month period. It is reasonable to assume that the additional costs associated with the quarantine were at least partially responsible for the reduction in the number of horses imported during the 1993/1994 period. There is a $50 hourly fee for inspection services conducted in Mexico by APHIS veterinary medical officers (in addition to an APHIS per horse charge of $28.50). Assuming that APHIS services would be rendered for 2 hours during each day of quarantine, and assuming an average quarantine period of 3 days prior to the VEE interim rule and 7 days following the interim rule, the reduction in user fee costs from the lifting of the restrictions due to VEE would be about $400 per shipment ($700 minus $300). For an average shipment of 40 horses, the savings in fees would be about $10 per head.
