Churkin noted that Karadzic had given this promise under two conditions: the presence of Russian military observers, which -- in his words -- was possible to organize within 48 hours, and the presence of Serb liaison officers, which was an element in the initial UN document on opening Tuzla airport. The Russian envoy stressed that the other side did not accept the presence of Serb liaison officers at this airport but he nevertheless said he hoped other participants would continue negotiations with the Muslim government on this issue since this was a very important humanitarian issue. We also agreed that in seeking a political solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina one should take account of the interests and sovereign rights of all three constituent peoples, he stressed. We agreed that there were ways of stimulating the difficult negotiating process, the Russian special envoy added. Karadzic said that today's meeting was one in a series of working meetings characterized by a high degree of understanding and that he was satisfied with the fact that it had been stated in clear terms that the Serbs should have the same sovereign rights as the Muslims and Croats in Bosnia. The Serb side is trying to adjust its interests to the situation as we are determined to contribute to a final solution, particularly peace, Karadzic said. He stressed that the Serbs in Bosnia have a need for special relations with Yugoslavia. We must seek solutions within this framework, Karadzic said in conclusion.
