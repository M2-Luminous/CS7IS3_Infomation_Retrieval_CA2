There are limits to our patience, he said. In his 11th annual meeting with the media, President Mubarak said Egyptians are good-natured people linked to the Sudanese people with bonds of brotherhood and cordiality. He added: The Sudanese Government will not provoke us into taking a position that harms the Sudanese people, whose well-being is a matter of concern to Egypt. The president denied reports that 10,000 Egyptian soldiers have been sent to Hala'ib [on the Sudanese border]. There is no justification for such a step, he said. He said the Sudanese Government's provocations against Egypt are meant to cover up Sudan's internal problems. Sudan's accusations against Egypt are shameful, he said. The president added: I am seeking to establish peace throughout the world, so how can I seek a conflict with Sudan? They are trying to provoke us, but we will not be provoked unless our security is harmed. The acts they committed against Egypt are minor ones. On Yemen's problem, President Mubarak said Egypt supports a Yemeni unity established on the right foundations, not one imposed by force. What is happening in Yemen, he said, shows that the unity was not well-thought out. He said he had conveyed this view to Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. What is important now, the president said, is to stop the fighting, disengage the troops, and then begin a constructive dialogue. Only arms dealers will benefit from a continuation of the war, and the Yemeni people will be the victims, he said. In his statements, the president also discussed a number of domestic issues. He stressed that a housing law will not be issued until a thorough study has been completed by all sides and parties; it should be satisfactory to everybody, he said. President Mubarak ruled out any dangers or contamination in the Nile's water as a result of the war in Rwanda. He said terrorism is not a threat to Egypt, and efforts are under way to eliminate and uproot it. Everything is being done cautiously, he said. [passage omitted]
