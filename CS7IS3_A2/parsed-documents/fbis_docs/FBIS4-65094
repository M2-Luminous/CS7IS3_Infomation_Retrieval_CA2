FBIS4-65094 "drweu092_h_94003" FBIS-WEU-94-092 Daily Report 11 May 1994 GERMANY Kohl, Yeltsin News Conference Kohl, Yeltsin News Conference LD1105184294 Berlin N-TV in German 1540 GMT 11 May 94 LD1105184294 Berlin N-TV German BFN [Joint news conference by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Russian President Boris Yeltsin with unidentified foreign and domestic correspondents in Bonn and short statement by German Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt; Yeltsin speaks in Russian with superimposed German translation -- live; broadcast in progress] [Text] [Kohl] ...Another key subject in our talks -- they will of course be continued tomorrow -- is the subject of security and stability in Europe. I have once again discussed with President Yeltsin the goals of the NATO partners as expressed at the NATO summit in January this year. We Germans are interested in Russia supporting and participating in the proposed NATO Partnership for Peace program. We also discussed the most acute threat to European security and stability, namely the conflict in former Yugoslavia. We both agreed -- this also applies to the talks held on this matter by our two foreign ministers in particular -- that after the most recent escalation, a solution to the conflict in Bosnia is particularly urgent. Our two countries and the ministers responsible are playing an active part in the so-called contact group consisting of representatives of the United Nations, the European Union [EU], Russia, the United States, and France, Great Britain, and Germany. The goal of these joint efforts is to achieve a comprehensive cease-fire in Bosnia as soon as possible, and to work resolutely toward enabling the parties to the conflict to achieve a peace plan. The day after tomorrow, a meeting will take place between the five foreign ministers from the contact group. I hope that this discussion too, will lead further in this direction. Ladies and gentlemen, in bilateral terms German-Russian relations are free of the strains and problems we have unfortunately known so often in the past. We have discussed a number of matters of particular common interest. These covered, among other things, the establishment of a joint historical commission for research into recent German-Soviet, German-Russian history. Both President Yeltsin and myself are most interested in this, and will bring our influence to bear here to ensure that this commission begins its activities very soon -- and we have agreed that very soon means by the end of June. We also discussed the repatriation of cultural artifacts removed during circumstances of war. You are aware of the legal basis for this enshrined in the German-Russian cultural agreement. We have received a report from the first session, which took place recently. One or two matters have still to be clarified. Again, both of us are very keen to see this work make very swift progress. We also agreed that the next meeting -- which I expect to produce quite concrete results -- will take place by mid-June, that is four weeks from now. Then, ladies and gentlemen, we talked about a subject that is currently coming in for a great deal of discussion -- here in Germany and also in Russia -- that is, the farewell ceremony for the Russian soldiers leaving Germany. President Yeltsin and I will jointly conduct this farewell ceremony on 31 August. I attach particular importance to the farewell for the Russian soldiers in Germany taking place in a worthy, respectful manner, and in a spirit of friendship. We have agreed that the whole event will take place in Berlin. In that context we agreed that we intend to see to the details personally, to do justice to the aims I explained before. I would like to add a second matter, which resulted in misunderstandings that I in some respects found incomprehensible. I will now examine why. You are aware that in the original proposal, I presented the idea that we should meet in Weimar on that day. The underlying idea was and is that in addition to the farewell to the soldiers -- who were at the head of the military and martial part of our history -- we should express appreciation for the long, common cultural experience of our nations, and not least go to Weimar, where the cradle of modern democracy in Germany -- the adoption of the first democratic Reich constitution [Weimar Constitution of 11 August 1919] -- took place. Since this idea met with incomprehension, and since I would like to avoid further misunderstandings here, we both agreed today that at a later date -- but not postponed until an indefinite time -- at a foreseeable time, we will meet in Weimar and take the opportunity to invite men and women who have played a major part in the cultural life of our nations to a joint event, to bring to life and make clear for everyone the great common cultural traditions of our nations. I pointed out again earlier in our talks that we share a lengthy common chapter in a great common culture, be it in philosophy, painting, or music, and not least literature and poetry and much else besides. It is our joint desire -- and I am very grateful to President Yeltsin that he thinks as I do -- it is our joint desire that this great, respectful tradition in the two countries will become evident here. Of course, bilateral economic relations have also played a great role in this connection. I want to express my desire once again to German industry that we hope that as many German companies as possible will invest in Russia. President Yeltsin will take the opportunity to talk to major German business representatives about this subject during his visit to Stuttgart on Friday [13 May], above all about the conditions -- which are repeatedly discussed in Germany -- for foreign investors so that these conditions also improve in Russia. We also discussed the relations that have evolved between eastern German enterprises and Russian partner enterprises. These contacts have been very much to our disadvantage [word indistinct] due to the problems of adapting over the last few years. This was discussed, also successfully -- my colleague [Economics Minister] Rexrodt will announce some details of this afterward in the discussion. In a word, ladies and gentlemen, it is only the first stage of the visit, but this is an opportunity to open a new chapter in the history of our nations, continually improving German-Russian relations. Russia is, from the German point of view, our most important neighbor. In the ups and downs of history we have shared many experiences and did each other a great deal of harm. I think it is now very important not to forget history, to try and learn from it, both now and in the future -- the future means the 21st century in six years -- to set the right signals for the coming generations of our nations. Mr. President, may I ask you to take the floor? [Yeltsin] Federal Chancellor, Ladies and Gentlemen: The first few hours of my stay on the hospitable soil of Germany have been very intense. I am pleased with the results of the talks that took place today with President Richard von Weizsaecker and with Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The talks with Herr Kohl were conducted in an open and friendly atmosphere, and this has already become a good tradition with him, and this reflects the special character that has marked the relations between our two states in recent years. The results of the talks have demonstrated the unity of our views and of German-Russian relations. With the federal chancellor, we agreed that in recent years we have come a long way toward each other. We have succeeded in overcoming the overwhelming majority of the problems that have burdened us since the war. The agreements (?reached at our previous meetings) are working, and in particular after my official visit two years ago. Already 38 large joint projects are being realized. Federal Chancellor Kohl and I discussed at length the conclusion in August this year of the stay of Russian troops in Germany. We agreed that the Russian troops should be sent off in a dignified fashion and to give this event a ceremonial character, in Berlin, and this farewell should be a symbol of the end of a certain stage of history and the entry of our two states and Europe as a whole into a new era of relations and a new era of reconciliation. Also, this will be a prologue to what will take place on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. At the same time Russia and Germany have declared themselves in favor of this anniversary being given a common impulse, and so we are proposing that in the political declaration that is planned for December 1994 for the meeting of the heads of state of the CSCE states in Budapest, some special statements should be adopted dedicated to the end of World War II 50 years ago. These sentences should reflect the principles of the world order and the relations with which the participating states of the CSCE approach the third millenium. We also touched on the problems of human rights and democracy. Life has brought us in different ways to these objectives. Russia now also finds itself on the road to upholding democratization. This process cannot be described as painless. On this road various speeds can be (?adopted), various ways of progressing, and various methods of democratization appropriate to the state of society. But there is no turning back, nor will there be. We are not giving up on progress, nor will we do so. This is demonstrated by the development of events following the Russians' vote for the new constitution and the parliamentary elections. The recent signing by Russia's leading political forces -- which number several hundred -- of a Treaty on Public Accord reiterated that the majority of Russians continue to support the implementation of peaceful transformations and political changes in society. Economic cooperation between our two countries likewise featured prominently in our talks today. Germany remains Russia's largest trading partner. Given the problems currently facing Russia in the period of restructuring, it is virtually impossible to avoid certain shortcomings. There are temporary difficulties, but I am sure that we will be capable of surmounting these difficulties. We agreed to devote the greatest attention to such fields of cooperation as energy, conversion of the defense industry, mechanical engineering, and support for small and medium-sized businesses, especially on the operational side. We also proposed using such effective mechanisms for economic relations as interest-free commercial credit or the swing, to use its other name. Our discussions of economic problems and the problems of economic relations will continue tomorrow. Our exchange of views on international issues was very intensive. The new nature of German-Soviet [as heard] relations and the atmosphere of trust that marks my present contacts with Chancellor Kohl dictate our countries' actions on international issues. Now that we have embarked on the path of democratic development, Russia wants to develop side by side with the whole democratic world. The maintenance of peace and security in the face of new global problems demands comprehensive development of the processes of integration. Russia does not view itself as standing aside from these processes, and this explains our desire to take part in all international involvements, in the G-7 industrial countries, and in cooperation in the NATO Partnership for Peace program, taking account of Russia's importance. The federal chancellor reiterated Germany's previously expressed view that it is necessary for Russia to play a weighty part -- and he spoke about Russia joining the G-7 -- about cooperation between Russia and the EU, and about Russia's involvement from the outset in the new post-Cocom [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls] export regime. I expressed our continued support for Germany at the United Nations. Russia regards Germany as a worthy candidate for permanent membership of the UN Security Council when such a decision is made. We agree that it is necessary to strengthen the NPT [nuclear nonproliferation treaty]: This treaty must be made unlimited in duration, and a situation must be created that will make it possible to conclude an agreement on a universal test ban throughout the whole world. Finally, we also discussed in detail with Chancellor Kohl the question of the development of the situation in Bosnia and agreed that we will do everything to bring this war in Bosnia to an end, so that the settling of the problems of former Yugoslavia can be achieved. In this direction also, we must work more closely and on the basis of the resolutions of the United Nations and the CSCE. Thank you for your attention, and I am ready to answer your questions. [German Economics Minister Rexrodt] Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen. My colleague Aleksandr Shokhin and I have held talks, among other things about the order for the DWA plane in Annendorf. As you know, without Russian orders this plant would not, for the foreseeable future, be used to full capacity. After thorough preparation, in which retired State Secretary Koehler was involved, but also Mr. Shokhin and myself, we have today agreed that for 1994 the Russian side will place an order worth 500 million marks [DM] for passenger trains with Halle-Annendorf. We will again be making an exception and guaranteeing this order with special conditions. For 1995 there will be other orders, but on a smaller scale, and the whole thing will be replaced -- and here German and Russian interests meet -- by comprehensive cooperation in the field of the manufacture of passenger trains. This means that the DWA, but quite possibly other firms as well, will work closely in Russia on the extension and the setting up of Russian passenger train construction plants. This close cooperation will incidentally extend to other economic fields, in particular in the area of high technology. I am very pleased that with this we are able to give a very positive signal to the new laender -- for Saxony-Anhalt, for Halle, and for the passenger train makers in Halle-Annendorf. Thank you. [Yeltsin] We have agreed on DM500 million for 1994, and the Russian Government will make a decision to this effect. Second, for 1995, the task has been assigned to draw up a separate agreement between the two sides and to lay down precisely the scope of this order. [Interfax correspondent] Boris Nikolayevich, I would like to ask you the following question. After everything you have said here about your talks with the chancellor, to what extent has Europe come closer to a lasting and just peace? This question is above all asking about a just peace, since that is particularly important for Russia. [Yeltsin] Of course, you understand very well that the securing of a comprehensive peace and comprehensive security in Europe does not depend on bilateral agreements alone. But the fact that two very important states are in agreement, one of 150 million people, the other of 80 million -- Germany is the second largest country in Europe after Russia -- this suggests that we will also find it easier in relations with other states with regard to a unified security system in Europe. [Correspondent] Chancellor Kohl, you have both already touched on the role and the goals of NATO. Did you also discuss the question of whether a special relationship with NATO could be found for Russia -- that is, a system of relations that could go beyond the Partnership for Peace? Thank you. [Yeltsin] You are absolutely right. You have formulated the question very precisely. Of course, we cannot simply sign the document on Partnership for Peace -- which we basically agree with --and sign it without a special protocol with NATO. That means there will have to be a further document with NATO, in which a number of concrete questions on Russia's special features are laid down. Special features in the sense that, for example, an army of 3 million men is there, with the attendant technical equipment, and that, for example, there is equipment there that does not match NATO's unified standards. There is a whole series of questions, but we are already starting this May to lay down work on this protocol together with NATO. After the protocol with NATO has been signed -- and I don't think there will be any major insoluble questions for NATO on this -- then we will also sign the document on the Partnership for Peace. [Correspondent] Boris Nikolayevich, Mr. Chancellor, a question to you both: You have already addressed this to some extent -- Russia's cooperation with international organizations. I would like to ask more specifically about the G-7. Boris Nikolayevich and you, Mr. Chancellor, how do you assess the transformation of the G-7 into a G-8, and how do you regard the issue generally? [Kohl] Clearly, in the time ahead -- I am not referring to the meeting in Naples in a few weeks but in the years to come -- a G-8 will come about [word indistinct]. This is not something I alone can determine; it is a matter for talks, and like the agreements in the G-7 sphere, it is a procedure whereby the party doing the inviting, that is, the host, must have a say, but of course with the relevant feedback. We will no doubt discuss the issue in connection with overall developments at our Naples meeting, but as I said -- I am repeating my first sentence -- developments are quite clearly heading in this direction, and from the German point of view this is desirable. [Yeltsin] I would like to add a few words. This question is topical; it is no longer the same Russia as three, five, or 10 years ago. Russia is taking a democratic path, Russia is going over to a market economy. Half of the companies in Russia are currently already private companies. It is a Russia that from 1917 to 1989 did not even know what private ownership meant. Russia is a big country, a superpower. For that reason it has the moral right to take part in the tackling of international issues that are addressed by the politicians of the seven leading states, that is, Russia should become the eighth country. However, at the same time we understand that this issue cannot be settled at once in one step. We therefore discussed with Helmut Kohl that the first stage must be concluded, that we should participate in the preparatory drafting of the political issues and their discussion. The same applies to security issues, and that in a second stage after Naples we should also be involved in economic questions and that there should then be a G8 next year, but not yet now in Naples. [Correspondent] President, Colonel General Burlakov [commander in chief of Russian forces in Germany] and the leadership of the Red Army has always insisted that there should be a joint farewell parade of the troops of all four allies from Germany. Your statement now and your agreement with Helmut Kohl -- how do you think this can be harmonized with feelings in the Red Army and the leadership of the Red Army? [Yeltsin] Well, I don't think I quite understand. To start with, there is no Red Army any more, and the question is not very comprehensible either. There was a Red Army in 1917. [Correspondent from Russian TV station NTV] Boris Nikolayevich, I would like to return to the question of the farewell ceremony for the Russian soldiers. You know very well that this question has met with a very sensitive reaction in Russia -- one could go so far as to use the word discontent. What can you say to us about this problem; what have you discussed with the chancellor in this respect? [Yeltsin] I am very content that my friend Helmut Kohl has sensed the mood in our society and the mood of the president as well. One cannot of course do things in such a way that might destabilize the political situation in Russia. For this reason he very rapidly came forward with the proposal that we should perform all the ceremonies in Berlin but separately, without the Allies. [Correspondent] One question for the chancellor, one question to President Yeltsin. Chancellor, the G-7 has until now been defined as an association of the strongest economic states of --to use an earlier term -- the free world, in other words the six Western states plus Japan. So how does the future role of Russia, which is certainly a large, powerful, respected country, fit in? [passage indistinct] [Correspondent] A question to President Yeltsin. People in Germany have a lot of trust in you, but there are concerns in Germany about nationalist developments in Russia. What would you say to those citizens who are concerned about extremist nationalist tendencies in parts of Russia? [Yeltsin] Please understand that there have been conflagrations in many countries of the CIS, that wars are in progress there, and, among other things, these are nationalist-based wars. One nation is fighting another, one region is fighting another. In Russia alone, in which there are 21 national republics, 88 components of the federation, no blood has yet been shed for those reasons. Yes, it is true that some extremists are shouting -- it is not much different in your own country. But we have no fear of Zhirinovskiy. No, no, we don't fear him. No, he has no power base and he won't have any in the future either, since Russia, which went through the 1941-1945 war, knows what nationalism means. [Correspondent from Russian TV] Boris Nikolayevich, could you explain to us the essence of Russian policy on the ethnic German Russians? [Yeltsin] As we had agreed, there is a commission that started its work two years ago. As you know, there are already national districts. We naturally do not by any means want to lose the Germans in our regions. We do not want them all to emigrate, not by any means. We want them to live in our country -- that they work in our country so they can live well in our country -- and our work is channelled in that direction. This work is being done at the moment. [Correspondent] Boris Nikolayevich, here there is a lot of polemicizing about the repatriation of works of art that came to Russia during World War II. What is the Russian president's opinion on this? [Yeltsin] What would you think if an officer here stole books in a library and took them with him to Russia? How should we actually judge that? What should we think of it? That is to say, this question is extremely complicated, and cannot be resolved at one go. We cannot say it must be resolved in the course of repatriation and that the Germans have also taken things from Russia, and various objects have gone here and there. In any case, we cannot work out where more artifacts have ended up, and so we have set up a joint commission to work on this, involving the Russian minister for cultural affairs, and the minister from Germany. They have been working, but they have been working poorly and slowly. What is that, one meeting a year? But they have of course already resolved some of the questions. They have decided that there are many of our cultural artifacts here that will have to be given back; there is the Gotha library, which will have to be returned. That is the situation. But today we decided with the chancellor that the work of this commission will have to be speeded up--that is the first thing. The next point is that the second meeting will have to take place by 15 June. Third, by the end of this year, Helmut Kohl and I will agree on and sign a schedule for the further meetings of this commission. But we will clearly not intervene in what the experts, the professionals, have to do. We will naturally bow to the decisions made by the commission, the professionals. [Voice, in Russian] That is enough -- the last question. [Correspondent] How do you see Russia's prospects for accession? In the EU there is some movement on this question. How do you see it? [Kohl] I do not think this question is topical in the sense of the agenda. You know that we in the EU have just undergone a very difficult process in the parliament last week and agreed on an EU enlargement involving Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway. These countries now have to pursue this path in their own referenda. The definition of the EU with regard to Central, East, and southeastern Europe is still entirely unresolved. I am firmly of the opinion that we should now do what is most important with respect to the EU and Russia. That is, we should actively address the questions of association, of working together, particularly in the economic sphere. A number of questions still have to be solved, but I very much hope that it will be possible to sign the texts now available in the very foreseeable future. Everything else is a development in the distant future. That involves two kinds of decision -- those who wish it, and the others who [word indistinct]. I regard it as entirely out of the question for us to make a statement at this time. [Yeltsin] My position on this: Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl has assured me that when Germany holds the EU presidency it will very emphatically support the conclusion of the agreement between Russia and the EU so that this takes place within a month if possible. That means that everything must be agreed upon, the quotas, the cargoes, the goods, the market, and so on. There are hundreds of issues. We still have to overcome this final stage and then everything will develop in this way. We must not, of course, forget that Russia is a European country even though we are also in Asia. But one has to consider then that Russia should belong to the Council of Europe.
