The new accusations, made in an interview with BBC World Service Wednesday night, follows comments from Foreign Office Minister Douglas Hogg, falsely describing Iran as a "factor of instability in the region" during a visit to Qatar. Both remarks are uncharacteristic of the norms of diplomatic protocol that supposed to be based upon mutual respect and are seen jeopardizing the already strained relations between the two countries after the reciprocal expulsion of senior diplomats. In his interview, Hurd claimed that the expulsions, started by Britain last Thursday, were "not a game," but believed that it was up to Iran, and not Britain, to ensure that the tit-for-tat exchanges did not continue. The sting in his remarks was in resorting to old allegations about Iran's "supposed involvement in terrorism", which have not been heard from a British minister since Tehran severed relations with London in 1989. The foreign secretary cited the Rushdie affair and orchestrated smears about Iran's links with the IRA to maintain that it was Tehran, and not London, that should change its behavior before there could be "decent relations" between the two countries. But he made no mention of the `forged documents' issued earlier in the day by the Foreign Office that apparently hoodwinked no one into believing its claim of Iran's involvement in discrediting Britain's already discredited policy in Bosnia. The documents disclosed are two among many floating around over the past year and are so ludicrously written that it is an insult to even the most illiterate to suggest they were produced by "Iran's intelligence service", as claimed by the Foreign Office. Even more incredible were the conflicting statements put out by the Foreign Office, which came after maintaining last week that its excuse for expelling an Iranian first secretary would remain confidential because of its apparent childish nature. Hurd's tact in his interview was to claim that it was now impossible to go on "excusing inexcusable behavior." But behind his words, the question left open as to who was trying to convince whom about who in stooping so low to worsen the diplomatic row. The sudden change of events in Britain's relations with Iran can be traced to the U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit to London on April 25, when he was reported to have asked for further UK support in Washington's campaign to isolate Iran. With Hurd due to meet Christopher in Oxford this Saturday, it is presumed that he can be briefed about subsequent campaign that was launched with the smears about the IRA [Irish Republican Army] links only four days after his visit. But still left to be answered by the British Government is the earlier embarrassing discovery of an intelligence service bug in the Iranian Embassy, which the succession of UK insults have been trying to camouflage. Indications are that Britain's increasingly erratic and often eccentric foreign policy is the result of a power-struggle, where hardline anti-Iran opinion currently has the upperhand to produce unpalatable behavior reminiscent of its colonial past.
