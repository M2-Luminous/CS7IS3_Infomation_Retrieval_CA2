This constructive discussion can be assessed from the following viewpoints: The distance between us and our co-religionist brothers and the lack of the proper conditions for creating an "atmosphere of discussion" with them, has only generated numerous ambiguities on both sides. These ambiguities could be clearly perceived in the nature of the issues raised by the Kuwaiti delegates. This places an immense responsibility on our shoulders and those of our colleagues in Kuwait and other Persian Gulf countries. In other words, a regular exchange of opinions and ideas by nonofficial individuals on the regional level can provide a clear impression of the attitude of the officials and on the other hand, can prove to be an important factor in fostering greater closeness and understanding among the peoples. The presence of the Kuwaiti guests in Iran and their discussions with their Iranian colleagues could prove to be the beginning of a new and dynamic move beneficial to the regional nations. For many years, despite Iran's constant declaration of its good intentions and its desire for extensive relations with other countries of the region based on good neighborliness, the fomenters of tension and those who wish to gain by generating tension have continued to spread propaganda to the contrary. Adverse propaganda by the fomenters of tension from outside the region and by those pursuing illicit interests has resulted in many of our brothers in this country adopting certain erroneous stances on the basis of this tension-creating propaganda. The cordial visit to Iran by a delegation of Kuwait professors, writers, and journalists marks the initiation of a wholesome trend of exchanging views and perceptions among those who play the greatest role in moulding the interests and inclinations of the officials and elucidating ideas for the peoples of the region. Without doubt, a continuous exchange of opinions and the expansion of this trend to the regional level will help to eliminate many misunderstandings and fallacious conclusions; and the regional countries will thus achieve better mutual understanding. This will provide a suitable bedrock of culture, inclinations and joint interests, and will become a precursor for the creation of an "atmosphere of discussions and exchanges of views." We take this opportunity of the visit of our Kuwaiti brothers to Iran to extend a similar invitation to all our colleagues in the other regional countries, to whom we wish to play host. Conversely, we are also ready to be guests in their countries. In this manner, our co-religionist brothers will be able to discuss various issues in a cordial way and so bring the nations closer together. We extend our hands to them to create this atmosphere of discussion and exchanges of views among nonofficial individuals (writers, journalists, university professors, and others who do not have any official restrictions) and to our colleagues in other countries of the region. At least discussions among us will have the advantage of being held in a cordial and fraternal atmosphere, and the media and extraneous official influences will not be able to affect the opinions and inclinations of the people of the region. These influences are the factors that generate tension and create a climate of suspicion and hostility, and this path is to the detriment of the nations of the region.
