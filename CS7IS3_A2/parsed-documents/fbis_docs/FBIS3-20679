Lazanski: "With Missiles at Serb Humanitarian Aid Helicopter"] [Text] The camera of Ognjen Radosevic, photographic reporter of SRPSKA VOJSKA, the journal of the army of the republic of Srpska, took an exclusive photograph [reproduced in POLITIKA] in the sky above Romania [a mountain in Bosnia]. On this occasion, a Turkish F-16 fighter-bomber, as part of the NATO patrol that continuously flies in the skies over the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, encountered a humanitarian aid MI-8 helicopter of the army of the republic of Srpska with visible Red Cross markings. Nonetheless, the Turkish pilot fired two short-range air-to-air Sidewinder missiles at the humanitarian aid helicopter. The Serbian pilots, through skillful antimissile maneuvers, avoided both Sidewinder missiles, and the lighted trail of these projectiles is seen in the lower left corner of the photograph. The Turkish F-16 fighter did not want to risk a new attack and got away from the area of this unusual aerial settling of accounts.
