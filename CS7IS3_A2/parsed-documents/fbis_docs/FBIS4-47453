Comparison with data obtained from the three methods permitted differential evaluation of the effects of the drugs on learning. Nooglutil and piracetam have no effect on avoidance learning in a shuttle box or on the T-maze reflex. In a Skinner box, nooglutil accelerated the formation of the escape and avoidance responses, while piracetam improved only the escape response. The reason for enhanced performance in a Skinner box is that the inherent worsening of performance due to ambiguous cause and effect relations is countered by the nootropic drugs. Nootropic drugs have no effect on the formation of memory pathways in conditions that are not accompanied by functional disruption of higher nervous activity in both positive and negative reinforcement.
