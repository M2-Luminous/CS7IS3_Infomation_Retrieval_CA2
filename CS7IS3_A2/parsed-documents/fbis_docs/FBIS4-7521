Zoric says that this truly might be a strategic turnaround in Croatian policy, but he adds that caution must be maintained with respect to the results of that agreement. "Some Croatian opposition parties, especially Drazen Budisa and the HSLS, the Bosnian Croats, and the Franciscans have come out in favor of a Croat-Muslim agreement, and they did so at a point when it was not so popular, nor did it bring political success with most of the public. If at least one human life would have been saved, the agreement would have been successful. "Nevertheless, those who have now come into their own should not be euphoric, nor should they hunt scapegoats, but should proceed cautiously so that the agreement really bears fruit, because implementing it will be painful," Zoric warns. [Podgornik] What do you think about the confederation of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina? [Zoric] Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina can enter into definite intergovernmental relations only after they become sovereign over their entire territory. It is in the interest of Croatia for Bosnia and Herzegovina to remain an integral state, and for the Croats to be equal citizens in it. But it seems as though some people see in this proposal a confederation of a truncated Croatia with a detached piece of Bosnia and Herzegovina. That would be a triumph for the conception held by Serbian expansionism, which means death to both Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, because those two states, whether in confederation or separate, would be territorially untenable in the face of an expanded chetnik Serbia, which is ravaging our entrails. [Podgornik] But the United States guarantees that it will support the territorial integrity of Croatia, so it seems that we have never been closer to recovery of the occupied territories. [Zoric] It is true that the United States has changed its policy toward that area. But, if I might so put it, the United States has only given a sign to Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. There still is not a single reliable manifestation that the United States is really thinking seriously. The United States sent an ultimatum to the Serbs around Sarajevo, but that ultimatum also threatens the Croats around Mostar. Clinton said that the United States has found its strategic interest here; however, this happened at the same time when Saudi Arabia was announcing that it would invest $8 billion to buy U.S. aircraft. The question is whether that will be enough. At the same time, it is easy to see from the Serbian media that with their most recent offensives in Bosnia and the violation of the truce in Croatia they have actually been testing to what extent the Americans are willing to persist in their new course of policy. The Specter of a Revived Yugoslavia Is Abroad [Podgornik] Are you afraid of a revival of Yugoslavia? [Zoric] That danger does exist. For instance, the Croats and Muslims create a federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and want to marry it to Croatia--so that Bosnia and Herzegovina formally remains intact, but with the status of the Bosnian Serbs unresolved. What in that case could prevent the international community from allowing the Bosnian Serbs confederation with Serbia? When you have that kind of asymmetrical confederation with a Bosnia and Herzegovina that exists as a legal entity, you could get Yugoslavia in the course of a single night. [Podgornik] When could a referendum be held of the population concerning the confederation of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina? [Zoric] That referendum could be legitimate only if it could be conducted in the areas now occupied as well. If it were not conducted in the areas occupied as well, the referendum might legalize the amputation of a fourth of the territory of the Republic of Croatia. [Podgornik] What consequences will the Washington agreement have on the domestic scene of Croatia? [Zoric] I think that the Croatian Government has made a good move and should now encourage creation of confidence and national consensus among the Croatian political forces. But the responsibility for that, I would say, lies above all on the opposition, which at this point ought not to cause nervousness and hunt scapegoats for the past, because that could be devastating to the process of peace between Croats and Muslims. For those who favor Croat-Muslim cooperation, the fact that there is an agreement is much more important than to seek justice or a gain for the party. I am convinced of that, and I would like to see that happen, at least as far as my HSLS is concerned. Nervousness would not favor the Croats in Bosnia nor the Croats in Herzegovina, for various reasons. The Baneful "Tito's Youth" [Podgornik] Does this mean that the HSLS will now be less critical of the government? [Zoric] No. We have not been critical of the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Union] just because of the disastrous policy toward Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Now that one of the sore points for the nationality has started to move toward resolution, the opposition ceases to be hostage to the issue of Bosnia and has been given more room. Now we can be still more critical of the incumbent party when it comes to denationalization, transformation of ownership, and many moves made in the economic area. [Podgornik] Could implementation of the Washington agreement encounter any serious resistance in a segment of the incumbent party or the opposition? [Zoric] There are more grounds for supporting the agreement than the other way around. Some people will see the agreement as a continuation of Croatian policy, others as a change of direction, still others as an alliance against a common enemy, and yet others as the interest of the nationality or the human interest. The conduct of the new policy, however, could be very painful in Herzegovina. The policy of reaching agreement between Croats and Muslims is out of step with the facts and emotions at the moment, and we should therefore take care that its implementation does not conflict with reality. Another question is whether the same people can carry out two concepts that are so different, those people who have gone from war to alliance. I am afraid that resistance could arise to people who as bureaucrats go too far in carrying out particular directives. In the HDZ of Bosnia and Herzegovina there are people who do not go abroad because they might have certain problems with foreign judiciaries. [Podgornik] You are referring to Mate Boban? [Zoric] I am referring to "Tito's Youth," who are today ruling Herceg- Bosna. Those who at one time sweated profusely in labor brigades in order to earn badges as shockworkers. Some people who are today guiding the HDZ as a people's party of Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina at one time had the first founders of the HDZ in Herzegovina called in for police interviews. They are very clever political operatives, but not very clever with their own people, whom they are now putting between the rock and the hard place, and in the end they have driven many people in Herzegovina crazy. Look at the result. The Herzegovinians are humiliated. The rest of the nationality looks on them as the problem causing unrest all over Croatia. And it is well-known that the Herzegovinians are that part of the Croatian nation, formerly and now, who from the depth of their soul have been fighting with their lives and resources for Croatian independence even against Yugoslavia, which signifies death to Croatia and Croats. Today, their political leaders are issuing reports to the effect that there are supposedly no problems in Herzegovina. However, there certainly are problems in Herzegovina. People are confused, because they were waging war for a cause, they were losing their lives, their children, their husbands, their farms. They had more casualties in the war with the Muslims than with the Serbs. Today, many people are asking: Why? That question is troubling a great number of people who have sizable families, and they are living in complete economic and political uncertainty and confusion. This is the average destiny of most people who until yesterday were told that they would be the masters of Herceg-Bosna and that Neum was Croatian. And today they are being given explanations that under the Washington agreement Croatia would be allowed passage through Neum and that what is happening to them and Croatia constitutes a continuation of a successful policy. If Croatian political forces do not act cautiously, I am afraid that the Herzegovinians could again end up on what for them is the perpetual "wrong side." That is in fact why I cautioned that the opposition now has greater responsibility than the government, because this is a question of fundamental interest to the nationality. There Is No Split in the HSLS [Podgornik] Is the HSLS threatened with a split such as has happened in the HSP [Croatian Rights Party] or the IDS [Istrian Democratic Conference]? [Zoric] No. In the course of the fierce campaign against us, the HSLS proved that it is a mature political party. Maturity is not a consequence of complete and doctrinaire unanimity of opinion in a party, but above all of responsibility and practicality. The HSLS is a political alternative to the incumbent party in its program, its strength, and the people it brings together. [Podgornik] Can the HSLS remain the second party? How do you interpret the disagreements in the party which have even broken through to the public? [Zoric] The HSLS can remain the second party, but it will not, it will do everything to become the first party. As for the second question, let us say that perhaps we have a good conception of political marketing. We live on the public's interest in us, so we have taken pains to interest people in something that sounds more enticing, more unusual. [Podgornik] Are you really the leader of the "harder ethnic line" in the HSLS? [Zoric] Many people have attributed that to me. Because I do not see what is bad about that, I can publicly admit that it is my honor to be perceived that way. We are a democratic party, and with us every position is won through a competition in which there is a candidate and an opposing candidate, so some win and some lose. That will also happen in the party convention in May, but that will not signify a split. For example, there are seven candidates for the four vice presidents of the HSLS. If one of the candidates loses in a race with me, that will not signify a split, but will mean that the party is organized along democratic lines. We operate along democratic lines even within the party, which is why I think we are able to bring Croatia real democracy. [Podgornik] You recently made a trip to the United States with Ivan Herak, who during that trip was expelled from the IDS. Will he really become a member of the HSLS? [Zoric] I have talked to Herak a great deal, and I think that these are very close political ideas. I naturally tried to persuade him to come over to the HSLS and I will be glad if I managed to persuade Herak. I would also like Denis Jelenkovic to come to the HSLS. I think that the HSLS has a great chance of success in Istria, because it is the second party there, and Drazen Budisa, you recall, obtained a convincing majority of the votes among all the presidential candidates in the election.
