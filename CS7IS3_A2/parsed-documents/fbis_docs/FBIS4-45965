This sentence uttered by Francois Mitterrand at the Elysee sounds like a promise, a determination and a political testament. The head of state this afternoon extended an invitation to all French figures concerned with defense affairs and nuclear issues. Addressing his guests, among whom were Defense Minister Francois Leotard and the chiefs-of-staff of the three armed services, the president, standing between the French and European flags, thus made the promise that nuclear tests would no longer be carried out in France: [begin recording] Mitterrand: No other tests will take place before May 1995, that is before a year from now. I know that a good dialectician... [pauses] It is said that this is not very important because this decision is not dangerous if taken within a year; the decision will be taken as soon as Mitterrand is gone! Let me say this to you, ladies and gentlemen: Nobody will do it after me! Nobody will do it, unless of course, another nuclear power starts its tests. I have already said that we will not do it because France would not like to see the French people and the whole world come to harm by re-launching a nuclear arms race, thus holding the third world and all the poor countries up to ridicule. Nor would France like to be the country that puts nuclear war on the map again. [end recording]. [passage omitted]
