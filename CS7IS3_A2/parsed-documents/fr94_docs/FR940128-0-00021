FR940128-0-00021 FR940128-0-00007 The present §266.12 has been revised and incorporated into the new §266.7(c) described above. Section §266.12, as noted earlier, is the redesignated §266.4. The present §266.13 has been redesignated as the new §266.15. Sections §§266.13 and 266.14 are new. The former section describes when the Board will terminate an individual's status as a representative payee and appoint a new one. The latter section describes what evidence an annuitant must provide to the Board to terminate representative payments and thereby receive benefits directly. The Board published this regulation as a proposed rule on March 10, 1993 (58 FR 13225), requesting comments by April 9, 1993. A number of comments were received. One commenter suggested that a paragraph be added to §266.4 (Information considered in selecting a representative payee) to provide that a creditor who provides goods and services to the annuitant should not be able to serve as a representative payee unless such creditor is a relative, legal guardian, or connected with a licensed or certified care facility. The Board agrees with this comment and a new paragraph (i) is added to §266.4 to reflect this proposal. One commenter suggested that §266.6 be modified to require a face-to-face interview with the payee-applicant rather than a discretionary interview as was proposed in that section. In the Board's experience a mandatory interview with the payee-applicant is not always necessary. In many cases the payee-applicant is a court appointed legal guardian or conservator or is a licensed care facility. However, the Board will modify its internal procedures to provide that where the payee-applicant is not interviewed, the Board employee responsible for developing the application for representative payment shall document in writing why no interview was done. In the same vein, another commenter suggested that the regulation provide for a mandatory interview with the annuitant when a payee is proposed and that the Board seek suggestions from the annuitant as to whom would make an appropriate payee. As in the case of payee-applicant, the Board has found that a requirement to interview the annuitant in each and every case where a representative-payee is required is not necessary. In many cases, the reason for the appointment of a representative payee is that the annuitant is no longer sentient or capable of significant communication. Of course, in these cases a requirement for an interview would serve no purpose. Rather than adopt a mandatory requirement for an interview with the annuitant, the Board is of the opinion that the better approach is the one referred to above with respect to the payee-applicant interview; namely, that the annuitant will be interviewed and his or her recommendations sought whenever possible. Where the annuitant is not interviewed, the Board employee responsible for developing the application for representative-payee must document the basis for not conducting the interview. The Board's internal operating procedures will be modified to reflect this change. A comment was also received with respect to §§266.7 (b) and (c). Under these sections where the representative payee fails to provide the Board with an accounting of his or her expenditures or fails to provide other information, the Board may suspend payment to the payee and then the payments are held in trust by the Board until a new representative payee is found or payments are reinstated to the present payee. One commenter was concerned that the regulation did not provide that if a new representative payee is not found, or payment to the present representative payee reinstated, within 30 days, that payments were not required to be made to the annuitant. The commenter pointed out that such a provision is provided for in the Social Security Act with respect to its representative payee program. See 42 U.S.C. 204(j)(2)(D). In the Board's experience the vast majority of annuitants for whom representative payees are appointed are not competent to handle their finances. When payment to a representative payee is suspended pending appointment of a new payee, the Board seeks to appoint a new payee with the utmost speed. However, this process may take longer than 30 days because, as the commenter pointed out, there is indeed a shortage of individuals willing to act as representative payees. On the other hand, making payments to an individual who cannot manage his or her own affairs would not be in the best interest of the annuitant. Consequently, the Board has modified §266.7 by adding a new paragraph (d) which provides that where payment to a representative payee is suspended to appoint a new representative payee, such payment must be reinstated within 30 days unless the annuitant is an unemancipated minor under age 18, or is judged by the Board to be incapable of handling his benefit payments, in which case the Board will hold the payments in trust until a new representative payee is appointed.
