During a recent visit to China, the International Regulatory Review Team (IRRT) of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) agreed that China's nuclear safety administration system reached the standards of usual international practice. China's progress in this area is closely related to its active international cooperation, according to Huang Qitao, director general of China's National Nuclear Safety Administration (NNSA). He said that China's attitude towards international nuclear safety cooperation and exchanges is active, open and unreserved, adding that NNSA has signed cooperative agreements with a number of countries while maintaining regular contacts with some other countries having no such agreements with China. Huang noted that China has received support from some international organizations such as the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), IAEA and the European Community, which provided China with materials, computer software, and information concerning safety in nuclear power plants. He said that China also takes part in international cooperations of IAEA including the drafting of the International Nuclear Safety Convention, and China is ready to discharge all obligations when the convention is signed. In an interview with XINHUA, Ms. Annick Carnino, head of the IRRT of the IAEA, said that IAEA will strengthen its cooperation with China in nuclear safety administration and is ready to provide China with help in nuclear emergency planning and response.
