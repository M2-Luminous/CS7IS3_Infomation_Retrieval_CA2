Expecting precisely such a natural reaction from the president and his closest aides immediately after the adoption of the decree, and not receiving it in the two days that followed, many people decided that very high-level and subtle politics were involved here. Former USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev voiced his conjecture directly on television. It really seemed to many people that the Kremlin simply had to react, and immediately, to the Duma's amnesty decree, that it did not have the right in the face of the whole country and the world to do otherwise. But if it was not reacting or protesting, that meant that something which we mere mortals were not privy to was afoot here, but we mere mortals could nevertheless be sure that we were being looked after and that everything was all right. Now it emerges that, while the presidential aide was conveying the president's letter to the speaker, the general prosecutor was giving up the prosecutor's "throne of office" and his deputy was deciding the country's fate. In other words, there was simply no dark secret about, for example, Boris Yeltsin's having agreed with Ivan Rybkin and Viktor Chernomyrdin on some political concessions from them in exchange for the president's granting of freedom to the heroes of the civil carnage. It did not and does not exist. What, then, in that case was there? The amnesty decree was passed by the Duma on Wednesday 23 February, just before the president's annual address to the Federal Assembly deputies. On the morning of 24 February I -- as a member of the Presidential Council -- went to the session. But how surprised I was, then, when the security guards at the entrance, after carefully examining my pass as a member of the Presidential Council, refused to let me into the hall.... That morning I was unable to see anyone -- the president, his aides, the head of administration. I heard the president's speech on television at the same time as I saw "on the box" the very people whom I had very much needed to communicate with personally. Hearing no direct references in the president's speech to the amnesty, I thought that there were undoubtedly decisions of some sort in being of which we were unaware and that consequently things were as they should be. It was simply impossible to imagine it otherwise -- that no one was seriously thinking about this. But I wanted to know for sure whether things were as they should be or not, particularly as immediately after the adoption of the decree Aleksandr Maksimovich Yakovlev, a very experienced lawyer and, what is more, the president's representative in the Duma, stated in a television interview that the Duma's decision fell within its remit. While Aleksey Kazannik also stated immediately after the president's speech that he would carry out the Duma's decision as soon as he was in receipt of documents which were not at odds with the law. After the president's speech I began trying to contact Administration Chief Sergey Filatov by phone with the intention of fixing up a meeting. He has two offices: One in the Kremlin, close to the president's, and another on Staraya Ploshchad, closer to the apparatus. At Staraya Ploshchad they said that he was busy. Somewhat later I was told that unfortunately he had already left for the Kremlin. At the Kremlin, however, they said: "He will not be here till Monday." This strengthened me even further in my conviction that everything was all right, that everything was consequently as it should be; after all, the head of administration could not go away for three days at a time when the Duma amnesty decree would have to be carried out. No, that could not happen in a normal country! The Duma had, after all, by this time already made several attempts to implement the amnesty decree -- and certainly in a way designed to empty the cells in Lefortovo. (One scandal-renowned politician wryly joked while discussing this topic with me over the telephone: "They (meaning Yeltsin's team) have emptied Lefortovo for themselves." Anyone interested in politics presumed quite justifiably that the administration's numerous experts and analysts were engaged day and night in studying various courses of action or -- even better -- potential outflanking maneuvers. On 24 February I was telephoned by ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA editor Natalya Polezhayeva, who was almost in hysterics: State Duma deputies had been contacting her on the ordinary phone lines and the special government ones asking why the newspaper had not published the amnesty decree? "I replied," Polezhayeva said, "that I did not have the complete package of documents yet. Someone had reported to Rybkin that the decree would not be carried in the newspaper the next day, the 25th. Rybkin faxed me a letter and demanded a written explanation for the Duma. I faxed to him my explanatory letter to the Duma. But I myself telephoned Kostikov. He heard me out and said: `What is there to do, then? It has to be published.' So I carried the whole `package' of documents in the issue. It was announced on the "Novosti" program on the evening of 26 February that ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA was publishing the amnesty decree the next day. (People will know that the decree comes into effect from the moment of its publication. In other words, the publication gave the spur to its further implementation -- A.Ya.). Immediately after the "Novosti" news program, at 2200, I was telephoned at home by Satarov who asked why the decree was being published. I explained this to him in plain terms. He became very down-hearted and said that he and Baburin would now `concoct something,' draft some kind of letter from the president to Rybkin. After that call I realized that there was no secret concerning the amnesty, that they had simply not thought about anything over there...." I consoled the editor by joking that she would certaintly be given credit by the Lefortovo prisoners when they were released. On the 26th, right up to the release of the whole gang, I dialed all the important Kremlin numbers. Only secretaries answered. The secretary of first presidential aide Viktor Ilyushin said: "He is working elsewhere and won't be here today." I told journalists who rang me that the inner circle -- and they are literally just a few in number -- could actually be working somewhere at a dacha, as is usual with our country's political establishment. But I had no other, "dacha" telephone numbers available to me. I still did not believe that everything could be simply so primitive -- that no one was actually making any calculations, undertaking anything, or apparently intended doing so. AND IF YOU, PRESIDENTIAL AIDE GEORGIY SATAROV, HAD NOT BY CHANCE HEARD ON THE OSTANKINO CHANNEL THAT THE DUMA AMNESTY DECREE WOULD BE PUBLISHED IN ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, THERE WOULD SIMPLY NOT EVEN HAVE BEEN THE BELATED LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT TO IVAN RYBKIN ON THE MORNING OF 26 FEBRUARY! The president's letter, which was written after the "Novosti" program, on the night of 25-26 February and which was designed to show everyone the concern felt by the authorities at this senseless act, explains, at least to me, a very important thing which is just as dangerous as the amnesty act adopted by the deputies, namely that the supreme authorities were -- we will learn some time whether by accident or design -- in a complete information vacuum. Just as during those memorable days in October, everyone had, as it were, disappeared and was getting on with work and other concerns at "different venues." Only this time the role of Gaydar in providing the danger signals, danger signals above all for the authorities, was taken on by television announcers. But, alas, this time when they heard about the act amnestying those whom they had opposed in October 1993 Russians STAYED AT HOME. Only the Red opposition was attending rallies. THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE RALLY PROTESTING AGAINST THE DUMA DECISION OR SUPPORTING THE PRESIDENT'S LETTER. Certain nonimportunate questions occur to me in this regard which I would like to ask those whom I was unable to reach by telephone in the Kremlin for a whole week. First, I would very much like to know the name of the bright guy who proposed to Yeltsin and persuaded him that it was extremely necessary for the president to head off Volfovich's [Zhirinovskiy] amnesty idea and himself sumbit such a legislative initiative to the Duma. Who is this benefactor of ours? Did the whole legion of experts, analysts, and political scientists in the Kremlin and on Staraya Ploshchad really not realize that the Duma would certainly exploit the proposal to add their own paragraph -- about a political amnesty? But if that was so and the proponent of the idea was very anxious about the 20,000 people "inside," why did he not consider that option and warn the president? Let us suppose that he did consider it and issued a warning, but the president decided to initiate the amnesty just the same. Why, then, did the president's men (and new president's men now) not consider and propose in good time a dozen options to meet this expected event? After all, the Duma had persistently approached this point during several divisions but had lacked the votes. Even Volfovich and his team could not produce a result. (None other than Sergey Shakhray, deputy and minister who was appointed a member of the Security Council by the president himself two weeks ago, helped here, as we know. Greatly concerned about reconciliation and harmony in society, he came to everyone's aid at the crucial moment with his Party of Russian Unity and Accord, stating during a TV interview immediately after the president's speech that the political forces which voted for the amnesty must assume responsibility for the future exemplary behavior of those who had stepped out of line, and modestly keeping silent about his own role in this story). Not only were the president's moves not planned even one step ahead, but the state mass media proved unprepared for such a scenario; TASS political observer Tamara Zamyatina described in detail on Sunday's "Itogi" program how they were simply unable to get anything intelligible out of anyone behind the Kremlin wall. Only nonstate television in the "Itogi" program gave a complete picture of the mood in the Kremlin and at Lefortovo both at the moment of release and afterward. Only after the event did state television shamefacedly show scraps of documentary footage of October 1993, complete with the calls to seize the Kremlin, City Hall, and Ostankino. The president has a very large number of people around him. They can no longer fit into the Kremlin. But for the umpteenth time he has found himself hostage to them alone, with his fate balanced on a knife edge. But the juggernaut rolls on. A month ago we met with the president and spoke about the poverty-stricken state of the press in our state. During our 30-minute conversation he summoned aides and apparatus staff by telephone five times, even giving them instructions on these questions. Subsequently I wrote official notes to him and his aides several times with proposals regarding what needs to be done to avoid further confrontation with journalists. Alas, everything keeps flowing and nothing changes. But while General Barannikov was getting his things ready to leave, a colleague of his, also a KGB general, who had looked after Barannikov's public relations, was getting ready to assume the sensitive leadership of the press in the capacity of first deputy chairman of the State Committee for the Press. That is something, colleagues! It is a long time since we have been run from there. But the time has come, and the documents have already been submitted to the government for confirmation . These are the questions which I would like answered both as a member of the Presidential Council and as an ordinary citizen who is not indifferent to either the fate of the country or, naturally, the fate of my own children.
