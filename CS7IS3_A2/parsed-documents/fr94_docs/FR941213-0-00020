FR941213-0-00020 FR941213-0-00004 Pursuant to section 503(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), comments were solicited from various interested Federal agencies. No comments were received. Public Comments The public comment period and opportunity to request a public hearing was announced in the September 16, 1994, Federal Register (59 FR 47574). The comment period closed on October 17, 1994. No one commented and no one requested an opportunity to testify at the scheduled public hearing so no hearing was held. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Under 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director is required to obtain the written concurrence of the Administrator of the EPA with respect to any provisions of a State program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq. ) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq .). The Director has determined that this amendment contains no provisions in these categories and that EPA's concurrence is not required. Pursuant to 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from EPA. EPA responded by letter dated September 27, 1994 (Administrative Record Number IND&hyph;1402). In that letter, the EPA stated that it had no comments on the proposed amendment. V. Director's Decision Based on the findings above, the Director is approving, except as noted herein, Indiana's program amendment concerning performance standards for restoring soil productivity submitted by Indiana on August 11, 1994. As discussed in Finding 2, the Director has determined that the deletion of 310 IAC 12&hyph;5&hyph;145(c) renders the Indiana program less effective than the Federal regulations. The Director is requiring that Indiana amend its program to include a counterpart to 30 CFR 823.4(b) or to otherwise require that any prime farmland soil reconstruction specifications promulgated as rules for the State of Indiana by the SCS be incorporated by reference into the Indiana program. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 914 codifying decisions concerning the Indiana program are being amended to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undue delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA. Effect of Director's Decision Section 503 of SMCRA provides that a State may not exercise jurisdiction under SMCRA unless the State program is approved by the Secretary. Similarly, 30 CFR 732.17(a) requires that any alteration of an approved State program be submitted to OSM for review as a program amendment. Thus, any changes to the State program are not enforceable until approved by OSM. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(g) prohibit any unilateral changes to approved State programs. In his oversight of the Indiana program, the Director will recognize only the statutes, regulations and other materials approved by him, together with any consistent implementing policies, directives and other materials, and will require the enforcement by Indiana of only such provisions. VI. Procedural Determinations Executive Order 12866 This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review). Executive Order 12778 The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15 and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met. National Environmental Policy Act No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)). Paperwork Reduction Act This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 et seq. ). Regulatory Flexibility Act The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.
