Martti Ahtisaari has 25.9 percent of the votes, Elisabeth Rehn 22 percent, Paavo Vaeyrynen 19.5 percent, and Raimo Ilaskivi 15.5 percent. Then there are the other candidates. There is quite a big gap to the next one, Keijo Korhonen, with 5.8 percent; Claes Andersson with 3.8 percent; Pertti Virtanen 3 percent; Eeva Kuuskoski 2.6 percent; Toimi Kankaanniemi and Sulo Aittoniemi, both with 1 percent; and Pekka Tiainen with 0.2 percent. Looking at the absolute number of votes, perhaps they will stay in some people's minds. Martti Ahtisaari received just over 800,000 votes in these elections, Elisabeth Rehn 700,000 votes, Paavo Vaeyrynen just over 600,000, and Raimo Ilaskivi nearly 500,000. At a rough glance, there are just over 1 million votes to be distributed in the second round of the elections, if we assume that everybody sticks to their candidates in the first round, that is Ahtisaari and Rehn.
