Nikitin, including recorded remarks by I. Mironov, economics minister of the Chuvash Republic of the Russian Federation; from the "Vesti" newscast] [Text] Chuvashia is trying to overcome the economic crisis by relying on its own potential. Our correspondent reports: [Nikitin] Chuvash Republic President Nikolay Fedorov has signed an edict on additional measures to settle economic relations in the Republic. [Mironov] We are faced with two main tasks today. First, to help republican goods producers to overcome their difficult situation. The second task is of a more strategic nature; it is to turn the Chuvash Republic into a major business, cultural, economic, and financial center of the Volga region. [Nikitin] The edict stipulates a lower tax rate applicable to banking. The republican authorities believe that the Chuvash capital of Cheboksary will become one of Russia's major banking centers. Goods producers should already be given assistance in creating investment resources. Privileges are being introduced by the edict with respect to some taxes, including the tax on profits on enterprises engaged in production that are being set up in the republic. They are exempt from this tax for three years, which is quite a sufficient period for an enterprise to establish itself and start production. After this, the enterprise can fulfill its obligations to society and start paying taxes. Thus, mutual interests will be satisfied.
