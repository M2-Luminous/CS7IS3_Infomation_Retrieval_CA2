The driver was taken to hospital as police and firemen rushed to the scene. The driver was later identified as an Italian employee of the embassy, Marco Formichella, 34, suffering from cuts and bruises after a blast that made a small hole in the road surface and split open the side of the car. The bomb is believed to have been a rudimentary device, little more than a cardboard box packed with nitrate-based explosive, with an electrical detonator (proved by the discovery of six small batteries under the car). Investigators are trying to establish whether it was set off by a timer, or was attached to the car ignition -- a thesis indicated by the fact that it went off as the driver turned the key.
