FR940826-0-00020 FR940826-0-00008 7 CFR Part 989 [Docket No. FV94&hyph;989&hyph;3FR] Raisins Produced From Grapes Grown in California; Removal of an Exemption for Raisins Produced in Southern California and Exported to Mexico AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule revises the administrative rules and regulations established under the Federal marketing order for raisins produced from grapes grown in California. It removes a provision that currently exempts raisins produced from grapes dried on the vine in southern California and exported to Mexico from all marketing order requirements. This rule is based on a unanimous recommendation of the Raisin Administrative Committee (Committee), which is responsible for local administration of the order. Elimination of the exemption will facilitate administration and improve enforcement efforts. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 26, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Richard P.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 989 [7 CFR Part 989], both as amended, regulating the handling of raisins produced from grapes grown in California. The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended, [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive effect. This action will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of entry of the ruling. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. There are approximately 20 handlers of California raisins who are subject to regulation under the raisin marketing order, and approximately 5,000 producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. A majority of producers and a minority of handlers of California raisins may be classified as small entities. This final rule removes a provision that exempts raisins produced from grapes dried on the vine in southern California and exported to Mexico in natural condition from all marketing order requirements. It is based on a unanimous recommendation of the Committee and other available information. Section 989.60 of the order provides that the Committee may establish, with the approval of the Secretary, rules and procedures to exempt from regulations raisins produced in southern California (i.e., the counties of Riverside, Imperial, San Bernardino, Ventura, Orange, Los Angeles, and San Diego) and disposed of for distillation, livestock feed, or by export in natural condition to Mexico. Paragraph (b) of section 989.160 of Subpart_Administrative Rules and Regulations (7 CFR 989.102&hyph;989.176) currently exempts raisins produced from grapes dried on the vine in those southern California counties, which are disposed of for use in distillation, livestock feed, or by export in natural condition to Mexico, from all marketing order requirements. This final rule eliminates the exemption that applies to those raisins exported in natural condition to Mexico.
