In this case, the state, and indirectly the citizens, suffered a loss. But this was not the first such scandal, because when the Ybl Bank went bankrupt, almost 2 million forints from budgetary institutions were lost. In the opinion of Fidesz, the financing of the institutions cannot be regulated in such a way that they would have no surplus at all from time to time. But if they do have a surplus, it is expedient to invest it, and in such a way that the money would be in the safest possible place. In the opinion of Fidesz it would be desirable for budgetary institutions to invest only in treasury bonds and other government bonds.
