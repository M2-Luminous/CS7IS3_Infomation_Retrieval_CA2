The decision came at a morning cabinet meeting, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii told reporters. The move is intended to help pensioners and the disabled amid the current trend for lower interest rates in line with progressing financial deregulations, Fujii said. Private banks offer welfare savings with a relatively high fixed interest rate under the Finance Ministry's permission. He noted that the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications is expected to take a similar measure for such savings offered by post offices.
