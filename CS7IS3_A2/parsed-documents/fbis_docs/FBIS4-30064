Hata repeated his stance in a meeting with Murayama, who asked him to clarify his earlier remarks indicating the possibility of disbanding his cabinet so as to lure the SDP back into the fold, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai told reporters. Saying Japan needs a powerful government to tackle difficult problems such as tax and political reforms, Hata reportedly told Murayama he will entrust the issue of his resignation to the ongoing talks between the coalition and the SDP. These talks "have yet to be completed and will be resumed at 11 A.M. [0200 GMT] Tomorrow," Murayama told a separate news conference. Murayama declined comment on Hata's suggestion of his resignation, the key condition for the SDP's return, saying the talks are still in process. The SDP chief said the result of negotiations on the SDP's possible return to power should be known "in a day or two," as the current Diet session ends next Wednesday and the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) filed a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet. During the meeting with Murayama at his official residence, Hata urged the SDP, the main bloc in the government of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, to rejoin the ruling alliance, Murayama said. The SDP walked out of the coalition in late April in protest at the formation by other major coalition partners of a new parliamentary group excluding the SDP, forcing Hata to form Japan's first minority government in 39 years. The SDP chairman said Hata pressed a demand for the clarification of the reason for the SDP's withdrawal from the coalition. Murayama told Hata the SDP did not leave the coalition in April because of differences in policies but because of "other problems," alluding to the formation of a large parliamentary group excluding the SDP, according to Kumagai. But Hata and Murayama agreed to watch the progress of the talks between the coalition parties and the SDP, Murayama and Kumagai said. The ruling coalition and the SDP are currently holding talks toward reaching a policy agreement in forming a new government. The main point of contention is tax system reform, on which the two sides are still far apart. The SDP is opposed to a hike in the current 3 percent consumption tax in return for large-scale income and residential tax cuts in 1995 and beyond. The government is scheduled to chart a final course for a comprehensive tax system reform by the end of June and act on necessary legislation by the year's end. At a press conference shortly after the fiscal 1994 budget cleared the Diet and the LDP filed a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet, Hata indicated the possibility of stepping down with his entire cabinet. Hata told Murayama that the coalition parties have overcome many difficulties since first coming to power last August and that he wants to maintain the framework of the coalition, Kumagai said. The chief cabinet secretary said Hata and Murayama did not discuss whether they would meet again. They also did not discuss a cabinet resignation en masse or how to deal with the no-confidence motion, Kumagai said. Meanwhile, the House of Representatives Diet Steering Committee failed to set a timetable for the lower house to hold a plenary session to vote on the no-confidence motion. The LDP, toppled from government last summer for the first time in 38 years, claimed Hata's minority administration does not reflect people's views. The LDP demanded the lower chamber take a floor vote on the no-confidence motion Friday but the coalition opposed it.
