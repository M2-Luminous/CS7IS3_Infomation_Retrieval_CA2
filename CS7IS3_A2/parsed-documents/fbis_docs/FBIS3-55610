"Despite Bill Clinton's declarations in Brussels, the Ukrainian side is not sure that the definitive version of the accord on the fate of its nuclear weapons will be signed in Moscow on January 14," Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuriy Sergeyev said. "If by that date the definitive version has not been worked out, realised, the three-way summit (between Clinton, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Ukrainian leader Leonid Kravchuk) in Moscow will be purely consultative," Sergeyev told reporters.
