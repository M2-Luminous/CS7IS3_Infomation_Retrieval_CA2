A few hours after the assassination of President Habyarimana on the evening of 6 April and having learned of the kidnapping by the Presidential Guard of several ministers and their families -- all of whom were killed -- he sought refuge with one neighbor, while his family sought refuge with another. In the morning of 7 April, the Blue Helmets came to look for him in armored vehicles, but they did not take his family. From 7 to 19 April, Mr. Twagiramungu remained on United Nations premises, before being transported -- in an armored vehicle and hidden in a jute sack -- to the airport and tossed into a plane bound for Nairobi and then Brussels. Illegal On Wednesday [11 May], Mr. Twagiramungu met with Foreign Minister Willy Claes. "We agree on the need for a cease-fire and the need to say that the hostilities are being aggravated by the continued supply of increasingly sophisticated weapons to both belligerents." Mr. Twagiramungu supports the RPF, which wants to sign a cease-fire agreement only with the Rwandan Army, not the government, "because the government has called for massacres and because it is illegal. The "president" did not even take an oath before parliament and the parties did not give their agreement to having their members participate in the cabinet, as was the custom when we were still operating under the terms of the 1991 constitution," which was claimed by the authorities to be the legal basis, in preference to the Arusha agreements, which replaced it in 1993. For the time being, the civilian opposition wants to set up a coordination committee for the democratic forces of change bringing together four parties: the Democratic and Republican Movement (MDR), the Democratic Socialist Party (PSD), the Liberal Party (PL), and the Christian Democratic Party (PDC). "Contact must be made with the people by radio. There is a terrifying political vacuum. There are only the RPF and the killers. This situation is desired by the MRDN [National Revolutionary Movement for Development], which wanted to annihilate the opposition so that it could be alone in the face of the RPF and then exterminate it with the support of the people. We cannot tolerate this. The political struggle must continue." However, one problem does arise: The MDR is divided between those who follow Mr. Twagiramungu and those who, in the name of "Hutu Power," have joined the presidential sphere supporters, some of whom are currently participating in the massacres of civilians. "They fell into the trap of the MRND, which preached Hutu unity. I preach Rwandan unity, as is written in our bylaws. They did not respect these bylaws, so they can no longer be in our party. We need a congress to decide on a clear divorce. Under no circumstances may we cooperate with these people any more." Yes To Arusha Mr. Twagiramungu supports "the Arusha peace agreements 100 percent" but "of course, the killers will have to be excluded from the planned institutions and the international community must help us judge them." Is the RPF the army of the civilian opposition? "I cannot say. I have not talked about this with them. In our agreement in Brussels in May and June 1992, we said that we were prepared to collaborate with the RPF if it agreed to the negotiations. We also said we would undertake the same political struggle: Dismantling the dictatorship. We must keep this spirit. When the RPF has ended the war -- we do not have weapons to join them and put an end to the massacres -- the struggle will still be to destroy the dictatorship." And the Rwandan Army? "How can it be described -- it and the gendarmerie, both of which have remained on the sidelines without defending anyone from the massacres! I condemn the Army leadership. If there are officers who are convinced that what is happening is evil, then let them fight the militias or, at least, keep their distance." What about the MRND? "The militias that kill do so on the orders of this party. I think it should be dissolved. We cannot keep parties which preach extermination. The MRND militants must redefine what they want and choose other leaders. Apparently, there are moderates in the MRND. So let them prove it by dissociating themselves from the massacres. We cannot tolerate letting these people start again some day. I am almost 50 years old. I have seen violence like this in 1959, 1964, 1973, 1990, and 1994. Will my children also have to live with this all their lives? For 35 years now anytime anyone has talked about power it is in Hutu/Tutsi terms. Will we have to wait another century to achieve national unity? If the answer is yes, then there will never be any development. Never."
