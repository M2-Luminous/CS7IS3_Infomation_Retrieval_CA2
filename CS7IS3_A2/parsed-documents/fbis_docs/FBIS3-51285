He visited Pedro Escobedo and San Juan del Rio and later went to Hidalgo. Pablo Martin Contreras, president of the Otomi people, gave Colosio the staff of command in Ixmiquilpan, in the heart of the Mezquital Valley, where Colosio received the support of the Indian population. In downtown Ixmiquilpan he met with PRI members from Hidalgo. He said that what is most painful is learning first hand the difficult conditions that many Mexican communities face daily. He added that shortages are intolerable and cannot be accepted and that poverty should not be accepted as one's destiny. At an event attended by thousands of peasants, Colosio emphasized that things must be called by their names because Mexico rejects lies and demagoguery, which are deceptive. The PRI candidate called for a decisive battle to end poverty, deprivation, and inequality in Mexico. He also talked about the Chiapas situation. [Begin Colosio recording] In the difficult times that Chiapas State is experiencing, we must all reiterate our desire, our fervent desire, and our determination to have only one Mexico. To face the challenge of poverty, the fatherland needs unity, harmony, and work. This is what the gleam of hope in the eyes of Hidalgo children, of Chiapas children, and of all Mexican children is asking. [end recording] Colosio said that the Chiapas and Mezquital Valley situations demonstrate the urgent need for more just conditions. He added that the solution is sweeping social reform. [Begin Colosio recording] Today we are encouraged by progress in the negotiations. The Mexican Army's declaration of a cease-fire shows willingness to find ways to bring peace to this Mexican region. [end recording] Colosio pointed out that talks, reconciliation, and the strengthening of the state of law will continue to promote stability in Mexico. Later, he met with the PRI political council in Pachuca and with Hidalgo women. He also attended a social event.
