FBIS4-51900 "dreas086_d_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-086 Daily Report 4 May 1994 South Korea ROK: Take 3 of 3--Unification Minister on Nuclear Issue ROK: Take 3 of 3--Unification Minister on Nuclear Issue SK0405060894 SK0405060894 BFN [Text] [Minister Yi continues] What is important at present is to put various opinions and views together harmoniously. It is true that there were some complications in the past. However, each office came to have a good understanding of each other, and I believe that they will now handle the work in harmony. [Reporter Yi] The family of Yo Man-chol, who defected from North Korea, held a news conference yesterday. At the news conference, we noted that North Korea is suffering from a serious food shortage. What plans do you have to bring in our country the North Korean workers who escaped from logging sites in Russia and our North Korean compatriots who defected to China? [Minister Yi] Needless to say, our Foreign Ministry and other offices are making great efforts on this. The relevant government offices held many discussions to work out proper measures to deal with the issue. I understand that there is progress. Our government assumed it as an essential principle to resolve this issue from the humanitarian point of view, because there are many complex and delicate diplomatic, legal, and political factors. Taking all these factors into consideration, the government is handling the issue in an appropriate manner. We seek the people's cooperation and understanding so that the government can settle this quietly. What I mean by humanitarian point of view is the welfare of the constituents of the nation who shared the same blood with us. Thus, the government, paying keen attention, will deal with the issue properly. [Reporter Yi] Many people think that the continuous escape of the North Korean compatriots may lead to the collapse of the North Korean system. In other words, a similar situation to what happened in East Germany will occur. However, the North Korean side is known to be opposed to reunification through absorption. What is your opinion on this? [Minister Yi] As it is known, our basic policy is to establish a national commonwealth [minjok kongdongche] on this land in a peaceful, independent, and democratic way. Therefore, we neither want to see an abrupt outbreak of a situation nor do we wish misfortunes resulting from such situation. The whole world is changing today. But only the Korean peninsula remains divided. This is indeed a disgrace of the nation. North Korea should respond to dialogue at an early date. We need not be nervous about the North Korean claims on opposition to reunification through absorption and so forth. It is true that many North Korean compatriots are suffering from many difficulties. However, we have no intention to use this for political purposes or for North-South relations. [Reporter Yi] People are hoping that the relevant government officials in charge of diplomatic and security affairs should make efforts to seek national consensus and to make the people fully understand the situation. What is your view on this? [Minister Yi] I will speak to the people as much as I can whenever the opportunities arise, just as now. There are many channels for dialogue. I do intend to fully reflect the people's opinion and views in the policies to be implemented. I think that without dialogue with the people, no policy can be implemented effectively. In particular, this is ever more true about the reunification policy. Thus, I will make all possible efforts to seek the people's wisdom and reflect their will in the policies. [Reporter Yi] Thank you for being with us today despite your busy schedule. [Minister Yi] Thank you. (endall) 031246 yy/ramirez/KYY29045.03/dr610405.12/hc 04/0609z May BT #0096 NNNN
