In its statement, the Democratic Russia Movement calls for the deletion from the draft agreement of the thesis banning the use of assessments of the events of August 1991 and of September-October 1993 "as a pretext for deepening the confrontation". The movement's coordination council regards this thesis as "unacceptable". This view is shared by Valeriya Novodvorskaya, leader of the Russian Democratic Union. Interviewed by ITAR-TASS, the eminent human rights defender said: "How will the democrats be able to look into the eyes of the people, whom they had urged to man the barricades, if such a dubious ban is adopted?". The supporters of Democratic Russia want some declarative commitments to be deleted from the text of the agreement and a clearer delimitation of responsibilities for the fulfilment of the memorandum terms. Chairman of the Socialist Workers Party Lyudmila Vartazarova moves to delete from the draft agreement paragraphs duplicating the Russian Constitution or contradicting it in the part relating to the observance of human rights. Moreover, Vartazarova warns against "the discreditation of the very idea of national concord by rash and unconsidered actions". She suggests a procedure for the document's broad public discussion.
