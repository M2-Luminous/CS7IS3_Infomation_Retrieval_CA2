This time it is Prof. Dr. Suhadi Mangkusuwondo, economist at the FEUI [Economic Faculty of the University of Indonesia] and member of the APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] group of "eminent persons," who has expressed it. It is true that Indonesia's non-oil-and-gas exports continue to rise from year to year in absolute volumes and values, but the rate of increase is steadily declining. Meanwhile, it is difficult to expect any increase in oil and gas exports. In 1993, Indonesian exports rose by 8.41 percent over 1992. That increase was lower than during the 1988-1992 period (an average of 15.8 percent). Thus, there is a trend toward steadily lower increases. Again, we should note that what is declining is the increase, not the absolute volume or value. This has been a problem for economists and economic policy makers for the last two or three years and will be a big problem in the future. It is not a new problem, however. In 1989, while Indonesia was euphoric over increases of more than 15 percent in non-oil-and-gas exports, Dr. Iwan Jaya Azis, another FEUI economist, warned us and predicted the current situation. Iwan said that after 1992, increases in non-oil-and-gas exports would decline and would continue to do so. He said it is very probable that non-oil-and-gas exports will level off after 1995. That was said merely from the viewpoint of Indonesia's ability to increase its non-oil-and-gas exports (capabilities of resources, production, and competitiveness on international markets), without considering any other factors. There are factors now that did not enter into calculations at that time. One of them is GATT. Its impact and consequences will be felt gradually over the next several years. In general, GATT will create freer world trade, which, as far as possible, will be without tariff and nontariff barriers. It requires that each country be able to compete in international trade and demands more production, investment, and trade. It means an opportunity to increase non-oil-and-gas exports, but it also means a threat to Indonesia if we are not able to take advantage of it and fulfill its requirements or if we are not able to compete in an atmosphere of sharper competition. We have also read predictions that the developing countries will lose much export revenue because of the introduction of GATT. In fact, it is predicted that Indonesia will lose the most. We need not believe such predictions or assessments, although they are not without basis. Moreover, Indonesia's capabilities are viewed and assessed through foreign eyes. In other words, the predictions may not come true, or they may. We should accept such assessments as warnings to be alert and to act. Prof. Suhadi Mangkusuwondo suggests that we look again at our investment capabilities, because increases in exports depend on such capabilities, which include our ability to attract foreign investment. We feel that is not enough, however. There are several other factors, including our ability to spot opportunities on world markets consistent with our capabilities. We need to be wise by selecting what we are capbable of doing in exports, for we cannot export every commodity and every service. There is another matter that has not been touched on very much, because it has not been acknowledged as a big problem. When it has been touched on, it apparently has not been done very directly. We have been faced with changes through a variety of deregulation measures. Their objective has been to restrain the high-cost economy and increase competitiveness with exports and, domestically, with imports. Nevertheless, hindrances in the form of bureaucratic costs -- both official and under-the-table -- and collusion between officials and businessmen are increasingly visible as the main factors in Indonesia's high-cost economy. It cannot be denied that exports are the mainstay of Indonesia's economy. The dependence of our economy on non-oil-and-gas exports will increase in the future. Exports will be even more the source of financing for development and the source of loan payments. In our opinion, there are three things we could experience in the future in our economy, including exports. First, we could continue to be surprised by the rapid and continuous changes that occur as the result of globalization in the economy and in technology, information, and telecommunications. For example, the export commodities that Indonesia depends on, and that represent our "prima donna" exports, could suddenly cease to sell or suddenly decline in revenues because of those changes. Second, we might not be prepared to adapt or able to react to the changes that occur in the world. The consequences could affect our economy, and development could also be hindered. Third, the changes could force us, for the sake of the survival of our economy, to make alterations that actually are unwanted by some interest groups. The fact is, the choice is up to us.
