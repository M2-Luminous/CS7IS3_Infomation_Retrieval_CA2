So, what is the actual restraint situation? This reporter recently learned from relevant sectors that the so-called transportation restriction refers only to the overall situation which varies greatly among various transportation industries. Taking railroad and highway transportation for example, railroad transportation "bottlenecks" are entirely prominent, while highway transportation is relatively overbuilt. According to explanations by comrades related to railroad sectors, in recent years state expenditure has greatly accelerated railroad construction. At present 10 major railroad projects have fully entered the design and construction stage. In the first half of 1993 alone, investment reached 3.42 billion yuan. The Lanzhou-Xinjiang multiple track, Hou-Yue line, Bao-Zhong line, Beijing-Zhengzhou electrification, and Nanning-Kunming lines have all entered a high tide of construction. However, railroad transportation still is severely stagnant because of many factors. In the short term the conflict of transportation capacity lagging behind economic development still is rather prominent. There are relatively great deficiencies, whether of freight or passenger transportation. According to relevant sectors, the first half of 1993 was one of the most serious periods ever for a shortage of railroad transportation. The average rate of satisfying of applications for rail carriages for freight use was around 40 percent, more than 10 percentage points below a normal year. It was hard to ensure transportation of some state plan and key commodities. For example, in May 162,000 tons of coal was under plan contract for use in the chemical industry nationwide. Actual arrangements were made for 87,000 tons and the actual amount transported was less than 80,000 tons. Transportation was a major external cause affecting shortages of state steel contracts in the steel industry nationwide. Economic development was unusually rapid in the southeast coastal area in 1993, and investment has doubled, creating a large volume of goods and passengers flowing southward, and meaning even more prominent already over-capacity Beijing-Guangdong and Beijing-Shanghai lines. Goods headed south for Guangdong can only be one-forth of applications. Many mining enterprises along some coastal lines have restricted or ceased production because there is no way to guarantee railroad carriages. The passenger transportation shortage situation also is extremely serious; main trunk lines commonly are more than 50 percent over capacity. In some areas there is no choice but to scatter passengers by using commodity cars for travelers. According to transportation sector explanations, in recent years the stress of highway construction mainly has been on roads for vehicle use to realize the goal of a nationwide "two vertical and two horizontal" network. The trend has been led by localities with central government assistance, full utilization of accumulated funds and loans, opening up a modernized highway transportation network. There have been great successes. Nevertheless, there is a relative shortage of passenger and commodity resources, road conditions are rather poor and highway transportation prices are too high compared to rail because of the rapid increase of vehicles in society. Transport capacity is relatively overbuilt, meaning severe waste. According to statistics, in the first half of 1993 the quantity of civilian vehicles recovered throughout society had reached nearly 7.5 million units, a net increase of more than 1.2 million units over the same period in 1992, a 19 percent increase rate. The corresponding passenger and freight transportation rates were 3.63 billion people and 3.86 billion tons, respectively, up only 5.2 percent and 6.4 percent over the same period in 1992. On the other hand, vehicle utilization rates dropped. According to a random survey by sectors concerned in the first half of 1993, cargo carrying vehicles had an average empty driving rate as high as 48.2 percent, up 4.8 percent age points over the same period in 1992. Specialized transportation sector vehicle work rates were only 56 percent, down nearly 10 percentage points from the same period in 1992. Highway transport's advantages of being fast, convenient and flexible have yet to be developed.
