FBIS4-5215 "dreas068_d_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-068 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 South Korea Russian Official on Asylum for DPRK Loggers Russian Official on Asylum for DPRK Loggers SK0804132094 Seoul YONHAP in English 1306 GMT 8 Apr 94 SK0804132094 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] New Delhi, April 8 (YONHAP) -- Russian Vice Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov said here on Friday that if South Korea wishes it, Russia would send all those North Korean loggers who had escaped from their logging yards in Siberia to South Korea. Panov, now here to attend the 50th U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) meeting, told the YONHAP news agency that there would be no problem in permitting their asylum in South Korea. Saying that talks were going on with North Korea over whether to continue to keep North Korean logging yards in Siberia, the Russian vice foreign minister said a new agreement could be concluded before long taking into account the views of human rights organizations concerned about the rights of North Korean loggers. With regard to his recent remarks that Russia would support North Korea if it is invaded, Panov said that Russia is the successor to the former Soviet Union and that the agreements signed between the USSR and North Korea still remain valid. "If we repeal USSR-North Korea agreements overnight, it would lead to a great confusion," he said. "But, we are re-interpreting some of the clauses of such agreements now that things have changed." Russia is seeking ways to cope with the changed reality while keeping the existing agreements without offending North Korea if possible, Panov said.
