I would like to convey to you the greetings of all the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia], the greetings of all Macedonians, Albanians, Turks, and members of all the nationalities who live in our land. I convey to you their warm greetings and best wishes for the prosperity of your country and for the well-being and success of all your citizens, as well as for success in your responsible work. These greetings also signify full support for your efforts for the democratic transformation of Bulgaria in an historic period of transition. On the other hand, it also means support for your efforts for peace, understanding, and good-neighborly relations between the Macedonian and Bulgarian peoples and among all Balkan nations and states. These greetings also express Macedonia's striving to develop, on the broadest possible basis, good-neighborly relations and mutual selfless cooperation with Bulgaria at all levels. In this context, I would like to say that Bulgaria being the first to recognize the independence of the Republic of Macedonia was an act of great historical importance. [applause] This not only opened a new era in neighborly relations and cooperation, but also was a major contribution to future cooperation between the Bulgarian and Macedonian peoples. Furthermore, this was a major contribution to peace and stability in the southern Balkans. Adhering to political realism has proved to be the best means of overcoming various historical elements of distrust, frustrations, and unfortunate oversights between the Macedonian and Bulgarian peoples. Ladies and gentlemen, the great changes that have taken place in the last few years on the territory of the former SFRY allowed the Republic of Macedonia finally, after a long struggle, to achieve its total independence as an internationally recognized legal entity. This was an expression of the century-long striving of the Macedonian people for their own state, created by peaceful and democratic means, with the maximum participation of the widest people's initiative on a political and pluralistic basis. As a result of the referendum and the free elections, for the past four years our country has been steadily constructing a political, social, and parliamentary democracy of a modern European type. Conditions are being created for establishing and activating the market economy. The free creative initiatives of the people are being released in the economic and other spheres. Thus the political, economic, and social character of the country is being changed. This is a precondition for constructing the Republic of Macedonia as a stable and democratic European state, a land of free people and citizens, regardless of their ethnic, social, national, religious, or any other affiliations. Within this framework we have created new space for the development, expression, and affirmation of Macedonian creativity, science, and culture. Drawing from their ancient national, cultural, and political traditions, personnified today by the free Macedonian state, and in cooperation with the other Balkan, European, and non-European nations, the Macedonian people are today discovering broad prospects for effecting a comprehensive national and social upsurge. Our country, like many others at the present time, is experiencing a difficult period of transition, with many inherited and newly emerged difficulties of an internal and international character. We are committed to a peaceful policy, exclusively based on peaceful and democratic means and cooperation and conducted through a dialogue of a bilateral and broader international nature. How do we see Macedonia? Independent Macedonia is a peaceful and stable Balkan state with a European orientation. It is a factor for comprehensive peace and stability in the Balkans. It is a state with open borders and an affirmed policy of good-neighborly relations. Unfortunately, we live in a region where a tragic war is being waged in our immediate vicinity. We witness daily this war's horrible repercussions, the ethnic cleansing, international and interreligious hatred, the encroachment of borders by force, all of which brings back our fresh memories of the totalitarian and quasi-democratic systems in the Balkans, the ideological confrontation of the Cold War, and the division of the region into blocs. Unfortunately, Balkan history is full of wars, clashes, international hatred, and nationalistic deceptions. Therefore, today we all must draw lessons from history and utilize them to the benefit of free men and our nations, and with a due sense of responsibility, now more than ever before, for turning the present world into a good place in which we should all learn to live together. Everyone should live his own life, but each one of us alongside the other, with each helping the other. Factors such as good-neighborly relations and confidence could be the key to achieving peace and stability in the Balkans. In addition, it is especially important to adhere to the principle of respect for the existing borders between states and the rights of minorities, resolving all problems through political and peaceful means. In our country, we are trying to improve relations among peoples and international relations alike. In this manner, we managed to stay out of the war and make a contribution to peace and stability in the region. In this enterprise, we were guided by the lasting interests of the Macedonian people and all our citizens, as well as their striving to live in conditions of peace and good-neighborly relations in the Balkans and Europe. We are convinced that this is also in the interest of others, including the Bulgarian people and all the citizens of the Republic of Bulgaria. It is our duty to express this interest in material form on the basis of total neighborly trust, friendship, and cooperation between us and our peoples. In this way, all of us together could turn the Balkans into a region of peace, freedom, and cooperation. In this context, I would like to impart my belief that only in this manner will we be able to combine most effectively the processes of European integration, of the large, so-called European home, and extend this home into the Balkans. The Republic of Macedonia is firmly following this road and is prepared to cooperate with all Balkan and European countries. I would venture the belief that within this context Bulgaria and Macedonia have identical views, interests, and methods of work. Because of the policy that our country has been following, within a brief period of time we have achieved broad international recognition and affirmation. We became a member of the United Nations and of a large number of international organizations. We established friendly and diplomatic relations with dozens of European and non-European countries. We cooperate for achieving peace with all members of the international community and are striving toward our integration in the European structures. From a domestic viewpoint, we are preoccupied with adopting measures for economic stabilization and strengthening the institutions of power. In this context, I can say that while all this is being effected under very difficult conditions of transition and external pressure, we have succeeded in creating a rule-of-law state and a parliamentary democracy. Simultaneously, precisely like Bulgaria, many of our difficulties result from the strong effects and the consequences of the international sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro. The Macedonian economy is suffering great losses because of these sanctions. So far, these losses amount to about $3 billion. However, this is not everything. For two months now, Macedonia has been exposed to the unjustified and unilateral measures of the Greek Government. A strict embargo on our exports and imports was established. Our country was almost hermetically sealed off. Because of this embargo, our economy is incurring direct losses of more than $60 million every month. The embargo has grave consequences not only for our economy but also for our country's social life. However, with great economic sacrifices we are resisting this situation. According to the IMF, we are conducting a successful struggle against inflation. We became a member of all international financial institutions. We began to systematically resolve all problems related to privatization and to intensify the process of privatization and transformation of the larger economic systems. For this purpose, we need various kinds of economic aid. We attach special importance to developing our infrastructure and our relations with our neighbors in this context. We regard the construction of the East-West main road-rail link, to which Macedonia, Albania, Turkey, and Italy, as well as other international institutions, have committed themselves, as an investment in developing the whole of southeast Europe. The construction of the railroad, which will connect our two countries for the first time, will become a new, important factor of great significance for developing Bulgarian-Macedonian economic and other cooperation more successfully. Esteemed ladies and gentlemen, we live at a time of great changes. Therefore, we all bear a great responsibility to our peoples, while at the same time we are trying to resolve problems of vital importance for present and future generations. Speaking about Macedonia, I can say with a full sense of responsibility that we are firmly determined to direct peacefully all our strivings and efforts toward strengthening the free and independent status of the Republic of Macedonia. We assumed such a commitment to our people through the independence referendum. This commitment also stems from our Constitution, which stresses that the Macedonian nation is based on the principle of self-determination, an aspiration that our people expressed in the referendum on the establishment of the independent Republic of Macedonia. We view this as a historic task and a responsibility toward our people. Simultaneously, we feel a sense of responsibility to the historic heroism of our ancestors, who for centuries struggled for their Macedonian national name and dignity. We are also responsible for the future of the younger generation, which should enjoy a better life than us. With democratic means and the criteria of modern times, we will create both the present and future life. Ladies and gentlemen, dear Bulgarian friends, Macedonia adheres to the principle of good-neighborly relations. Being situated in the very center of the Balkans, at the very crossroads, Macedonia has the privilege of having four different borders with four nations and states, with which it has been destined to share both good and bad. The history of relations with the Balkan states and peoples is a long and complicated one. It is full of many conflicts and misunderstandings, which often related to Macedonia or neighboring territory. Unfortunately, we are witnesses of the fact that problems still exist among the individual Balkan states. We too are involved in serious disputes, such as the one with our southern neighbor. However, past experience shows that when each state strives to resolve the problems on the basis of equal dialogue the danger for the Balkan region can be eliminated. Even the most complex problem can be resolved by peaceful means. Neighborly trust can be directly and responsibly established as a precondition for resolving any problem. This is an instrument that can eliminate all sources of conflicts and instability in the Balkan region. The international community, through the documents of the United Nations and the CSCE, has created powerful instruments for establishing relations between states based on confidence and respect. Thus, a powerful basis for respecting human freedoms was also established. In Macedonia, the democratic foundation for respecting human rights is very firm. This includes the rights of members of the ethnic minorities. We incorporated these minorities by establishing our state upon the principles of modern civilization. In effecting peaceful coexistence within our country, we are actually working for stability not only in our country but also in the entire region. This is our contribution to peace, good-neighborly relations, and cooperation in the Balkans. Ladies and gentlemen, National Assembly representatives, in conclusion please allow me to say a few more words. I would like to express my great pleasure at being invited by President Zhelev to visit your country. I had the opportunity to have a broad exchange of views on the most important issues of Bulgarian-Macedonian relations and cooperation. I am convinced that, as a result of the talks that I had with President Zhelev and other Bulgarian politicians, our relations will obtain new positive stimuli, from which we will both benefit. We have reason to look forward to fruitful cooperation in all spheres and to open borders between our countries, based in law, as it should be between two equal and sovereign states. I believe that we have contributed to developing good-neighborly relations between our two neighboring states and mutual friendship between the Bulgarian and Macedonian peoples, as two kindred peoples. There are prospects and possibilities for even closer cooperation in the future. You and the Macedonian parliamentarians must make joint efforts to establish friendly and fruitful Bulgarian-Macedonian relations. During those two days, we also had the opportunity to continue our dialogue on the most important international issues, especially those of a regional character. I noted with satisfaction a great coincidence of our assessments of the war in Bosnia, namely that it is possible to resolve the conflict through a peace treaty and by respecting the rights of all the peoples that live in this state. No one dares to support this war. We noted the vital interest of both Macedonia and Bulgaria in ending the war, something that will facilitate the progress of both countries. We reached an agreement to consult one another on resolving other open issues in the region, as a step toward building a new Balkan house of European prominence, one that is attractive to all the Balkan peoples. Finally, Mr. Chairman, please allow me to thank you once again for the opportunity to address you from this lofty rostrum. I wish you, all the National Assembly representatives, and all the citizens of the Republic of Bulgaria, much success and prosperity. [applause]
