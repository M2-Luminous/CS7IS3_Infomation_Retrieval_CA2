During this period our party and people have consistently waged the struggle to model the entire society after the chuche idea under the dear comrade leader's leadership. As a result, they have registered great victories and changes which are unprecedented not only in the history of our nation, but also in the history of the communist movement, and our revolution has greeted an ever- victorious era of a new upsurge. It is thanks to the wise leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who is brilliantly leading the cause of modeling the entire society after the chuche idea, that our people have proudly built a tower of socialist success on which the chuche idea has been embodied and are enjoying an independent and creative life to their hearts' content and that they are vigorously struggling and advancing, being optimistic about the future of socialism and communism and full of firm faith in victory. The respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Everything is being properly carried out in our country today and it will be also properly carried out in the future, too, because Comrade Kim Chong-il is outstandingly inheriting our revolutionary cause. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's leadership is the great leadership to inherit and consummate the chuche revolutionary cause that the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song pioneered and has led to the road of victory and glory. The chuche revolutionary cause, which the great leader started its historical beginning, is the popular masses' cause which is pioneered and developed under the banner of the chuche idea, and it is also a sacred cause to completely realize the popular masses' independence by building socialism, communism, through the embodiment of the chuche idea. On the course of carrying out the chuche revolutionary cause under the wise leadership of the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song, our people achieved the task of national liberation, brilliantly achieved the tasks of democratic revolution and socialist revolution in the northern half of the Republic after national liberation, and, thus, built the most superior socialist system of our own style there. In this way our revolution has reached a high stage, greeting a new revolutionary turning point. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, with his insight into the mature demands of our developing revolution, developed and consummated the socialism of our own style which has embodied the chuche idea by expounding the program of modeling the entire society after the chuche idea and, thus, has provided the guiding principle to seek a high stage of communism. As the dear comrade leader has elucidated, modeling the entire society after the chuche idea means to advance our revolution, using the great chuche idea as the only guiding principle, and to build and consummate socialism, communism on the basis of the chuche idea. In other words, it means to remold men, society, and nature in conformity with the demands of the chuche idea and, thus, to completely realize the popular masses' independence. The program of modeling the entire society after the chuche idea extensively contains the most correct goal and direction of struggle for completely guaranteeing the popular masses' independence, as well as struggle policies and methods for their realization, by developing and consummating socialism of our own style and realizing communism at a high plane. When we thoroughly uphold and implement the program of modeling the entire society after the chuche idea we can develop and consummate the socialist cause without the slightest deviation and vicissitudes under any difficult circumstances and conditions and successfully build communist society in which the popular masses' independence is completely realized. The cause of including the entire society with one ideology can be achieved only by the great leader [suryong], the great leader [yongdoja] who created the revolutionary ideology and theory representing the times and who has produced brilliant revolutionary achievements by embodying the revolutionary ideology and theory through tested leadership. Despite the difficult condition in which the imperialists and the traitors of socialism are intensifying the counterrevolutionary offensive, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il always upheld the banner of the great chuche idea, put forth an original idea and theory to realize the program of modeling the entire society on the chuche idea, and has wisely led our people's struggle for their realization. Above all, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il put forth an original idea and theory to realize the program of modeling the entire society on the chuche idea, thus providing us with an ideological and theoretical guideline for us to advance the chuche socialist cause vigorously straight forward along the road of victory. His new elucidation of the essence of socialism and of the inevitability of its inheritance and completion is an important achievement he has made for the realization of the cause of modeling the entire society on the chuche idea. The dear comrade leader gave a new elucidation that by embodying the chuche idea, socialism brings forth a society which is free from exploitation and oppression of man by man in which social equality is realized and in which the popular masses are tied in comradeship as common masters of state and society and enjoy independent and creative life suitable for the nature of the social human being. Based on his original proclamation that in socialist society where the popular masses are masters, ideology is of vital importance and the party's leadership is the lifeline for the victory of the cause of socialism, he clarified anew that the basic factor of the development of socialist society lies in the struggle of the popular masses united in comradeship with high self-awareness and capability as masters. His elucidation of the new idea on the method of building socialism is one of the important achievements the dear comrade leader has built for the realization of the cause of modeling the entire society on the chuche idea. The dear comrade leader put forth the idea and theory on living in our own way and on highly exalting the Korean nation-first spirit, thus establishing an original method of carrying out party building and state building in our own way according to the chuche faith and will, developing politics, economy, and culture in our own way, and carrying out the revolution based on the Korean nation-first spirit. That the dear comrade leader established the scientific theory on inheriting and completing the cause of socialism based on the revolutionary outlook on the leader is the most important achievement he made for the realization of the cause of modeling the entire society on the chuche idea. The dear comrade leader made a comprehensive compilation of the idea and theory on the inheritance and completion of the cause of the revolution into such demonstrative statements, as we should firmly maintain the purity of socialist ideology and correctly resolve the issue of leadership succession in order to fulfill the cause of socialism. To do this, we should build the party as a guide of socialist-communist society under a long-range program, realize its leadership firmly, and correctly inherit the tradition of the ideology and leadership achieved by the leader. Thus, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il gave a new comprehensive elucidation of the ideology and theory on the essence of socialist society and its inheritance and completion based on the principle and methodological theory of the chuche idea, the abundant experience of our country's building socialism, and the scientific analysis of the historical lesson in building socialism. By so doing, we could overcome the limitation of the previous socialist ideology and theory centered on materialism and establish a complete socialist ideology. At the same time, our socialism was turned firmly into the chuche socialism centered on popular masses, thus enabling us to advance vigorously along the single road of victory and glory. This is the most noble achievement the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has made on the way to realize the cause of modeling the entire society on the chuche idea. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il also provided a strong political force and a guarantee of armed forces to realize the program of modeling the entire society on the chuche idea, so that the cause of our-style socialism could make a long drive taking advantage of victory unshaken in the face of any trial. The dear comrade leader attached prior importance to building the party firmly organizationally and ideologically in leading the revolution and construction and put forth the revolutionary policy on modeling the entire party membership on the chuche idea; and, to realize this policy, he strengthened and developed our party into an invincible revolutionary party in which the uniformity of ideology and leadership is firmly ensured, in which the entire party membership is united as strong as iron, and which has taken root deep among the popular masses and formed a harmonious whole with the masses. The dear comrade leader placed the unity and cohesion between the party and the people onto a high plane of wholehearted unity, and combined the entire society into one sociopolitical living organism in which the leader, the party, and the masses share their destiny. In this process, the main force of our revolution, the main force of the cause of our-style socialism, has been solidified as an indestructible force. Based on his insight into the important significance of the revolutionary armed forces in carrying out the cause of socialism, the dear comrade leader put forth the independent army building policy on modeling the entire army on the chuche idea, and strengthened and developed the People's Army to be one-a-match-for-a-hundred revolutionary armed forces well prepared politically, ideologically, and in terms of military technology. Hence, our people have come to have invincible revolutionary armed forces that can support with arms the cause of modeling the entire society on the chuche idea. Solidifying the main force of the revolution into an invincible force and providing strong revolutionary armed forces constitute a decisive factor that brings forth the victorious advance and ultimate completion of the cause of modeling the entire society on the chuche idea. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il defined the three revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--as a fundamental way to realize the modeling of the entire society on the chuche idea and wisely leads the struggle to implement it. By so doing, he successfully remakes nature, society, and people as demanded by the chuche idea. The dear comrade leader put forth the three revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--as a strategical line for socialist-communist building, and exercised his leadership so that the technological and cultural revolutions could be vigorously pushed forward with the ideological revolution given prior importance. He exercised his leadership so that the party's leadership role for the three revolutions would be intensified, so that the movement of winning the three revolutions red flag and the three revolutions teams movement would be vigorously conducted, so that the three revolutions would be turned firmly into a work of the masses themselves under a powerful leadership system. As a result of this, the entire society came to be filled with the chuche idea, with the socialist collectivist spirit and beautiful communist virtues prevailing in it. At the same time, our self-reliant socialist economy came to be accelerated on the high plane of chucheization, modernization, and scientization; the intellectualization of the entire society came to be in brilliant progress, and the socialist literature and art came to be in full resplendent bloom. Thus, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il brilliantly led the cause of modeling the entire society on the chuche idea, creating the history of great victory for our-style socialism, and brought forth an epochal upturn unprecedented in the nearly 5,000-year history of our nation. It is the greatest honor and happiness for our people to uphold and follow the leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il--outstanding ideologist and theoretician with brilliant wisdom and great statesman and iron-willed brilliant commander with iron-will and tested leadership--at the head of the party, the revolution, and the revolutionary armed forces. Only victory and glory will shine in the future of our people who carry out the cause of modeling the entire society on the chuche idea under the leadership of the dear comrade leader. On this road, our socialist fatherland will grow and prosper forever.
