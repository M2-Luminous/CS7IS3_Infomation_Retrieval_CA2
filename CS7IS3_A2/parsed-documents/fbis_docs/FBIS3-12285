In a press statement today, Hawatimah asserted that the crime will not go unpunished. He said that withdrawal of occupation forces from the occupied territory and giving the Palestinian people the right of self-determination will put an end to the tampering of the settlers and occupiers with Palestinian blood. Earlier today, the DFLP called for general and comprehensive strike in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and Jerusalem. In a similar statement, Khalid 'Abd-al-Majid, the secretary general of the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, said that the crime perpetrated by the Zionists in the Ibrahimi Mosque at dawn today is one of the most grotesque crimes against civilians in this age. The crime he said, is part of an Israeli scheme to terrorize and expel our Palestinian people from the occupied territory. He called on the UN Security Council and all world states to take measures to ensure the Zionists will not commit massacres against the Palestinian people. The Palestinian Forces Alliance leadership has issued a statement in which it denounced the mosque massacre and called for escalating the intifadah against the occupiers and unify the ranks of our people in and outside of the occupied territory to confront the crimes of the occupation and the settlers. The statement, which was issued following an emergency meeting held by the alliance to discuss the massacre, appealed to peoples of the world and international organizations and establishments to put an end to the Zionist arrogance and the settlers' recklessness and tampering with Palestinian blood. The statement called for a general strike and national mourning for the martyrs in the massacres and saluted the steadfast people in the occupied territory who came out in Hebron, Nazareth, and the Golan to confront the enemy forces.
