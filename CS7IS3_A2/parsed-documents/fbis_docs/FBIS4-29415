The Trade Representative Office is likely to present these views to pressure the ROK Government at trade negotiations. In the Federal Gazette dated 9 June, the U.S. Trade Representative Office asked "U.S. agricultural exporters to hand in their views on problems facing them with regard to the 77 items of goods to which the ROK Government opened its markets in 1989 by 8 July."
