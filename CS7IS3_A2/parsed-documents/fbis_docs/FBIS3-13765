In an interview on the program "Guest and Issue" transmitted by Arab Radio and Television (ART) from Rome and monitored here today, the foreign minister noted that Egypt is a responsible Arab state. It is the biggest Arab state and it was the one that launched the first initiative for Arab-Israeli peace. Musa said that the Arab-Israeli conflict has a long and complex history, resulting in numerous concepts and stances. He added that overcoming these contradictory concepts demands three elements: The first is time, the second is determination and persistence, and the third is a high level of negotiating skills. The foreign minister pointed out that these three elements have made it possible for the Palestinians and Israelis to reach agreement on the Declaration of Principles. But the actual implementation of these principles has been facing many difficulties and obstacles. Musa said the Palestinian issue is in the process of being solved; the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles marks the beginning of this solution. This also means that there are Palestinian rights that must be accepted and restored, and that the situation cannot continue as it has under any circumstance. The foreign minister affirmed that this agreement was a first step and not the final one, as the Israelis think. He said: Neither the Palestinians nor Egypt would accept this. This step does not give us everything but some of what we want. He added that there are essential differences between the Israelis and the Palestinians about the details. Both parties maintain positions of principle on every point. He said: We need a step that will touch the essence of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and the word withdrawal is considered extremely important in this regard. Asked about the issue of regional security, which countries are covered by this security concept, and the relationship between this and the Arab interests, Musa said: Regional security is not open to everyone. Inclusion in it must be the subject of a political decision. Anyone who wants to be included must make many concessions to convince the others of its desire for peace. He added that this applies to states outside the Arab geographical sphere. It also applies to a state such as Israel. Regarding weapons of mass destruction in Israel, the foreign minister said: A resolution of this issue is a precondition for the establishment of comprehensive peace in the Middle East. Asked about relations with Iran, the foreign minister said there is a very large scope for the establishment of very good relations between Iran and the Arab states. It is possible to have Arab-Iranian cooperation and ties provided Iran proves its true desire for the establishment of such relations and refrains from anything that could negatively affect such relations. He noted that one cannot talk about good relations while part of an Arab state's territory, such as the United Arab Emirates, is under occupation. Asked about the Middle Eastern market and reports about Israeli and U.S. pressures for the establishment of such a market, Musa said: We cannot prevent any Israeli official from talking about this issue or from visualizing what he wants. But this does not mean that there are Israeli pressures. Musa affirmed that Israel cannot dominate the economies of the neighboring Arab states, as it is not an oil-producing country and, therefore, cannot control it and its prices.
