In a press release issued on Friday, the Estonian ministry welcomed Churkin's "condemnation" of the 1940 events but denounced his refusal to qualify them as the annexation or occupation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union or as a Soviet aggression against them. "International law did not begin in 1945, as Mr. Churkin asserts," the ministry says. It says Estonia has for a long time "shown patience and goodwill and has made many concessions in order to solve problems which it inherited from the 50 years of Soviet occupation." The ministry says the fact that Russian officials have completely ignored Estonia's efforts and have instead made a series of propaganda attacks and poorly concealed threats does not serve to strengthen trust or ensure stability.
