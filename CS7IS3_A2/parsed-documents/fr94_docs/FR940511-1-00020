FR940511-1-00020 FR940511-1-00003 In developing the FFD Rule, the scope of random drug testing was one issue that received considerable attention. In the Federal Register notice for the proposed rule published on September 22, 1988 (53 FR 36795), the Commission solicited comments on the appropriateness of the worker categories identified for testing. At 53 FR 36817, the Commission indicated that it was proposing that the rule apply to all persons who have been granted unescorted access to protected areas because (1) current programs are implemented in accordance with the Commission's Policy Statement on Fitness-for-Duty of Nuclear Power Plant Personnel published on August 4, 1986 (51 FR 27921), which applies to all persons within protected areas at nuclear power plants; (2) these persons could introduce and sell/distribute drugs in the workplace; and (3) any person under the influence of these substances could cause a safety hazard, if not to the general public, to the user and to fellow workers. Many of the public comments on the proposed rule addressed the scope of random testing. Most comments supported random testing for all persons granted unescorted access to protected areas. However, a considerable number of comments objected to random testing provisions of the rule. A number of the comments asserted that random testing was unnecessary and that many of the individuals granted unescorted access to protected areas have no potential for precipitating or escalating a safety-related incident. Some comments recommended that only those workers who may potentially affect the health and safety of the public be covered. For the final rule, the NRC chose not to reduce the scope of persons subject to random testing. Currently, the FFD Rule requires licensees authorized to operate or construct a nuclear power reactor to implement an FFD program that applies to ``all persons granted unescorted access to protected areas, and to licensee, vendor, or contractor personnel required to physically report to a licensee's Technical Support Center (TSC) or Emergency Operations Facility (EOF) in accordance with the licensee's emergency plans and procedures.'' Licensees authorized to possess, use, or transport formula quantities of nuclear material were recently required to initiate FFD programs and are not included in this analysis. Persons who come under the FFD program are subject to the drug testing provisions, which include random drug tests. Discussion Random drug testing involves two distinct functions: (1) Random selection of persons to be tested, and (2) collection and analysis of test specimens. The random selection process is used to ensure that all persons subject to drug testing will have an equal probability of selection for testing at any time. Random drug testing is also a very strong deterrent to substance abuse. In developing the FFD Rule, the NRC decided to specify random drug testing because of a concern about the threat that substance-impaired workers posed to the public health and safety. Based upon comments received during rulemaking, the Commission concluded that all workers with unescorted access to protected areas of operating nuclear power plants should be included within the scope of the rule. However, some workers have argued that they do not perform safety-related functions and have now questioned whether random testing is an undue encroachment on individual expectations of privacy. See International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 1245 v. NRC , 966 F. 2d 521 (9th Cir. 1992). Other viewpoints contend that expectations of privacy are diminished when workers apply for and accept jobs in the nuclear industry because job applicants willingly agree to significant privacy encroachments including preemployment urinalysis tests, detailed background investigations, security and fingerprint checks with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, credit checks, and psychological assessments. Accordingly, the Commission is now reassessing the scope of random urinalysis testing as applied to workers without safety-related duties to ensure a proper balance between safeguarding individual rights and the Commission's responsibility to protect public health and safety. At nuclear power reactors, the safety risks from someone using illegal drugs or abusing alcohol arise from the potential for that person to inadvertently or deliberately take actions that could affect plant safety. The safety risks from inadvertent acts primarily involve impairment caused by substance abuse and the effect of that impairment on the person's ability to perform safety-related functions. Although the Commission has no information that would indicate that a person is more susceptible to coercion or blackmail due to drug abuse than from any other activity, there is a perception that the safety risks from deliberate acts come from the susceptibility of a substance abuser to be coerced or influenced into deliberately damaging a nuclear power plant, whether or not that person has safety-related duties. For example, the person could lose their inhibitions while under the influence or could be blackmailed into some act against the plant by someone aware of that person's substance abuse. Objective data establishes a relationship between substance abuse, impairment, and inadvertent acts [NUREG/CR&hyph;5227, ``Fitness for Duty in the Nuclear Power Industry: A Review of Technical Issues''], but the staff's review of the relevant literature suggests that insufficient scientific data exist to directly link substance abuse to the performance of deliberate (or malicious) acts. However, it has been clearly shown that, as human error rates increase, the risks to plant safety will increase significantly. [See NUREG/CR&hyph;1879, ``Sensitivity of Risk Parameters to Human Errors in Reactor Safety Studies for a PWR.''] It has also been shown that substance abuse can sufficiently impair a worker's motor skills and judgment that accidents attributable to neglect and human error become significantly more probable. [See NUREG/CR&hyph;5227 and Supplement 1 to NUREG/CR&hyph;5227.] Information reported to the Commission indicates that arrests for sale and distribution of illegal substances inside nuclear power plant protected areas have decreased markedly since January 1990 when the FFD Rule was implemented. Prior to the FFD Rule, a number of cases involving the sale and distribution of illegal substances at nuclear power plants were reported, as described in the staff's report cited previously. The persons arrested for on-site sale and distribution of drugs included both safety-related and non-safety-related workers. The job categories included clerks, custodial workers, craftpersons, and engineers. Since implementation of the FFD Rule, however, only one case of this type has been reported to the Commission by a nuclear power plant licensee. Two of the more significant deterrents added by the FFD Rule were: (1) The requirement for random drug testing, and (2) the five-year minimum revocation of unescorted access for persons determined to have been involved in the sale, use, or possession of illegal drugs within a protected area.
