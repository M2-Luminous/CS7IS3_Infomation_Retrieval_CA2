This seems to be the question the political parties that will be represented in Congress are already asking themselves. A question that, for the moment, has no answer. For some, the question involves electoral calculations for 1996, and for others, only a question of presence or leadership within Congress. Thus, each group has its own expectations. Some are interested in the presidency of the Congress, while others probably are not. There exists a partisan thesis according to which the forces of the center left and the left join together for the purpose of isolating the Social Christians and the government parties. The MPD [Democratic Peoples Movement], the ID [Democratic Left], DP [Popular Democratic Party], PRE [Ecuadoran Roldosist Party], Ecuadoran Revolutionary Popular Action, CFP [Concentration of Popular Forces], Alfarist Radical Front, National Liberation Party, and the Socialist Party of Ecuador could join together, leaving aside the Social Christians and the government, so that the former will be "burned" by their association with the latter. Supporters of this thesis appear to be primarily certain leaders of ID and DP. This strategy, however, seems not to appeal to many, especially the people of the MPD. Yesterday, Juan Jose Castello, leader of the now powerful MPD bloc, said he did not view an alliance with the DP as having great possibilities "due to the rightward leaning position adopted recently by the president of that party, Osvaldo Hurtado. If they want a congressional accord, they will have to change their positions" said Castello, who seemed yesterday rather contrary to entering any alliance. For its part, the Social Christian Party (PSC) seems to be interested in forming an opposition bloc that would exclude the government and the center-left parties. The idea is to stigmatize the center-left parties as parties of the government. This is more or less the same tactic; everyone wants to place their rivals next to the discredited government. For that reason, Jaime Nebot's party seems interested in seeking an alliance with the MPD, CFP, PRE, and the independents, placing Fernando Larrea in the Presidency of Congress. The PSC believes it is of no advantage to occupy the Presidency of Congress because it always imparts to the occupant the "repellant" odor of governmentalism. This possibility, however, does not seem very likely either because of the intransigent position of the MPD, which would become the "starlet" of Congress. Castello was very clear yesterday when he said he did not rule out the possibility of an arrangement with the Social Christians, "if and when they renounce their interest in privatization." That is the touchstone: privatization would align the Social Christians with the government, or it will not pass. The Social Christians are faced with a dilemma: either they support privatization in which they believe, and they appear to be allies of the government, or they take a position contrary to privatization, just to lend credibility to their opposition. An MPD-PSC pact would appear to be asking the impossible, but nothing can be ruled out in politics. MPD voters, however, surely would not like to see their deputies reach an agreement with the greatest defenders of privatization. There are also those who hope to form an opposition coalition called the "dignity" bloc. The idea, conceived by deputy-elect Frank Vargas, is that all of the left and left-center parties that have not been in government form a coalition, even knowing that they will not constitute a majority. HOY has learned that Vargas wants to have talks with the leaders of the MPD, the Socialists, National Liberation, CFP, and other parties that have never been in power. This possibility, however, also seems remote because it will be difficult to find deputies willing to enter the congressional fray, knowing that they will not be in the majority, which is the only way they can enter legislative commissions. What could be called macropolitics -- that which is designed to find an alternative to presidential power -- is faced with micropolitics, plagued by immediate interests, and which contemplates the possibility of present power. "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush," several possible Vargas allies must be thinking, before supporting the remote and still uncertain chances of the general [Vargas]. These are all possibilities that are bandied about, ideas that circulate, but as yet there is nothing definite. A few more days will decide. For now, all that is certain is that no one wants to be the government's allies.
