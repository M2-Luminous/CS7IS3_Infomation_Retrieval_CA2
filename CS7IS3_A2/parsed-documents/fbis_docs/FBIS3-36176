It says that the free interpretation of articles of the Constitution creates a precedent which the chambers could use in the future to put through federal laws and adopt other decisions in circumvention of the Constitution. What is at issue is the procedure for the election of the chairman of the lower house of the Russian parliament -- the State Duma. The letter states that the election of Ivan Rybkin, the chairman of the house, formally violated the Russian Constitution. The point is that Ivan Rybkin required 225 deputies' votes for election, half the number of seats in parliament, rather than 223, half of those elected. This is what our parliamentary correspondent has just reported. This was also reported by AFP. We asked Ivan Rybkin for clarification on this score. [Begin Rybkin recording] I would like to say that in the French parliament it is sufficient for the absolute majority of its members to be present in the chambers for there to be a quorum. This is calculated from the number of seats actually occupied in the house. A motion put to the vote is regarded as adopted if it gains an absolute majority of votes cast. A majority of the majority. We have chosen a stricter option, according to the usual method that was worked out in the standing orders of the Congress of People's Deputies and other legislative bodies of Russian power. Namely, we always calculate the quorum from the number of actually elected deputies. I believe that this norm is a sensible and thoroughly considered one and if there are any variant interpretations in future, we can remove them. [end recording] We also asked what would happen if this matter were to be taken to the Constitutional Court and the court decided that Chairman Rybkin should stand down and deputies elect a new chairman. This is what Ivan Rybkin replied. [Begin Rybkin recording] The chairman of the State Duma should be an example of obedience of the law and that will, undoubtedly, be the case. But I also believe that what has been worked out and achieved through long years of Russian practice should be respected by all branches of power. [end recording]
