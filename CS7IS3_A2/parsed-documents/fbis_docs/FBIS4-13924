Past experiences do not encourage the belief that Christopher will drop from his calculations the factors that made him fail to visit Beirut in his former tours, particularly as the peace negotiations between the Arabs and Israel -- which are expected to be held later this month -- are regarded as important and will lead to results that reflect the ambitions of the Madrid Conference co-sponsors, especially the United States. Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz took a negative position in the past that reflected the official and popular Lebanese resentment of U.S. Secretary of State James Baker's disregard for Lebanon and the Lebanese authorities during his shuttle trips in the region. Buwayz refused to meet the U.S. secretary of state anywhere other than Beirut. The U.S. official was consequently compelled to come to Lebanon and to meet with the Lebanese regime's high officials in Zahlah, al-Biqa'. Today, as Secretary Christopher prepares for a new tour of the region, Lebanon needs another honorable stand similar to the previous one. It should refuse to go to the Washington meeting to be held this or next month if Secretary Christopher's tour does not include Beirut like the other Arab capitals. Lebanon's presence in the Washington meeting is fundamental. The Lebanese resistance operations against the Israeli presence in the south and from there against Israeli territories are upsetting and worrying to the Israelis. The peace and security of south Lebanon is as important as the peace and security of the Galilee. Why does Lebanon not take a stand this time and refuse to participate in the next round of peace negotiations in Washington if the U.S. does not treat Lebanon like it does the other Arab countries taking part in these negotiations? Lebanon has a just and reasonable case. The exchange of views between senior Lebanese and U.S. officials, especially Secretary Christopher in telephone conversations facilitates the negotiating task and the exchange of viewpoints between the two sides. But, in the Lebanese people's view, this is not enough, because these contacts only enable the U.S. side to avoid any reproach every time the U.S. secretary of state bypasses the Lebanese capital on his tours. Some people who are pessimistic about the negotiations in their pre-final stages are saying that the resettlement is imminent. Lebanese and Arab officials are aware of that. The Americans are aware of it too. How then will they make Lebanon drink the cup of resettlement even though it has already rejected this principle of resettlement? All the national parties here agree among themselves on the need to stand united against any plan that will force Lebanon to accept the resettlement of part of the Palestinians on its territories. Lebanon's economic, social, and demographic conditions cannot tolerate the imposition of half a million new citizens while the resources and geographical areas of the other Arab countries, especially those who expelled the Palestinians from their territories after the Gulf war, are greater than Lebanon's resources and its small geographic size. Let us take a new, honorable stand and see what the U.S. position will be, especially as Lebanon only wants its fair share.
