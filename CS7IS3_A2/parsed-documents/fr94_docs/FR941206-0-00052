FR941206-0-00052 FR941206-0-00008 With respect to prime farmlands, Colorado's proposed Rule 3.03.1(3)(b) requires that no more than 60 percent of a performance bond shall be released until soil productivity for prime farmlands has returned to equivalent levels of yield as unmined land of the same soil type on the surrounding area under equivalent management practices as determined, among other things, from the success determination methodology of Rule 4.25.5(3)(a). Colorado proposed to revise referenced Rule 4.25.5(3)(a) to require that crop production on prime farmland shall be measured for the 3 cropping years immediately prior to full release of bond in accordance with Rule 3.03.1(2)(c), or partial release of bond in accordance with Rules 3.03.1(2)(b) and 3.03.1(3)(b). The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(c)(2) require for phase II bond release, among other things, that no part of the bond shall be released until soil productivity for prime farmland has returned to the equivalent levels of yield as unmined land of the same soil type in the surrounding area under equivalent management practices as determined from the soil survey performed pursuant to Section 507(b)(16) of SMCRA and 30 CFR Part 823. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 823.15(b)(3) specify requirements for demonstration of success of productivity on prime farmlands and require that the measurement period for determining average annual crop production shall be a minimum of 3 crop years prior to release of the operator's performance bond. Therefore, the Federal regulations require that, prior to phase II bond release, an operator must demonstrate productivity success on prime farmlands with a minimum of 3 years of productivity data. Colorado's revised Rules 3.03.1(2)(b), 3.03.1(3)(b), and 4.25.5(3)(a) clarify that phase II or phase III bond release requires demonstration of productivity on prime farmland and that the demonstration of productivity must include the data from the 3 crop years prior to the requested bond release. Because an operator may wait the full term of responsibility before requesting any bond release and may request full bond release without going through individual phase releases, Colorado has ensured that the same demonstration of productivity on prime farmlands must occur at either phase II or III bond release. With respect to alluvial valley floors, Colorado's referenced Rule 3.03.1(3)(b) requires that no more than 60 percent of the bond shall be released until the essential hydrologic functions and agricultural productivity have been re-established. This requirement is consistent with the requirement in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 822 that an operator preserve the essential hydrologic functions of an alluvial valley floor. Based on the above discussion, the Director finds that Colorado's proposed Rules 3.03.1(3)(b) and 4.25.5(3)(a) are no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(c)(2), 822, and 823.15(b)(3), and approve them. 9. Rules 3.03.2(4)(c) and 3.03.2(5) (a) and (b), Schedules for Informal Conferences Concerning Objections to Bond Release, and Requests for Public Hearings Concerning Proposed Decisions on the Bond Release Request Colorado proposed to revise Rule 3.03.2(4)(c), concerning informal conferences held to resolve written comments or objections to a bond release, to specify that the conference must be held within 30 days from the date of the permittee's published notice of requested bond release and must conclude by the 60th day following the inspection and evaluation that is required in Colorado's Rule 3.03.2(2). (Colorado's Rule 3.03.2(2) is substantively identical to the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(b)(1) in requiring an inspection and evaluation of the bond release site within 30 days after receipt of the application for bond release or as soon thereafter as weather conditions permit. See finding No. 1 above for a discussion of Colorado's proposed revisions to Rule 3.03.2(2).)
