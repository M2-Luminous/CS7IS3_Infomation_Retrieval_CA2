Yushenkov described various laws currently in the pipeline and said that as a result of Western competition, the United States' share of some 30 percent of world arms trade market in 1987 had now climbed up to almost 60 percent in 1993, as against Russia's five percent. Yushenkov also said that Russia had already concluded contracts to deliver planes to Malaysia worth approximately 600 million dollars this year and that Thailand was interested in Russian arms and the Russia's Scud system in particular, said to be much more effective that the Patriot system. Russia was also trying to enter the Latin American markets, ITAR-TASS said. Yushenkov praised the Partnership for Peace deal signed by Russia recently and recalled that "Western Europe has still not extended the most favored nation status to Russia in full. The bans, especially those affecting quantity, affected the output of military industrial enterprises." Sergey Yushenkov hoped that having now joined the Partnership for Peace program Russia would now regain, if only partially, its previous stature on its traditional Polish, Czech, and Slovak markets, where there was a need for spare parts for Russian arms purchased at an earlier stage, ITAR-TASS concluded.
