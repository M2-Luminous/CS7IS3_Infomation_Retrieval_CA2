Seasonally adjusted trade deficit for the month was $1.26 billion [Australian dollars]. That is in line with market expections and well down on the revised December result which blew out to $1.6 billion. Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show the balance of merchandise trade turned around from a deficit in December to a surplus in January. There was a seasonally adjusted 4 percent rise in exports during the month while imports fell 5 percent, helping to quell market fears that the economic recovery was running too fast. The fall in import was despite the purchase by Qantas of a new aircraft -- the first civil aircraft imported since October of last year.
