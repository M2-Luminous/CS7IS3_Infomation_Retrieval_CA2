During this morning's meeting with the government, the Nicaraguan Freight Transportation Federation [Federacion de Transporte Carga de Nicaragua], the National Chamber of Transportation [Camara Nacional del Transporte], and the National Association of Transportation [Asociacion Nacional del Transporte] committed themselves to suspending the transportation strike, which entered on its sixth day today. The authorities agreed to freeze the prices of gasoline and diesel fuel until May and April, respectively, granted a subsidy to cooperatives of taxis and commercial delivery vehicles during the next four months, and granted tax exonerations and concessions. The government also released the 209 drivers arrested 26 and 27 January during police operations in the Nicaraguan capital, because they had obstructed the free movement of people. After dismissing the agreement, Gustavo Aguiluz, a spokesman for the Sandinist CNT, described this morning's agreement, however, as a show mounted by the government in alliance with other organizations to unsettle or weaken the strike. He said unilateral decisions do not resolve the demands on the gasoline issue. He said in four months a new demonstration would be necessary to prevent a fuel price increase. The passenger service strike continues, and only a few buses and taxis are circulating in Managua. The CNT has called a demonstration of force for 31 January in this capital, where it will rally all of the country's buses and taxis.
