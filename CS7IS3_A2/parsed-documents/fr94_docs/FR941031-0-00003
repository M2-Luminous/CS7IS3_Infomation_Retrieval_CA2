FR941031-0-00003 FR941031-0-00001 The Board also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.0111 per kernelweight pound, $0.0021 more than the previous year. This rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 198,000,000 kernelweight pounds of merchantable walnuts, will yield $2,197,800 in assessment income, which will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Unexpended funds may be used temporarily during the first five months of the subsequent marketing year, but must be made available to the handlers from whom collected within that period. While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits derived by the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted by the Board and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register because: (1) The Board needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis; (2) the marketing year began on August 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the marketing year apply to all assessable walnuts handled during the marketing year; (3) handlers are aware of this action which was unanimously recommended by the Board at a public meeting and similar to other budget actions issued in past years; and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered prior to finalization of this action.
