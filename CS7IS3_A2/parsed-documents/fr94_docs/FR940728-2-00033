FR940728-2-00033 FR940728-2-00027 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Savannah River Operations Office (SR) Financial Assistance Award; Intent to Award a Noncompetitive Grant AGENCY: Savannah River Operations Office, DOE. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The DOE announces that it plans to award a renewal grant to South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC), 2600 Bull Street, Columbia, SC 29201. The grant, ``Emergency Response and Environmental Monitoring at the Savannah River Site (SRS)'' will be awarded for a five-year period at a projected funding level of $17.4 million. Funds of $3,360,000 are available for the first budget period, and subject to the availability of funds, the remainder will be awarded thereafter. Pursuant to Section 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(C) of the DOE Assistance Regulations (10 CFR Part 600), DOE has determined that a noncompetitive award is appropriate since SCDHEC is the authorized regulatory agency qualified to perform the activities covered under the grant within the subject jurisdiction. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Elizabeth T. Martin, Prime Contracts and Financial Assistance Branch, U.S. Department of Energy, Savannah River Operations Office, P.O. Box A, Aiken, SC 29802, Telephone (803) 725&hyph;2191. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Procurement Request Number: 09&hyph;94SR18265.001. Project Scope: The proposed renewal grant allows the State of South Carolina to set up and maintain a program to oversee the environmental monitoring and emergency/planning preparedness compliance programs at the SRS. Activities of the SCDHEC are intended to supplement activities conducted under applicable environmental laws and regulations but do not include legally required environmental oversight activities or required regulatory inspections. The emergency preparedness/planning activities have been conducted under an existing grant with SCDHEC; however, this amendment will combine oversight of environmental monitoring and emergency preparedness activities at the SRS under one grant. Based on documentation presented and appropriate evaluation, it is determined that this award to SCDHEC on a noncompetitive basis is appropriate and is in the best interest of DOE. Issued in Aiken, South Carolina, on: July 8, 1994. Robert E. Lynch, DOE Savannah River Operations Office, Head of Contracting Activity, Designee.
