How do you describe this form of terrorism? [Al-Tikriti] Terrorism is the worst thing in the world and we hate terrorism. The aim of terrorism is to hurt people and for this reason we strongly condemn terrorism. We, as a state, are against all kinds of terrorism because terrorism is an act against humanity and religion. We are greatly distressed by the situation in which friendly Turkey finds itself. The security of Turkey has great importance for us. In my opinion, I think terrorist activities are ongoing in northern Iraq and we are aware of this. It is definite that there is cooperation between Abdullah Ocalan and Jalal Talabani and that their aim is to establish a Kurdish state. I would like to point out that our people and our government want to cooperate with Turkey on the issue of terrorism and we are always ready to cooperate in preventing initiatives that aim to divide Turkey. [Yondem] Which countries, do you think, support the PKK? What do you know about this issue? [Al-Tikriti] Terrorist activities exacerbated in recent years because Apo [Ocalan's nom de guerre] and the Iraqi Kurds are trying to achieve their dreams. Apo and Talabani could not be so courageous if they had only themselves to depend on. This proves the point that foreign forces support these organizations, primarily the United States and the Western countries. The most important proof of this support are the Poised Hammer units in the region. The real help comes from those units. The United States and the Western countries are implementing their plan very well. On the issue of neighboring countries supporting the PKK, I cannot evaluate this issue but I can definitely say that the United States and Western countries are extending their support. Do you know why PKK terrorism exacerbated over the past three years? The reason is that the empty territory in northern Iraq is being used for terrorist bases since Iraq was struck down. This is the reason why attacks on Turkey are being perpetrated from that area. We think that we cannot solve this problem without cooperating with neighboring countries, especially with Turkey. I want to stress a point by using you and the TRT representatives as intermediaries, and I am stating as the State of Iraq that we have never had and will never have any adverse intentions regarding Turkey. The Turks are our brothers and we have great affection for Turkey. We want to stress the fact that we can be the best fraternal country for Turkey and we want to point out that we are ready to do everything for Turkey, not only today but tomorrow also. We can never forget Turkey's stand during the Gulf War. All of Iraq, especially our Honorable President Saddam Husayn, appreciate the recent statements issued by the Honorable Ciller and the efforts she exerted to lift the embargo imposed on Iraq. There is a need for close cooperation in order to eradicate terrorism. If Turkey is ready to cooperate on this issue, we are ready to cooperate in all areas.
