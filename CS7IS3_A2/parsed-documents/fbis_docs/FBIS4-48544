A press release from the Ministry of Power and Steel made available to the Pan African news agency (PANA) said the project considered the largest and most ambitious of its kind in Africa is to be closed on Friday [20 May]. The project was to make Nigeria not only self-sufficient in steel and its by-products but also a steel exporting country. The management and staff of the project as well as the public have been ordered to stay away from the project sites until further notice. According to the country's power and steel minister, Wole Oyelese, the temporary closure is to facilitate the work of a panel set up recently "following a rampage by workers". The panel is to investigate the causes of the riot as well as examine the grievances of the workers and views of the management. It is also expected to "recommend a more feasible work atmosphere for the general good of the steel complex",the minister said. The panel joins the long list of probes set up by military ruler Gen Sani Abacha to probe government institutions, parastatals, and projects since he took power seven months ago.
