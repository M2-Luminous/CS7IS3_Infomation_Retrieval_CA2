Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer said this in a statement on Saturday [5 March], after talks with the homeland government about the possibility of it entering the election. Welcoming the registration by the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front], through the Vryheidsfront [Freedom Front], Mr Meyer said the government was still waiting for the African National Congress's recommendations about international mediation. "Aspects that must still be cleared out include the aims of international mediation, how it will be embraced, how long-winded it will be regarding the constitution itself, what the process and structure will be and who will be invited to become involved in it." Mr Meyer said once it had been established what recommendations had been made, the government would be able to give attention to the matter. "The government still believes specific recommendations about the improvement of the constitution can still be achieved in direct negotiations between parties, and that international mediation is not necessary. Negotiations emanating from agreements between involved parties will honoured, with an eye open for amendments to the constitution by the new parliament, after elections."
