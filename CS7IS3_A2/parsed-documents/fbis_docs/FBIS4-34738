FBIS4-34738 "drlat122__a94008" FBIS-LAT-94-122-A Daily Report 23 Jun 1994 ANNEX Brazil Company Admits High Nicotine Tobacco Sent To U.S. Company Admits High Nicotine Tobacco Sent To U.S. PY2406034594 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 23 Jun 94 p 13 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PY2406034594 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL Portuguese BFN [Article by Claudia Schuffner] [Text] Yesterday, the Souza Cruz Company confirmed that it had made two shipments of the Y-1 high nicotine tobacco to the United States. This type of tobacco has twice as much nicotine as regular tobacco (6 percent as compared to the average 3 percent). Production of the Y-1 tobacco has been banned in the United States. Y-1 was developed in a laboratory by the U.S. company DNA Plant Technology. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has banned both the production and export of seeds of this type of tobacco. David Kessler, director of the FDA (Food and Drug Administration), reported that the Y-1 plant was grown in Brazil because "U.S. manufacturers agreed that the nicotine content of new varieties of tobacco should be close to average levels," which vary from 2.5 to 3.5 percent. According to Souza Cruz, Y-1 was produced at the request of the Brown and Williamson Tobacco Co. The company's press office in Rio de Janeiro reported that 850 tonnes were exported in 1991, and 253 tonnes in 1992. Souza Cruz adviser Victor Sznejder said the company filled orders placed by Brown and Williamson as well as by 50 other customers from different locations around the world. Yet of the average 60,000 tonnes of tobacco of various species exported by Souza Cruz, the only order for the Y-1 type came from Brown and Williamson. Although denying that the plant had undergone genetic changes, Souza Cruz could not explain how the seeds of the Y-1 plant -- the patent rights for which Brown and Williamson has claimed both in Brazil and the United States -- ended up in the hands of Brazilian farmers. Souza Cruz does not produce tobacco in Brazil, but purchases the production of 65,000 farmers in southern Brazil. These farmers, however, could not have gained access on their own to the genetic code of the Y-1 plant. Brown and Williamson may have sent the seeds to Souza Cruz, which in turn may have turned them over to the farmers. The two companies are close partners. They are both controlled by BAT (British American Tobacco) Industries, a British group that owns 100 percent of the assets of Brown and Williamson and 75 percent of those of Souza Cruz. In Brasilia, the Brazilian Government has announced that it has no control over the nicotine content of cigarettes manufactured in Brazil. Yesterday, the Agriculture Ministry, which is charged with monitoring tobacco production, reported it has never heard of the Y-1 high nicotine tobacco. The FDA claimed that this type of tobacco, which has a high content of nicotine and which increases addiction in smokers, is being produced in Brazil. Jose Meireles, chief of the Division of Production Standardization and Supervision, said their control of Brazilian tobacco is limited to "checking the health conditions of the product." Government experts would verify, for instance, excessive humidity or use of toxic pesticides. They do their inspection with the naked eye, without laboratory analyses that could measure the nicotine content. Thus, Brazilian consumers do not have the slightest idea of the tar or nicotine content of the tobacco used to manufacture cigarettes in the country. In most cases, the experts rely on the information supplied by the respective manufacturers. Advisers of Agriculture Minister Sinval Guazelli have noted that the ministry has no authority to check the quality of export products. In the case of the Y-1 tobacco exported to the United States, Law 5025 -- issued in 1966 -- provides that an exporter will be held accountable for the quality of the product he is selling. Agricultural experts are awaiting, however, to receive the FDA report to discuss with Industry and Commerce Ministry the mechanisms for controlling the tobacco being exported. The Health Ministry has announced that it has no authority to monitor the content of cigarettes. The ministry has issued only one decree on the subject; it orders manufacturers to post the warning that cigarette smoking is hazardous to human health on each cigarette.
