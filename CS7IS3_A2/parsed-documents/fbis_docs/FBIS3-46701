Accordingly, it is expected that the United States will be in favor of the trends toward pluralism; that the regional powers' right of speech will be strengthened; and that the roles of international institutions and international organizations, including the United Nations, will be enhanced. Powerful countries will constantly make efforts for disarmament, including cutting nuclear weapons. However, the regional arms race will be intensified, because uncertainty may take place as a result of the weakening of the influence of the United States and Russia. In this connection, the need for multilateral cooperation to cope with the issue concerning regional security will be raised. In particular, because of the relative economic stagnation of the United States and the European Community (EC) and because of the rapid economic growth of the East Asian countries, the world order cannot but become more multilateral. It is expected that the settlement of the Uruguay Round (UR) negotiations and the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) will promote the free trade system in the international economic order. In addition, as the atmosphere for security and economic cooperation is heightened in international society, international concern and cooperation toward the environment, narcotics, and terrorism--the factors traditionally irrelevant to security--will be increased. Accordingly, in order to stably manage the world's security, economy, and other factors traditionally irrelevant to security, international society's cooperation and the leadership of advanced countries, including the United States, will be more necessary. The Situation of Northeast Asia The factors of constant tension--including the enhanced roles of Japan and China, the regional arms race, the instability of Russia, and the North Korean nuclear issue--exist in Northeast Asia. However, the relations among the four powers in the region, which have been important in stabilizing the regional order, will be improved. Accordingly the atmosphere for cooperation among the four powers will be maintained. In connection with the issue concerning security, it is expected that U.S.-Chinese relations, Japanese-Chinese relations, and U.S.-Japanese relations, which have become three pivots in maintaining the Northeast Asian order since the end of the Cold War, will be developed to promote cooperation. In particular, because since September 1993, the United States has strengthened cooperation with China, including the revision of a hard-line policy against China and because China has also positively promoted the improvement of its relations the United States, there will be considerable progress in U.S.-Chinese relations this year. The Atmosphere for Cooperation Among the Four Powers Will Be Maintained Taking into consideration the roles of the United States and China in Northeast Asia, the improvement of the relations between the two countries will have a positive influence on the stability of the regional situation. It is expected that because of the settlement of the UR negotiations and because of the agreement on establishing the Trade and Investment Committee in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), economic exchange among the Northeastern Asian countries will be further expanded. However, because the United States may put more market-opening pressure on regional countries which may enjoy great economic booms, trade friction between the United States and regional countries may take place. It is expected that such an atmosphere in Northeast Asia will have a positive influence on the reunification environment rather than a negative influence. The development of relations among the four powers--United States, Japan, China, and Russia--will contribute to resolving North Korea's nuclear issue and establishing peace in the region. The development of the relations among the four powers will play a positive role in leading North Korea to open its door. The fact that the neighboring four powers are in favor of maintaining the present situation on the Korean peninsula while North Korea wants to resolve the issue concerning the Korean peninsula, including the nuclear issue, through negotiations with the United States rather than direct negotiations with the ROK, may be a stumbling block to improving North-South relations. North Korea's Inner Situation Above all, it seems that in political domains, North Korea will constantly intensify the unity around the leader [suryong] and the implementation of the 10-point program of great unity of the whole nation. To consolidate the system for Kim Chong-il's power succession, North Korea will constantly strengthen its idolization work for Kim Chong-il. Accordingly, there is a possibility that Kim Chong-il may be appointed chairman of the party military commission. Internally, as to the issue concerning the agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first economic policies, North Korea may fully encourage farmers and workers to invigorate the stagnant economy. Externally, North Korea may promote a limited openness to induce foreign capital and technology. At the same time, it is expected that to minimize a bad influence caused by the change of the neighboring environment, North Korea may fully hold rallies of all kinds of social organizations in a bid to strengthen internal social control. The Strengthening of Internal Social Control However, because of the influx of overseas information through openness, social and economic deviation may be increased gradually in North Korea. In the meantime, it is expected that regardless of economic stagnation, North Korea may adhere to a policy giving priority to the Army to strengthen Kim Chong-il's authority. North Korea's External Relations Based on their traditional friendly relations, North Korea and China will continue to strengthen political relations, economic exchange and cooperation, and military exchange. However, to promote sustained economic development, China may seek to change benefactor-type relations based on ideology into give-and-take cooperative relations. North Korean-U.S. relations will depend upon the progress in the negotiations over North Korea's nuclear issue. Taking into consideration the two sides' will to avoid catastrophe, North Korean-U.S. relations may be positively developed. Accordingly, it seems that North Korea and the United States may discuss the issue of enhancing the dialogue level according to the holding of the third round of the North Korean-U.S. high-level talks, the issue of promoting economic cooperation, and the issue of expanding the exchange of people. The rapid development of North Korean-Russian relations may be difficult. However, according to Russia's policy based on actual interest, the economic exchanges between the two countries will be improved gradually. At the same time, regardless of the readjustment of the military allied relations, military exchange and cooperation will be maintained between North Korea and Russia. North Korean-Japanese relations will be improved politically and economically both. In particular, it seems that the North Korean-Japanese negotiations to establish diplomatic relations, which have been brought to a deadlock since the eighth round of the talks, will be resumed. Accordingly, the economic exchange between the two countries may become actually brisk. North Korea's Strategy Toward the South This year, there may be not a considerable change in North Korea's strategy toward the South, including its existing policy on the theory of excluding the South Korean Government and its reunification tactics. Accordingly, North Korea will denounce the South Korean Government by using various propaganda means and will constantly agitate the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification, the National Alliance of Youths and Students for the Country's Reunification, and the Alliance for the ROK Youths. However, because the ROK movement circles have been weakened since the civilian government was launched, because the United States and Japan have put pressure on North Korea to resume North-South dialogue, and because the neighboring environment has changed, North Korea may attempt to change its tactics while adhering to its basic strategy of revolutionizing the South. In other words, as a tactic for holding the third round of the North Korean-U.S. high-level talks, North Korea may propose that "the pannational council for forming a reunified state" in which the South Korean Government and other figures of all strata participate be formed. In addition, it is highly likely that as a tactic for demonstrating its legitimacy, North Korea may propose that "a scholastic fact-finding team for King Tangun," in which the South Korean Government figures and other figures from all strata participate, be formed. North-South Relations Above all, it seems that even though a point of compromise may be found through North Korea's acceptance of the ad hoc inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in 1994, the stage for ensuring the transparency of the nuclear issue will not be reached. Accordingly, it is highly likely that North Korea's nuclear issue will be a stumbling block to improving North-South relations this year. As to North-South dialogue, various issues which have been caused by the North Korean systems unrest, the nuclear issue, and the North's hard-line policy toward the South, may make it difficult to reach a point for North-South reconciliation. In connection with North-South dialogue, in case North Korea accepts the IAEA's inspections, the North and the South will promote talks to exchange special envoys. However, taking into consideration North Korea's pretentious dialogue strategy, it is highly likely that in connection with the issue concerning the exchange of special envoys, North Korea may avoid discussing agenda related with nuclear issues, including North-South mutual inspections. In addition, even though North-South dialogue is resumed to reopen the channel for North-South high-level talks and to implement the North-South Basic Agreement, North Korea may avoid implementing the basic agreement. This is because North Korea has actually denied the channel for high-level talks through its proposal for the exchange of special envoys and it is concerned about the possibility of unrest caused by brisk exchange and cooperation. Accordingly, even if a point of compromise is smoothly reached in North Korean-U.S. negotiations, the stage for fully implementing the basic agreement may not be reached. North-South economic exchange and cooperation will depend upon the progress of the negotiations over the nuclear issue. However, if North Korea assumes the attitude to accept nuclear inspection, North-South economic exchange and cooperation will be brisk. Even if North-South economic exchange becomes brisk, taking into consideration North Korea's lack of foreign currency and the backwardness of its production capacity, the rapid development of North-South economic cooperation may be difficult. However, it is expected that if processing-for-wages trade [imgagong kyoyok] smoothly develops, the North and the South will launch a small-scale joint venture in the light industry field at the Nampo industrial complex. North-South social and cultural exchanges may be expanded gradually. However, it is highly likely that North Korea may avoid discussing and delaying the issue concerning separated family members.
