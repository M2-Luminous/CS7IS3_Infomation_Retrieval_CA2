The EU's trade with Russia is about 4 percent of the Union's total foreign trade. In other words, the EU is very important to Russia, and Russia, of course, is very important to Finland. A trade agreement between the EU and Russia has yet to be completed but, when signed, it will offer future advantages to EU members and, especially, better conditions for financing trade. These benefits will also be available to Finland if and when it joins the EU. The enormous requirements of Russia and the CIS countries call for projects and funds exceeding the resources of Finland and Finnish enterprises. The future of Finland's eastern trade depends on international financing and access to international support programs. Cooperation and Partnership Does Not Lead to Free Trade The EU and Russia have been negotiating a cooperation and partnership agreement since November 1992. Problems like aluminum and the scope of activities of foreign banks have delayed its conclusion. This agreement will not implement free trade between the EU and Russia, but discussions concerning the abolition of customs duties are on the agenda for 1998. This cooperation and partnership is not intended to bring about Russian membership in the EU. The EU is negotiating similar agreements with the CIS countries of Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. Finland has a simple GATT-based trade agreement with Russia. Finland could expand its current share of trade with Russia via the EU. This would offer clear advantages in terms of protection against market interferences such as dumping and quotas. The EU also has access to forceful methods like boycotts. Political Conditions Arouse No Interest Unlike the EU cooperation and partnership model, the Finnish trade agreement does not include political fringe conditions related to continued democratization in Russia. Finns are not particularly enthusiastic about features of that sort, since Finland has traded and wants to go on trading with Russia regardless of the situation in the country. Finland's Eastern Trade in Full Expansion "Finland is in the forefront of commercial relations with Russia and the Baltic states." Tapio Vilkama of TT [expansion unknown] points out that, for instance in the area of new joint ventures, only Germany and the United States are ahead. "Talk about Finland missing the train to the east is unfounded," Vilkama adds. Complexities Must Be Sorted Out Before Membership A recent problem is the compulsory special-product certificate for all consumer goods. Only a certificate issued in Berlin or Switzerland is accepted, the fee for each shipment is 250 Finnish markkas [FMk], and there is a FMk5,000 charge for annual visits by experts to companies. That is why some 60 trailer-truck shipments were returned to Finland last fall. Vilkama points out that the problems must be resolved by means of a bilateral agreement before Finland joins the EU. This would ensure that certificates issued by the Finnish Standards Federation have the same validity as foreign ones. Metal, food, and manufacturing industries -- especially electric and electronic industries -- are the busy sectors in trade with Russia. Contracting is another active area, and the construction material and furniture industries have regained the trading levels of the peak years in the early eighties. Finland's participation as a member of the EU in the Union's cooperation and partnership program would create better uniformity in trading procedures for Finnish companies. Only then could Finland fully benefit from its Eastern trade know-how that has been fully recognized in Brussels. Access to development projects will become possible via Brussels. The EU conducts an extensive program for East Europe and the Baltic states. This program (PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary]) with funds worth 1.4 billion ECU [European Currency Unit] is designed to assist countries of East Europe on their road to democracy and a market economy. TACIS [Technical Assistance Program to the CIS] with a budget of 510 million ECU is a development program for Russia and the CIS countries. But East Europe occupies a more central position in Brussels' eyes. These development programs are internal to the EU. Early information about projects and the opportunity to take part in their early planning stages is important. This includes the definition of technical standards, which are vital for commercial suppliers investing in such things as energy projects. Otherwise there is a risk that these standards will be set by large multinational companies, thus finishing off the chances of smaller Finnish enterprises. EU membership would open information channels for Finnish enterprises about these development programs. Training in the use of these opportunities has been launched. We are mentally prepared, assures Nina Vaskulahti of the Foreign Ministry. She has worked at PHARE and is familiar with the methods of that organization. Finland Must Get to the Sources of the Funds The Finnish list of support projects and development funds for Russia, the Baltic states, and East Europe is long and diversified. The Finnish support program for East Europe includes FMk3.3 billion worth of grants and loans with a state guarantee. The volume of loans for bilateral projects with the Baltic states, namely FMk818 million, is the highest in the world. The action program for the neighboring Russian regions -- Murmansk, Karelia, St. Petersburg, and the Leningrad district -- has a FMk300 million budget for technical assistance and grain deliveries worth in total about FMk250 million. Thousands of people have participated in programs offering training, consultancy, and the development of administrative systems. The total Finnish assistance package, including loans and support, is worth approximately FMk5 billion. Finland is a member of the EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development], but the bank's rules are rigid and bureaucratic. The projects financed by the institution are very large by Finnish standards: The EBRD loan sector is worth at least ECU5 million, with a shareholder participation of 25 to 30 percent of the total project value. The EBRD has invested in more than 100 East European projects, but there is no Finnish management participation in any of these. It is believed that Finnish opportunities via the EBRD will improve when we can participate in the study and preparation phases of the projects. Assistance From EU's Own Bank The EU's own bank, the EIB (European Investment Bank), has considerable investment resources. The EIB will become accessible to the Finnish business community through membership in the EU, although a certain level of cooperation is currently being discussed under an agreement with the EFTA [European Free Trade Association] countries. The IFC (International Finance Corporation), a subsidiary of the World Bank, which is the largest financer of development programs, differs from its two host institutions, the IBRD [International Bank for Reconstruction and Development] and the IDA [International Development Agency], inasmuch as it also finances projects in the private sector. IFC is active in East Europe, promoting joint ventures, privatization, legislation, capital markets, and foreign investment. Finland has up to now been an outsider in terms of the main flow of international financing. Trading, even with neighbors, may become difficult in the future if we attempt to go it alone.
