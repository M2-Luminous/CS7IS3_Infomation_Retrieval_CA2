It is the only manufacturer of laser discs in the whole country. Ye Huaming [0673 5478 2494], chairman of the board of the company, is the son of Ye Ting [0673 2185], an early-day CPC leader. He worked in the national defense sector for many years. According to the findings of YI CHOU KAN, Xianke uses its sophisticated equipment to produce laser discs without copyright for Hong Kong manufacturers, provided that the Hong Kong manufacturer produces a document claiming that it holds the copyright. Xianke can also undertake commissioned sales through its massive distribution network. A staff member of the factory said: Because Xianke "has a backer in the central government," it is not afraid to do this! However, at a formal interview with this reporter, Xianke's general manager denied it. The car comes to a crossroads and the buildings of Xianke Laser Group can be seen from a distance. Making the company worthy of its reputation, the building is tall and imposing, with a chic exterior design. A huge triangular logo on the wall gives the air of a large sophisticated factory. This factory has very powerful backing. Ye Huaming, chairman of the board, is the son of Ye Ting, one of the early-day CPC leaders, and a foster son of CPC Marshal Nie Rongzhen. He has been like a "brother" with Li Peng and the two of them played together until they grew up. His real brother, Ye Zhengda [0673 2973 1129], holds a high position in the Commission of Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense, an organization with a mysterious background. At the moment, there is only one company in the whole of China capable of producing laser discs and that is Xianke. This is why Deng Xiaoping also inspected this factory during his tour of southern China in 1992. But recently there has been some information claiming that Xianke is producing laser discs that have no official copyright for foreign firms and is also distributing them on a commission basis. We Cannot Make Pirated Copies To verify this matter this reporter, in the name of a company, went to Xianke's operation department and, without beating about the bush, told them that he wanted to have a batch of laser discs "without copyright" produced. "We are a newly founded company in Hong Kong. We want to have some laser discs made for sale in Southeast Asia but we do not have the copyright for these laser discs. We want to have them pirated. Is it possible?" "This is impossible. We cannot do this!" he shook his head and said. Then quickly he added: "We have a big name (company reputation). We cannot do these things. We cannot take the responsibility!" The person who received this reporter was a Mr. Zhu [2612], manager of the operations department of Xianke Company. He sat down and took a good puff at his cigarette. He slowly blew the smoke out and his tone changed. "But, as long as you have a proof of copyright, we do not care (about the rest of the matter)." "We want to copy laser discs but we just do not have any copyright proof." There Are Over-the-Table and Under-the-Table Copyright Proofs "This can be done either on the table or under the table. On the table, our company cannot do this kind of business. But under the table, we can pretend we know nothing about it and process products with imported materials to order," he whispered, his hand covering half of his mouth. "What I am saying is, though we know it is pirating, we will not take the responsibility. Do you get the point?" He then added: "We know nothing about your company and probably cannot find out where you are at all. We also do not know if your company exists or not. But we do not care about this. As long as you give us a written claim to copyright, stamped with your company seal, it is okay." "Is it really okay, even if we do not hold the copyright of the laser discs?" this reporter asked again. "Of course it is okay. Our company does not care whether or not you really hold the copyright of the programs on the master discs. We are only responsible for processing imported materials and do not worry about anything else," he emphasized. "If you write a proof of copyright, stamped with your seal, sign a contract with us, and pay a 50 percent down payment, we will deliver the goods at the agreed time." Taking Care of Everything Concerning the Job It takes only around two weeks from placing an order to the delivery of goods, he said. As business is good at the moment, the order books are full till March. For this reason, an order must be placed as quickly as possible. He patiently explained to this reporter the calculations for every section. An order for at least 3,000 copies should be placed each time because the production cost for each piece is 128 yuan. The price is negotiable for mass production and could be 120 yuan for an order of 5,000 copies. "Can a disc purchased from a shop be reproduced?" "Sure, so long as the laser disc is original, of good quality, and not a reproduction. We can find someone to make a master copy." "Where can it be made?" "You don't have to bother about that. We can find some friends locally or figures from high-tech companies in other provinces. A master tape can be made in a week or so at the price of HK$40,000 to HK$50,000 (Hong Kong dollars)." "What about the cover and package?" "We can make the covers for five yuan each. The reproduction, which includes the trade mark such as Polygram, Fitto, and patterns, will be exactly the same as the original." He explained with a smile: "If the reproduced copies are sold with the original ones, no one will be able to distinguish the original from the reproduced ones." He also proposed reproducing from Fitto rather than Polygram because management of the latter was stricter than the former. Our request to reproduce songs from different discs could also be met. Willing to Sell 1,000 Copies for Us "An order for Karaoke discs is generally 3,000 copies. We can sell 1,000 for you in the domestic market." "Where would you sell them." "You do not have to worry about that. We have connections with a number of provinces, including Karaoke boxes, commercial arcades, and shops." He said that production of a film disc is the same as that of a Karaoke disc. As the market for film discs is limited, they usually receive orders for 1,000 each. Delivery of Goods is Safer in Macao "When the discs are reproduced, where will they be delivered?" "The goods are delivered in Shenzhen. You have to go through the customs and that is not our responsibility." He said, after some hesitation: "It will probably be rather difficult to go through the Hong Kong customs. The companies which have placed orders in the past have usually left from Macao because the customs there can be easily passed without trouble. When the goods arrive in Macao, they can be shipped directly to Southeast Asia, bypassing Hong Kong customs." "Upon your request, we can deliver the goods to Zhuhai but you will still have to go through customs in Macao." More Pirated Laser Discs Are Finding Their Way into Hong Kong The number of pirated karaoke laser discs impounded by Hong Kong Customs has been rising. Early this month 6,000 laser discs worth $3 million were seized; 10,000 were seized late last year. Pun Yeung-kong, Custom's Bureau of Copyright and Trademark Investigation chief, said these laser discs came from Southeast Asia, Taiwan, and South Korea. There were no indications of massive inflows of pirated mainland discs into Hong Kong, although he could not rule out the possibility that crafty merchants sold pirated discs overseas via Macao before they were imported into Hong Kong, trying to divert attention through this tortuous route. He said Hong Kong Customs has obtained some information on illegal laser and compact disc copying by mainland factories and has provided such information to mainland customs. But it is not for the Hong Kong Customs to decide how this matter should be handled. Matters Are Made Easier with Connections Within Beijing's Officialdom By this time the manager was obviously in high spirits. This reporter asked him: "You must have invested quite a lot for such an operation?" "We sank about 7 to 8 billion yuan into it!" said the manager, taking a company manual from a cabinet. "We are the only one capable of making laser discs and laser disc players in the mainland. Look! Deng Xiaoping visited us on his southern inspection tour... Li Peng, Jiang Zemin, Zhu Rongji, Zou Jiahua -- all of them have visited us." He said with glee: "Our president is Mr Ye Huaming, Ye Ting's son." "Has being in this business ever worried you?" "No, we have connections in Beijing. Matters are made easier with connections within Beijing officialdom!" Then he lowered his voice whispered: "Hurry up if you want to place an order. We've heard that the central authorities are going to hit hard on copyright piracy. Things might not be as good then and we may have to stand watching the money flow passing us by." He said Xianke has high productive forces, annually churning out 5 million compact discs and possibly 1.5 million laser discs. The output is quite astounding. During this reporter's "business conversation" with the manager, he screened a Hong Kong production "Moonlight in Tsim Sa Tsui East" for the reporter, saying his company owned the copyright of this movie. But according to the producer of this movie, Cheung Kuen, the movie had never been distributed in the mainland, much less selling the copyright to Xianke. Investigations show that Ye Huaming is closely connected with the National Defense Ministry. He himself worked in its Fifth Research Department for many years. The research department was founded by his foster father, Nie Rongzhen. Hailed By the National Defense Sector Ye Huaming's brother, Ye Zhengda, has also worked in the national defense sector for many years. He is now deputy director of the Science and Technology Committee of the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense. Ye Huaming and Li Peng are both descendants of revolutionary martyrs but were adopted by "heavyweights" of different ranks (Li Peng's foster father is Zhou Enlai). They knew each other as boys, grew up together, and are very nice to each other. These "sons of Heaven" who emerged powerful at about the same time have formed a tight relationship network. Vigorous Support From the Leadership For this reason, Ye Huaming has had vigorous support in the few years during which he has tried to make Xianke Corporation a success. For instance, when the corporation found the expenditure of importing a Phillips production line exceeded the budget, Ye went to Beijing to talk with Li Peng. As a result Xianke obtained appropriations from Beijing for its production line purchase. Li Peng also personally attended the ribbon-cutting and inscription opening ceremony for Xianke. There have been visits in the past few years from high level leaders such as Jiang Zemin, Zhu Rongji, Zou Jiahua, and Liu Huaqing, greatly enhancing its goodwill. "We Will Never Be Involved in Copyright Piracy!" In an interview with this reporter, Tang Shaokai, Xianke Corporation general manager, firmly maintained that they would never be involved in copyright piracy and hoped to join hands with Hong Kong in cracking down on it. "Is there truth in references overseas that your company accepts orders for making pirated laser discs?" "We offer processing and assembly services. But we always demand proof of copyright, that is effective certification, before we accept orders. We will not accept any without such proof." "What is effective certification?" "That is the copyright has been purchased; or you have signed a copyright contract. That is, for example, this movie is a production of a certain film distributor. We cannot take manufacturing orders without such proof." "If we produce a sheet of paper stating, say, we own the copyright of this laser disc. Will that do?" "In principle, no," Tang Shaokai replied swiftly. "Why? Because a statement written by you cannot prove that you have the copyright." "Does your company closely monitor processing and copyright?" "It should be so. In general it is pretty tight," he replied quickly. "What are your feelings and response to claims by some Hong Kong and overseas companies in the same industry that your company is taking orders to make pirated copies? "Well, right now I don't quite know how to make a response. Under individual circumstances, it is possible that such a thing has happened. It is possible that the copyright proof was fake and we did not discover it. We only have a few people who are knowledgeable in this area so such a thing may have happened. But we will never deliberately involve ourselves in copyright piracy," Tang Shaokai replied. He also said agitatedly: "As an entertainment company, we hope that the publishing firms in Hong Kong and the mainland can join forces. Because copyright piracy has also given us great pressure and made an impact. We hope that the two sides can come together and talk about this problem." Ye Huaming Has Worked For the Ministry of National Defense for 20 Years As a child of a revolutionary martyr, Ye Huaming has always enjoyed special considerations ever since his early childhood. He was sent to study in a military aeronautical institute in the Soviet Union in 1953 and has worked in scientific research organs under the Ministry of National Defense for over 20 years. He came south to Shenzhen and worked as director of the city's Scientific Committee as early as 1983 when Shenzhen began practicing the open-door policy. Not long after he came to Shenzhen, however, Ye Huaming gave up his official career with the government and engaged himself in the enterprise sector by setting up Xianke Laser Limited. An open-minded man as he is, Ye Huaming used to fiercely criticize the bureaucratic structure of the Shenzhen Government; he also believes that Shenzhen can "change" politically by further carrying out the political reform. Hong Kong's Film Producers Suffer Heavy Losses A great many small-scale video-producing factories on the mainland are engaged in illegally reprinting large numbers of films produced in Hong Kong. Hong Kong's film industry is been very concerned about the current situation and has estimated the losses already incurred through piracy at hundreds of millions of Hong Kong dollars. Ma Feng-kuo, deputy director of the Hong Kong Film Industry Association, recently revealeed the seriousness of the matter to the Chinese authorities during his trip to Beijing with a delegation. He said: "We have disclosed our opinions to the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television, telling them that many small factories on the mainland have been involved in the illegal production of video tapes and laser discs of Hong Kong- produced films. However, since most of these factories are shielded by local governments, the central authorities have not, till this day, been able to find effective measures to check such a situation." Films With False Copyrights Run Rampant in Mainland China Holding a pile of video tape covers of pirated films, Ma Feng-kuo shook his head: "We have in our hands reprinted video tapes of at least several dozen Hong Kong-produced films, yet all of them have obtained both licenses and projection permits issued by the Ministry of Culture or by the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television. However, since none of the the copyrights of any of these films has ever been sold to the mainland, we can say for sure that the copyright certificates held by the manufacturers of such video tapes are all false." He indicated that illegally reprinted video tapes and laser discs of Hong Kong-produced films are circulating on the mainland through two channels. One is to apply for licenses with the Ministry of Culture or other organs by using counterfeit certificates of copyright so that the issuance and projection of pirated video tapes and discs can be "legalized," while the other is to illegally reproduce films in large numbers and then circulate them through underground channels. Hong Kong Film Producers Are Faced With Losses of Hundreds of Millions of Hong Kong Dollars This huge illegal market has caused heavy losses to Hong Kong film producers. "There are tens of thousands of small-scale cinemas in China with moviegoers totaling hundreds of millions. The total sum would be enormous if one paid only 50 fen a time. Judging by the total number of moviegoers on the mainland, Hong Kong film producers are faced with losses of hundreds of millions of Hong Kong dollars incurred by illegal reproduction." He said that, because the legal system on the mainland is not perfect and piracy is not considered a crime but a civil disobedience, it is very difficult to strike really severe blows at illegal reproduction. "It is of no use to only impose disciplinary sanctions. The leadership has still failed to give sufficient support to struggles against illegally reproduced films. "Reproduction of films is something similar to the illegal reprint of banknotes. It is a pity, however, that many mainlanders nowadays do not consider it as being a crime." Large-Scale Piracy of Karaoke Discs Mr. Yang, who is in charge of Polygram Records Limited Karaoke Discs Department, indicated that illegally reproduced Karaoke discs have indeed been found on the mainland. With all the audio and visual effects of the original versions, pirated discs are either intact copies or selections of original discs. One can find pirated discs on the mainland only three to four weeks after the original discs are put on sale in Hong Kong and the former are usually over 100 yuan cheaper than the latter. Things are similarly alarming on Hong Kong streets. A sales department spokesman for Fitto Entertainment Company Limited noted that no pirated versions of discs produced by his company are found on the mainland and Fitto has not yet begun formal issuing of its discs on the mainland.
