FBIS4-36056 "drnes108_j_94005" FBIS-NES-94-108 Daily Report 5 Jun 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA GCC Foreign Ministers Hold 51st Session in Abha GCC Foreign Ministers Hold 51st Session in Abha Communique Urges Yemen To Halt War LD0506201594 Riyadh Saudi Arabian Television Network in Arabic 1830 GMT 5 Jun 94 LD0506201594 Riyadh Saudi Arabian Television Network Arabic BFN [Text] Their Highnesses the GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] foreign ministers this afternoon ended the meetings of the 51st session of the Ministerial Council, which was held in the city of Abha and lasted for two days. At the end of the meeting, GCC Secretary General Shaykh Fahim Bin-Sultan al-Qasimi read the press release, which said the following: [Begin al-Qasimi recording] The Ministerial Council followed with great anxiety the painful developments in Yemen and the consequences of the continuation of the internecine fighting, which made the leaders in South Yemen declare the setting up of the Democratic Republic of Yemen. In this context the council welcomed the issuance of the UN Security Council Resolution No. 924 and expressed its great regret for the continued fighting despite the issuance of that resolution. If the UN Security Council stressed in its Resolution 924 the eagerness of the international community to protect peace and stability in Yemen, this eagerness increases within the framework of the GCC; thus, the council calls on the Yemeni leaders to put the interests of Yemen and its people above all considerations and to respond immediately to the requirements of the UN Security Council by ending the military operations forthwith and having recourse to dialogue in order to avoid bloodshed and protect lives and property. On the premise of the fact that unity is a request of the sons of the Arab nation, the council welcomed Yemeni unity when it was set up by consent of the two independent states, the Yemeni Arab Republic and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen in 1990. Consequently its continuation can only take place with the consent of the two sides. Faced with a de facto situation embodied by one of the parties announcing the return to its former status and the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, the two sides cannot deal with each other in that framework except through peaceful ways and means. While the council appreciates the desire of Yemen's sons for unity, it stresses that it cannot at all impose this unity using military means. The council states that the continuation of the fighting must have repercussions, not only on Yemen but on the council's states, making them take suitable stances toward the party that does not abide by the cease-fire agreement. It will also make them consult with Arab and international parties on necessary measures to be taken in the Security Council toward that deteriorating condition in line with the principles of the United Nation's Charter. The GCC Council condemned the Iraqi regime for not completely abiding with international legitimacy, for continuing its procrastination, violating cease-fire terms underlined in Resolution 687 by reiterating its expansionist claims on Kuwait, and not recognizing its sovereignty, threatening its independence, and endangering regional security. The statement expressed its appreciation to member states in the Security Council for their firm stance calling on the necessity for Iraqi respect for the sovereignty, independence, and international borders of the State of Kuwait in a legal, documented way. The council expressed its utmost concern for the unity of Iraq, its sovereignty, and the safety of its lands, and its sympathy for the brotherly Iraqi people in their plight -- for which the Iraqi regime was fully responsible. The Ministerial Council also reviewed the latest development regarding relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran; and reiterated its firm stance that supports and backs the United Arab Emirates' [UAE] sovereignty on its three islands: Upper Tunb, Lower Tunb, and Abu Musa. The council stressed its full support for all the peaceful measures and ways undertaken by the UAE to recover its sovereignty over its three islands. In its final press release, the council denounced the continuing campaigns that are being waged by Iranian mass media against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia regarding pilgrimage arrangements -- a matter that contravenes relations of good neighborliness. It does not serve the boosting of relations and the establishment of an atmosphere of trust and tranquility in the region. The council expresses its utmost gratitude and praise for the huge and sincere efforts that are deployed by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, at its forefront King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz Al Sa'ud, custodian of the two holy mosques, to enable the pilgrims to carry out their pilgrimage rituals in security and ease. The council also discussed the developments of the peace process in the Middle East. In this context, it expressed its aspirations that bilateral negotiations would achieve a fundamental progress on all levels; especially Syrian and Lebanese levels. In this connection, the council welcomes the signing of the Cairo Agreement on 4 May 1994, because it represents a positive step on the path of finding a just, comprehensive and lasting solution to the Palestinian cause and the Arab-Israeli conflict. The council also followed with concern the continuing Israeli violations of the sovereignty of Lebanon -- a matter that contravenes international charters and the spirit of the peace process. The Ministerial Council strongly condemned Israel's attacks against Lebanese villages; the killing of civilians, the destruction of properties and its hampering of the ongoing peace efforts. The council renewed its call to the UN Security Council to enable the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina to exercise the legitimate right of self-defense in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter; including the lifting of the arms embargo that has been imposed; the tightening of sanctions; the increase in pressure on Serbia and Montenegro; and to prevent reward for the aggressor.
