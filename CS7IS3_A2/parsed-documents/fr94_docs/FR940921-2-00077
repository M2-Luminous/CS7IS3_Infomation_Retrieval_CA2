FR940921-2-00077 FR940921-2-00066 As is the case for Regular 7(a) loans, EWCP loans of $155,000 or less will be eligible for an SBA Guarantee of 90 percent of the principal amount of the loan. For loans over $155,000, the SBA Guarantee may not exceed 85 percent; however, loans made under the SBA's Preferred Lender authority may not exceed 70%. It is noted that legislation is pending before the Congress that would increase the maximum guarantee coverage for all EWCP loans to 90 percent. This legislative change will cause the guarantee percentage to be the same as ExIm Bank's guarantee percentage. SBA will monitor, but not regulate, the interest charges and fees imposed by lenders for EWCP loans. This approach is consistent with the policies of ExIm Bank and most state export finance programs. A $100 application fee will be assessed each applicant for an EWCP loan application or a Preliminary Commitment (PC) application. However, an application fee will not be assessed to the lender on a loan application for an exporter who had previously received a Preliminary Commitment and paid a fee. The normal guarantee fee for 7(a) loans will be assessed: One quarter of one percent (.25%) for a loan under one year and two percent (2%) for loans over one year. As previously stated, an SBA guaranteed EWCP loan is obtained by an exporter from a lender participating in SBA's EWCP loan program. The exporter and the lender prepare the loan application which the lender submits to SBA for a loan guarantee. In cases where an exporter is unable to find a lender willing to make the loan, the exporter can submit an application to SBA for a Preliminary Commitment. A PC is a 60 day conditional commitment issued by SBA to an exporter specifying that SBA will guaranty a loan to the exporter in accordance with the terms and conditions specified in the PC. It should be noted that PCs are not required as an interim step to obtaining an EWCP loan; rather, they help an exporter find a lender who will make the loan. Another benefit of PCs is that they allow an exporter to take advantage of SBA financial counseling and technical assistance without first having a participating lender. In some areas, SBA approved Intermediaries will be available to assist exporters in loan packaging, deal structuring and credit analysis. Pursuant to an agreement with the exporter, these intermediaries may charge an amount not to exceed 1% of the loan amount. SBA approved resource partners will be available to assist exporters with management and technical assistance. Applicants must be identifiable small businesses organized in the United States as for profit entities with operations in the United States. The size standards applicable to regular business loans under the 7(a) program also apply to EWCP loans. While a business organized and/or located outside the United States is ineligible for EWCP financing, a U.S. subsidiary of a foreign corporation may be eligible. Finally, Export Trading Companies and Export Management Companies are eligible for EWCP financing if they take title to the goods being exported. Applicants must have sufficient experience and capability to complete the export transaction. Generally, exporters should have been in operations, though not necessarily in exporting, for at least 12 continuous months prior to filing an application. Exceptions will be considered where the applicant is a new business but the principals have proven expertise in the exporter's line of business. The exporter's ability to perform is one of the most important considerations in the EWCP loan making process. This includes the exporter's ability to acquire or produce the export product or service, complete the export transaction, and present the proper documents for payment. Therefore, loan applications shall be approved only where such performance capability is determined to exist. Credit Considerations All SBA guaranteed loans, including EWCP loans, are statutorily required to demonstrate reasonable assurance of repayment. Usually, regular 7(a) loans are term loans and collateral is not linked to loan repayment. Assessment of the applicant's ability to repay the loan from operations over an extended period is a primary concern and collateral is important as a secondary source of repayment. Strength of the balance sheet including net worth and liquidity are essential as well as the reasonableness of projections. Conversely, EWCP loans are short-term and transaction-based. The primary repayment source is the collateral associated with the transaction in which the lender has taken an assignment. The primary concern is the borrower's ability to perform on the contract and the ability to realize on the collateral. The horizon is short on these transactions. Balance Sheet strength, reasonableness of projections, etc. are important only as they relate to the primary concern. SBA does not assess foreign commercial or political risk. Therefore, exporters are required to have an acceptable letter of credit, valid purchase orders and contracts, acceptable export receivables and/or ExIm Bank export credit insurance or private insurance that is acceptable. Transactions financed by EWCP loans must be payable in U.S. dollars unless SBA permits otherwise on an exceptions basis. This policy addresses both the foreign currency and foreign exchange risks. It is essential that EWCP loans be secured with a first lien on all collateral associated with the transactions financed by the loan. Also, an assignment of proceeds from the borrower to the lender shall be required as a condition to SBA's guarantee. SBA has modified its policy on personal guarantees due to the short-term nature of these loans and their structure. Subject to appropriate approvals, SBA and ExIm Bank plan to utilize, under the pilot, a joint loan application form. This will enable potential borrowers to better understand the program functions and uses. Also, it will facilitate the referral of applications to the appropriate Agency. Other SBA forms required by law or policy will be used by SBA during the pilot.
