In a statement broadcast here tonight, the source fully denied news media reports that Yemen had accepted the proposals. In spirit and essence, the source said, the proposals constitute a flagrant violation of Security Council Resolution No. 924, and they contradict the resolution in text and spirit, as the source put it. The source said Yemen had announced it had accepted discussion on the possibility of activating a joint military committee, which was formed by a decision from President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, in its full formation. The committee comprises six Yemeni Armed Forces officers, five Jordanian officers, five Omani officers, and the military attaches of France and the United States in Yemen. It should be noted that Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, head of the proclaimed government in Aden, presented a proposal to Lakhdar Brahimi earlier today calling for the establishment of a team of observers drawn from a supervisory committee consisting of 11 military officers representing the Arab League, south Yemen, north Yemen, Oman, Jordan, and the military attaches of the United States, Russia, France, China, Britain, and a UN representative.
