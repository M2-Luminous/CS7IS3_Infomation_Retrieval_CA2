That little-known fact is part of the outcome of the province's farmers turning to produce for which there is strong market demand. They have been doing that for the past 14 years, and now the market-oriented agriculture in south China's Guangdong Province has attained full development. The agricultural structure has been greatly rationalized. Last year, agricultural output of Guangdong topped 88.6 billion yuan (about 15.3 billion U.S. dollars at the 1993 exchange rate), with a growth of 3.5 percent over the previous year. Average income of local farmers has also increased by a large margin. Through the export of agricultural products, Guangdong earned 2.1 billion U.S. dollars last year. The province has taken a lead in doing away with unified purchase and sale of agriculture products and has lifted price controls on all the main products, encouraging farmers to adjust their activities to market demands. To increase farming profits, the sown area of improved varieties of rice and cash crops has been greatly expanded. Highly efficient and profitable agricultural sectors including breeding of aquatic products, animal husbandry and forestry have developed into pillars of the rural economy, together with farming. Output value of aquatic products in 1993 accounted for one-fourth of the province's total produced by agriculture. Deep-sea fishing has also boomed, with the number of pelagic fishing boats in operation making up a third of China's total. Guangdong's output of meat last year reached 2.6 million tons, holding the country's third position, and turning the province into a large producer of meat from having been a large consumer. Five thousand large, intensive and highly modernized production centers for fruit, flowers and vegetables have mushroomed all over the province, creating tremendous profits for it. Improved processing abilities of various agricultural products and the establishment of multi-layered retail and wholesale markets have also played an important role in boosting local agriculture.
