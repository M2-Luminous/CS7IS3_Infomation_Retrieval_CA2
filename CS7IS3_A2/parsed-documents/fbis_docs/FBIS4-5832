Amiruddin says that there is no need to worry about the issue of national leadership succession, because the mechanism for it already exists in laws. "We do not follow a system like the one in Latin America, where the president may be replaced at any time. That can produce instability," Amiruddin said in reply to reporters' questions at his office on Monday, 21 March. In response to a question as to the significance of President Suharto's recent repeated mention of succession, Amiruddin said he did not dare to judge. "Whether there is already a presidential candidate, or the emergence of a presidential candidate is expected, I do not know," he said. "In fact, he says the subject of succession has many definitions. It can be a question of the person, the mechanism, on the understanding of the term itself," he added. "It is clear that a leader will emerge at the time he is needed," Amiruddin declared. Amiruddin said the issue of succession should merely be left for each of the sociopolitical forces to think about when the time comes. This includes the subject of GBHN [Broad Outline of State Policy] materials as well as the question of the next candidates for president and vice president. "All the sociopolitical forces have certainly considered and readied their candidates, who will then be submitted to their factions in the MPR," he added. According to Amiruddin, if a single candidate emerges, the system should not be blamed. It should be asked, however, if they did not dare to nominate their "champions." "Making nominations is a requirement, and such political activity does not imply an effort to seize `power,'" he continued. In reply to a question whether sociopolitical organizations must now prepare their "champions" for the next succession and publicize their names, Amiruddin said that preparing "champions" now is not a problem. As for mentioning the names of "champions," he said he could not yet say. "Judging by experience and circumstances, there is a danger if names are mentioned too soon," he said without explaining what he meant by "danger." Amiruddin admitted that the culture of Indonesian society does not yet support a situation in which the names of persons are mentioned. Developments in society still show variations in thought and opinion. There is the worry that misunderstanding could cause confusion. "Does that mean there is not yet a democratic maturity in society?" a reporter asked. "It is not a question of whether democracy is mature or not, but a question of culture," Amiruddin replied.
