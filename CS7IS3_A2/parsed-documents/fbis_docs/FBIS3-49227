Hanna Suchocka and Olga Krzyzanowska spoke about "unrepresentative" parliament. Jan Lopuszanski has threatened to "organize civil resistance if parliament, which is dominated by the left-wing orientation, attempts to approve a new constitution." What is your opinion on this subject? [Kwasniewski] I believe that such views represent a serious misunderstanding. In a situation where the current parliament was called into being through a fully democratic election procedure, after the Supreme Court confirmed the validity of that election, it is simply irresponsible to say such things. In any case, attempts to undermine the representative nature of the present parliament are quite senseless. The method used could be applied to question the validity of any parliament: After all, there will always be a side that has lost.... In my opinion, our present parliament, which is fully representative and which was democratically elected not only is perfectly competent to draft and promulgate a new constitution, it also carries a civic duty and a social mandate to carry out that task. [Burczyk] You sometimes talk about the need to create "a constitution based on a civic compromise." What exactly do you have in mind? [Kwasniewski] The question of the drafting of a new constitution has been for many years, as it were, the battleground of two opposing concepts. One of these maintains that a constitution should be a more homogenous and politically unequivocal legal act, while the other concept--created, incidentally, by 19-century thinker Lassalle, who was a social democrat (though that fact should not be held against him)--assumes that a constitution should be based on a social compromise. I am an advocate of the second concept. I believe that the fundamental legal act should reconcile the different beliefs, philosophies, and options preferred by society. This goal cannot, of course, be realized in its entirety, but the creation of a constitution should in any case be conducted through dialogue with, ideally, the widest spectrum of Polish society, through discussion and compromise. [Burczyk] Representatives of your political group [Social Democracy of the Polish Republic, which is a component of the Democratic Left Alliance; Kwasniewski is chairman of both] declare that they will listen even to extraparliamentary opposition's opinion on the projected new constitution at its drafting stage. How do you see such cooperation in practical application, inasmuch as, formally and legally, extraparliamentary opposition is not entitled to have a say in the drafting of the fundamental law? [Kwasniewski] Well, we have to accept that extraparliamentary opposition operates outside parliamentary channels and that certain consequences follow from that.... Nevertheless, we still maintain that even groups such as that should be presented with individual projects so that their opinions could be obtained. In my opinion, a special forum should be created for that purpose. [Burczyk] So far, there has been little positive response to your proposals. On the contrary, you can hear critical voices even from the "extraparliamentarians," who do not particularly want to lend their names to something on which in the end they will not have a say in any case. They do not wish to play the role of a fig leaf.... [Kwasniewski] We will not spell out our specific offer to them until our commission has determined the pragmatic framework of our task. So far, we have only outlined our intentions to them, and you can hardly expect anyone to formulate their opinion about someone's unspecified intentions.... I remain moderately optimistic on that question. This is because I believe that sensible extraparliamentary groups will come to appreciate that it is better to be in the know than to be in the dark; better to have some influence on what happens than not to have any at all. [Burczyk] Minister Drzycimski said recently: "A constitution opens up a new battlefront for the coalition, but the coalition is not interested in such a front." In this way, he indicated, as it were, that he was hoping that the whole process of drafting and introducing the constitution would be actively checked by the government coalition.... [Kwasniewski] As far as I am concerned, I want exactly the opposite kind of action. I am an advocate of quick moves. After four years of improvised democracy, it is high time to create a stable framework for the state's sociopolitical system. I believe that we should include the introduction of a new constitution in the proposed timetable of major political events in Poland scheduled for the immediate future. If the local self-government elections are to take place in the spring of 1994 and the next presidential election is scheduled for the fall of 1995, then, by the end of next year, we should prepare the final draft of the new constitution, and, by the spring of the following year, that fundamental law must be approved by parliament and then confirmed in a referendum. [Burczyk] Do you share the opinion that, once it has approved the constitution, parliament should be dissolved and a new election should take place? [Kwasniewski] No, I do not agree with it. This is because I believe that stability is one of the most important elements in Poland's political life today. That is why we have been and still are in favor of carrying out the local self-government elections according to the time schedule, running the presidential election on time, and organizing the parliamentary election according to the proposed timetable. If we succeed in promulgating the new constitution according to our plans--that is, not a constitution of the victorious camp but a constitution of civic compromise--and if we manage to stick to the planned calendar of individual elections, political reality in Poland will have a much better chance of becoming more easily predictable. Is that not an exciting and worthwhile prospect and one that deserves all of our effort? [Burczyk] As regards the referendum on the proposed constitution, there are two concepts to choose from. According to the first of these, the referendum will approve (or refuse to approve) the constitution after the latter has been accepted by the National Assembly. According to the second concept, the referendum should be held before the passing of the constitution by the National Assembly; in this way, some of the most controversial questions concerning the sociopolitical system could be resolved, as it were, while the constitution is still "on the stocks." Which of these options are you prepared to support? [Kwasniewski] One thing is beyond question here: The actual text of the constitution should be approved in a general national referendum. As regards the other type of referendum and the question of whether it should have the power of final acceptance or just fragmentary acceptance, the problem is slightly more complex. This solution has its advantages, but it also has serious legal and practical drawbacks. Perhaps it would simplify the resolution of certain questions--such as, for example, the nature of state-church relations, or the extent of social rights safeguarded by the Constitution. On the other hand, what should we do if the referendum turnout turned out to be very low, and the votes were distributed in an unfortunate way, making it hard to interpret them unequivocally as the expression of the will of the people? The concept of a fragmentary-acceptance referendum requires much more careful analysis and consideration.
