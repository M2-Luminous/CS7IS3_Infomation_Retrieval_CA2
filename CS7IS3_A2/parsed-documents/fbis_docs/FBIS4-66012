The countries which are providing soldiers are currently shouldering too much of the financial cost of these expensive operations. The burden should be divided more fairly. Netherlands Defense Minister Ter Beek made this demand yesterday [24 May] in Brussels at the NATO defense ministers' meeting. Ter Beek specifically referred to the use of Netherlands aircraft to impose the no-fly ban over Bosnia. This NATO operation organized under UN auspices, called "Deny Flight," involves the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, in addition to the Netherlands. These four countries are paying the full cost of the operation, between 75 and 80 million guilders a year for the Netherlands. The participation of Netherlands soldiers in UN peacekeeping missions is paid for by the Development Cooperation Ministry. The Netherlands has previously agreed to pay 1.5 percent of the cost of all UN operations. But the cost of providing troops and material for NATO operations is not divided among all the alliance's member states. The presence of forces including a liaison battalion and a transport battalion, and the deployment of the Air Force (from the northern Italian town of Villafranca to enforce the no-fly ban) and the Navy (from the Adriatic Sea) are costing the Defense Ministry nearly 140 million guilders in net extra costs. Ter Beek has already asked the cabinet for compensation and it is possible that this will be provided for in the coming budget. In Brussels, Ter Beek let it be known yesterday that "financial solidarity" had to apply within NATO. "The Netherlands can not continue writing out blank cheques for years. The political signal has been given and now we just have to wait to see how it works out," it has been said in Netherlands circles.
