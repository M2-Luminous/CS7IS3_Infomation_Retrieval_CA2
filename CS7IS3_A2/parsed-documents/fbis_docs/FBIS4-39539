He said the situation had deteriorated seriously during the last few days. The general was speaking at a hurriedly summoned news conference to discuss the latest major provocation against Russian border guards in the zone patrolled by the Moskovskiy border detachment. [passage omitted] These provocations, Anatoliy Chechulin stressed, are not the best prelude for the second round of inter-Tajik talks provisionally scheduled for 17 June in Tehran. The Russian general pinned the blame for the continued provocations both on the extremist wing of the Tajik opposition and on the civilian and military authorities in certain Afghan border districts, who pay lip service to stabilization of the Afghan border situation but, at the same time, directly facilitate the staging of these provocations. He declared that the most decisive measures would be taken against "the instigators and organizers of aggression," whom the general held entirely responsible for the possible consequences.
