FR940318-0-00067 FR940318-0-00013 Although the option rules of the final regulations, and not those of the temporary regulations, generally apply on testing dates on or after November 5, 1992, the final regulations allow a loss corporation to elect to apply the option rules of the temporary regulations for an extended period. For most loss corporations, the election applies to all testing dates that occur before May 17, 1994. If, however, the loss corporation is subject to a title 11 or similar case filed on or before May 17, 1994, the election applies to all testing dates on or before the time the plan of reorganization becomes effective. The final regulations provide an exception to the general effective date for the control test. The test generally does not apply to an option issued on or before March 17, 1994, or issued within 60 days after that date pursuant to a plan existing before that date. The control test will apply to such an option, however, on testing dates on or after the date of a transfer of the option that would itself cause the option to satisfy the control test. Special Analyses It has been determined that this Treasury Decision is not a significant regulatory action, as defined in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business.
