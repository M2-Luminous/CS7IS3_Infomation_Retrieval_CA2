Replying to correspondents' questions, Admiral Boorda said he disagrees with a message issued by his office (in his capacity as commander of the U.S. Naval Forces in Europe) describing the new Greek Armed Forces leaders as being pro-government. He noted that the message was written by a young officer who was trying to understand what was happening in Greece at that time. He stressed that it was a shame that the text was leaked. [passage omitted] The admiral said this message certainly does not affect his good relations with Admiral Limberis. He added that the Greek YEETHA also issues messages that the chief possibly does not check. Admiral Limberis agreed with this observation, noting that it is practically impossible to check every message. He noted, however, that measures should be taken in such cases. During the talks, Boorda and Limberis discussed the issue of the establishment of a NATO headquarters [in Greece], particularly the installation of a multinational rapid intervention division.
