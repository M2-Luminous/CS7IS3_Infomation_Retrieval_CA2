That position was stated at a news conference on Friday by the heads of the delegations, Algis Gricius, the Lithuanian parliamentary foreign affairs committee's deputy chairman, and Tunne Kelam, deputy chairman of the Estonian state assembly. The stand on the issue was coordinated in Vilnius at a meeting of the Baltic delegations to the Council of Europe. The Lithuanian and Estonian position was supported by Latvia, which so far has guest status at the Council of Europe. The Baltic states' key argument against Russia's admission to the Council of Europe is the presence of its troops on Latvian and Estonian territories. Besides, the heads of the Lithuanian and Estonian delegations said Russia must first solve its own problems and stop interfering in the internal affairs of other states. We are waiting for Russia, as the successor to the rights of the Soviet Union, to make an official statement on the 1940 occupation of the Baltic states, Algis Gricius said. The parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe is due to open in Strasbourg on 24 January.
