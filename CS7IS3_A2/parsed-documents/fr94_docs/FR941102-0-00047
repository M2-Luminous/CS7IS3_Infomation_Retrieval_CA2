ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission adopts an amendment to Rule 3a12&hyph;8 [17 CFR 240.3a12&hyph;8] under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that would designate debt obligations issued by the Kingdom of Spain as ``exempted securities.'' The purpose of this amendment is to permit the marketing and trading of futures contracts on those securities in the United States or to U.S. persons. This change is not intended to have any substantive effect on the operation of the Rule. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 2, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Francois-Ihor Mazur, Attorney, Office of Market Supervision, Division of Market Regulation, Securities and Exchange Commission (Mail Stop 5&hyph;1), 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549, at 202/942&hyph;0184. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Introduction Under the Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA''), it is unlawful to trade a futures contract on any individual security, unless the security in question is an exempted security (other than a municipal security) for the purposes of the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act'') or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''). 1 Debt obligations of foreign governments are not exempted securities under either of these statutes. The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC''), however, has the authority to designate securities as exempted securities for purposes of the Exchange Act. 1 The term ``exempted security'' is defined in Section 3 of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. 77c, and Section 3(a)(12) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(12). In order to facilitate the trading of futures contracts on debt securities of certain foreign governments by U.S. persons, the Commission has adopted Rule 3a12&hyph;8 under the Exchange Act (``Rule'') 2 to designate debt obligations issued by certain foreign governments as exempted securities under the Exchange Act solely for the purpose of marketing and trading futures contracts on those securities in the United States or to U.S. persons. 3 Currently, the foreign governments listed in the Rule are Great Britain, Canada, Japan, Australia, France, New Zealand, Austria, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, Ireland, and Italy (the ``fourteen designated countries''). As a result, futures contracts on the debt obligations of these countries may be sold to U.S. persons, so long as the other terms of the Rule are satisfied. 4 2 17 CFR 240.3a12&hyph;8 (1992). 3 Under the Rule, the trading of futures on foreign government securities exempted by the Rule is permitted only on or through a board of trade. 17 CFR 240.3a12&hyph;8(a)(2) (1992). 4 See infra note 14 and accompanying text for a discussion of the other terms of the Rule that must be satisfied in order for these contracts to be marketed or traded in the United States. On May 5, 1993, the Commission issued a release proposing to amend Rule 3a12&hyph;8 to designate the debt obligations of the Kingdom of Spain (``Spain'') as exempt securities, solely for the purpose of futures trading. 5 The Commission received two comment letters concerning the proposal from the same commenter. 6 5 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32265 (May 5, 1993), 58 FR 27684 (May 11, 1993). 6 Letter from Antonio Garcia Rebollar, Deputy Director, Ministerio de Economia y Hacienda, Direccion General del Tesoro y Politica Financiera to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Commission, dated May 31, 1993; and letter from Antonio Garcia Rebollar to Howard Kramer, Associate Director, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated November 24, 1993, described infra notes 19&hyph;22 and accompanying text. The Commission is adopting this amendment to the Rule, adding Spain to the list of countries whose debt obligations are exempted by Rule 3a12&hyph;8. In order to qualify for the exemption, futures contracts on debt obligations of Spain would have to meet all the other existing requirements of the Rule.
