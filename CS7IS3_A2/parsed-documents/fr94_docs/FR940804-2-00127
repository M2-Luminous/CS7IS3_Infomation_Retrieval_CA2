FR940804-2-00127 FR940804-2-00070 [Docket No. 92&hyph;48] Avner Kauffman, M.D.; Denial of Application for Registration On April 7, 1992, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Avner Kauffman, M.D., (Respondent), 12620 S. Harlem Avenue, Palos Heights, Illinois 60463. The Order to Show Cause sought to deny Respondent's application for a DEA Certificate of Registration, alleging that Respondent's registration would be inconsistent with the public interest as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f). The Order to Show Cause asserted in part that Respondent's registration would be inconsistent with the public interest in light of his 1985 felony conviction for delivery of a controlled substance. Respondent's previous DEA Certificate of Registration was revoked by the DEA in September 1985. The Order to Show Cause further alleged that following the revocation of Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration, he continued to prescribe controlled substances in violation of the Controlled Substances Act. Respondent, through counsel, requested a hearing on the allegations raised in the Order to Show Cause and the matter was placed on the docket of Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner. On September 29 and 30, 1992, a hearing was held in Chicago, Illinois. On September 22, 1993, the administrative law judge issued her opinion, recommended ruling, findings of fact, conclusions of law, and decision. Neither the Government nor Respondent filed exceptions to the recommended ruling. On October 22, 1993, the administrative law judge transmitted the record in this proceeding to the Administrator. Having considered the record in its entirety, and pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67, the Deputy Administrator hereby issues his final order in this matter based upon the findings of fact and conclusions of law set forth below. At the hearing, a lieutenant from the Illinois State Police testified that on January 27, 1984, he purchased 2.2 grams of cocaine from Respondent during an undercover investigation. The next contact between the two occurred on January 31, 1984, when the lieutenant spoke to Respondent on the telephone. During the conversation, Respondent informed the lieutenant that he would sell the lieutenant half an ounce of cocaine for $1,100. Respondent and the lieutenant met later that day, but Respondent was unable to deliver the cocaine as discussed. Respondent, however, gave the lieutenant six tablets of Seconal, a Schedule II controlled substance. Respondent did not conduct a physical examination of the lieutenant and the Seconal was not provided for any medical purpose. Additionally, Respondent offered to provide the lieutenant with Quaaludes, then a Schedule II controlled substance. During their meeting, Respondent also informed the lieutenant that he had once smuggled a kilogram of cocaine from Florida; had previously lost about $30,000 worth of cocaine in bad drug deals; and could obtain another kilogram of cocaine for $50,000 if the lieutenant were interested. The lieutenant and Respondent next spoke on February 1, 1984, to discuss another cocaine purchase. At a meeting later that night at Respondent's office, the lieutenant bought 14 grams of cocaine from Respondent for $1,100. During the meeting, Respondent commented on the quality of the cocaine and promised that it was better than the cocaine previously sold to the lieutenant. The lieutenant testified that this was the last time he purchased cocaine from Respondent, although he attempted additional undercover buys on several occasions. Respondent was arrested on February 9, 1984. Following his arrest, Respondent stated that he had purchased cocaine ``10&hyph;15'' times and had smoked cocaine. Respondent was indicted on March 2, 1984, on three counts of delivery of a controlled substance. Respondent pled guilty to one count and was sentenced on February 1, 1985, to three years probation and a $3,000 fine. As a result of his conviction, on March 23, 1984, the Illinois Department of Registration and Education summarily suspended Respondent's controlled substance license. In June 1985, Respondent entered into a Consent Agreement suspending Respondent's medical license but staying the suspension, placing him on probation and suspending his controlled substance license for five years. Respondent was further ordered to perform 120 hours of volunteer medical service for each year of probation, to continue psychiatric treatment, and to file biennial reports certifying compliance with these conditions. Based on his lack of state authorization to handle controlled substances, the then-Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration revoked Respondent's previous DEA Certificate of Registration, effective September 23, 1985.
