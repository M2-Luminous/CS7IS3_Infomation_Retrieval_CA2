The official made this statement while commenting on reports that the Yemeni leadership has refused the Arab League's offer to sign the document of "the Yemeni accord agreement" at the Arab League headquarters in Cairo and prefers to have it signed in the Jordanian capital of Amman. The official said: The place where the document will be signed is not important. The important thing is to have reconciliation between the Yemeni leaders in the interest of that country's people. Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid had telephoned Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid offering to host the signing of the accord agreement between them. The Yemeni leadership declined the offer in favor of Amman, as Jordan's King Husayn was the mediator in the reconciliation between the Yemeni president and his deputy before the offer was made by the Arab League secretary general.
