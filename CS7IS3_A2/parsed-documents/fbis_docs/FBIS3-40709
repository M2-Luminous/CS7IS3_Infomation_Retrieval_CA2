The protest was registered during the two-day biannual meeting of officials of the Border Security Force (BSF) and Pakistan Rangers, held here this week. The army soldiers were reportedly deployed during the general elections in Pakistan, apparently to strengthen the vigil on the border. In the normal course, the armies of both the nations must remain about 5 km inside the border as the protection of the border is entrusted to the BSF in India and the Pakistan Rangers.
