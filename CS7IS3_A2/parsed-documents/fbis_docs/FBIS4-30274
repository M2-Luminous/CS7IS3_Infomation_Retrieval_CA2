The world's major currency, the U.S. dollar, has plunged in value while Japanese yen has skyrocketted. On Wednesday, one dollar fetched only 99.85 yen, the lowest since the end of the World War II. The people in Japan and the United States are aghast. This monetary incident is bad for both the United States and Japan. The U.S. Federal Reserve had to intervene in the New York financial market by buying more U.S. dollars to save the exchange rate from dropping. The Bank of Japan also made similar efforts. As for Japan, the stronger yen will obviously precipitate the problems because Japanese goods will be more expensive and will not be able to compete in any market. The United Stated had to intervene in the financial market for fear of a further aggravation of its trade balance. Stock markets fell worldwide because it is anticipated that the United States will increase interest rates to prevent the further decline of the dollar and to arrest inflation. To a certain extent Thailand is also affected by a weaker dollar. One dollar which bought 25.16 baht is now only worth only 25.05 baht. On Wednesday, the Bank of Thailand had to work out certain measures to prevent the baht from appreciating. Semifinished products and raw materials imported from Japan, Germany, and several other countries will become more expensive now. As a result of the new exchange rate, the price of Thai products will rise because we have to add in the risk-cost of the new rate. Although we use U.S. dollars as our medium of trade, we will have some difficulties in selling our products in foreign markets. We appeal to the Bank of Thailand and the Thai Banking Association to urgently work out measures to prevent the baht from appreciating. We must not think that we can relax just because our baht is tied to a basket of currencies. The probability of the appreciation of the baht currency is always there despite its link with other currencies. Several countries have now recognized our baht currency, while many people have called for the relaxation of restrictions on the release of baht loans in foreign countries. We must be extremely cautious and try to stabilize the value of our baht currency.
