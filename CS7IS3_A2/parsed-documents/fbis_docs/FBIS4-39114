But Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze hopes for a positive outcome. [Unidentified Correspondent] The unexpected complications in the Russian leadership over deploying peacekeeping forces in the Georgian- Abkhazian conflict zone evoked an equivocal reaction in Georgia. The opposition to the Georgian leadership, which thinks that Russia has no interest in stability in its southern neighbor, discerns in this a confirmation of Russia's unreliability as a partner. In particular, followers of Former President Zviad Gamsakhurdia, demonstrating outside the UN representation in Tbilisi against the presence of Russian troops in Georgia, organized a protest action against the introduction of Russian troops as peacekeepers in the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone. The latest complications worry the Georgian leader as well. Eduard Shevardnadze had a telephone conversation with Russian President Boris Yeltsin on the subject today. In an exclusive interview for the Today program, Eduard Shevardnadze said: [Begin Shevardnadze recording] At this point doing anything in contradiction to what has been agreed, on which agreement has been reached at all levels, would be irrational and unwarranted. It seems to me there was no prior explanation. Then, I think the Russian leadership understands that a swift settlement of the conflict is not only in the interests of Georgia, but of Russia as well. An unstable Abkhazia, and an unstable Georgia as a whole, are indisputably not conducive to establishing peace and order in the North Caucasus. So this is evidently a temporary phenomenon, and in a few days I think another decision will be made, one that will be conducive to settling the conflict. [end recording]
