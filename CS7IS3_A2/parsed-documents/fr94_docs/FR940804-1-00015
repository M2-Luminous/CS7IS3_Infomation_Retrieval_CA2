FR940804-1-00015 FR940804-1-00004 (iv) The price arrived at by performing a major portion analysis; and (v) Prices received under arm's-length wellhead sales in the field or area. MMS also seeks suggestions on other possible methods to arrive at a value of unprocessed gas at the wellhead for comparison purposes under dual accounting. (4) Percentage Increase to Value in Lieu of Dual Accounting In situations where lessees have made a reasonable effort to do dual accounting but nonetheless cannot establish an accurate comparison of values, MMS is considering allowing a percentage increase to the otherwise determined value of production in lieu of dual accounting. Analysis has shown that the difference between the greater of the combined value of the residue gas and plant products resulting from processing the gas or the value of the gas prior to processing has exceeded 40 percent of the lower value in some cases. MMS seeks comments on the feasibility of applying a percentage increase and the amount of such an increase to comply with dual accounting requirements. (c) Integration of Major Portion Scenarios and Dual Accounting Scenarios MMS seeks comments on how to integrate any selected scenarios on major portion with the scenarios on dual accounting. For example, one way to integrate these is the following: If the index scenario is selected for major portion analysis and the percentage increase is selected for dual accounting, then a way to integrate these concepts is to apply the percentage increase to the higher of index or gross proceeds.
