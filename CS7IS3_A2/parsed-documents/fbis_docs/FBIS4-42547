It is a 50-year-old piece of history that is closed for ever. We do not call ourselves neofascists, and we are against all forms of totalitarian regime," said Mirko Tremaglia, who was elected chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Italian Chamber of Deputies last Wednesday [1 June]. His election gave rise to much negative comment in the international press, and Tremaglia has been branded a neofascist. For 22 years he has been a popularly elected deputy for the MSI, the Italian Social Movement. The MSI has always been described as a neofascist party. Tremaglia has been a member since the party's foundation. His party chairman, Gianfranco Fini, does not talk about neofascism, but prefers the term "postfascism." "Whatever that might be," Tremaglia said, throwing his arms in the air. But "Mussolini belongs to history," he told AFTENPOSTEN. In the elections in March the MSI was the senior partner in the National Alliance (AN), which in electoral cooperation with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia and the federalist Northern League under Umberto Bossi achieved a landslide victory. The neofascists found themselves in a position of power for the first time since the end of World War II. Tremaglia believes that corruption broke the back of the Italian First Republic. Prime Minister Berlusconi's right-wing coalition will give society the renewal that is needed. The AN has its priorities clear: "We are aiming at reforms in order to introduce a republic with presidential rule in which a section of parliament is reserved for political parties and another section is for citizens. In the days of the First Republic we had no representatives from that world," Tremaglia said. When AFTENPOSTEN asked if this means that he is talking about the corporate state, he replied brusquely that "I have already said what the AN stands for." [AFTENPOSTEN] How long will the coalition government stay together? Northern League leader Bossi did not even want to acknowledge people from your party during the election campaign. [Tremaglia] Yes, but now he is no longer saying no. Things have changed. Now national interests have been given top priority. It is important to have reforms implemented; to create a republic with the involvement of those Italians who work and produce things -- that is, the forces which have been subordinate to the power of the politicians. This is something which we now have to turn on its head," Tremaglia said with Italian passion. He also told AFTENPOSTEN about a meeting he had with industrialists immediately before coming to Norway last Friday. At the meeting there was a mood of support for the course he -- without wanting to use political labels -- is advocating. "People no longer want to give carte blanche to the politicians, but want to assume responsibility themselves and attend to things political. This is `the new Italy.' This is why Clinton is saying that people must give us a chance and support us. People must be judged on what they do, not on the basis of labels," Clinton has said. "Since the MSI was founded in 1946 we have never had any intention of rebuilding the fascist regime there was before. Over the years the MSI has gained legitimacy through democratic channels, through free elections," Tremaglia said. He has been in Oslo for a meeting of NATO's parliamentary assembly. He has been a member of this assembly since 1984, and has had regular contacts with Norwegian politicians. He also told AFTENPOSTEN with pride that he met the king when he was in Norway in 1987. "I have met many people over the years and no one has objected to me. Now many people are crying: `You were in the war. Fascist.' I was 17 then," the 67-year-old said resignedly. He believes that it is "the crisis-hit Italian left" -- among others -- which is trying to plant unfavorable allegations abroad about him and others from the AN. "Some people have said that it is strange that a person with such a past can be elected chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. What do people actually mean by this? I have never done anything criminal. We will be asking for explanations of such comments," said Tremaglia, who is happy that the chairman of the Storting Foreign Affairs Committee, Hakan Blankenborg, has said that he does not want to be involved in any witch hunt or any persecution of individuals. He believes that the at times violent reactions from abroad to what is being called the neofascists' entry into the corridors of power are out of place. "We have been elected by the Italian people in democratic elections, and do not have a mandate from anyone else," he said. He is happy that Foreign Minister Antonio Martino has made it clear both to French President Francois Mitterrand and to others that Italy will not have any interference or threats. Tremaglia is not always as careful when he makes statements. Last month he said that the Treaty of Osimo which fixes Italy's borders with Yugoslavia should be torn up. Many took this to mean that he wants a revision of the borders in order to regain areas where people of Italian extraction live. "We are not asking for any border changes. It would be anachronistic to make such demands," he said emphatically. But he also pointed to the Berlin Wall, the divided Germany, and to the fact that no one thought that reunification would come, given the situation. [AFTENPOSTEN] What political "kin" do you feel your party has in Europe? [Tremaglia] An important question for the future . "The AN has received an envoy from (Jacques) Chirac's party," he said. He was hinting that the AN now feels at home in the same pigeonhole as the French Gaullists. Tremaglia simply laughed and shook his head when AFTENPOSTEN asked whether the AN does not feel some kinship with Le Pen and his racist French nationalists. "The MSI has dissociated itself from the racist legislation from Benito Mussolini's days." AFTENPOSTEN reminded him that party chairman Fini has spoken of Mussolini as the greatest statesman of our century. A well-prepared Tremaglia trotted out two quotes from Britain's wartime prime minister, Winston Churchill -- one from 1933 and one from 1943 -- to show what respect Mussolini enjoyed. It was clear from both quotes that Churchill believed that Mussolini effectively and laudably saw to it that the Socialists and the Bolsheviks were kept out of power. The problems of the Mediterranean are also close to Tremaglia's heart. He fears a serious crisis in the wake of the "terrible immigration" from North Africa. That is why he is a strong advocate of a 30-year plan for European investment in North Africa, "instead of our taking in 20 million North Africans. It is not right that people should have to move away from their own countries to find work."
