Francis Briquemont, accused Thursday [20 January] Bosnian Croats of blocking the efforts to deliver humanitarian aid to Sarajevo by road. Foreign news agencies reported Gen. Briquemont as saying in Sarajevo on Thursday that Bosnian Croats failed to keep their promise given on January 12 by their Commander, Ante Roso. They promised to enable UNPROFOR to repair the important Bjela bridge, near Jablanica, southern Bosnia-Herzegovina. The former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina has been ravaged by the civil war between local Moslems, Serbs and Croats for the past 21 months. Gen. Briquemont said if the bridge was repaired this would facilitate the passage of humanitarian convoys from the Croat-controlled territories in western Bosnia through central Bosnia on their way to Sarajevo. The general said it was quite obvious that the Bosnian Croat Army (HVO) had no wish to help open the Mostar-Jablanica route. Gen. Briquemont steps down as the U.N. forces commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina next week, after criticizing the U.N. policy in this former Yugoslav republic.
