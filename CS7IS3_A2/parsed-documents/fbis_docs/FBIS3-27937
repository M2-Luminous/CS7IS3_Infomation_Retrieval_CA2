FBIS3-27937 "dreas021__a94010" FBIS-EAS-94-021-A Document Type:Daily Report 1 February 1994 ANNEX Japan Draft Budgetary Guideline Excludes AWACS OW0102100794 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 1 Feb 94 Morning Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0102100794 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] A draft guideline, set by the ruling coalition parties, for the fiscal 1994 budget, came to light on 31 January. In response to the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of GATT, the draft guideline cites projects for upgrading the current agricultural foundation to protect Japanese farmers as the centerpiece of the budget for fiscal 1994. The draft guideline also calls for the need to strengthen the management foundation for small-and medium-sized enterprises and take measures for economic recovery, revitalize land transactions, and construct houses. The draft guideline does not touch on the purchase of Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft and the construction of new bullet-train railroads for which a coordination of views is continuing within the ruling coalition parties. What is noteworthy in the draft guideline is that it calls for reforming the current tender system and drawing up a basic plan for environment, thus revealing that the ruling coalition parties, which came to power following a change of government, intend to compile their first budget their own way. The ruling coalition parties plan to ask the Policy Secretary Council to further discuss details of the draft guideline and to formally adopt it as a "guideline for the compilation of the budget for fiscal 1994" on 8 February after obtaining an endorsement at a meeting of representatives from the ruling coalition parties. The draft guideline explicitly points out the need to aggressively promote the upgrading of the agricultural foundation in line with the "new agricultural policy," saying, "In 1994, it is necessary to take as many emergency measures as possible for agriculture." The draft guideline calls for creating a new loan system to extend long-term loans to be used for the management and operation of farming and for introducing a new formula to promote the effective utilization of farm lands for would-be farmers. The centerpiece of stimulus measures in the draft guideline is the revitalization of land and housing transactions. To that end, the draft guideline calls for: 1) adopting a "public housing lease system for special loans" to promote the payment in advance for the lease of corporation-built housing; 2) creating a new system like the Town-Building Loan System by the Housing Loan Corporation; and 3) expanding the public announcement places of land prices. In this way, the draft guideline gives consideration to the fairness of land and housing transactions to prevent a recurrence of the bubble economy. As for the defense budget, the draft guideline says: "Efforts should be made to build an efficient and moderate defense power under the Medium-Term Defense Buildup Plan which has been revised so as to curb defense budget spending." Regarding the AWACS whose purchase is facing vehement opposition from the ruling Social Democratic Party of Japan, the draft guideline avoids mentioning it. As for a plan to review the plans to construct new bullet-train railroads which has become a future task for the meeting of representatives from the ruling coalition parties and ministries and agencies involved to coordinate their views, the draft guideline hints at the possibility of increasing the planned three railroads and five rail blocks, saying, "It is necessary to continue the promotion of preparations for the construction of new bullet-train railroads." The draft guideline, however, does not specifically indicate the names of areas where the railroads will be constructed and the question of securing necessary financial resources. As for the administrative reform, deregulation, decentralization that Prime Minister Hosokawa has publicly promised the people, the draft guideline calls for an early implementation of decentralization and the streamlining of subsidies from the national treasury to local autonomous governments.
