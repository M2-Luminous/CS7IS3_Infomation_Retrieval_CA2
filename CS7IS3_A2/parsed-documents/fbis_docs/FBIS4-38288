FBIS4-38288 "drnes126_o_94003" FBIS-NES-94-126 Daily Report 29 Jun 1994 SYRIA No True Peace Seen Without U.S. Pressure on Israel No True Peace Seen Without U.S. Pressure on Israel JN2906141294 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 1140 GMT 29 Jun 94 JN2906141294 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Station commentary] [Text] As soon as a possible date for a new tour by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to the region was announced, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin rushed to hint that this tour will fail just like previous tours in the region by the U.S. secretary of state. Israel seems to be deliberately seeking to keep the peace process at a standstill and uses its methods, which oppose the achievement of the just and comprehensive peace, to bring the peace process to a dead end and foil the U.S. and world efforts to boost this process. Of course, these Israeli methods are not new. They are as old as the peace process itself. They date back to the time of the Madrid Conference more than two and a half years ago and to the time when Israel found itself in a political crisis, which it is trying to escape by placing obstacles and hurdles on the path of the peace process, by avoiding the dues of the just and comprehensive peace, by deviating from the Madrid formula, and by not abiding by the principle of returning land in exchange for peace. The Israeli political crisis stems from the fact that the just and comprehensive peace imposes upon it full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, southern Lebanon, and the other occupied Arab territories. Because Israel is not interested in withdrawal or in activating the peace process, it is trying to blame others for the failure to achieve positive progress. At the same time, it increases its allegations, falsehoods, and justifications to avoid the dues of the just and honorable peace. This can be clearly seen in the Israeli position that contradicts in form and substance the just and comprehensive peace, and by Israel's adherence to everything except the ingredients and principles of that peace. Accordingly, Israel sticks to the proposals of partial solutions and separate settlements. It also sticks to the slogan "Peace in Return for Peace" because it does not want to implement the resolutions of international legitimacy and does not want to completely withdraw from the Golan Heights and southern Lebanon. It wants to see weak Arab parties on which it can impose its conditions and ideas and push them into further surrender and relinquishment of Arab rights, and who will accept its occupation, and the continuation of that occupation of Arab territories. The Syrian position is totally different. That position responded favorably to the principles of the peace process and its true ingredients. That position also placed Israel in a real dilemma. Syria, which opened the road toward peace by accepting the U.S. initiative, adheres to the principles of the just and comprehensive peace and the objectives of the peace process. Syria, as everybody knows, has announced its clear commitment to implement the UN resolutions, on which the peace process and the U.S. initiative were based. Syria also responded favorably to all requirements of the just and comprehensive peace. On more than one occasion, Syria helped rescue the peace process from Israel's conspiracies and plans to torpedo and sabotage it. Israel continues to place obstacles and hurdles on the path of the just, comprehensive, genuine peace. It publicly advocates replacing the Washington talks and the principles of the Madrid Conference with separate, secret talks. Moreover, Israel exercised an aggressive policy and did not stop the series of bombardment and its crimes, suppression, and terrorism in Lebanon and the occupied Arab territories. Israel is now taking strict measures to tighten its grip, entrench its occupation, and expand its suppression in the occupied Arab territories. This Israeli arrogance would not have taken such a serious turn if the world community had assumed its responsibility and defended its principles, resolutions, and charters; and if the United States had adopted a decisive position against Israel's vandalism against its peace initiative. It is now clear that in the light of the Israeli practices and positions, which run counter to peace, that it is impossible to arrive at a just and comprehensive peace and stability and tranquility in the region without an effective U.S. and world intervention to pressure Israel. Consequently, commitments and obligations must be translated into a reality on the ground. As much as it is interested in achieving peace, Syria sticks to the return of the entire Golan Heights, South Lebanon, and the occupied Arab territories. Syria will not relinquish a grain of its national and pan-Arab soil. Every one knows that there can never be peace without Syria and without its positive and constructive role in making genuine peace.
