An honor guard was formed at the runway. The national anthems of Iran and Kazakhstan were played. Presidents Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani and Nursultan Nazarbayev inspected the honor guard. The VIP said his farewells to officials seeing him off. After the honor guard passed in review Nursultan Nazarbayev bade a warm and heartfelt farewell to the Iranian leader at the airplane ladder, and wished him a safe journey. The head of Kazakhstan said at a subsequent press conference improvised then and there that he was fully satisfied with the results of talks with the Iranian president, and with the agreements they reached, primarily in the economic sphere. There is good potential for increasing diverse business ties between the two countries, which can now be utilized highly productively owing to the extensive transportation system currently being established, including rail, motor, air and sea lines of communication. In the future, Nursultan Nazarbayev emphasized, Iran may become one of the biggest importers of Kazakhstan's agricultural products; the exchange of goods is growing in many other directions as well. Because of bad weather in Karaganda Oblast, which the Iranian president had intended to visit, his itinerary was revised. Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani stopped in Aktau, where he inspected the seaport and acquainted himself with the possibilities of its expansion and reconstruction through the efforts of the two countries. An infrastructure that will make possible the shipment of a large quantity of oil, grain, livestock products, industrial goods and equipment by sea across the Caspian between Kazakhstan and Iran is to be created here. The guest also visited other facilities of the oblast center. He was accompanied on a tour of the city by Minister of Power and Fuel Resources Kadyr Baykenov, the co-chairman of an intergovernment joint Kazakh-Iranian commission on commercial, economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation; by Myrzatay Zholdasbekov, our republic's ambassador to Iran; and by Fedor Novikov, the head of Mangistau Oblast's administration. The Iranian president took off for Baku from Aktau. His first visit to Kazakhstan, which was made at the invitation of Nursultan Nazarbayev, occurred in a spirit of mutual trust and good will, and it is seen on the whole as having been productive for both sides. Nine documents were signed on the basis of the results of the talks, including a protocol on mutual deliveries of goods in 1993-1994. Thus relations between Kazakhstan and Iran are now regulated by almost 25 different agreements, which create a strong foundation for growth of diverse cooperation. Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani invited Nursultan Nazarbayev to make an official visit to Iran at any time convenient to him. The invitation was gratefully accepted.
