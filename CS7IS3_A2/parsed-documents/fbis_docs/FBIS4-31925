This does not mean, however, that it is an entirely unknown organism. On the contrary, as a fruit of the continuing development and evolution of the European Community, it had long been expected, not just by its member countries but also by all partners. As such, it also is taking over all of the obligations of its predecessor, including those concerning our country. Poland is linked as an associate member to the EC by the European Treaty, which was signed on 16 December 1991. An agreement of this kind must be ratified by the parliaments of all of the member countries of the EC, the European Parliament, and the parliament of the concerned country. Poland ratified that agreement as early as in June 1992, but its ratification by the other countries took much longer. In effect, the agreement as a whole became effective as late as on 1 February 1994. However, its commercial part [the so-called Interim Trade Agreement] had already taken effect on 1 March 1992, and that made it possible to implement concessions [by the EC], presupposing the establishment, within 10 years, of a zone of free trade in manufactured goods. The turning point in the relations between Poland and the EC occurred in 1988 upon the signing of the so-called Joint EEC-CEMA Declaration, which afforded the possibility of negotiating and concluding specific bilateral agreements between the Community and discrete countries of Central-East Europe. In practice, since 1973, when the EEC adopted the principles of a joint trade policy, that possibility had not yet existed; all economic agreements had to be negotiated with the Community as a whole rather than with its individual member countries, but the CEMA countries refused to acknowledge the supranational powers of the EEC on this issue and, pointing to the imbalance between the negotiating parties, demanded bilateral agreements. At the same time, direct negotiations between the EEC and CEMA were impossible because the statute of CEMA did not authorize it to act on behalf of its member countries. Owing to the East-West detente, one of whose fruits was the signing of the aforementioned "Joint Declaration," that impasse could be broken, and, on 19 September 1989, Poland signed its first major agreement with the EC concerning trade and economic cooperation and, soon afterward, the association agreement ["European Treaty"] as well. The latter confers on Polish-Community relations a totally new quality, such that, within a short period of time, the status of our country changed from that of the virtual absence of agreements to one that is much more favorable than that of many other EC partners. It also is a vital factor in the whole of the changes taking place in our country; it stabilizes the direction and course of our economic reforms by placing them in the context of the entire West European system. The range of the issues covered by the European Treaty extends from political dialogue (Articles 2-5) through trade (Articles 7-36), migration of labor (Articles 37-43), establishment of companies (Articles 44-54), exchange of services (Articles 55-57), movement of capital (Articles 59-70), competition (Articles 63-67), to coordination of legal systems (Articles 68-70) and economic (Articles 71-94), cultural (Article 95), and financial (Articles 96-101) cooperation. Although the very fact of the signing of such a far-reaching treaty is advantageous to Poland, not all of the barriers to mutual relations could be overcome. Most of these barriers pertain to trade relations, and they can by now be more concretely identified after the nearly two-year-long implementation of the Interim Trade Treaty. As for the other barriers contained in the remaining parts of the European Treaty, these concern chiefly migration of labor and financial assistance. Regarding migration of labor, it was merely settled that Polish citizens who are legally employed on EEC territory will be treated like the citizens of the host country. Unfortunately, it was not possible to incorporate provisions legalizing the employment of other categories of Polish citizens residing in the member countries of the Community and sanctioning an additional quota for Polish employees. Yet, precisely such provisions would be most advantageous to the Polish side, given the current rising unemployment and the attendant social tensions. Another disputed issue was the financial protocol. Unlike in the case of association agreements with Greece and Turkey, in Poland's case, the agreement merely refers to the statutory provisions of PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] and the European Investment Bank [EIB]. But the EIB offers loans solely on market terms rather than financial assistance in the close meaning of the term, while PHARE is intended to provide consulting and technical rather than financial assistance. All of this reflects conflicting signals from the member countries of the Community. Their verbal support for the reforms in Poland and other countries of Central-East Europe is very strong, but, when it comes to particular decisions entailing specific expenses to their own economies, their attitude becomes quite detached. What is more, as the EU matures, the rise of new barriers relating to a common foreign policy, security policy, and trade policy is conceivable. These barriers may prove to be particularly detrimental to our aspirations for membership in the EU. The Interim Trade Agreement The Interim Trade Agreement--that is, the trade part of the Association Treaty--introduces two basic distinctions. First, it treats differently manufactured goods and farm commodities, and, second, it introduces differing timetables for the abolition of [trade] barriers by Poland and by the Community. The former distinction was dictated by the specific conditions of the commodity market of the EC, while the latter, termed "the asymmetry principle," means that the EC began to abolish import barriers earlier and more rapidly than did the Polish side, this being intended to give us time to adapt ourselves to the conditions of trade on the international market. As regards manufactured goods, the EC abolished the duties on 50 percent of our exports on the effective date of the agreement. The pace of the reduction of duties on other goods varies for discrete groups of merchandise, as specified in detail in the Appendixes to the Treaty, which classify specific articles according to Integrated Nomenclature (NC). As regards farm products, total liberalization of trade is generally not envisaged; all merchandise was divided into six groups, each with a different timetable for the reduction of duties and countervailing fees as well as for increases in the fee-exempt quotas. In every case, however, a major limitation is the so-called protective clauses, which provide for restrictions in the event of, among other things, dumping, problems with balance of payments, abuse of monopoly practices, or broad fluctuations on the markets for particular products (farm, textile, steel). Viewed in a broader context, it turns out that the concessions granted by the Community are rather limited. Here at least three factors should be taken into consideration: --Share in aggregate exports: The longest-lasting and most restricted timetable of liberalization was adopted for goods in which Poland at present relatively excels (so-called sensitive goods) and whose free market access would yield maximum advantages; these goods account for nearly 23 percent of Polish exports to the EC, or, if allowance is made for textiles and steel, about 44 percent. --Existing level of protection: The attendant extended process of abolition of barriers applies chiefly to the goods for which the extent of protection was the highest in the past as well. This means that trade liberalization applies primarily to the domains in which anyhow in the past, too, market access had been relatively easy. --Possibilities for production: The industries manufacturing so-called sensitive goods, which are most affected by the recession, have both the largest inventories and the highest spare productive capacity, and they are capable of rapidly responding to increased export possibilities. Thus, in practice, in the sectors in which the extent of protection is the highest and the possibilities for higher output and profitable exports are the greatest, the EC is eliminating its barriers most slowly. This also applies to trade in farm commodities, for which the treaty generally does not envisage the establishment of a free-trade zone and which not only account for 20 percent of Poland's aggregate exports to the Community but also concern goods whose production cost is relatively low and that are, comparatively speaking, quite profitable. A disturbing element is the increasingly frequent problems raised by the utilization of protective clauses by individual member countries of the Community attempting to protect themselves against higher imports from Poland. This concerns, in particular, the subsectors currently experiencing major structural problems, such as the steel industry and farming. Most often, Polish exporters are being accused of dumping, the more so considering that, often in this country, the domestic prices of some or other products are not treated as real market prices. Our farm exports are being restricted under various pretexts. It appears, however, that the Commission of the Communities is aware of the rising protectionism and, in practice, low extent of the concessions granted in the association agreement. The Copenhagen Summit (21-22 June 1993) became yet another attempt to meet the expectations of the Central-East European countries. Five of the decisions adopted at that summit are especially noteworthy, as viewed from our standpoint: --[Full] membership of the associated countries in the EC was defined as a common objective of both sides. --A fuller incorporation of the associated countries in the institutional structures of the EC was envisaged. --The liberalization of imports by the EC will be accelerated. --Part of PHARE funds will be allocated for direct infrastructural investments. --The possibility of including the associated countries in some Community programs will be afforded. This appears to be laying a solid foundation for the growth of further cooperation; however, the reality may prove different from the Copenhagen declarations. The broadening of economic ties is being impeded by the deep crisis in the world economy. Unexpected problems may also arise owing to the transformations occurring within the EU itself.[.sup]1[/] Effects of Changes in the Foreign Policy of the EU Poland's attempts to establish closer cooperation with (up to and including [full] membership in) the EU coincide with the marked advancement of the integration of West Europe (within the framework of the Union and between the Union and the EFTA [European Free Trade Association]). This markedly complicates achieving our goal because we have to adapt ourselves to an organism that is not only incomparably more highly developed but also rapidly evolving. The related nascent problems may be exemplified by two aspects of the Union's growth: a common foreign and security policy and a common trade policy. Common Foreign and Security Policy Attempts to coordinate foreign policy have been under way since the EEC was first established. The Maastricht Treaty has brought considerable order into it, even if it also, as a result of far-reaching compromises, is couched in rather vague language open to diverse interpretations. Two major provisions of that treaty allow for the possibility of adopting decisions by a qualified majority of votes (Article J.3) and open the road for a common defense policy (Article J.4). Currently, the West European Union is charged with the responsibility for coordinating the defense system, though upon making allowances for the NATO obligations of certain of the Union's member countries. To Central-East Europe, a more integrated Community with a common policy on a broader range of political and economic issues means primarily an organism that is more closed to third countries. A common foreign and security policy engenders two principal groups of barriers: --Fear of domination by the larger and more highly developed countries of the Community; after 40 years of domination by Moscow, the countries of Central-East Europe are particularly sensitive about pursuing an independent foreign policy of their own. --Lack of experience, and especially of discipline, in cooperating with other countries and coordinating foreign and security policy. As exemplified by the member countries of the EC themselves, even after 20 years of attempts to attain this kind of cooperation, that is no easy matter. Neither Poland nor the other postsocialist countries can cope with these barriers. This process also requires involvement by the EC and a gradual preparation of eventual candidates for inclusion in all aspects of a common policy. A common foreign and security policy may prove a particularly valuable domain for gaining experience because here the form and scope and cooperation are defined only on the basis of a consensus of all of the member countries. Foreign Economic Policy A point of departure for a common policy on foreign economic relations is the Treaty of Rome, which mentions, among the principal instruments of the EC, a common system of external tariffs and a common trade policy (Article 3). Along with the Uniform European Act, the EC extended coordination to other domains of economic cooperation. The Maastricht Treaty thus introduced no radical changes in this respect, merely confirming (Article 3) that the EC's activities include, among other things, a common trade policy and an internal market characterized by a free flow of goods, people, services, and capital. The provisions of the Uniform Act, while pertaining exclusively to internal liberalization and formally not referring to foreign relations, are not irrelevant to the EC's partners. At least three aspects of the EC's new policy will be directly related to these provisions: --Allocation of EC quotas: To be sure, the EC does not intend to extend national quotas to the entire territory of the Community; rather, it intends to eliminate these quotas by using various forms of compensation during the transition period. Nevertheless, this may initially result in tighter protectionism: --Protective measures: Previously employed individually by the various countries pursuant to Article 115 of the Treaty of Rome, upon merely notifying the Commission; under the Maastricht Treaty, they will now be subject to total control by the Commission and contingent on its prior approval. --Trade in goods not included in the rules of the Common Market: Under Article 223 of the Treaty of Rome, defense goods were excluded from free trade, and a detailed list of such merchandise was agreed upon in 1950 and, in connection with the creation of the Common Market, has to be not only updated but also downsized. Unlike in the case of the EC's common foreign and security policy, any changes in its common economic policy will affect Poland's situation both when that country joins the Community and when it remains outside it. Of a certainty, the possibility of inclusion in an area covered by a common protection system is more favorable to producers, but, on the other hand, the discrepancies in the economic systems and development levels of the EC and Poland are so marked that opening the domestic market to competition may cause unimaginable damage to the enterprises that still operate according to the principles of a planned economy. The aforementioned extension of national quotas to the entire area of the EC and the restrictions on the employment of protective measures require a long preparatory period even in the case of the weaker members of the Community. Major problems may also arise in connection with such issues as: --The requirements posed by the standards and technical norms of the EC. --The still predominant share of the state-owned sector in manufacturing [in Poland]. --Adaptations of the financial and tax system. --Liberalization of the service sector. These are only representative and most important groups of problems, but even they alone demonstrate the magnitude of the technological, organizational, and--most important--financial efforts that will have to be undertaken in the event that any of the countries of Central-East Europe join the EU. Prospects and Challenges As can be seen, cooperation with the EU is not problem-free. What is more, as this cooperation grows, not only the problems but also its cost will increase. But this does not mean that Poland should abandon the ambition of becoming an associate and later full member of the Union because then the cost to this country would be still higher. But everything should be done in order to completely exploit the opportunities and possibilities being afforded by the new situation in Europe, and also to get prepared, through the joint effort of both sides, for eventual problems and to try and reduce them to a minimum In the case of the member countries of the Communities, this requires chiefly overcoming the stereotyped idea of a conflict between "broadening" (accepting new members) and "deepening" ( developing new domains and forms of mutual cooperation). According to this stereotype, any tightening of ties between the Union and the Central-East European countries can be considered only after the process of building the Union is completed. Yet, opposing these two concepts in itself already is fallacious because they are not mutually exclusive and, even more, they cannot run their course independently of one another. Any change in EC policies, if it is to be lasting, should by now make allowance for the needs and possibilities of potential new members. This is particularly essential in the case of the countries of the former Soviet bloc, which in every respect remain separated from the EC by an abyss they cannot bridge on their own. Besides, paying attention to Central-East Europe does not mean halting the development of the Communities. On the contrary, any attempt to "put on hold" the lagging part of the European Continent would be harmful to both sides. Thus, the "deepening" of the EC could be enriched by taking a number of specific measures enabling the countries of Central-East Europe to smoothly join that process and, by the same token, stabilizing and accelerating the reforms in these countries themselves. Such measures may consist in, e.g.: --Speeding up the implementation of the provisions of association agreements (and, in particular, in this connection, accelerating the liberalization of access of East European goods to the EC market. --Affording to the countries of Central-East Europe the possibility of participating, at least in the capacity of observers, in the shaping of Community regulations (so-called acquis communautaire). --Including associated members of the EC completely in the domains of common policies, where this does not threaten the unity of the Communities (e.g., environmental protection, research programs, regional policy). --Developing a concept of "gradual membership" that would enable the Central-East European countries to be gradually included in the formulation of common policies and, insofar as possible, to participate in their implementation. There is no precedent for any of these concepts in the foreign relations of the EC so far, but the complexity of the situation and the overall process of restructuring the shape of the Communities require a new approach to the process of European integration as a whole. Much more difficult (and definitely more important) is another aspect of this whole process--namely, the proper formulation and consistent implementation of a Polish strategy of development because, regardless of how good the conditions afforded us by the EU may be, it will be up to us to utilize them properly. This requires, above all, strategic thinking in global terms and, thereupon, the adaptation thereto of our current foreign and domestic policies. Specific measures should be primarily taken to exploit the opportunities already afforded by the Interim Trade Agreement and especially by the three-year period of one-sided liberalization of trade specified in that agreement. In this case, the paramount requirement is an economic policy stimulating improvements in the efficiency of our domestic industry and a proexport orientation of production. A survey conducted by E. Kawecka-Wyrzykowska indicates that, to 90 percent of the Polish enterprises that export their products and/or deal in exports, the principal barriers are of a domestic nature (debt, instability of tariff and tax regulations, excessively high cost of investment, etc.).[.sup]2[/] In addition to a rational program encompassing the whole of domestic economic policy, a specific plan dealing directly with the implementation of the treaty and regulating our current contacts is also needed. The principal measures should include: --Determining which institution is to be responsible for an efficient flow of information among interested organizations; this concerns information on the extent of the utilization of the export quotas assigned to us, on the possibilities for the legal protection of the domestic market and Polish producers against excessive competition from the Communities, and on the process of adaptation of the Polish legal system and the prospects for scientific and cultural exchange. --Efficient monitoring of the consequences of the treaty, serving to formulate proper arguments and coordinate contacts with the Communities. These contacts do not have to be top-level alone because possibilities for tightening or renegotiating certain provisions are also afforded to the Association Council established under the agreement, and, similarly, the Joint Commission of the Polish parliament and the European Parliament can also act on its own initiative. --Dissemination of the basic legal acts and documents crucial to cooperation with the EU at various levels, and popularization of knowledge about the Union among the public. But the coordination of all measures remains the fundamental prerequisite. This means, on the one hand, coordination of the process of adapting our economy, legal system, social policy, etc. to the requirements posed by the European Treaty and, on the other, coordination of the measures taken to restructure the economy as a whole, in both its relations with the economies of other countries and in purely domestic terms.
