Signed in Walvis Bay by the South African justice minister, Mr. Kobie Coetsee, and his Namibian counterpart, Mr. Ngarikutuke Tjiriange, the agreement was the first of its kind between South Africa and a neighboring state. It creates the legal scope for enforcement of maintenance orders, civil judgments, and cross border subpoenas, and criminal court orders. The two governments also agreed to investigate reciprocal legislation to better facilitate searches and seizure of illegal goods.
