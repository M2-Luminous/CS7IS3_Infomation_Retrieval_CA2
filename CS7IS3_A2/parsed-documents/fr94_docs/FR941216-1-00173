FR941216-1-00173 FR941216-1-00015 3. The Area Has a Fully Approved SIP Under Section 110(k) of the CAA Based on the approval of provisions under the pre-amended CAA and EPA's prior approval of SIP revisions under the amended CAA, EPA has determined that Kentucky will have a fully approved O 3 SIP under section 110(k) for the moderate nonattainment area when EPA approves SIP submissions regarding the emissions inventory, VOC RACT for stationary sources not covered by a CTG, and emission statements. Final action will be taken prior to or at the same time as final approval of this redesignation. 4. The Air Quality Improvement Must Be Permanent and Enforceable Several control measures have come into place since the Ashland-Huntington nonattainment area violated the O 3 NAAQS. Of these control measures, the reduction of fuel volatility from 10.5 psi in 1988 to 9.0 psi in 1992, as measured by the Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP), and fleet turnover due to the Federal Motor Vehicle Control Program (FMVCP) produced the most significant decreases in VOC emissions. The table below lists the actual enforceable emission reductions which are responsible for the recent air quality improvement in the Kentucky portion of the nonattainment area. The VOC emissions in the base year are not artificially low due to a depressed economy. The technical support document (TSD) contains additional information on these reductions. Reductions in VOC and NO X Emissions From 1990 to 1993 1VOC (tpd) 1NO X (tpd) 3.88 0.28 5. The Area Must Have a Fully Approved Maintenance Plan Pursuant to Section 175A of the CAA Section 175A of the CAA sets forth the elements of a maintenance plan for areas seeking redesignation from nonattainment to attainment. The plan must demonstrate continued attainment of the applicable NAAQS for at least ten years after the Administrator approves a redesignation to attainment. Eight years after the redesignation, the state must submit a revised maintenance plan which demonstrates attainment for the ten years following the initial ten-year period. To provide for the possibility of future NAAQS violations, the maintenance plan must contain contingency measures, with a schedule for implementation, adequate to assure prompt correction of any air quality problems. In this notice, EPA is proposing approval of the Commonwealth of Kentucky's maintenance plan for the Ashland-Huntington nonattainment area because EPA finds that the Commonwealth of Kentucky's submittal meets the requirements of section 175A. A. Emissions Inventory_Base Year Inventory On November 13, 1992, the Commonwealth of Kentucky submitted comprehensive inventories of VOC, NO X , and CO emissions from the Ashland-Huntington nonattainment area. The inventory included biogenic, area, stationary, and mobile sources using 1990 as the base year for calculations to demonstrate maintenance. The 1990 inventory was projected to a 1993 attainment inventory using population growth rates. The 1993 inventory can serve as an attainment inventory because the O 3 NAAQS was not violated during the 1993 year. The CO and the biogenic VOC values are included as a part of the 1990 base year emission inventory. The Commonwealth of Kentucky submittal contains the detailed inventory data and summaries by county and source category. Finally, this inventory was prepared in accordance with EPA guidance. A summary of the base year and projected maintenance year inventories are included in this notice for VOCs and NO X . Refer to the TSD accompanying this notice for more in-depth details regarding the base year inventory for the Ashland-Huntington nonattainment area. This notice proposes approval of the base year inventory for the Ashland-Huntington area.
