Both parties have set up co-ordination committees in most states as a first step to their merger. Merger as such is still not mentioned in so many words but that is what leaders of both parties have in mind as their ultimate aim. The call for unity has been given this time round in an unusual way. So far unity calls were erratic and disjointed. Polemics now and then punctuated them and unity moves went two steps backward soon after going one step forward. In a significant departure from old grooves of hostility, general secretaries of both parties, Harkishan Singh Surjeet CPI(M) and Indrajit Gupta (CPI) have now shared one letter pad to send out a circular on unity. This is intended to inspire a sense of urgency among their comrades. Their circular of December 11 asks party leaders in all states to form co-ordination committees to discuss "various issues confronting the body politic" and for "strengthening the left." West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura have been left out on the ground that "left democratic consolidation has come into existence and is working alright." The circular points out central level co-ordination has been taking place for many years. States which have "difficulties" have been asked to seek central parties' help. West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura are states where communist parties are strong. The process of merger can instantly throw up questions of share in leadership. Party sources admit that several people who hold big or small positions in their respective parties will have to be ready for sacrifice when merger takes place. That can at once unsettle matters rather than solve them. Other minuscule left parties, RSP [Revolutionary Socialist Party] and Forward Bloc, also may be affected. Communist leaders feel that those partners of the left democratic front can be irked if a CPI-CPI(M) club is constituted within that front. If bilateral relations between the two communist parties are emphasised even while harping on the left democratic theme, left unity may suffer, communist leaders say. Which is why they have decided to make haste slowly in those states. Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra set up co-ordination committees soon after the decision on unity taken at the last three-yearly conclaves of both parties was communicated to state units there. But that is not where unity has to be forged. CPI leader A.B. Bardhan says that unity as a prelude to merger can be possible and meaningful only when it is achieved in areas where either party has a significant base. But his own partymen are dragging their feet in Bihar, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh where they are a shade stronger than their "big brother." If CPI is not keen to have unity where it feels it is better off, why should CPI(M) be magnanimous in its strongholds? The present unity move has come soon after the assembly elections in December. The poll outcome was not exactly pleasant to communist leaders, notwithstanding the debacle of their bete noire, BJP. Their ally, National Front, had come a cropper. Not only have they to find a new, viable ally but reunite themselves in a stroke of left consolidation. The old hostilities and imagined ideological differences, they feel, can be left happily behind. The irony is that the unity move has come when dissensions are rife, particularly in CPI(M) in areas where it is strong. And, leaders of both parties have found a new cause for quarrel. CPI(M) has not a whit liked CPI's soft corner for expelled K.R. Gowri. Its anger is all over a single CPI remark: "Gowri's expulsion was unfortunate."
