Important decisions were made including the need to preserve the purchasing power of the Gabonese people following price hikes after the devaluation of the CFA franc. The head of state, President El Hadj Omar Bongo, called on cabinet to take tough measures to implement the freeze on essential commodity prices, and called on the Ministry of Commerce to remain vigilant on the issue since prices change from one area of the city to the other. The other important measure taken was the lifting of the ban on opposition leaders leaving Gabonese territory.
