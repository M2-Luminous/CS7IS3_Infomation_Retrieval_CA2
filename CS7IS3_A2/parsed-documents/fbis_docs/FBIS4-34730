Opposition congressmen yesterday reported that Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar will be summoned to Congress to explain, in a secret session, the content and scope of the president's proposal. Sanchez de Lozada's proposal in Colombia has prompted different reactions within the Bolivian opposition; while some congressmen said he is giving up a century old national desire for a "sovereign outlet to the sea," others called the proposal an "interesting initiative." The most adamant opponents of that proposal are Nationalist Democratic Action leader Jorge Landivar and Democratic Socialism Alternative Deputy Jerjes Justiniano. Landivar said Sanchez de Lozada has been hasty in his attempt to solve the maritime issue, adding that the president's proposal is some sort of a "tenancy agreement" because although Bolivia will have an outlet to the sea, it will be through a foreign territory. Justiniano said that we cannot give up a sovereign corridor to the sea because this is the right of all Bolivians and because it implies "treason to the fatherland."
