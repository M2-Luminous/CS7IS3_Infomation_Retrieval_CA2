According to the latest reports from Moscow, everything is all right now. Ambassador to Russia Roman Paldan, with whom our permanent correspondent to Moscow talked this morning, has more details. [Begin recording] [Correspondent Smihula] I know that you held intensive talks this morning with the senior staff at relevant ministries and offices. A while ago you spoke on the telephone to (Valeriy Chernayev), president of the Russian company Neftetrans. Ambassador, what is the latest development? [Paldan] The end result is that oil supplies to Slovakia will be resumed at 1200 hrs today. [Smihula] Do you mean our time or Moscow time? [Paldan] Moscow time. [Smihula] This means then that Russian oil should have begun traveling toward our country when the lunchtime edition of Radiozurnal is on the air. [Paldan] It is expected that the throughput of 27,000 tonnes in 24 hours will be achieved shortly. This is close to the normal throughput, I would say. Available at the present time are 150,000 tonnes of oil, for which documentation has been issued. Work on further quantities is going on in order to ensure a continuous flow and subsequently also continuous production in Slovnaft [Bratislava-based refinery working on Russian oil].
