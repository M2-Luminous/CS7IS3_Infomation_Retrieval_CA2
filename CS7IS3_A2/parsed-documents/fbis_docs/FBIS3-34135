AL-HAYAH has learned that the delegation, which represents the High Coordination Council for the Islamic Revolution, includes 'Abdol Hadi Arghandwal as representative of the Hezb-e Eslami (led by Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar); Hashamatollah Mojaddedi on behalf of the Islamic National Liberation Front (led by Sebghatollah Mojaddedi); Dr. Talib on behalf of the (pro-Tehran) Shiite Hezb-e Wahdat; and 'Abdol Samad on behalf of the Uzbek militias. The delegation will leave for Tehran today and will proceed for Riyadh from there, carrying with it the opposition's leaders' visions and viewpoint on settling the crisis. The delegation has met with Pakistani Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ali and ambassadors of the [UN] Security Council member states, in addition to heads of the Islamic states' diplomatic missions in the Pakistani capital. The meeting was held at a time when opposition sources have said that the Pakistani foreign minister has agreed in principle to the opposition plan that calls for the resignation of the president and his prime minister simultaneously, for withdrawal of the armed elements from the capital, and for forming a provisional council to manage the country's affairs until elections are held. Meanwhile, the two parties to the conflict have continued their military preparations at a time when fierce fighting has been raging on between them in Kabul. AL-HAYAH has learned that Hekmatyar has told Afghan notables who met with him recently that he is about to complete building a military airfield in Surkhab, south of Kabul. This is the second airfield constructed by Hekmatyar in the areas under his control. The first airfield, built two weeks ago in Dasht-e Saqawa, near Char Asiab (where Hekmatyar lives), was subjected to missile attacks launched by the government forces. But the new airfield is located beyond the government missiles' range and it can accommodate fighter aircraft, contrary to the old airfield, which can only accommodate passenger and freight aircraft. Informed sources have told AL-HAYAH that Surkhab Airfield has been fitted with a very sophisticated radar capable of monitoring the airspace extending to the Pakistani border. It is well known that the Surkhab Airfield plan has been ready since the days of former President Mohammad Daud (1973-78) and that this airport was supposed to be an alternative to the current Kabul Airport. Moreover, battles continued between government and opposition forces yesterday and military aircraft controlled by General 'Abdol Rashid Dostam, the Uzbek militias' commander, raided artillery positions in central and northern Kabul for the second consecutive day. The aircraft targeted the hill on which the television tower is built and where artillery pieces belonging to (pro-Rabbani) former Defense Minister Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, whose faction controls the central part of the Afghan capital militarily, are deployed.
