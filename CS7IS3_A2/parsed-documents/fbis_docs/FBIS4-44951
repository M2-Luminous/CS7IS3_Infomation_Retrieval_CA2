How well did the governorates implement their shantytown control plans? What difficulties did they encounter? Shantytowns are largely found in 11 Egyptian governorates but are at a maximum concentration in Cairo, Giza, al-Qalyubiyah, and Alexandria. There are 434 shantytowns throughout the governorates. They need 3.485 billion pounds even though 290 million pounds was expended on the first stage of improvements and enhancements. The second stage has been allocated an additional 183.9 million pounds in the current fiscal year Cairo accounted for the lion's share of total expended allocations. Expenditures on the first stage alone amounted to 10 million pounds in addition to 50 million pounds in the current fiscal year. 84 Percent The Ministry of Local Administration conducted a performance evaluation of the first stage of the shantytown action plan in order to improve the efficacy of subsequent stages of development and to overcome obstacles encountered in removing the shantytowns. The focus of the Cairo governorate in the first stage was on zones fraught with tension, specifically al-Zawiyah al-Hamra' and 'Ayn Shams. The first stage of allocations of 10 million pounds were spent on sewers and street paving. In 'Ayn Shams, 13 streets were paved and the water system was improved. Needed cleaning and beautification equipment was also purchased. Al-Zawiyah al-Hamra' had its main streets and lanes paved, its sewer system completed, and its water system overhauled. In addition, cleaning equipment was purchased and al-Zawiyah al-Hamra' hospital was refurbished. The first stage of shantytown development in Cairo accomplished 84 percent of its goals and expended 8.4 million pounds of its total allocation. Self-Help Al-Qalyubiyah, according to a Ministry of Local Administration report, achieved 100 percent of planned objectives and expended all its development allocations on street paving, sanitary sewers, and potable water systems in its various towns. Al-Qalyubiyah began shantytown development on its own, according to its governor Dr. 'Adil Ilhami, by allocating 10 million pounds of its local resources to deal with the problem, resolve the predicament of shantytown residents by providing them with alternative housing, and develop existing shantytowns in 'Izbat-al-Zira'ah, Manshiyat-al-Nur, Tarrad al-Nil, and Shubrah-al-Khaymah. After the shantytowns were surveyed and a plan devised for their development, they were allocated a two-tier allotment of 27.5 million pounds supplemented by an additional allocation of 4.5 million pounds under the governorate's emergency plan to initiate shantytown control--a plan approved by the Ministry of Local Administration. The governor pointed out that the emergency plan was fully implemented in all the shantytowns of its various towns, but that still to be completed is the governorate's comprehensive plan, once the shantytowns are surveyed and their needs for projects and services ascertained. This comprehensive plan is to cost about 279 million pounds for school and hospital construction, street paving, sewer systems, electric grid projects, and other basic services in the deprived areas. The governor explained that it will take 18 additional shantytown schools to solve the three-shift problem in certain areas. More police stations and youth centers also need to be built, he added. Ten million pounds were allocated for the first stage of shantytown development in Alexandria governorate, of which 86 percent, or 8.645 million pounds, has been actually spent on development. Shantytown development in Alexandria targeted street paving and sewer projects. Five million pounds ware spent on paving and the remaining 3.645 million pounds went to sanitary sewer projects. Before the Assembly The Housing Committee of the People's Assembly, in order to field monitor shantytown development, visited some of the governorates afflicted with shantytowns in order to evaluate the progress of the work in the field, ascertain the objectives accomplished, and prepare for the Assembly a special report on the government's shantytown development plan, according to Housing Committee chairman al-Sayyid Sarhan. The Committee noted that shantytowns continue to spring up and grow, laying to waste all efforts expended on that problem. This is attributed to development-stunting "bureaucracies" in the governorates, lofty fees and costs for approved land divisions, and the failure of certain towns over 60 or more years to modify their perimeters in accordance with their natural expansion. The Committee chairman emphasized that new housing divisions should take the form of urban communities in the sense that they should be complete with the basic services that their residents need, such as schools, hospitals, and police and fire stations. Only when such facilities are planned should a division be approved and issued its permit by the authorities. It is also necessary, he added, to protect state-owned land from squatters in order to ward off the formation of new shantytowns. State-owned land should be used for building planned urban housing communities that would be self-sufficient in public services and utilities. Support by the State He said: "It is mandatory for the state to prevent the formation of any more shantytowns. It is obvious that those communities sprang-up under the noses of various state agencies which lacked the wherewithal to do something about them. It is important to ward off future shantytown formation by supporting local governments and other agencies that could play a role in challenging them." I asked him: "How about the shantytowns that must be removed?" He answered: "The Committee visited a few of those. They will never respond to development and improvement efforts and need to be totally removed. However, we must first provide their residents with alternate housing. We may be able to accommodate them in vacant housing units in new communities and build them integrated communities there. "Land reclaimed from shantytowns could be incorporated in local city planning and utilized in accordance with city needs in a manner that would prevent them from supporting shantytowns again." The Housing Committee concluded in its report that local governments and the Ministry of Public Works and Water Resources should coordinate with each other in order to prevent the formation of new shantytowns in susceptible locations such as canal and river banks, under bridge superstructures, and along major roads. The Committee also underscored the value of reducing costs and easing permit requirements for new land developments as part of orderly urban development in the cities. An End to Shantytowns Dr. Mahmud Sharif, Minister of Local Administration, believes that rural areas must be developed and helped to grow in order to ward off the formation of new shantytowns by containing outward migration. He also believes that planning should out-pace shantytowns by developing new plots suitable for residential use and selling them to individuals and cooperatives, and by coming down hard on building code, zoning, and city planning violations. There must be coordination in that regard between local governments and various agencies of the Ministry in order to quickly spot the violations and remove them. He pointed out that the Ministry has set priorities in approaching the problem since it would be difficult to deal all at once with all shantytowns throughout the governorates. Topping the list of priorities are Greater Cairo and Alexandria as well as nine other governorates in Upper Egypt. Shantytowns in the 11 governorates have been surveyed and the cost of their development estimated at 3.48 billion pounds. The governorates have proffered projects that are already planned and therefore could be tendered in two months. Outlays of 106 million pounds have been allocated for this stage and the governorates have selected projects that could be completed during the current fiscal year. This puts shantytown development allocations at 290 million pounds so far. Requests from the governorates for the cleaning equipment they need are being received and reconciled as to costs and specifications. This equipment, estimated to cost 162 million pounds, will be supplied in two stages. Equipment supplied in the first stage will cost 51.9 million pounds. Grassroots Solutions Minister Mahmud Sharif emphasized that only with grassroots participation can the shantytown problem be resolved once and for all. He cites the good example of al-Nahdah City which absorbed a large number of quake and shantytown victims and where The Red Crescent Society implemented a specific plan to involve inhabitants in the management of their city. Each apartment building elects one of its tenants to represent it, and five such representatives are elected to represent all residents on the city's administrative council. This indicates that it is possible to modify citizen behavior and to implant the values of respect for public property and interest in the environment as well as develop neighborliness and the spirit of belonging. Several agencies helped with that plan in cooperation with UNICEF. Preliminary results are very encouraging. The Ministry is reinforcing that experiment by introducing a new plan to help alleviate unemployment in that society by training youths in the various trades and giving them preference in obtaining small business financing from the Social Fund and others.
