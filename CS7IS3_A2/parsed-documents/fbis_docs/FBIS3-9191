I had to start with very simple matters, such as becoming familiar with NATO. We opened the door slowly and tried to show the changes that happened in our country and its armed forces," says Major General Jiri Pisklak, the Czech Republic's representative at NATO. [Fiala] What are the changes you have just mentioned? [Pisklak] The principal changes have been carried out in three large stages: In the first, Soviet troops were withdrawn; in the second, the Republic was partitioned and, therefore, the Army was also divided; and then there is the transformation that we are undergoing now. This stage should end by 1996, which means that, by then, our Army should be rebuilt into an army of a new type similar to the NATO armies. It is my task to work in that direction. I am alone here but, actually, I am mediating contacts between the Czech Republic's Army, the NATO command here in Brussels, and other command posts. This is multinational cooperation among NATO's multinational staffs. [Fiala] Have you noticed any progress in that cooperation? [Pisklak] We have made a great deal of progress, about which we do not know much in our country. Actually, we are participating in the work of all committees in the North Atlantic Council for Cooperation, which is a political and consultative body in which the overall situation in NATO is discussed. The ambassador of the Czech Republic comes here and presents our political attitudes, the policy of the Foreign Ministry, and so on. I have the opportunity to participate in these meetings. Today, we are also participating in the creation of the principal documents in the Political Committee. We are also cooperating with the Economic Committee. [Pisklak] Under what circumstance was the North Atlantic Council established? [Fiala] It has been newly created, and this is why a special formula is used in that connection: 16 NATO countries and 22 countries of this council [sentence as published]. It is a body that was established after the political changes in our country were made. This body makes it possible for all of the countries, including the republics of the former Soviet Union, to join the advanced countries of Europe. The members are, for example, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Georgia, etc. There are also Finnish observers. The purpose of the Council is to make it possible for all countries to consult the political situation. For example, the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction is a new topic. Foreign ministers also have meetings. It is an important thing that the Council has approved a working plan that fixes the spheres of cooperation, including the political, economic, scientific, and ecological spheres. In this connection, I would like to avoid speaking about details because there are some 300 or 400 various committees and work groups within NATO. [Pisklak] Can you describe the work of some of the committees and evaluate their results? [Fiala] I highly appreciate the results of the Committee for the Coordination of the European Airspace. I have to say that Europe is saturated with air traffic. We must have a unified system of controlling the air traffic, so our countries could join and become compatible in that sphere. The Czech Republic has made great progress. In Prague, a new center for air-traffic control is being built, which is practically comparable with the West European standards. We have joined such organizations as ARFA [Allied Radio Frequency Agency], which deals with the allocation of frequencies, because it is known that frequency bands are overcrowded and every country is keeping an eye on the frequencies it can get. In the Economic Committee, matters related to the conversion of the arms industry were widely discussed. Cooperation in the Ecological Committee is developing promisingly. This committee is called the Committee for the Vision of Modern Society. For us, the most interesting thing was the solution to ecological problems, where Charles University is involved to a certain extent. The Foreign Ministry is participating in all of the said activities as the main organizer, and the Defense Ministry and its experts are engaged in many matters because these matters belong to the sphere of the Defense Ministry's activity. Someone could say that ecology does not belong to the sphere of rapprochement with NATO. This is not the case, however. For instance, the cleanup operation after the Soviet troops had an impact on both the Army and civilians. [passage omitted] [Fiala] Do you have an idea how much the compatibility of our Army with NATO forces will cost our taxpayers? [Pisklak] For the time being, almost nothing. We will have to carry out the transformation of our Army, in any case. Transformation is paid for from the state budget. We are spending the extra money on the compatibility of our system. For the time being, we are not paying anything extra. In the future, when legal technicalities regarding residence permits are sorted out, some of our people should come here--not as many as from the big countries, however. One or two people should remain in Mons, and three to five should be designated for direct cooperation here in Brussels. Of course, the cost for having officials abroad, costs that are linked to the work of those people, are paid from the budget. However, no enormous sums will be involved. Through the Partnership for Peace plan, we will participate in certain social actions, which will allow us to participate in international operations. First, certain exercises will be focused on keeping peace, on preparing UN joint operations, rescue and humanitarian actions, and others. It is normal practice that each NATO country pay for those actions. From the existing military budget, we will be unable to pay for a large action, and it is expected that we are not going to undertake any large actions this year. Later on, we are expected to pay for anything that will take place on our territory within the Partnership for Peace framework, and we will have to pay the bill if we send smaller units abroad for exercises. This requires legislative steps, however, because these things have to do something with the Constitution, and parliament will have to decide them. [Fiala] Could you be more specific about the legislative changes? [Pisklak] Every country that will want to become a member will have to review its laws and legislative system to find out how much their law and legislative system are compatible with membership in the Alliance. Their legislative system may contain certain laws and stipulations that may prevent these countries from fulfilling obligations ensuing from the treaties. This mainly applies to the deployment of foreign troops on their territory. (I know that we hate listening to those things after our 1968 experience). For example, the Belgian Government gives special status to people who work on NATO staffs in Belgium. This status should apply to our people also. The deployment of the troops in Germany is regulated by special laws, for example. There is a special law that defines the rights and obligations of foreign soldiers participating in exercises on the territory of a member country. We will have to establish a group of experts who will select, as a reference, a NATO country similar to ours and who will deal with these matters. We can ask for such help without any problems because everyone will be willing to provide it. This is why the question of whether to join NATO immediately is not easy. Every country must prepare itself in a certain way. It it difficult to fix a deadline, for which our people yearn so much. [Fiala] When are we going to become a full Alliance member, in your estimate? [Pisklak] In my estimate, this deadline should not extend beyond the end of this century because our Republic is certainly comparable with some NATO member countries regarding the stability of the political system, economic results, the overall transformation of our thinking, and our capability to build a democratic system. Actually, NATO believes that the democratic system and the market economy are shared values. We are building this democratic system and market economy, and we need to complete them. Our public does not have too detailed information on NATO. In general, NATO is believed to be a sort of military organization, similar to the Warsaw Pact. NATO, however, is not only a military organization.... [Fiala] What factors will most influence the Czech Republic's joining NATO? [Pisklak] A composite of all factors at the same time. NATO is not only a defense organization but also a political and economic organization and an organization that controls cooperation in science. The security aspect prevails, of course. We should speak about creating a reliable European security system in Europe in the future. NATO is undergoing a transformation and is modifying its military structure in an important way so as to adjust it as much as possible to the new conditions. If the conflict in Yugoslavia is ended (which would help improve stability and strengthen peace in Europe), I believe that we really will have the possibility to create, in a well-conceived and reasonable way, a European security system. I am of the opinion that NATO has the prerequisites to become the cornerstone of a system on which everyone could rely. It can share experience and knowledge with others. It would be an ideal solution if we had NATO with two, three, or more pillars--a Central European pillar, for instance, could be one of them. We should not divide our efforts to establish European security. This is my personal opinion. [Fiala] What is your view of our Army, from the Brussels perspective? [Pisklak] Out Army has undergone significant changes. New people assumed positions in all of the important places. Unlike the previous people, they are knowledgeable about the world, and they have proper educations. Unfortunately, many of them complete their educations and leave, which is a very sad fact. I believe that, in the new spirit, the Army's task is to defend the Czech Republic. I also believe that people who are in the Army feel that they are responsible for the defense of the country. I believe it is an unfortunate fact that our society looks at our Army through the perspective of the past, despite the fact that our Army is undergoing an important and painful process of transformation. If I am to be sincere, I have to say that we were not alone in having been immersed in ourselves for those 40 years. In NATO, they have similar problems. They, too, have a narrow and maybe even a distorted view of certain things. In the process of becoming acquainted with them, we have arrived at a surprising conclusion: We are closer to each other than we originally thought. We have found out that our opinions are quite close, that we have identical views on problems of security, education, training, the role of the Army, etc. [Fiala] Our Army was a Warsaw Pact member until recently.... [Pisklak] NATO membership leaves complete sovereignty to its members. This is quite a different thing from the directive manner of control that existed within the Warsaw Pact. It is desirable that our society should understand that we have to begin building the Army. Time is flying, and, if we want to build on the traditions of the first republic, we should support the creators of the new Army. We should stop noticing only negative aspects and begin noticing that our soldiers are able to do something positive. I could give you examples of the professionalism of our Army. If someone was able to move 130,000 Soviet troops in such a short time, and if someone was able to divide the Army that had coexisted since 1945 into two parts, he must have been a professional; amateurs could not have done it. If our soldiers manage to be equal partners to the Western soldiers, if they are able to fully integrate themselves into the United Nations [troops], our Army is commensurate with a number of other armies. We only need to create conditions for the people to feel good and to want to serve in the Army. We should make the Army attractive to young people.
