"Russia should be pulled closer in Naples", Yeltsin told German Finance Minister Theo Waigel at the end of their Thursday meeting referring to the G-7 summit scheduled for July. "We shall try as much as it is possible", Waigel promised in return. According to Russian Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, Yeltsin wants the G-7 to analyse the forms of insuring investments in Russia from noncommercial risks. He told TASS that the Russian leader had raised the issue at the G-7 summit in Tokyo, but "unfortunately the European Union is only now getting down to the work". Shokhin added that the problems of Russian foreign debt in the framework of the London and Paris Clubs of creditors were discussed during Yeltsin's meeting with Waigel. Waigel, in his turn, told TASS that the debt problem will be discussed in detail at his talks with Shokhin. According to him, Yeltsin expressed his gratitude for efficient work in attracting international financial institutions to reforming Russian economy. He also said that the Russian pullout from Germany will not "alienate the peoples" of the two countries. "On the contrary, this step already now causes sympathy to Russia among citizens and political parties of our country", the finance minister stressed. After the meeting with Waigel Yeltsin left for Helmut Kohl's home region of Rhineland-Palatinate where he is to hold several private meetings with the chancellor.
