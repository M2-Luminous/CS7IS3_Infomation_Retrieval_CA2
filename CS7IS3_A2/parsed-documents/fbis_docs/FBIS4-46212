It is still not clear if the attack was criminal in nature or political. Again, FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] leader Nidia Diaz's [nom de guerre for Maria Concepcion Valladares de Sosa] bodyguard received the brunt of the attack and this time he was injured in an arm. The bodyguard suffered a similar attack three months ago. According to the now FMLN Deputy Nidia Diaz, the attack was aimed at her on both occasions. She, thus, stated that former guerrilla commanders do not have any security to participate in politics. Diaz's bodyguard suffered the second attack in less than three months today. According to the reports, Elmer Cruz Pineda, a PNC [National Civilian Police] member assigned to Nidia Diaz' security, drove the vehicle that was hit by 20 rounds of 9-mm pistol and M-16 rifle fire. Furthermore, the attackers threw a grenade that seriously injured the bodyguard's right arm. [Begin recording] Cruz: There was an attack on Mrs. Nidia Diaz at about 0600 this morning. It is estimated that it was carried out by Army soldiers who do not agree with the peace accords. I believe there is no two ways about this. It can't be anybody else but them. Reporter: What did you do when you were attacked? Cruz: I fought off the attack and defended myself. I was alone at the time and I tried to defend myself. [end recording] The attack was made on the same vehicle that was attacked last time; it took place in front of the political leader's house, located on Los Lirios Avenue in the University neighborhood, at approximately 0630. The attackers were fought off by just one man. They crashed their vehicle after the attack, leaving it approximately two blocks from Deputy Diaz' house. [Begin Diaz recording] We no longer use bullets in politics. We are civilians and work within the institutional framework of the government. This event is very serious because we supposedly have guarantees and believe we can have confidence. I would like to go about without any bodyguards and move about just as any other person. All of a sudden this happens and you realize that you have to have a bodyguard. I feel it is much more dangerous because we have placed our trust is the system and have presented ourselves, with all our characteristics, our people, our relatives, under the protection of the government's institutions. [end recording] Nidia Diaz, who now has a large group of bodyguards 24 hours a day, reported the charges to the joint group. [Begin unidentified bodyguard recording] We have to be on our guard at all times when we are with her. We have to make sure we are not being followed. [end recording] Definitely, the violence in our country does not stop and the people responsible for countering it have not found the means to do so.
