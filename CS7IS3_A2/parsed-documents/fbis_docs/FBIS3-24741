FBIS3-24741 "drafr020_c_94028" FBIS-AFR-94-020 Document Type:Daily Report 31 Jan 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 31 Jan MB3101130794 MB3101130794 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR Harassment To Hamper Free, Fair Election--"The harassment and intimidation of National Party [NP] and Democratic Party supporters in townships across the country poses perhaps the biggest threat to a free and fair election," writes Kaizer Nyatsumba in his "One in Your Eye" column on page 12 of Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 31 January. "The ANC [African National Congress]--now seen by many as a government-in-waiting--has a deep interest in a free and fair election." When the ANC obtains its "landslide victory many psephologists believe it is heading for, its opponents must not be able to challenge the outcome of the election on the grounds that they could not reach certain parts of the country during their campaigning because of intimidation." SOWETAN Election `Show Business' Begins--National Party leader and state president, F.W. de Klerk, "has taken the bull by the horns and is ringing bells as he goes into black areas to tell them that the National Party has changed," notes a page-10 editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 31 January. Mandela also took "a colourful train ride from Johannesburg station to Nasrec to launch the ANC's election manifesto." SOWETAN warns the public to be careful of this "show business" and more so when supporters' employers "bus them to rallies and buy them lunch and party hats." Voters should "demand" that all political parties "put their cards on the table on real concerns -- housing, jobs and schools, and most importantly, how to achieve peace." "The ANC has led the way with its manifesto. This and other manifestos must be studied carefully before important, historical decisions are made." RAPPORT `Alarm Bells' Over ANC Martials at Polling Booths -- "The type of intimidation President F.W. de Klerk had to contend with on his election campaign of the Transvaal this weekend, especially from ANC ranks, raises the urgent question of whether a free and fair election is really possible in South Africa at this stage," begins a page-22 editorial in Afrikaans in Johannesburg RAPPORT on 30 January. "Earlier this week the ANC announced that it wants to deploy approximately 40,000 so-called peace martials, in ANC uniforms, at polling booths. This alone should set alarm bells ringing for all those who fear intimidation and confrontation on voting day." "Murder and mayhem has reached such alarming proportions that several black townships, housing millions of voters, is completely out of bounds to certain political parties." "If the state president with all his security finds it difficult to reach the voters, what will the fate be of candidates and organizers who have to embark on door to door campaigning as the election draws nearer." "After so many years Mr. Nelson Mandela has not yet succeeded in stopping his supporters from committing acts of violence." "How many non-ANC supporters will dare to make their way through rows of ANC `peacekeepers' to vote at the polls. It is obvious that the election cannot be postponed, but opponents of the ANC should guard against being forced to `get the election behind them, no matter how it proceeds.'" BEELD ANC Supporters at Polling Booths Not Acceptable--Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 27 January cautions in a page-10 editorial: "The ANC's plan to deploy about 40,000 of its so-called peace keepers in ANC uniforms near polling booths on election day `to see to it that the routes are open' is a recipe for intimidation and confrontation. If the ANC expects people to swallow its lame excuse about the deployment of these people, they are mistaken. Ask any victim of intimidation what a simple sideways glance can mean once the order has gone out from the `comrades' about what blacks can or cannot do." "This plan is nothing but a transparent and calculated strategy to try to intimidate people against exercising their democratic right on polling day. It makes no sense to deploy masses of people in party colors for a task which under normal circumstances must be done by the police and traffic police." "Rather, the ANC should do what the National Party is doing, and that is to promise firm action against any supporters guilty of intimidation or other methods which can interfere with a free and fair elction. Let polling day be a day of free choice for all voters, otherwise the credibility of the election result will be called into question. Should that hapen, we will face the prospect of the bloody Angolan path." Editorial Laments Choice of Peacekeeping Force Head -- Another editorial on page 10 of BEELD says: "Every action of the National Peacekeeping Force in maintaining peace to ensure a free election will be watched with eagle eyes. One of the prerequisites for success is that the force remain impartial. The composition of the force is aimed at this. So it is a pity that someone whose name appears on the ANC's list of candidates in the forthcoming election has been appointed to command the force. We accept that Brigadier Gabriel Ramushwana's military background makes him a suitabmake it difficult to maintain the impartial image of the peace force. Since last year Brig. Ramushwana has been in the news for refusing to pay back 580,000 rands allegedly paid to him incorrectly from the Venda pension fund. Brig. Ramushwana's appointle appointment. However, his high political profile, including his position as chief minister of Venda, will ment was probably the result of a compromise, but he does not appear to be the correct choice for such a sensitive position. The peace force needs to be cedible both in conception and birth."
