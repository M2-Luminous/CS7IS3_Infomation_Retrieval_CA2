FBIS4-19867 "drweu079_j_94007" FBIS-WEU-94-079 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 ITALY & VATICAN CITY Leadership Conflict Within the PDS Leadership Conflict Within the PDS BR2204140494 Rome LA REPUBBLICA in Italian 22 Apr 94 p 11 BR2204140494 Rome LA REPUBBLICA Italian BFN [Unattributed report: "Progressive Forces Seek New Man for `Return Match'"] [Text] Rome -- The official watchword at PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] headquarters is definite: Occhetto's leadership is not in question within the PDS. The top leaders say so by implication, and the party leader himself said so forcefully at a Directorate meeting. But after the election defeat the debate on the pros and cons of a change of leadership for the major party of the progressive alignment is enlivening the debate between the various tendencies within the Left. It is even challenging the assumption that the leader of the "return match" against the Right, victorious in the 28 March elections, must necessarily be of communist extraction. Even within the PDS there are growing signs of a situation in flux. It is unanimously agreed that the process is bound to accelerate after the European elections in June, which demand a cautious attitude on everyone's part. It is only then that we will see the start of the debate leading up to the congress in the fall, clarifying the intentions of the various protagonists, who are now busy mainly with examining what is to be done, without revealing their respective hands. Against the background of the now almost proverbial rivalry between Occhetto and [PDS Deputy Secretary] D'Alema, a conflict over policy line is emerging, based essentially on the choice between, on the one hand, "renewal" and the "stability" of the leadership and, on the other, the problem of the PDS' new role. It is the basic substance of the debate between those aiming at a dissolution with a view to the establishment of the "democratic party" and those, on the other hand, who insist on a "strong relationship" with the center by an organizationally autonomous Left -- two stances that seem to be represented by [L'UNITA editor] Walter Veltroni and Massimo D'Alema, respectively. Significantly, a rapid opinion poll conducted by LA REPUBBLICA yesterday among some 40 progressive deputies and senators indicates the editor of L'UNITA and the former PDS lower house speaker as the two favorite candidates for the leadership of the alignment, out of a choice that also includes figures from outside the PDS, such as former Deputy Stefano Rodota, Mayor of Rome Franco Rutelli, Socialist Valdo Spini, and Mayor of Venice Massimo Cacciari. One- third of those interviewed expressed no preference, but three-fourths of the sample seemed convinced that a change of guard is essential. If the same opinion were to become current within the PDS itself, the fall congress could indeed prove to be Occhetto's last as secretary.
