According to the latest survey done by the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, the proportions taken up by the public economy in the national industrial output value and the national retail volume of consumer goods have both declined, while those of the non-public economy have increased steadily. The survey shows that in the national industrial output value the proportion for state-owned industrial enterprises was 48.3 percent in 1992, down from 77.6 percent in 1978, when China launched its reform and opening-up drive. Meanwhile, the output value of collective industrial enterprises climbed from 22.4 percent to 38.2 percent during the same period. And the other 13.5 percent was accounted for by foreign-funded, private and individual undertakings, which made their debuts only after 1978. In the national retail volume of consumer goods, the state-owned sector's share decreased from 54.6 percent in 1978 to 41.3 percent in 1992. The share of the collective sector also dropped during the 1978-1992 period, from 43.3 percent to 27.9 percent. But the share of other economic elements jumped from 2.1 percent to 30.8 percent during the same period. The survey shows that in 1992 the output value of state-owned industries increased by 14.4 percent over the previous year, while that of collective and township enterprises and other industries, including foreign-funded enterprises, rose by 28.5 percent, 40 percent and 48.8 percent, respectively. In south China's Guangdong Province, the survey shows, non-public enterprises, employing more than 6.34 million people, make up 52.4 percent of the total registered capital. The proportions for state-owned enterprises and collective enterprises are 31.2 percent and 16.4 percent, respectively, the survey adds.
