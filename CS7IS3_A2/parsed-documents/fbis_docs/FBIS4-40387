This point of view was expressed today by DPRK Ambassador to Moscow Son Song-pil. Replying to an ITAR-TASS correspondent's question, he said: "At one time we displayed an interest in the Russian proposal to hold an international conference. Our side based its position on the fact that such a forum would promote a solution to the accumulated problems around the negotiating table on the basis of equal rights and mutual respect. There was no question of any sanctions at that time. Now we clearly state: Sanctions and dialogue are incompatible." Regarding the DPRK's departure from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the ambassador announced that on 13 June his government officially informed the U.S. Administration of this, the latter being the depository state of the IAEA Charter. He stressed that recently all the cooperation with the IAEA boiled down to carrying out inspections of North Korean facilities which were of a "far from objective nature". The IAEA has practically neither the time nor the inclination for constructive cooperation in the development of the DPRK's peaceful nuclear program as envisioned by the charter of that organization, the diplomat said, . "The longer we stayed in the IAEA the more vigorously our peaceful nuclear activity was being restricted," Son Song-pil stated. He considers that the resolution recently adopted at the Council of Administrators of the IAEA on the "North Korean nuclear problem" effectively signifies the introduction of sanctions. This, in his opinion, is what forced the DPRK Government to make the decision to leave the international agency. As for the Treaty of Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the ambassador said the DPRK reserved the right to so-called "special status". This is because his country announced its departure from the treaty but then declared its "temporary suspension."
