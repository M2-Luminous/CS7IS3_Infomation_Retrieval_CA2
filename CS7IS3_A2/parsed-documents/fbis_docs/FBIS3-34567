In an exclusive statement to AL-JUMHURIYAH upon his arrival at the al-Rashid Hotel, where he is staying in Baghdad, Ekeus added that the UN Security Council is fully prepared to find solutions to the issues related to the lifting of the sanctions imposed on Iraq. Nonetheless, Ekeus noted, I do acknowledge that our discussions will address complicated political and technical issues. When asked by AL-JUMHURIYAH why the statements he makes in Baghdad on the prospects for lifting the sanctions are optimistic, whereas the statements he makes on the issue when he is outside Iraq are different, Ekeus said that he hopes that rapid steps will be taken this time to lift the embargo imposed on Iraq after he apprises the UN Security Council of the outcome of his Baghdad talks, which he expects to be positive. When questioned if he is aware of the fact that he is responsible for the Iraqi people's continued suffering, which is caused by the embargo and prolonged talks on Iraq's compliance with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, even though Iraq has honored all its commitments as enshrined in these resolutions, particularly those regarding Paragraph C, when the UN Security Council has failed to honor its commitments as enshrined in Article 22 of Resolution 687, Ekeus said: This time, I will make a personal effort. I will talk to all competent agencies about lifting the sanctions imposed on Iraq. This will be a personal effort on my part. It will also reflect my sense of responsibility toward the Iraqi people. This is because I, from the humanitarian point of view, am aware of what the continuation of the sanctions means. Nonetheless, any decision on the sanctions issue is contingent upon the outcome of these talks. We posed the following question to Ekeus: Is it fair that the Iraqi people should continue to suffer from the effects of this unfair embargo, even though Iraq has all along been honoring its commitments toward the UN Security Council? His answer was as follows: What can we do? These are the results of the Gulf War. We will try to find some solutions. We asked him whether he is optimistic about the outcome of the talks this time. He said: Maybe, maybe. Rolf Ekeus came to tears when a glorious Iraqi woman named Zahra' Yahya, widow of martyr Mu'izz al-Qaysi and mother of martyr Muhammad, approached him with a photograph of her martyred son, and asked him whether he recognized the child in the picture. She addressed him, saying: It is my son Muhammad. I lost him and his father, too. Do you know why? Ekeus replied: No. Zahra' said: My son was martyred when the United States launched a missile attack on Baghdad in June 1993. Ekeus said: I am sorry for this outcome. She answered him saying: What do I have today with your regrets? I will sue you. I will sue the United States. I will sue the United Nations and the UN Security Council. You come here to discuss the destruction of Iraq's weapons. Meanwhile, you allow the United States to kill Iraqis with its weapons. You have failed to take any measures against the United States. Ekeus repeated his strong regrets over the loss of her husband and son. But Zahra' continued to speak to him in fluent English, asking him and the UN Security Council to take a humanitarian position on the crimes perpetrated against the Iraqi people. Then, Ekeus could not restrain himself any longer. He came to tears and repeated: "Madame, I am very sorry for you." Afterward, he left us. Meanwhile, a Belgian journalist who was nearby, having seen Mr. Ekeus' tears, commented, saying: Impossible. Is it possible for Mr. Ekeus to weep and shed real tears? How can this stony-hearted man weep?
