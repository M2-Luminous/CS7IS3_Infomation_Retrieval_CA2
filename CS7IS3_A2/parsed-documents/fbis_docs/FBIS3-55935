The document provides for a three-month suspension of the order to revaluate the capital assets of enterprises and organizations in its part concerning printing-houses, TASS was told today at the Russian Journalists' Union. The sharp rise in printing expenses nearly provoked a one-week strike of newspapermen. Furthermore, the draft ordinance instructs the relevant agencies to consider the possibility of granting the mass media the status of cultural institutions in order to reduce taxes collected from them. The document also suggests that the publishers of children's books and textbooks be exempted from taxes and that socially important publications be subsidized by the state. The draft also calls for certain amendments to the privatization programme for this year with a view to take a proper account of the mass media. Some governmental agencies are also instructed to solve other concrete problems facing the press. The document is expected to be considered within the next few days. The working group of its drafters, which was set up as a result of the recent meeting of newspaper editors-in-chief and heads of journalists' associations with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, includes head of the Russian Committee for the Press Boris Mironov, chairman of the Russian Journalists' Union Vsevolod Bogdanov, head of the Association of Publishers and Editors-in-Chief Ivan Laptev.
