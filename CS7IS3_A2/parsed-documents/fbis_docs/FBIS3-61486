The vertical structure of the waves is examined, and through a series of formulae the long- and short-wave approximations of their dispersive dependencies are obtained. A study is also made of Airy wave packets, which are generated during the evolution of initial disturbances in the ocean. The special features of the generation of gyrsoscopic waves by periodic and by moving disturbances are described, and a comparison is made of the effectiveness of wave generation by surface and by bottom disturbances. On the basis of his investigation the author concludes that gyroscopic waves possess properties which differentiate them substantially from internal waves. The main differences lie in the frequency range of their occurrence, in their vertical structure, in the directions of their propagation in relation to the generating sources, and in the spatial structure of fields of gyroscopic waves behind moving disturbances. Effective generation of gyroscopic waves can be expected in layers of quasi-homogeneous depth during the flow of currents past irregularities in the terrain of the ocean floor. The question of experimental detection of gyroscopic waves in the world ocean remains still to be explored.
