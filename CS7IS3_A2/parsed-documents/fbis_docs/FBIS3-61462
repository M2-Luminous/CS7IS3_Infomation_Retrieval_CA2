N. Kotlyarov, UDC 621.396.61:621.375.026] [Abstract] Methods for optimizing the energy parameters of nonlinear models of electronic power amplifiers with a nonresonant random load are discussed. These amplifiers are used to construct final stage broadband short-wave radio transmitters. The approach considered here may be used to calculate possible energy characteristics of various types of broadband power amplifiers with a prescribed load, for which the influence of harmonic components of the output signal spectrum must not be disregarded.
