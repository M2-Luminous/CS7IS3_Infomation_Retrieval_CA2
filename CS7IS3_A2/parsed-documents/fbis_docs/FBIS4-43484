Reference to Biondi's proposals was also made by the Council of Europe's ad interim secretary general, Peter Leuprecht, who in his opening address called on the organization's 32 members to collaborate more closely to both prevent and repress corruption "a phenomenon from which no European country is saved." Biondi went on to argue how it would be "extremely opportune" that the workings of this group be also open, either as members or observers, to other international organizations or countries which are not members of the Council of Europe, so they can contribute their different experiences. He also recalled how the theme of the conference here, on the various aspects and levels of corruption, as well as the role of the judiciary, was based on an initiative from the Italian Justice Ministry "born from the conviction that this argument cannot be an exclusive monopoly of one nation." "But the search for individual responsibilities for judicial ends" Biondi stressed, "must in no way push into second place the need to respect the basic rights of the individual, guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights." The problem of repressing corruption must be on the same level as efficiently preventing corruption, the Italian minister continued, "We must introduce into our legal systems all the judicial measures needed to prevent, as much as possible, the creation of `at risk' situations, in which corruption can germinate and blossom." The conference here is slated to conclude tomorrow with the adoption of a number of resolutions and sees the participation of the justice ministers from almost all 32 of the Council of Europe members as well as observers from Russia, the United States and the Holy See.
