At a news conference, Zamora said: "We are concerned that we have detected a military presence in urban centers in seven towns in the departments of La Union, Chalatenango, Ahuachapan, Cabanas, San Vicente, Cojutepeque (Cuscatlan), and San Martin (Cuscatlan)." At least 2.5 million Salvadorans will elect a new president, vice president, 84 Legislative Assembly deputies, 262 municipal mayors, and 20 representatives to the Central American Parliament (Parlacen) in the first elections since the civil war (1980-92). According to the peace agreements signed by the government and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, FMLN, in January 1992, the new National Civilian Police (PNC) should be solely in charge of public security, but since the PNC has only been deployed in seven of the country's 14 departments, the old National Police also participates in those tasks. A total of 8,000 members from these two organizations are in charge of security for the elections. Zamora also reported other "irregularities" in the voting, like propaganda "abuse" by the ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance (rightist ARENA). He said, "The law absolutely prohibits this." He also reported an excessive number of cars with ARENA banners and symbols and a delay in opening voting centers, which has "hindered" the people's right to vote. Zamora also asked the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) to provide voters with more transportation because, according to him, this is another problem in the electoral process. Despite these charges, Zamora said he can give "a positive assessment of the process," and he added that no major incidents have occurred in the centers where the 6,981 voting tables are installed.
