The government, meanwhile, has agreed to meet representatives of the communist-led National Democratic Front (NDF) before holding the next round of exploratory talks in Vietnam. Howard Dee, chair of the government peace panel, however, urged the NDF to remove all preconditions for the Vietnam talks, saying these were contrary to The Hague Declaration signed by the two parties last year. "We...condemn the dastardly act of bombing sacred places, the church and the mosques of Davao City," Misuari said at the resumption of government-MNLF talks in Timbangan town. Misuari told Bangsa Moro [Moro Nation] supporters he will not allow anybody to sabotage the talks. He said the MNLF units in Davao City were ready to go after the persons responsible for the bombings of the Davao cathedral and mosques. Also attending the affair were Representative Eduardo Ermita, government peace representatives, and observers from the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) of Six led by Indonesian Ambassador Yusbar Jamil. The perpetrators of the bombings "...will not succeed, as unity and peace in Mindanao will be achieved and will reign," he said. Meanwhile, the GRP [government of the Republic of the Philippines]-MNLF "mixed" support committees which convened Tuesday noon named the cities of Zamboanga, Cotabato, Marawi, General Santos and Manila as the next venues for the peace talks. The schedules are: cease fire committee -- 5, 6, 7, January, Zamboanga City; defense -- 10, 11, 12 January, Cotabato City; administration -- 13, 14, 15 January, Manila; shariah -- 17, 18, 19 January, Marawi City, and 27, 28 29 January, General Santos City; economics -- 20, 21 January, Zamboanga City; and ad hoc -- 7, 8, 9 February, Zamboanga City. The "mixed" committees will meet in Zamboanga City, but the dates have not yet been agreed upon. The ad hoc committee is headed by Interior Undersecretary Alexander Aguirre, with Ermita, Makabankit Lanto, Baltazar Sator and Department of Justice Undersecretary De Castro as members. Heading the five MNLF committees are Lieutenant General Thambayopha Manjoarsa, defense and security; Dr. Jawali Laja, education; lawyer Jose Lorena, finance, mines and resources; lawyer Didagen Dilangalen, administrative; and Ustadz Shariff Zain Jali, judiciary and shariah. The OIC was represented in the Timbangan meeting by Ambassador Jamil, Libyan Ambassador Abdulaziz Azzaroukh and Indonesian Consul Colonel Muhammad Zaini. In a press statement, Dee cited as a "precondition" the rebels' demand for the withdrawal of Executive Order (EO) No. 125, issued by President Ramos on 15 September 1993. NDF peace representative Luis Jalandoni has said the order threw "a monkey wrench into the peace process" and accused the government of imposing the Philippine Constitution as framework for the peace negotiations. Jalandoni, in a statement issued in Utrecht, the Netherlands in October threatened to pull out from the Vietnam talks if the government did not recall the executive order. Dee said the order "defines the approach and administrative structure for the government's comprehensive peace efforts and...clothes the government panel with its authority to negotiate peace settlement." He said it is the government's responsibility to follow the "Rule of law and Constitutional processes" in pursuing a "just and comprehensive and lasting peace." Instead, Dee said, Jalandoni "takes issue with the reference in EO 125 and insists on resolving this issue even before the holding of the exploratory talks in Vietnam. "Any disagreement on this issue should be elevated for discussion ion the Vietnam exploratory talks as these talks are intended precisely to reach common understanding for us to proceed to the formal talks," he said. Dee said that without the "preconditions," the preliminary meeting can take place to prepare the agenda and ground rules for the exploratory talks." The former ambassador to the Vatican also urged Jalandoni to "come to the negotiations table to implement The Hague Declaration so that together we may give peace a chance." "Our people deserve nothing less."
