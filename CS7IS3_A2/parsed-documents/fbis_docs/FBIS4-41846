The chief of the public relations center of the service Aleksandr Mikhailov said that when Stepashin spoke of the violation of human rights at a conference at the office of the Prosecutor General on June 23 he meant the violation of the right "to kill, rob and rape" assumed by criminals. According to Mikhailov, the attitude of Stepashin who was the head of a parliamentary committee investigating KGB activities in 1991 is clear and definite: To combat crime a solid legal basis should be built and law enforcement bodies should act accordingly. The head of the PR center said that in implementing the presidential decree counterintelligence intends to base its actions on such legal grounds.
