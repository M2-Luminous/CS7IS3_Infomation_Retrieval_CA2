The weekly quotes the admiral as saying that he "continues vigorously to deplore" the cumulative delay in replacing the two French aircraft carriers, because this is liable to "insiduously weaken" the capabilities of the Naval Air Service. As we know, budget restraints have forced the successive governments to delay (initially by 30 months and more recently by an additional six months) the commissioning of the nuclear aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle--now under construction in the Brest navy yard--whose total cost is estimated at 17 billion francs [Fr], of which Fr10 billion has already been appropriated. The carrier is currently scheduled to be commissioned no earlier than late 1999, with an initial detachment of Rafale fighter aircraft on board. "The Clemenceau was commissioned in 1961 and the Foch in 1963," Admiral Coatanea explained to COLS BLEUS. "The Alize (a carrier-based maritime reconnaissance and antisubmarine fighter aircraft) joined the flotilla in 1958. The Crusader (a carrier-based aircraft designed for air defense) dates back to 1964. Their replacement is therefore urgently necessary, and I continue vigorously to deplore the successive delays in this program. These postponements insidiously weaken our capability for naval air action, the value of which has been demonstrated by the events of recent years. Moreover, these delays saddle those responsible for ensuring the availability of such action--and for carrying it out--with a burden whose increasing physical and psychological impact is comprehended by very few." "We appear to be on the right track, however," the admiral went on to say. "The Charles de Gaulle will be launched next spring. It is scheduled to go into active service by the end of the century, equipped with its first Rafale fighter aircraft and also a reconnaissance aircraft for which provision has been made in the budget." Admiral Coatanea made mention of the proposal--submitted to the government by the Navy--to purchase four Hawkeye carrier-based reconnaissance aircraft from the U.S. Grumman company. This radar-guided aircraft is capable of "illuminating": that is to say, capable of detecting aerial intrusions (by aircraft or missiles) that might pose a threat to aircraft carriers at sea. The cost of the project is estimated at Fr5.8 billion, and the 1994 defense budget has already set aside Fr1.735 billion. The Navy chief of staff "strongly" expressed the hope that "a second aircraft carrier will go into service several years later." Together with the Charles de Gaulle, he said, a second carrier would "constitute a homogeneous and powerful force that would always be available to support any action taken to prevent, contain, or otherwise respond to a crisis or conflict."
