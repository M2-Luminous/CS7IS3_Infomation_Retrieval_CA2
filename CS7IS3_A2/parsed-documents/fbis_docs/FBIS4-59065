I greet you from the valiant Mukayris district in the Abyan Governorate. Here is the true account of the progress of the purging of the strongholds of treason and separation. As for the 20th Brigade in Mukayris, the secessionist, rebellious traitors imagined that through this brigade and the extraordinary amounts of ammunition stored in it, they would be able to declare separation from this brigade. However, they were disappointed, for their evil plotting boomeranged against them. Our faithful, unionist forces managed on Thursday [5 May] at 1100 to seize the brigade, keeping its ammunition to defend the Yemen of unity of democracy, the Yemen of wellbeing and peace. As for the personnel of this brigade, some of them surrendered, while the others were captured. The vanguards of the faithful, unionist forces are marching to pounce on the remnants of the [word indistinct] traitors and rebels, hammering the last nails in the coffin of separatists who rebelled against constitutional legitimacy and harbored evil and ill intentions against this beloved homeland. However, the unbelievers plotted and planned, and God too planned, and the best of planners is God. [koranic verse] The vanguards of our valiant unionist and legitimate forces are removing the remaining dens of traitors, pounding their heads, which harbor secessionist illusions, and making them taste the bitter consequences of their evil intentions and acts. In al-Dayqah area this morning, the al-Wahadah Brigade forces under the command of Staff Colonel 'Abdallah Mansur engaged the rebellious secessionist forces of the 30th Brigade. Their forward forces were destroyed by our valiant, unionist forces, the defenders of unity, democracy, and constitutional legitimacy. Many personnel were detained and the entire equipment of those two brigades [as heard] were seized. Our forces are now continuing to liquidate other units that continue to persist in their course of injustice, misguidance, rebellion, and separation.
