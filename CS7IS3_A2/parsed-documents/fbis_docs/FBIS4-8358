Mr. Sangheli stated: "No matter how strange it would seem to you, we are fed up with the misery and intrigues published by the press, which keep telling us that Romania has allegedly granted us disinterested aid. In the past two years, Romania has not given us even a pencil for free. I would like to tell you that, in fact, Romania did not respect its commitments and is not a correct economic partner for Moldova. As far as political aspects are concerned, I do not even want to talk about them." The declaration was made in the Russian language, shortly after Andrei Sangheli chaired a government meeting devoted to the issue of relations with the CIS. The government spokesman, Ion Rosca, refused to comment on the Moldovan prime minister's statements. [Romanian Presidency Spokesman] Traian Chebeleu rejected Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli's declarations and noted that "the affirmations do not correspond with reality and I hope that, through the Romanian Embassy in Chisinau, we will receive the necessary clarifications on the viewpoints expressed."
