A resolution to this effect was passed at the report-back election conference of Democratic Russia's Moscow branch. The initiative to set up a new party was moved by the Russia's Choice parliamentary faction led by key reformer Yegor Gaydar. According to most speakers at the conference, the new party is to promote "consolidation of democratic forces". Ilya Zaslavskiy, a Democratic Russia leader, said "the powerful, disciplined political association of reformers" would counterbalance opposition forces presently gathering strength. The planned organization based on dual membership "is by no means counterpoised to the Democratic Russia Movement", Zaslavskiy emphasised. However, some of the Democratic Russia leaders do not share this view, for example Lev Ponomaryov, Dmitriy Katayev and Gleb Yakunin. According to Yakunin, "creation of the party will bury the Moscow branch of Democratic Russia" by turning it into a mere appendage to the political organization headed by Gaydar.
