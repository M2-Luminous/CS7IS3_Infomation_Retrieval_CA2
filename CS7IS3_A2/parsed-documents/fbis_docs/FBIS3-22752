The deputy commander of the Aranyaprathet task force unit, Col. Itsara Watcharaprathip, said senior Army officers in Bangkok showed high interest in the box suspected to contain uranium. The rusty box, which is 28 cms long, 21 cms wide and 6 cms deep and weighs about 4.2 kgs, bears a danger sign and a phrase in English which reads "1974-1994 Uranum 999x Made in USA 2350827". Col.

He said he had an intelligence report that at least 10 similar boxes weighing from one to five kgs were smuggled into Thailand and were sold to junk dealers for 200,000 to 1,000,000 baht.
