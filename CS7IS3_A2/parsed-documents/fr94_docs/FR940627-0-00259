FR940627-0-00259 FR940627-0-00019 (v) Preparation of Standard Curve. Dilute a single control sample in sample buffer to give at least five standards, between 1 and 10 μg total protein per 20 μl. The suggested values of total protein per 20 μl sample buffer are 1.25, 2.50, 3.25, 5.0, 6.25, 7.5, 8.75, and 10.0 μg. (vi) Preparation of Nitrocellulose Sheets. Nitrocellulose sheets of 0.1 or 0.2 micron pore size are rinsed by immersion in distilled water for 5 minutes and then air dried. (vii) Sample Application. Samples can be spotted onto the nitrocellulose sheets free-hand or with the aid of a template. For free-hand application, draw a grid of squares approximately 2 centimeters by 2 centimeters (cm) on the nitrocellulose sheets using a soft pencil. Spot 5&hyph;10 μl portions to the center of each square for a total sample volume of 20 μl. For template aided sample application a washerless microliter capacity sample application manifold is used. Position the nitrocellulose sheet in the sample application device as recommended by the manufacturer and spot a 20 μl sample in one application. Do not wet the nitrocellulose or any support elements prior to sample application. Do not apply vacuum during or after sample application. After spotting samples (using either method), let the sheets air dry. The sheets can be stored at room temperature for several days after sample application. (viii) Standard Incubation Conditions. These conditions have been described by Jahn et al . (1984) in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. All steps are carried out at room temperature on a flat shaking platform (one complete excursion every 2&hyph;3 seconds). For best results, do not use rocking or orbital shakers. Perform the following steps in enough solution to cover the nitrocellulose sheets to a depth of 1 cm. (A) Incubate 20 minutes in fixer (25 percent (v/v) isopropanol, 10 percent (v/v) acetic acid). (B) Discard fixer, wash several times in deionized water to eliminate the fixer, and then incubate for 5 minutes in Tris-buffered saline (TBS): 200 mM NaCL, 60 mM Tris-HCl to pH 7.4. (C) Discard TBS and incubate 1 hour in blocking solution (0.5 percent gelatin (w/v)) in TBS. (D) Discard blocking solution and incubate for 2 hours in antibody solution (anti-GFAP antiserum diluted to the desired dilution in blocking solution containing 0.1 percent Triton X&hyph;100). Serum anti-bovine GFAP, which cross reacts with GFAP from rodents and humans, can be obtained commercially (e.g., Dako Corp.) and used at a dilution of 1:500. (E) Discard antibody solution, and wash in 4 changes of TBS for 5 minutes each time. Then wash in TBS for 10 minutes. (F) Discard TBS and incubate in blocking solution for 30 minutes. (G) Discard blocking solution and incubate for 1 hour in Protein A solution ([I125]-labeled Protein A diluted in blocking solution containing 0.1 percent Triton X&hyph;100, sufficient to produce 2000 counts per minute (cpm) per 10 μl of Protein A solution). (H) Remove Protein A solution (it may be reused once). Wash in 0.1 percent Triton X&hyph;100 in TBS (TBSTX) for 5 minutes, 4 times. Then wash in TBSTX for 2&hyph;3 hours for 4 additional times. An overnight wash in a larger volume can be used to replace the last 4 washes. (I) Hang sheets to air-dry. Cut out squares or spots and count radioactivity in a gamma counter. (ix) Expression of data. Compare radioactivity counts for samples obtained from control and treated animals with counts obtained from the standard curve. By comparing the immunoreactivity (counts) of each sample with that of the standard curve, the relative amount of GFAP in each sample can be determined and expressed as a percent of control.
