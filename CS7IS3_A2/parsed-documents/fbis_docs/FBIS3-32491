The Cuban official said talks are currently under way among the three states for a possible petroleum cooperation agreement and that each is prepared to establish a commercial operation that is favorable to the three countries. The Cuban vice president stressed, however, that the issue was not discussed with President Caldera because the tour of South American countries is focused on strengthening relations with Cuba.
