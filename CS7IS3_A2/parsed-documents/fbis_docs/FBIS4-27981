The move follows Saturday's talks in Washington between high-level officials of Japan, South Korea and the United States, where it was decided to urge the U.N. Security Council to consider possible sanctions against North Korea. The sources said Kakizawa and South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu would meet next weekend to discuss the prospect of Security Council sanctions and of unilateral sanctions by the three countries if the council fails to act. Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito told a press conference earlier in the day that Japan wants to hold the foreign ministerial meeting as early as possible, considering the heightened tension relating to the issue of North Korea's alleged nuclear weapons development program. But he said Kakizawa and Han would be discussing a wide range of issues, in what will constitute a regular foreign ministerial meeting. The previous such meeting was held in September, when Han visited Japan. Meanwhile, Kakizawa, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai were scheduled to meet Monday night to listen to a report from Shunji Yanai, director general of the Foreign Ministry's Foreign Policy Bureau, who represented Japan at last weekend's trilateral talks.
