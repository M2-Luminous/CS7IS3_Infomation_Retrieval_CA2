FR941121-2-00058 FR941121-2-00047 [OPP&hyph;66203; FRL&hyph;4915&hyph;2] Accufilter International, Inc.; Notice and Order of Revocation of Registrations AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice; Notice and Order of Revocation of Registrations and Final Determination Governing Sale and Use of Existing Stocks. SUMMARY: On November 6, 1992, EPA issued registrations for Accufilter Straw, EPA Registration Number 64906-1, and Accufilter Sport Bottle, EPA Registration Number 64906-2. These silver-activated carbon filters are intended to remove the taste of chlorine and other sources of bad taste, odor, and color from drinking water. These registrations were based, in part, on receipt and review of water samples analyzed for silver content. EPA has subsequently determined that the registrant did not report the actual silver content in those water samples, but instead submitted false information showing the silver values to be lower than those actually obtained by the laboratory that conducted the sampling. Registrations obtained through the submission of false data are invalid for any purpose. By this notice, EPA announces and orders the revocation of registrations 64906-1 and 64906-2. As a result of these revocations, the sale, distribution, or use of existing stocks of these water filters after November 21, 1994 would be unlawful. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 21, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Richard F. Mountfort, Registration Division, Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 713, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202, 703-305-5446. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On November 6, 1992, EPA issued registrations to Accuventure, Inc., Beaverton, OR, for the drinking water filters Accufilter Straw, EPA Registration Number 64906-1, and Accufilter Sport Bottle, EPA Registration Number 64906-2. The company name was subsequently changed to Accufilter International, Inc., at the Beaverton, OR, address. These registrations were for drinking water filters in which silver was impregnated on activated carbon. The filters are intended to remove sources of odors and taste from drinking water. Silver is an element, and a secondary standard for silver in drinking water has been established. Under provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act, a secondary standard for a drinking water contaminant is not enforceble; rather, it is established for aesthetic purposes. Exposure to silver can cause argyria, a discoloration of skin or other tissues, which is usually permanent. Although not a toxic response, it is an undesirable cosmetic change. The registration applications for these filters include analyses of water samples from tests utilizing these filters. The testing was intended to reflect actual use conditions and included sufficient flushing of the filters to represent use over varying portions of the filter's useful life (new filters, 10%, 60%, 95% of filter life). Twenty four (24) sample analyses were reported from the laboratory. EPA has learned that in the testing performed by the laboratory and reported to the registrant, 14 samples were at or exceeded 0.05 milligram/liter (mg/L) of silver in drinking water. At the time of registration (1992) the secondary drinking water standard (maximum contaminant level) for silver was 0.05 mg/L. (This standard has subsequently been increased to 0.1 mg/L). When this report was forwarded to EPA in support of the registration applications, all 14 values had been reduced below the standard. The original data suggest that some of the filters may leak silver, that higher levels of silver than reported occur in drinking water as a consequence of use of the filters, and that quality control of the filters may be inadequate. This Notice has two parts: Part I describes the basis for the revocation of registrations for Accufilter Straw and Accufilter Sport Bottle; Part II describes the procedures which will be followed in implementing the regulatory actions set forth in this notice, including the treatment of existing stocks. I. Basis For Revocation The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), 7 U.S.C. 135 et. seq., does not prescribe procedures to be used to revoke a registration that has been obtained through a willful act of misrepresenting data submitted in support of registration. In the absence of such procedures, the termination of a license such as a pesticide registration is governed by section 558 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 558. Section 558 states: Except in cases of willfulness or those in which public health, interest, or safety requires otherwise, the withdrawal, suspension, revocation, or annulment of a license is lawful only if, before the institution of agency proceedings therefore, the licensee has been given_ (1) notice by the agency in writing of the facts or conduct which may warrant the action; and (2) opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance with all lawful requirements. Courts have interpreted willfulness to mean ``an intentional misdeed or such gross neglect of a known duty as to be the equivalent thereof.'' Hutto Stockyard, Inc. v. USDA (903 F.2d 299, 304 (4th Cir. 1990) (quoting Capitol Packing v. United States, 350 F.2d 67, 78-79 (10th Cir. 1965); Capital Produce Co . v. United States , 930 F.2d 1077, 1079 (4th Cir. 1991). To establish willfulness, one need only show that an act or failure to act was intentional, as opposed to accidental, and proof of an evil motive is unnecessary. Emil Lawrence v. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 759 F.2d 767, 769 (9th Cir. 1985). In this case, the registrant submitted data which were changed from the original, and did not reflect true results of the analyses of the samples. The altered results suggested lower silver content in the drinking water than actually occurred as a consequence of use of the filters. This was an intentional act, not an accidental one; therefore, it falls squarely within the definition of ``willful.'' Because the registrations were obtained through misrepresentation and a willful violation of the provisions of FIFRA, the registrations were not valid when granted and section 558 does not require that EPA provide notice to the registrant or an opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance prior to revocation of the registration. Although not required in this case, the Agency did provide the registrant written notice as well as an opportunity to respond to the allegations against him. The registrant has responded that he did not alter the data, but has not provided evidence to support his contention. These procedures go beyond what is required by the APA in cases of willful violations of law. II. Order This notice announces EPA's decision and order revoking registrations for Accufilter Straw and Accufilter Sport Bottle. As a consequence of this revocation, the sale, distribution, or use of any existing stocks of either filter in the United States is unlawful. Existing stocks are those currently in the United States and which have been packaged, labeled, released for shipment, and/or distributed to dealers, retailers, or other sellers.
