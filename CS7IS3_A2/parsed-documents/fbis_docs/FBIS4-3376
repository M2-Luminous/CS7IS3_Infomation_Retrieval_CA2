The trio -- Chen Che-nan and Stella Chen of the Democratic Progressive Party and Tsai Chung-han of the ruling Kuomintang -- made the charge to the UN Commission on Human Rights. They asked the commission to send officials to Taiwan to see for themselves Taiwan's current political and economic situation and its desire to join the UN. "A trip to Taiwan will help you understand how unreasonable it is that the 21 million people in Taiwan are not represented in the world body," Stella Chen told a commission official. The three lawmakers also asked the UN commission to condemn Beijing for its callous handling of the March 31 Qiandao Lake travel disaster in which 24 Taiwan tourists died, and push Beijing to unveil the truth about the incident. The UN official said the three must furnish the commission with more data before it can accept their charge against Beijing. He told the Taiwan lawmakers that the UN General Assembly recognizes Beijing as the sole legitimate government of China and regards Taiwan as part of China. "That is a political reality which this commission, a UN affiliate, cannot revoke," the official noted. He said although he is fully aware that Taiwan and Mainland China are ruled by two different governments and each has its own military, "I, as a UN civil servant, cannot freely criticize the UN for turning a blind eye to such facts." He added that even if Taiwan declares independence after holding a plebiscite, its chances of joining the UN are still slim unless the UN General Assembly changes its "one China" policy. Taiwan has been kept out of the world body since Beijing assumed the UN China seat in 1971. The three lawmakers told the news media later that they will launch a "one person, one letter" campaign after returning to Taiwan, which will encourage every Taiwan resident to write to the UN expressing the country's strong desire to win a seat in the world body. They arrived in Geneva late Monday [18 April] after attending a meeting of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) in the Hague. At their request, the UNPO filed a lawsuit against Beijing, on behalf of Taiwan, in the International Court of Justice Monday for Beijing's repeated attempts to prevent Taiwan from entering the UN. Two court officials accepted the lawsuit, but they didn't make any comments or explanations. The three Taiwan lawmakers later lodged a protest with the mainland Chinese Embassy in the Hague, demanding that Beijing apologize to the bereaved families of the 24 Taiwan tourists killed in the Qiandao Lake incident, and stop blocking Taiwan's efforts to join the UN. The trio put their protest in an embassy letter box as no embassy official would meet them. Dozens of overseas Chinese from the Netherlands and Germany joined the three in a demonstration outside the mainland embassy. The three along with another DPP legislator, Parris Chang, arrived in the Hague last Friday to attend the UNPO round table meeting which was chaired by Chang. The UNPO, an alternative United Nations, was founded in the Netherlands in February 1991 to help ethnic minorities and peoples which are not represented in the UN or other major world organizations.
