FR941128-0-00031 FR941128-0-00009 40 CFR Parts 712 and 716 [OPPTS&hyph;82044; FRL&hyph;4914&hyph;5] Preliminary Assessment Information and Health and Safety Data Reporting; Addition of Chemicals Agency: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Interagency Testing Committee (ITC) in its 34th Report to EPA revised the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Section 4(e) Priority List by recommending for health effects testing ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) (CAS No. 637&hyph;92&hyph;3) and tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME) (CAS No. 994&hyph;05&hyph;8). The ITC recommendations must be given priority consideration by EPA in promulgating test rules. EPA is adding these two chemical substances to two model information-gathering rules: the TSCA Section 8(a) Preliminary Assessment Information Rule (PAIR) and the TSCA Section 8(d) Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule. These model rules will require: Manufacturers and importers of the substances identified herein to report certain production, use, and exposure-related information, and manufacturers, importers, and processors of the listed substances to report unpublished health and safety data to EPA. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule will become effective on December 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan B. Hazen, Director, TSCA Environmental Assistance Division (7408), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Rm. E&hyph;543, Washington, DC 20460, Telephone: (202) 554&hyph;1404, TDD: (202) 554&hyph;0551. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This rule adds ETBE and TAME to the PAIR and the section 8(d) Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule. Manufacturers, importers, and processors of these chemicals will be required to report unpublished health and safety data, and manufacturers and importers will be required to report end use, exposure, and production volume data to EPA. Because the ITC has expressed no need for ecological effects information for the substances being added to the section 8(d) rule via this action, EPA is not requiring the reporting of these data for the subject substances under the section 8(d) rule. I. Background Section 4(e) of TSCA established the ITC and authorized it to recommend to EPA chemical substances and mixtures (chemicals) to be given priority consideration in proposing test rules under section 4. For some of these chemicals, the ITC may designate that EPA must respond to its recommendations within 12 months. In this time, EPA must either initiate a rulemaking to test the chemical or publish in the Federal Register its reasons for not doing so. On May 17, 1994, EPA announced the receipt of the 34th Report of the ITC, and it was then published in the Federal Register of July 13, 1994 (59 FR 35720). The 34th Report revises the Committee's priority list of chemicals by recommending ETBE and TAME to the section 4(e) priority list. This rule adds ETBE and TAME to the PAIR and the section 8(d) Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule. These two rules are model information gathering rules which assist the ITC in making testing recommendations and aid EPA in responding to the ITC recommendations. EPA issued the PAIR under section 8(a) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2607(a)), and it is codified at 40 CFR part 712. This model section 8(a) rule establishes standard reporting requirements for manufacturers and importers of the chemicals listed in the rule at 40 CFR 712.30. These manufacturers and importers are required to submit a one-time report on general volume, end use, and exposure-related information using the Preliminary Assessment Information Manufacturer's Report (EPA Form 7710&hyph;35). EPA uses this model section 8(a) rule to gather current information on chemicals of concern quickly. EPA issued the model Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule under section 8(d) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2607(d)), and it is codified at 40 CFR part 716. The section 8(d) model rule requires past, current, and prospective manufacturers, importers, and processors of listed chemicals to submit to EPA copies and lists of unpublished health and safety studies on the listed chemicals that they manufacture, import, or process. These studies provide EPA with useful information and have provided significant support for EPA's decisionmaking under TSCA sections 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. These model rules provide for the automatic addition of ITC priority list chemicals. Whenever EPA announces the receipt of an ITC report, EPA may, at the same time without further notice and comment, amend the two model information-gathering rules by adding the recommended chemicals. The amendment adding these chemicals to the PAIR and the Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule becomes effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Register . The reporting of ecological effects data will not be required for ETBE and TAME under the section 8(d) rule. Because no member of the ITC has expressed a need for these data, EPA believes there is no need to collect this information at this time. II. Chemicals To Be Added In its 34th Report to EPA, the ITC recommended ETBE and TAME for health effects testing. EPA is adding these two chemical substances to the PAIR and the section 8(d) Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule. The use of ETBE and TAME to augment or substitute for methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) (CAS No. 1634&hyph;04&hyph;4) as fuel oxygenates and the need for health effects data for ETBE and TAME are of concern to EPA and the ITC. For these reasons, EPA is adding ETBE and TAME to the section 8(d) rule to obtain data to support EPA's ongoing assessments of the potential hazards/risks posed by these two substances. Manufacturers, importers, and processors of the two substances being listed on the 8(d) rule by this action will not be required to report ecological effects data under the 8(d) rule for those substances. III. Reporting Requirements A. Preliminary Assessment Information Rule All persons who manufactured or imported the chemical substances named in this rule during their latest complete corporate fiscal year must submit a Preliminary Assessment Information Manufacturer's Report (EPA Form No. 7710&hyph;35) for each manufacturing or importing site at which they manufactured or imported a named substance. A separate form must be completed for each substance and submitted to the Agency no later than February 27, 1995. Persons who have previously and voluntarily submitted a Manufacturer's Report to the ITC or EPA may be able to submit a copy of the original Report to EPA or to notify EPA by letter of their desire to have this voluntary submission accepted in lieu of a current data submission. See ยง712.30(a)(3). Details of the reporting requirements, the basis for exemptions, and a facsimile of the reporting form, are provided in 40 CFR part 712. Copies of the form are available from the TSCA Environmental Assistance Division at the address listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. B. Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule Listed below are the general reporting requirements of the section 8(d) model rule. 1. Persons who, in the 10 years preceding the date a substance is listed, either have proposed to manufacture, import, or process, or have manufactured, imported, or processed, the listed substance must submit to EPA: A copy of each health and safety study which is in their possession at the time the substance is listed. 2. Persons who, at the time the substance is listed, propose to manufacture, import, or process; or are manufacturing, importing, or processing the listed substance must submit to EPA: a. A copy of each health and safety study which is in their possession at the time the substance is listed. b. A list of health and safety studies known to them but not in their possession at the time the substance is listed. c. A list of health and safety studies that are ongoing at the time the substance is listed and are being conducted by or for them. d. A list of each health and safety study that is initiated after the date the substance is listed and is conducted by or for them. e. A copy of each health and safety study that was previously listed as ongoing or subsequently initiated and is now complete_regardless of completion date. 3. Persons who, after the time the substance is listed, propose to manufacture, import, or process the listed substance must submit to EPA: a. A copy of each health and safety study which is in their possession at the time they propose to manufacture, import, or process the listed substance. b. A list of health and safety studies known to them but not in their possession at the time they propose to manufacture, import, or process the listed substance. c. A list of health and safety studies that are ongoing at the time they propose to manufacture, import, or process the listed substance, and are being conducted by or for them. d. A list of each health and safety study that is initiated after the time they propose to manufacture, import, or process the listed substance, and is conducted by or for them. e. A copy of each health and safety study that was previously listed as ongoing or subsequently initiated and is now complete_regardless of the completion date. The bulk of reporting is required at the time the substance is listed. Persons described in categories 1 and 2 do all or most of their health and safety data reporting at the start of the reporting period. The remaining reporting requirements, specifically categories 2(d), 2(e), and 3, continue prospectively. Detailed guidance for reporting unpublished health and safety data is provided in the Federal Register of September 15, 1986 (51 FR 32720). Also found there are explanations of the reporting exemptions. C. Submission of PAIR Reports and Section 8(d) Studies PAIR reports and section 8(d) health and safety studies must be sent to: TSCA Document Processing Center (7407), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, ATTN: (insert either PAIR or 8(d) Reporting). D. Removal of Chemical Substances from the Rules Any person who believes that section 8(a) or 8(d) reporting required by this rule is unwarranted, should promptly submit to EPA in detail the reasons for that belief. EPA, in its discretion, may remove the substance from this rule for good cause (40 CFR 712.30 and 716.105). When withdrawing a substance from the rule, EPA will issue a rule amendment for publication in the Federal Register . IV. Release of Aggregate Data EPA will follow procedures for the release of aggregate statistics as prescribed in the Federal Register notice of June 13, 1983 (48 FR 27041). Included in the notice are procedures for requesting exemptions from the release of aggregate data. Exemption requests concerning the release of aggregate data on any chemical substance must be received by EPA no later than February 27, 1995. V. Economic Analysis A. Preliminary Assessment Information Rule EPA estimates the PAIR reporting cost of this rule is $14,072. To calculate this figure, EPA used information from a variety of published sources as well as information from OPPTS's Risk Management 1 (RM1) reports on similar chemicals to generate a list of five firms that manufacture and/or import the two chemicals at a total of eight sites. The published sources used include: SRI International's Directory of Chemical Producers, Chemical Economics Handbook , and Specialty Chemicals ; other multi-client studies; the U.S. International Trade Commission's Synthetic Organic Chemicals ; and company product literature. An unknown number of the businesses affected by the addition of the chemicals to the Priority List may qualify as a small business as defined in 40 CFR 712.25(c). However, for this analysis it is assumed that all firms identified will report. Therefore, EPA expects five firms to generate a total of eight reports (some sites produce both of the chemicals). โฃโฃโฃโฃโฃโฃโฃโฃ Reporting Costs (dollars) (a) 8 reports estimated at $924 per report = $7,392 (b) 8 sites at $835 per site = $6,680 Total Cost = $14,072 Mean cost per site = $14,072/8 sites = $1,759 Mean cost per firm = $14,072/5 firms = $2,814 Mean cost per report = $14,072/8 reports = $1,759 โฃโฃโฃโฃโฃโฃโฃโฃ Reporting Burden (hours) (a) Rule familiarization: 18 hours/site x 8 sites = 144 (b) Reporting: 16 hours/report x 8 reports = 128 Total burden hours = 272 Average burden per site = 272 hours/8 sites = 34 Average burden per firm = 272 hours/5 firms = 55 Average burden per firm = 272 hours/8 reports = 34 โฃโฃโฃโฃโฃโฃโฃโฃ EPA Costs (dollars) Processing cost = 8 reports x $95/report = $760 B. Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule EPA estimates the total reporting costs for establishing section 8(d) reporting requirements for the two chemicals will be $10,353. This cost estimate is high because the Agency is uncertain about the likely number of respondents to the rule. Although EPA has used the best available data to make its economic projections, much of the information is based upon the 1986 TSCA Inventory Update and secondary information from industry sources. Therefore, EPA tends to overestimate rather than underestimate reporting burden. The estimated reporting costs are broken down as follows: โฃ 1โฃ 1โฃ lInitial corporate review l$ 2,080 lSite identification l1,248 lFile searches at site l2,829 lPhotocopying existing studies l428 lTitle listing l129 lManagerial review for CBI l2,565 lReporting on newly-initiated studies l54.52 lSubmissions after initial reporting period l970.80 lTotal l$ 10,353 โฃโฃโฃโฃโฃโฃ Reporting Burden (hours) (a) Initial review: 2 hours/firm x 15 firms = 30 hrs (b) Reporting: 10.26 hours/firm x 15 firms = 154 hrs Total reporting burden hours = 184 hrs VI. Rulemaking Record The following documents constitute the record for this rule (docket control number OPPTS&hyph;82044). All of these documents are available to the public in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center (NCIC), formerly the TSCA Public Docket Office, from 12 noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays. The NCIC is located at EPA Headquarters, Rm. NE&hyph;B607, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. 1. This final rule. 2. The economic analysis for this rule. 3. The Thirty-fourth Report of the ITC. VII. Regulatory Assessment Requirements A. Executive Order 12866 Under Executive Order l2866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments of communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, it has been determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. B. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements contained in this rule have been approved by OMB under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and have been assigned OMB control numbers 2070&hyph;0054 for PAIR reporting and 2070&hyph;0004 for TSCA section 8(d) reporting. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 34 hours for PAIR per response and 8.2 hours for section 8(d), including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch, 2131, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.''
