Speaking at an official lunch in the Kremlin in honor of the British premier on Tuesday [15 February], the Russian president stressed John Major's sincere attention to what happens in Russia, his real and concrete support of democratic reforms in the country. Yeltsin indicated that Russia moves along this path not easily, like all countries which have already passed it. "But the most important thing is that a reliable foundation, the Constitution, has been laid beneath the reform building," Yeltsin said. President Yeltsin expressed satisfaction with the talks in Moscow and the signed documents, noting that every meeting with John Major brings "something new and significant in relations between the two countries, brings them closer to each other and enriches their cooperation." Boris Yeltsin pointed out that Russia and Great Britain share common goals and values -- to do everything possible so that people live in a safer and more prosperous world, be free and not worried about the fate of their children and grandchildren. "Our approaches are not completely the same," the president said. "And naturally it is in common interests to find a correct and painless way toward reaching this great and noble goal." He said this is one of the most important guidelines of the Russian-British cooperation.
