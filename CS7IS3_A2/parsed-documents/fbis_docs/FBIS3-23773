However, one gets the impression that this is like tilting at windmills: The government pays little attention to the reaction of the most numerous public organization in terms of membership. How do you assess relations between trade unions and the government? Are you satisfied with them? [Goncharik] I am dissatisfied because I believe that the results of our dialogue could have been weightier. This will be possible only when the government reviews its economic and social policies, and introduces serious corrections to the latter in accordance with our postulates. We have certain accomplishments, but soaring prices and inflation only nullify them. For example, on New Year's eve, we were informed of the planned threefold increase in prices for dairy products and municipal services. This is being done when enterprises face work stoppages and workers are not being paid. The Trade Union Federation Presidium called a session and adopted an appeal in protest against these measures. The government backed out and the price increase was postponed. We understand that the postponement is temporary, but given the fact that the Supreme Soviet has rejected our proposal to establish the minimum wage of 35,000 rubles as of 1 December, our fight was not futile. [Nikolaychik] Do you correct your strategy and slogans taking into account the experience of your struggle? [Goncharik] You might have noticed that the federation has altered its position -- while maintaining our economic claims we have decided to concentrate our efforts on resolving more global issues. Some branch trade unions are demanding wage increases. However, without making our production more efficient, this measure will only fuel inflation and become a heavy burden on all of society. Competent legislation is one of the factors that can facilitate the development of production. In light of this, we are actively working at Supreme Soviet sessions along with industrialists and entrepreneurs drafting documents regulating taxation and favorable credits. Discussions are under way regarding the adoption of a general agreement between the government, trade unions, and employees. In particular, we have agreed to include in this document the share of wages in the gross domestic product (it was decreased from 26 to 19 percent). Another thing that I would like to point out is that disregarding reproaches voiced by many parties, we have put forward political claims. This does not contradict our charter which says that we can participate in elections. [Nikolaychik] Opinion polls conducted by trade unions have demonstrated that more than 700,000 voters advocate early elections. It is strange that this figure made no impression on the deputies who behaved as though nothing really happened. [Goncharik] These 700,000 voices will sound again when the session resumes its discussion of elections. The more so that Lukashenko's anticorruption report did not contribute to the prestige of power. We are receiving letters from enterprises and very often only 10 people out of 2,000 oppose early elections. Only a blind man fails to see the abnormality of relations between the Supreme Soviet and the government. It is really unnatural that the parliament and the government have diametrically opposing viewpoints regarding many issues of vital importance, including relations with Russia. The new legislature will form a new government, but this does not mean that everybody will be discharged. People able to work and think will confirm their right to be deputies, ministers, and the like. Many deputies support the idea of early elections and suggest a mechanism for holding them. However, when these people gather in the session hall, the instinct of self-preservation prevails. I think there are two reasons for this: Many deputies simply fail to comprehend the danger of the current situation in the Republic, while others are trying to keep their cushy jobs. [Nikolaychik] Suppose early elections are called. What stance will trade unions take; what political parties will they stake? You, for one, are known to support the Social-Democratic Assembly.... [Goncharik] We support this party's socioeconomic platform. The Trade Union Federation is now drafting its election platform. The system of elections is also relevant. Most likely, the elections will be held in districts with candidates being nominated by parties. This is why we are considering the possibility of electing people with similar standpoints to the new legislature. Our goal is to have a group of workers in the Supreme Soviet. We will seek support from centrist parties -- the Party of People's Accord and its social-democratic wing, the Scientific- Industrial Congress, and the Labor Party. The formation of a trade union party -- the Democratic Labor Party -- is currently under way. We will support this bloc. Our platform stipulates a socially oriented market economy with active protection of workers' rights and guarantees of their well-being. We want Belarus to be a flourishing state; that is why we have suggested that aside from the definitions "unitarian" and "democratic," our constitution includes formulas such as "social" and "sovereign". [Nikolaychik] Judging by our conversation, there is no incongruity between trade unions and politics. Could trade unions assume responsibility for the state of things in Belarus? [Goncharik] I do not think such a situation is possible in immediate future. [Nikolaychik] Even theoretically? [Goncharik] I am not an advocate of such a solution. Everybody should perform his functions. Our political activities are limited to participation in elections and electing politicians able to meet working people's demands. The experience of Poland demonstrates that under certain circumstances, trade unions can come to power. However later, they begin to fight trade unions. I also know this from the Israeli experience. The Israeli Trade Union, Gistradut, and the Labor Party are in fact one body. They have come to power and are facing problems. The state has specific restrictive functions that do not coincide with interests of groups and organizations. Clashes are inevitable. [passage omitted) [Nikolaychik] How do you assess prospects for the development of the ruble zone? [Goncharik] There are no doubts that today we should follow this path. We can waste no more time. For a certain period, people will feel an improvement; products will become cheaper and mutual payments will be simplified. However, what will happen then? We should make good use of the breather we will get. If we want Belarus to become a sovereign state, the Republic should adopt a national currency sooner or later. If we follow the path of simple integration in Russia's economy, we must accept political integration as well. Our sovereignty will be very feeble; we will become Russia's appendix and autonomous part. In my opinion, this would be a very dangerous scenario. We need political wisdom to walk this slippery path and not fall into an abyss. The Belarusian people are historically oriented toward Russia. Enterprise managers unilaterally support a union with Russia. However, we must pursue our national interests and sovereignty must be the cornerstone of our policy.
