Kuznetsov is convinced that with time "we are going to advance from the Commonwealth of Independent States to a union of independent states" setting up a super-national body with coordinating and controlling powers. In his opinion no matter who is going to be elected Belarusian president on Thursday the parliament will firmly pursue a policy of economic integration between independent states. At the present stage Ivan Rybkin finds it necessary to work for unified, standardized legislation for CIS countries in order to ease integration. He is convinced that the experience of unified Europe, its common bodies and conforming legislation should be used. Rybkin said that last week the Duma supported the idea of a parliamentary meeting of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine to discuss the results of the 1991 agreement on the formation of the CIS. "The evaluation of the situation should be realistic so that our future steps can be adequate," Rybkin declared. On July 5 the Duma committee for CIS affairs will hold hearings on the same subject. Rybkin invited Belarusian counterparts to attend. In return the Belarusian side invited Russian MPs to take part in festivities on the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Belarus on July 3.
