Observers say TA KUNG PAO has provided more balanced coverage of Xi's case than Hong Kong's three other pro-Beijing dailies--WEN WEI PO, the NEW EVENING NEWS and HONG KONG COMMERCIAL DAILY. While Hong Kong media began carrying unconfirmed reports of Xi's sentence last Saturday, none of the pro-Beijing papers covered the case until after the Beijing People's Intermediate Court confirmed Xi's 12-year prison sentence on Monday. TA KUNG PAO's prominently placed coverage on Tuesday included responses from Lu Ping, the director of China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, moderate local political organisations and even the Hong Kong government. WEN WEI PO, considered to be more hardline than Hong Kong's other pro-Beijing dailies, carried just a brief 100-word report quoting Lu Ping downplaying the case's impact on the local press. The discrepancy between the two papers' presentation of the case became more pronounced after more than 100 Hong Kong journalists petitioned the New China News Agency (XINHUA) to demonstrate their strong objection to Beijing's closed-door trial of Xi. TA KUNG PAO's lead story on Wednesday reported that pro-Beijing Hong Kong figures had expressed concern about the handling of Xi's case, as well as news about the petition presented by local journalists. Furthermore, the paper ran a rare editorial speaking up for the press. The editorial, entitled "It's Essential for the Public to See Justice", urged China to disclose information to show the public the verdict was judicially correct. "China has reiterated that Xi Yang's case has nothing to do with normal journalistic activities and will not affect the Hong Kong media in general," the editorial said. "The local press, however, still shows grave anxiety and speculation about the case because of the unclear situation." The editorial, which appeared to break ranks with the rest of the Beijing-controlled press, is believed to have been written by Tsang Tak-shing who has served as chief editor of TA KUNG PAO since 1986. Tsang, who is also a Hong Kong deputy to the National People's Congress, told EASTERN EXPRESS he would demand disclosure of details of the case, saying that "justice should be seen to be done". But he was quick to add that he would accept it if Beijing could not disclose those details owing to considerations of legal procedure. Analysts noted that Tsang's elder brother, Tsang Yok-shing, was among the six Hong Kong affairs advisers who paid a formal visit to XINHUA's Hong Kong office proposing that Beijing release details of Xi's verdict. Tsang Yok-shing is also chairman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, a pro-Beijing political body. WEN WEI PO on Wednesday did not carry any reports on the case, publishing just two commentaries, under pseudonyms, criticising leaders of the United Democrats, Martin Lee and Szeto Wah, of using Xi's case to mislead the public. Luo Fu, former editor of the NEW EVENING POST, said that despite the apparent differences in covering Xi's case, none of the pro- Beijing newspapers would dare to openly question Beijing's ruling. "There will not and could not be any basic difference among Beijing- backed newspapers, though their news coverage may appear to vary on the surface," said Luo. He has served a 10-year prison sentence in China after being found guilty of spying offences allegedly committed in a closed trial.
