It has been a long time since it was first said that Japan's space industry was experiencing a turning point. The end of the Cold War has resulted in a drastic decline in the international demand for weapons. This has made it necessary for us to review the significance of promoting space development for military purposes. In Japan, with the major change in the demand situation following the so-called Super 301 Article trade friction between Japan and the United States, the environment surrounding the space industry has become more complex. Meanwhile, we are currently living in the "space age." Last year we observed International Space Year. Under the slogan "the observation of earth from space," the designation of such a year was intended to promote space development. In parallel with this effort, experts investigated and discussed the prospects of the space industry in Japan at the meetings of the Aerospace Industry Committee. Since the work of compiling a report on the results of the investigation and discussion has been completed, I would like to hear from the gentlemen attending today's meeting who were central members of the committee about the focus of the report. At the same time, I would like to hear your expectations with respect to Japan's efforts to promote the space industry. I would like to have Professor Tsuchiya, who chaired the committee meetings, make the opening remarks. Characteristics of Space Industry and Japan's Role Tsuchiya: The space industry is a major industry which involves a number of technologically-related industries. However, in space technology, Japan must step up her efforts to catch up with the front-running countries in the field. Japan has a comparatively long history of involvement in the space industry. However, progress during the postwar years has been deterred by the restrictions imposed by the war-renouncing Constitution. In these front-running countries, space-related industries have made great progress, encouraged by the need to produce increasingly sophisticated and lethal weapons. In Japan, the lack of the military incentive has caused the industry to lag behind these major space-related industrial nations. However, the policy of sticking to the peace-oriented Constitution has a good side as well. That is, during the postwar years, efforts have been made to develop space technology for peaceful applications. The space industry is not the only industry which has experienced relatively slow progress in Japan. Among these slow-developing industries, what distinguishes the space industry is the fact that the industry has a longer history. I think that this long history reflects Japan's intention to maintain balanced industrial development. At the same time, the Japanese government may have felt a sense of obligation to contribute to the progress of international scientific technology through the promotion of space development. This has made it necessary for Japan to maintain a reasonably high technological level. In addition, this has made it necessary for Japan to maintain the right to participate in international scientific research meetings and the right to make announcements of research results. These necessities may have been behind the interdisciplinary cooperation among governmental organizations, academic institutes and private companies in the development of the space industry. A long time has passed since Japan's space industry was said to be experiencing a turning point. Now Japan must earnestly consider the role it will be able to play. Japan must also consider how to overcome the disadvantages it faces in promoting space industry development. These are the questions we must tackle seriously in our efforts to develop Japan's space industry. Moderator: The turning point issue has two meanings: a turning point in the efforts directed toward space development, and a turning point in the effort to develop the space industry. In fact, we are experiencing a turning point with respect to space development. In this sense, as Professor Tsuchiya has pointed out, the space industry must step up its efforts so that it can pursue its objectives on its own without governmental protection. Now is the time for us to step up our efforts so that we will be capable of coping with the problems Japan's space industry is facing. I agree with Professor Tsuchiya in that we must make an effort to ensure a balanced development of the space industry vis-a-vis other domestic industries and to have the balanced development realized. In space development, the development of rockets is experiencing particular difficulty. I would like to have Mr. Harada, as a central figure representing the space industry in an investigative committee, give his opinion of the current situation of space development in Japan. Harada: This is a difficult question to answer. As has been pointed out, not only Japan, but also the United States and European countries are currently experiencing very hard economic times. In this sense, it is a global phenomenon that progress in space development is decelerating as a result of economic hardship. In Japan, the space industry is a minor industry and, accordingly, the budget for space research and development is small. This was pointed out repeatedly in the latest report. However, in terms of annual growth, the space industry has maintained growth close to 10 percent, a growth rate which is high compared to the growth rates of other industries. In this sense, I think the future of the space industry is promising. As referred to a while ago, rockets constitute an essential part of space development efforts. As the vehicle providing the means for accessing space, the rocket actually constitutes the most important part of space development. Rocket development in Japan has progressed from the development of the N-I rocket to the H-I rocket. We are currently developing the H-II version which is scheduled to be launched next year. For those who have been involved in the development of rockets, launching the H-II rocket is the major goal for the time being. We are confident that the rocket will be launched successfully. The development of H-II rocket derivatives will be followed by the development of rockets which, having different capabilities, can be used in various launching tasks. This is the most important part of rocket development. In compiling the latest report, I glanced through the last report which was worked out in 1988. This report emphasized the "commercialization" of the rocket development business. The latest report, on the other hand, places priority on improvements in the economy in rocket development and rocket business management. For Japan, it is impossible to develop commercial-grade rockets which can be launched at low cost by competing with those countries which have established advanced rocket technologies. Even if we cannot develop such rockets, the development of rockets which can be launched at reasonable cost will make Japan capable of playing a role in the international effort to develop rocket systems--a role which is as significant as the roles being played by these countries which hold advanced rocket technologies. This way of thinking characterizes the latest report. The current effort toward space development is two-pronged. One involves the development of the derivatives of the H-II rocket and the development of commercially-usable rockets of different capabilities based on the designs of the derivative models. The other is the HOPE project--a project involving the development of a space shuttle-type space vehicle. We wish to embark on this project in the near future. It will lead to manned space flight by sending HOPE shuttles to space using reusable rockets. HOPE will probably be launched with the H-II rocket or with a rocket to be developed based on a derivative of the H-II rocket. Considering the current high cost of the H-II rocket, the rockets must be greatly improved to allow reuse. The above description is the most plausible scenario to be followed in our space development efforts. The rocket, as a space transport vehicle, is a field in which new targets that must be met are appearing one after the other. Before moving on to tackle the next target, we must clear the hurdle of the successful launching of the H-II rocket. Moderator: What about the launching of artificial satellites? Koshisaka: As Professor Tsuchiya has pointed out, the international situation with respect to artificial satellites has changed with the end of the Cold War between the United States and the former Soviet Union. In the past, they competed with each other in space development as national projects. As opposed to these superpowers, Japan has been promoting space development not for military purposes, but for the peaceful use of space. When considering this change and the fact that Japan has restricted space development to peaceful uses, I wonder if the end of the Cold War has really caused the country to experience a turning point in space development. It is undeniable that the international situation with respect to space development has changed. However, my observation is that this change has not affected Japan much because space development in Japan has been restricted to that for peaceful uses. Japan's space development has no elements which are affected by the change in the international situation. The definition of the term "space industry" is quite ambiguous. For example, the automobile industry has grown to the point that it is engaged in the production of cars without requiring government assistance. A business which has developed to such a degree could be regarded as an industry. In this sense, space business in Japan is still too small to be regarded as an industry. In the case of the automobile, camera and electric appliance production industries, the international competitiveness they have today has been nurtured on the strength of a strong domestic demand. Similarly, in the case of the space industry, the development of a domestic demand will be a prerequisite for the industry's further development. In terms of business scale, Japan's endeavors in the space field have been too small to be regarded as an industry. The "Super 301" clause has served to apply a brake to the development of the space industry. The clause imposes very tough requirements on the domestic space industry, particularly on satellite manufacturers. Under these circumstances, manufacturers must step up their efforts to outlast the problems. The fact that Japan's space industry is still in the process of development may alleviate the adverse impact of the trade clause somewhat. More than 30 years have passed since I began working in the field of space development. From my experiences in such development, it seems to have taken a longer time for space endeavors to develop into a full-fledged industry than has happened in other industries. However, the degree of the setback caused by the Super 301 clause could be low enough to be overcome without much difficulty. By viewing the setback like this, we can entertain hopes for the future. To aid us in coping with this setback, we hope the government will take the initiative in fostering a domestic space industry. The Super 301 trade clause calls for Japan to introduce an open bidding system for commercial satellites. This will require domestic satellite manufacturers to become more competitive in the international market. On the other hand, the clause calls for excluding from the open bidding system satellites to be launched to conduct advanced research and development. The communications industry in Japan has yet to improve its infrastructure, thereby realizing a speedier exchange of information over a wider geographical region, by launching more communications satellites. For the time being, it is important for us to strive to realize this. Effort To Develop Space Industry Moderator: How the significant development of the space industry will be realized represents a difficult task. The continued expansion of space development will be the key to this. In addition, it will be important for us to promote cooperation among domestic companies, as well as between Japanese and foreign companies. When taking these things into consideration, the system for developing space transport systems is expected to undergo drastic changes in the future. So far, a number of countries, including Japan, the former Soviet Union, the United States and EC countries, have been conducting space development independently. However, with the end of the Cold War, as the scale of the systems grows larger, the trend is toward securing compatibility among the systems being developed by the different countries. This trend represents a "turning point" in the development of space transport systems. Compatibility must be secured not for the sake of national prestige, but for the benefit of mankind. Professor Nakayama, as a man who has been involved with space development in Japan from the time it was started, what is your opinion regarding this point? Nakayama: My belief is that the development of space will bring benefits to mankind. Development plans include the exploration of the moon and Mars. As evidenced by today's weather forecasting satellites and transcontinental communications systems, the utilization of space has now become part of our daily activities. It is certain that the use of space will continue and expand. The question is whether or not the space industry can develop into a self-sustaining entity within Japan's economic system without government assistance. This question must be considered from a global perspective. Taking into consideration the fact that the development of space technology will benefit mankind, the ways in which each country has been pursuing space development must be modified. Now that the Cold War is over, I think that international efforts toward the development of space will take a form in which the cooperation and exchange of information and services will increase among the countries. When such an environment prevails, Japan must be offered rights and opportunities equivalent to those accorded other countries. If Japan has something which is technologically superior, it can offer them to other countries. And, if Japan does not have the technology to produce something, it can request it from another country which has the right technology. This kind of flexibility will contribute to easing the trade friction. A new perspective may arise when we become accustomed to this flexible thinking. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry has a number of departments devoted to fostering domestic industry. Today, there is a mounting urgency for some of these departments to create new sections to handle trade friction with foreign countries. These departments' practices of sticking to the tradition of protecting domestic industry is becoming increasingly out of date under the mounting international trade friction. In addition, when there are industries which are prone to causing major problems by disrupting the domestic economy, the government must deal with these problems by creating a new section. On the other hand, in those existing sections which oversee the industries which cause little trouble, assigning no more than one official to each section would be sufficient to take care of the industry. I think there is no need for the government to endeavor to foster a specific domestic industry by allocating unproportionally large resources simply because the government has departments dedicated to the promotion of the space industry. It is important for us to maintain continued progress in space development. Accordingly, research and development must be promoted. Even if it does not produce profits, we must continue the development of space technology as long as the government continues allocating funds for the effort. We should take advantage of this government assistance. When a technology which can be put to practical application has been developed, or when the need for such a technology arises, then we can think of establishing a joint venture with foreign companies to put the technology into commercial applications. We can also think of selling the [resulting] parts, or of buying similar parts from foreign countries when the need arises. What is most important is that we continue our efforts toward developing space technology. After we have successfully launched the H-II rocket, we can proceed with the HOPE project, and after achieving success with this project, we can proceed to another task. This is what is needed for us in space development. We do not know for certain what will happen in the years ahead. Those European countries which have been promoting the HERMES project recently began to hint that the project will be called off due to a lack of money. A thing like this can happen in any country. Even the United States is uncertain whether the country will launch a new space project after the current space shuttle program ends. Under these circumstances, it is possible that these countries will turn to Japan for help. Considering this possibility, it is important that Japan continue the development of space technology. We must promote this effort not as a business for producing profits, but to accumulate technological heritage for the future and to make a contribution providing international benefits by mobilizing the technological and economic resources which Japan can currently afford. It is difficult to foresee the future of international space development. However, in recent years, it has become increasingly clear that a country's progress in the space industry is dictated by that country's economy. A deterioration of the economic situation in a country can lead to a decrease in reliability and flexibility and an increase in accidents. It is possible that the day when Japan will play a leading role in the international space development effort it will arrive earlier than expected. Moderator: Professor Nakayama's observation of Japan's capabilities in space development seems to be contrary to that made by Professor Tsuchiya... Tsuchiya: I suggested that Japan has been disadvantaged in space development based on the fact that Japan's efforts have concentrated on nonmilitary purposes and that these efforts have been hampered by many limitations, including the lack of proper rocket firing ranges. In actuality, however, Japan has achieved high technological standards on the international level with the development of the H-II rocket and satellites. As stated before, the space industry in Japan is still very young, and has the possibility of making great progress in the future. I think that the space technology which will be developed in the coming years will be used in many applications. Although not all of the technologies developed will be used in commercial applications as soon as they are developed, it is still important to continue the efforts to develop new technologies. Of course, in the development of space technology, the cost factor must also be taken into consideration. Efforts to reduce development costs will continue, and costs will go down as the reliability of the technology improves. As Mr. Harada said, the developer seems to have great confidence in the performance of the H-II rocket. If there is much demand for rockets in the future, the production costs will be substantially reduced, and this, in turn, will generate additional demand. Here, the question is whether the lower costs will lead to an increase in demand or to the promotion of actual space applications. Take the space technology which enables us to determine our current location using a satellite, for example. Currently, there is relatively great demand for satellite-assisted location finding equipment, even though the cost is high. If the cost were to decrease further, there would be many more car owners able to afford the equipment. If it is proven that yachts and ships equipped with such equipment have very low disaster rates, the demand for the equipment will increase greatly. If the equipment proves very useful, car owners driving cars equipped with it will save gas and travel time by avoiding getting lost while driving. This will make the introduction of such equipment pay off economically. The equipment would prove useful for me because I have gotten lost many times when driving alone and when driving through unfamiliar places. Other similar instances may exist in which the usefulness of the equipment has been proven. Considering this, I think there is a strong possibility that current efforts in the development of space technology will lead to the generation of space industry. At the same time, it is very important to continue the development of space technology in order to accumulate the technology as a common asset of mankind. The importance of this effort must be recognized by all people living in today's world. In order to promote this effort, I agree with Mr. Yamazaki who pointed out the importance of creating an environment in which such an effort can be promoted through international cooperation. Japan must participate in the international space endeavor even if she is forced to take charge of only a small portion of the endeavor. It is possible that space technology will be used in a wide variety of consumer appliances in the future. Taking this into consideration, it is important that businesses continue to invest in space development efforts, even if they do not produce profits soon. In order to make the investments pay in the long run, we must make efforts to foster the space industry. Costly Space Development Effort Moderator: So far, two important things have been pointed out. As Mr. Harada said, the satellite-assisted location finder is a good example of applying space technology to commercial use. The satellites used for this purpose were not originally launched to develop the market for location-finding equipment. At first, the equipment cost about ¥40 million. The demand for the equipment increased to the level of thousands of units per month shortly after the price was reduced to the ¥150,000 level. This indicates that an industry can spring up in a very short time once the production cost of a product is greatly reduced. The other important thing which has been pointed out is that space is an infrastructure which must be shared by all countries. In this connection, the market for mobile communications systems has a promising future. If the cost were cut substantially, the mobile communications service would become accessible to more people more easily. This would then make it possible for the market to expand further. Space development has been criticized for the huge costs it requires. The hardware used in space development is very expensive. The current mobile satellite communications program was launched by taking the need to cut costs into account through the introduction of cost-cutting measures, which were worked out by introducing ideas drawn from Motorola's Iridium program. This program was developed by the private sector. Koshisaka: Concerning satellite communications using geostationary satellites, until recently satellite communications have been performed mostly between these satellites and fixed ground stations. In general, satellite communications are superior to optical fiber communications, although the latter has a number of advantages, including a smaller time lag in signal propagation. Satellite communications makes it possible for communications to be conducted "any time, anywhere, with anyone," the ultimate goal of the communications industry. With the number of customers using it increasing in recent years, the mobile communications service operated using satellites will grow into a major means of communications by taking advantage of the superiority of space communications. This concept is backed by the fact that, in recent years, the industry producing automobile radiotelephones has witnessed a sharp increase in demand for the equipment used in communications via ground stations. Whether mobile satellite communications systems are expensive or not will be dictated by the production costs. Considering the possibility that a satellite communications system will offer us the ultimate means of communication, our current efforts have a very promising future irrespective of the current high costs. At the same time, taking into consideration the fact that a satellite communications system will benefit people around the world, the development of such communications systems must be financed not only by a limited number of private domestic companies, but also by other establishments, including foreign companies. Moderator: In recent years, with the availability of advanced communications networks, including gigabit-speed networks, it has become possible to transmit increasingly large volumes of information at faster speeds. When the technology behind these networks matches that of the satellite communications technology, it will become possible for the satellite communications market to expand greatly. Koshisaka: I agree. Moderator: Regarding research on WEDOS, in which you played a role, don't you think it is important to make an effort to increase the number of WEDOS service customers, particularly in the field of earth environment observation, in the sense pointed out by Mr. Koshisaka a while ago? I think we must make an effort to increase the number of customers who will use WEDOS services for various purposes, including disaster prevention. Nakayama: World history since the Industrial Revolution shows that countries the world over have made efforts to overcome poverty. In today's industrially-developed countries, poverty has almost been overcome. The next task these countries must tackle will be the prevention of environmental destruction and natural disasters. Localized problems can be dealt with by local governments or individual countries. However, many of the problems arising in the world today are more than a single country can handle. With the recent progress in research on the natural phenomena occurring on the earth, including typhoons and abnormally high temperatures, we are now able to forecast droughts and floods. We must now launch a global effort to tackle these natural disasters as a problem common to all mankind. The introduction of space technology will help us greatly in our fight against these disasters. In this sense, we must promote space development, and WEDOS will prove to be very useful in these efforts. Japan must promote the international utilization of WEDOS. I hear that the Red Cross has a very strong interest in WEDOS. The Red Cross has stockpiled medical and other emergency supplies at sites across the world in preparation for disasters. When a major disaster takes place somewhere in the world, the Red Cross first tries to grasp the number of people who have been hit by the disaster and must be helped. The Red Cross may have previously obtained statistical data which will enable the organization to fathom the extent of the disaster once such a natural calamity occurs. The availability of satellite observation data on the disaster would greatly help the Red Cross take action against the disaster. By combining the observation satellites with conventional natural disaster relief systems, it would become possible to create a more effective international relief system. I think politics is partially responsible for these advanced earth observation technologies not having been put to practical use more efficiently. Many people have the misconception that space technology is very expensive to use. In actuality, a satellite launch costs about ¥20 billion, which is roughly equivalent to the price of a single jumbo aircraft. Moderator: Not so expensive in terms of a comparable price. Nakayama: I wonder if a large oil tanker or a skyscraper like the ones you see in central Shinjuku in Tokyo, where such buildings are concentrated, can be bought at prices of about ¥70 to ¥100 billion. There are many other things with prices in this range which are being dealt with within today's economic system. When compared with these prices, the cost of launching a satellite is not extraordinarily high. Then why is satellite usage not more common? I think that the reason is that, at present, there is no established system to collect the fees from customers for their use of satellite services. At one time, we thought it would not be very difficult to collect fees if we asked Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) or the Japan Broadcasting Corp (NHK) to launch satellites. These two corporations have well-established, efficient systems of collecting fees for the services they offer across Japan. However, this thinking proved not to work in the satellite business because we failed to recognize the fact that their services are confined to the domestic market. Therefore, we must find other methods for collecting fees. We were correct in thinking that fees should be collected for the services offered which employ satellites. Paying a fee for using a satellite-assisted disaster prevention system would be like paying a premium for a disaster insurance policy. If an international system to collect fees for the disaster prevention service were established, it would become possible to launch satellites. As for the GPS [global positioning satellite] service which makes it possible to find one's present location, we have been using satellites launched by the United States. So far, our interest has been confined to the ground-use equipment, which runs about ¥150,000, to use the service. If a system for collecting fees from all those using the service were created, it would become easier to launch a new satellite. There are other similar instances, including meteorological satellites. Many countries are benefiting from satellite service. However, these beneficiary countries have no intention of paying for the service, nor is there currently a system for collecting fees for the service. This is a major task we must tackle in the coming years. We have been offering free information services using satellites to expand the use of space technology. It seems that the United States has been taking this strategy. The same can be said of the GPS and the remote sensing services in that they have been offered free of charge. However, it is possible that the time will come when customers who have been using these services free of charge will be required to pay fees if they want to continue to use the services. In order for Japan to keep in step with the United States in this respect, Japan must keep a close watch on the United States to read its real intentions in offering free space technology services. One way to avoid being taken aback by a sudden change in strategy by the United States is for Japan to actively participate in international space development projects, such as the Iridium program. At present, I don't know which direction the free service system will be moving. However, the important thing is that it is time for us to earnestly consider this free service system from an international point of view by taking various factors into account, including the insurance system. In order to ensure the continued development of space technology, it is imperative that a system be established under which the customers must pay fees for the services they receive. To ensure continued development, the Japanese way of subsidizing R&D programs using the taxpayers' money is not the best one. Koshisaka: I listened to Professor Nakayama's remarks with great interest. So far, I have thought that the space development efforts had an aspect in which the effort to establish a fee-collection system was being ignored by offering, among other services, satellite services free of charge for earth observation and location finding. The same can be said of the services offered using LANDSAT, Noah and GPS. The United States has played a leadership role in offering satellite services free of charge. By establishing the fee collection system, it will become possible for people around the world to use satellite services without fearing the sudden suspension of services due to the lack of funds to operate them. One more important thing is that the technology which has been developed as the fruit of space development efforts must bring benefits not only to the people living in today's world, but also to the people of future generations. Considering the fact that many people today are worried about the deterioration of the earth's environment, securing the money to continue the operation of the WEDOS service on an international scale by encouraging investment in the service will be important. By making the effort to secure the funds for continuous operation, we can avoid being criticized by those of future generations for our negligence in establishing a fee collection system. Harada: In connection with Professor Nakayama's reference to the price of launching a satellite, the cost of producing a satellite may range from about ¥10 billion to ¥30 billion. But these figures do not include the cost of the rockets used to launch the satellite. In the case of Ariane rockets, the cost is ¥10 billion, while with the space shuttle, the rockets used to launch the shuttle to a comparatively low altitude may cost between ¥70 and ¥80 billion. This makes the total cost at least ¥80 billion. This means that launching a space shuttle to a relatively low altitude two or three times costs the same as constructing a large-scale nuclear power plant. Taking this into consideration, a satellite launch requires vast amounts of money. However, this does not mean that the high cost situation will continue forever. Humans have always been able to think of a way to solve the problems facing them. For example, when the United States participated in World War I, although I am not completely sure about this, the U.S. president ordered the production of 25,000 aircraft. However, the number of aircraft actually produced stood at around 14,000. When the war ended, they were at a loss about what to do with the many planes left intact. Ultimately, they used the planes for air mail service. By going through this experience, they developed jet aircraft years later, followed by the development of jumbo aircraft in the 1970s. Since the Wright brothers' feat occurred in 1903, jumbo aircraft were developed in a comparatively short time. During those years, production costs have been reduced to about one-hundredth. Taking this into consideration, the production cost of rockets may be reduced at a faster pace than we can imagine. A number of designs that differ drastically from the conventional ones have been proposed, for example, a transport system without Delta Clipper-type wings that rises vertically. The first flight test of an experimental model of this transport system is likely to take place in a month or two. Considering the speed with which new technologies are being developed, the reduction in production costs of space hardware may be realized at an unexpectedly fast pace. I think the space industry differs slightly from the automotive industry in that, in the former, it takes more time for the fruits of R&D to be made available to benefit the people. If the production costs of space transport systems are drastically reduced, it will become possible for us to take space trips in the future. For example, people would experience great excitement when observing planets moving in their orbits through a telescope. Even such an experience as seeing the planets through the narrow visual field of a telescope would give people great excitement. People will feel a completely different level of excitement when it becomes possible to observe the earth or space from a spaceship flying in a comparatively low orbit. Currently, it costs about ¥1 million to lift a 1 kg load into orbit. If a man weighing 100 kg is to be sent, the cost will come roughly to ¥100 million. This figure is unrealistic. However, if the cost were reduced to one-hundredth, it would become possible for us to take trips into space. This will be realized in the not so distant future. In actuality, our continued efforts to develop the space industry have resulted in fostering other related industries. These include the broadcasting, communications and earth observation industries using satellites. These are a few examples for which the future is promising with respect to our efforts to develop space technology. The most important aspect of space development is for the development effort to be continued. Our avid interest in space will provide the driving force needed to promote the development effort. When President Kennedy of the United States announced the Apollo program in 1960, he questioned himself regarding the significance of launching the program. He then answered the question by saying that they believed that space was the key that would determine the future of mankind. When this announcement came, the Cold War was continuing. President Kennedy also said that, concerning the significance the control of space would ultimately hold, no one could forecast it with confidence. Today, with the Cold War over, the phrase "control of space" should be changed to "development of space." Through his remarks, President Kennedy seemed to have wanted to say that space development has a charm that encourages people to challenge space. It was 30 years ago that he made those remarks. However, even today, it seems that space holds such a charm for mankind. This may serve as the driving force for our sustained efforts to develop space. It is the responsibility of such countries as Japan, the United States and European nations, which can afford to invest money in space development, to play leadership roles in promoting the development. Tsuchiya: The question of space travel aside, the demand for space technology may increase in the future. As Mr. Harada said, we know from past experience that the production costs of industrial products continue to decline as the development progresses. The time will come when satellites can be launched for one-hundredth the current costs. With these possibilities expected to be realized in the not so distant future, what is important for us now is to promote space development by having a clear vision. The question is how to formulate the vision. If we can formulate the vision, it will become easier to develop various types of rockets--not confined to the development of derivatives of the H-II rocket--that will be appropriate for diversified launching tasks. The effort to cut production costs will become easier by having a clear vision of what purpose a specific hardware item serves. I am not against the idea of collecting fees for the services from which customers benefit. However, I also think it is necessary to subsidize the development efforts until such efforts progress to a certain stage. For example, it was reported that the California state government was subsidizing transportation fees between Los Angeles and San Francisco. I don't know if the state has continued to shoulder part of the fees. Anyway, by following suit with California, the Japanese government should consider introducing a similar system to lower the air travel fees between Tokyo and Okinawa. Whatever form the system may take, it will be considered a government subsidy. Likewise, the government should allocate more funds to subsidizing the efforts to develop the demand for space technology. We benefit from television weather forecasts. However, we would not easily accept it if the television viewing fees were to be increased, for example, by ¥100, just because we benefit from the forecasts. Such an increase must be covered by a government subsidy. As for the subsidy to space development efforts, the government must review its policy on subsidies to promote the development of the space technology infrastructure for the benefit not only of Japan, but also of the world. For the time being, the space industry cannot help but depend on governmental assistance to nurture the industry. However, I cannot accept the thinking that we should press the government to increase the space development budget substantially by covering the increase 100 percent with taxpayers' money. Many people in the industry share this view. But I would say that, before they make such a demand, they should make efforts to create a market for space technology. Space Development--Common Goal of Mankind Moderator: Mr. Harada pointed out the importance of the space industry's playing a leadership role in promoting development in the communications and broadcasting industries as some of those space-related industries. On the other hand, Professor Nakayama stressed the importance of the Japanese government's playing a leadership role in promoting cooperation among countries of the world in tackling global problems, such as the deteriorating environment. These efforts, representing the need pointed out by Professor Tsuchiya, will be allowed to receive the "forward-looking" government subsidies. I share Professor Tsuchiya's opinion on promoting these endeavors. As for the necessity of clear vision, as Mr. Koshisaka said a while ago, we must switch our space development from a military-oriented effort to a nonmilitary effort--that is, in terms of protecting the earth's environment, to switch from the development of planet earth to the preservation of a good global environment. In order to promote the tackling of global problems, including environmental ones, cooperation must be promoted among the people involved in space development the world over. Nakayama: Concerning space travel, it may be possible to reduce the production costs of rockets. However, it is unlikely that the cost of the fuel required to launch rockets will be reduced to one-tenth or one-hundredth the current costs. At one time, it was said in the United States that it would be possible to reduce the fuel costs substantially. I have recently begun to think that such a substantial reduction would be impossible. The U.S. view failed to pay due consideration to the costs of producing rocket fuel. Moderator: There are some people who do not care about the costs of space travel--those newlyweds who are taking honeymoon trips. (Laughter) Nakayama: There may be some people who are willing to pay ¥10 million to take a trip to space. However, if the cost for space travel is expected to be greatly reduced in the not too distant future, [few people may pay such huge sums]. We should continue our efforts to reduce the production costs of rockets and the launching costs of satellites. However, we should not expect these costs to be reduced progressively when the production volume increases, as has been the case with automobile and household electric appliance manufacturing. This is because we will not need as many as a million rockets. And, it is unlikely that the production costs would decline to one-tenth if the production volume were to increase 10 times. Of course, the effort to cut production costs as much as possible must be continued. At the same time, it is important to devise a scheme which will require the customers of satellite services to participate, facilitating the launching of satellites. It will not be easy to collect money from every customer. Under the circumstances, we must think of other methods. For example, you may have noticed that commercial television stations have greatly improved their weather forecast presentations by introducing illustrations that are easier for viewers to understand. The reason that these stations have used extra money in their effort to improve their presentations has something to do with the effort to attract more viewers to their programs. For example, even if a news program does not amuse the viewers, they may be attracted to the news program, broadcast by commercial television stations, because they want to see the beautifully-rendered weather forecast which traditionally follows a news program. The increased number of viewers will contribute to these commercial television stations' making more money. The method of collecting money does not matter. The important thing is that there is a way to ensure the continued availability of sufficient funds to finance space development endeavors and to nurture the environment in which space technology will be used actively. As for the GPS, for the time being, Japan can concentrate on developing the receivers necessary for using the GPS for position or location finding, as well as on making money by selling the receivers. However, Japan must be prepared to shoulder half the cost of the continued operation of GPS service by launching satellites. In recent years, the United States has been cutting its shares in financing space development programs from the original 100 percent to a half or even a third, depending on the type of program, and has been pressing other countries to increase their shares. Under the circumstances, it is expected that, in the next 10 to 15 years, these countries will be required to accept their share of the responsibility in terms of money or tasks involved in promoting space development. Before jumbo aircraft came into service, probably when DC-8s were still in service, every passenger was required to pay the regular fare. However, with the introduction of jumbo planes and with the availability of many more seats, the concept of a "bulk" fare system, or a much-discounted fare system, was introduced. Thanks to this, group tours of foreign countries by Japanese citizens became very popular. In the case of space development, a similar strategy could be adopted. In conducting an experiment to create a material aboard a space ship, if the experiment were conducted by a single researcher, he would have difficulty convincing his boss that he had achieved the results he expected. By establishing a system under which researchers from a number of countries will be able to conduct experiments jointly aboard a space lab, and by establishing a system in which the results of the experiment are shared by the participating countries, such an experiment will become easier to conduct. As a way of convincing people that ¥10 or ¥20 billion is not extraordinarily high, I have cited the costs involved in constructing the great Seto Bridge, which reached ¥1 trillion. The authorities are reportedly in favor of constructing more such bridges at other sites in Japan in the future. In the meantime, the local governments use a total of ¥1.3 trillion of the taxpayers' money for garbage disposal every year. If efforts were made to reduce the volume of the garbage to half, ¥600 billion could be saved, which could be used to subsidize the space industry. My opinion is that the central government must continue to shoulder the costs required to promote efforts that will eventually benefit people. Koshisaka: It will be important to form a national consensus on that question. Nakayama: The problem is that many members of the general public, who have little understanding of the meaning of space development, insist that the space issue must be excluded when discussing government subsidies. In addition, there are others who have been publicizing the merits of space development that, in actuality, will be almost impossible to realize. This is very embarrassing for us involved in space development. Tsuchiya: Indeed, it is unlikely that even a brisk demand for satellites and the rockets to launch them will approach 1 million satellite or rocket units in the future. However, I think that the production cost of the H-II rocket can be reduced to half by the time the total number of rockets produced approaches 16. Koshisaka: Here, the rule of thumb comes into play. There is a big difference in fuel and production costs between producing one rocket and several rockets. Tsuchiya: I agree. The cost can be substantially reduced. Some may say that paying a high cost for space development is not a problem considering the fact that we pay such a high cost for garbage disposal. Nevertheless, we must continue our efforts to reduce space development costs by increasing the demand for space technology. Many more customers could be obtained by improving the reliability of space technology and by lowering the insurance costs. It is expected that international cooperation will be promoted further not only in sharing the cost of launching satellites, but also in developing fields for utilizing space technology. In addition, international cooperation must be promoted in sharing satellite launching facilities. For Japan, this will alleviate the burden of constructing new satellite launching centers within the country which would have poor functional flexibility. Nakayama: Incidentally, in connection with the price of Boeing 767 engines, I hear that the engine manufacturers are being asked by customer airline companies to lower prices. These companies claim that, considering the fact that the prices of commercial airplanes have been decreasing in recent years, engine prices should be lowered. Lowering engine prices will contribute to further decreases in plane prices. In negotiations for purchasing aircraft, these airline companies present the prices they can afford. This forces the plane manufacturers to step up efforts to cut production costs by reviewing the efficiency of the production line and the suitability of the production technology being used. On the other hand, in the space industry, nothing like this cost-cutting process has taken place. There has been no discussion on how much production costs can be cut to manufacture a rocket which will be priced at, for example, ¥10 billion. Discussions or negotiations will lead to taking a further constructive step. One possibility would be to go ahead with the rocket fabrication by cutting the price, sacrificing profits, to meet the customer's request. Another possibility is negotiating with the customer to create several rockets, thereby making the production pay. It is essential that we introduce a cost-cutting process, as is being practiced in the airline industry, into the space industry. Tsuchiya: That means we can still visualize a rosy future for the space development effort, can we not? Nakayama: Yes, we can. Koshisaka: In space development, too, we must consider the factor of "design to cost." The development of space hardware and space technology service must be promoted by taking the cost factor into consideration. The effort to meet the requirements as much as possible under a given cost is very important in pursuing R&D in the field of system engineering involving advanced technologies. To my regret, however, the importance of this effort is not necessarily understood by all those involved in space development. Nakayama: The lack of a sufficient number of customers is partly responsible for the poor understanding. Koshisaka: If those involved in R&D were to understand the importance of the concept of design to cost, they could find some alternatives in their development efforts--for example, by opting for the use of less-expensive conventional technology instead of the costly most advanced technology. The people currently involved in space development lack this flexibility. Tsuchiya: They must make an effort to use well-established conventional technology as much as possible. Koshisaka: What is required is for them to make the proper judgment regarding which technology is to be used in the system being developed, and which technology is not to be used. At present, they are not good at making such judgments. Nakayama: We still have many problems that must be tackled. Tsuchiya: All in all, it is important for us to continue the efforts to achieve a balance between technology and cost, and to promote international cooperation in space development. Space issues must be tackled from the viewpoint of promoting mankind's utilization of space by avoiding a situation in which the development efforts are hindered by conflicts over the possibility of the monopolization of space by a limited number of countries. To promote such development, I hope the government will promote international cooperation, for example, by increasing the official development assistance (ODA) funding. Moderator: With Mr. Tsuchiya's remarks having summed up the topic of today's meeting, I would like to close this discussion. Thank you for joining me in meeting today.
