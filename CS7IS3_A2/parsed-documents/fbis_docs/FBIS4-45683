Klaus said that towns and villages would have to implement by themselves standard projects aimed at restoring the environment spoilt by mining. He described as useful the current efforts by the management of the Ostravsko-Karvinske Doly mining company and representatives of the town of Karvina at establishing a proper co-existence which in practice would mean the abolition of the long-lasting "dictate" from the miners. In connection with the planned sale of some 20,000 apartments in Karvina Klaus said that in his view the general intention to sell apartments to their owners is "an idea erroneous from the very beginning which will get us nowhere and will only cause endless problems. I have never advised anyone to sell individual apartments, I have always recommended that owners be found for whole buildings within which flats would continue to be rented," Klaus said. He added that the sale of individual apartments would lead to the appearance of new, just as inflexible housing management firms. During his visit to Karvina Klaus delivered a lecture at the Commercial and Business faculty of the Silesian University. He said that the development of the Czech economy thus far showed that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) could grow this year by two to three per cent with the unemployment rate not exceeding four per cent at the end of the year. At the evening Klaus met Karvina inhabitants at a public rally.
