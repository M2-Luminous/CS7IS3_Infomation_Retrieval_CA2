NA": "Lessons for the Future"] [Text] The inspection and final performance evaluation for the winter training period has been completed among the troops of the 38th Army Corps, commanded by Major-General Anatoliy Kalashnykov. It was carried out by a group of generals and officers from the central apparatus of the MO [Ministry of Defense] of Ukraine headed by Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Colonel-General Ivan Bizhan. The results of the evaluation have been summarized. The principal conclusion drawn by the commission from the inspection was the fact that the military formation is, as a whole, able to fulfill the tasks entrusted to it to protect the state sovereignty of Ukraine. Many shortcomings were also noted as well, pertaining first and foremost to the professional proficiency of the staff officers, unit and subunit commanders and personnel. That proficiency was conditional upon both objective and subjective factors. The former include those connected with the difficult economic situation of the country, where funds, fuel and other material resources to support the combat readiness and everyday activity of the troops are lacking. This was taken into account in the inspection. But how to explain the negative attitude of some of the senior and command officers toward the organization of instruction in those military disciplines that do not require large expenditures? The latter pertain to the maintenance of discipline and regulation order, and the performance of official duties. The commission ascertained that the state of affairs is the worst in the military units headed by Colonel O. Kandiral, Lieutenant-Colonels L. Tkachenko and S. Manayev, and Major V. Ambros. A great deal of effort must be applied in order to instill order in the mechanized regiment commanded by Colonel V. Antsulov. The Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine became personally convinced of this when he visited the units and training areas. However, as was pointed out at the council, the overwhelming majority of the officers and their subordinates have done everything in their power, despite all of the bad things and difficulties, and tried to demonstrate what they had learned during the last training period. The company tactical training exercise with live firing that was visited by Minister of Defense of Ukraine General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy Radetskyy could serve as an example of that. He encouraged a group of officers and soldiers in their skillful actions. The exercise in the mountain training areas itself received a high rating. The troops of the 38th Army Corps (Carpathian Military District) have given an accounting of themselves. But the inspection continues. The baton has been passed to the Odessa Military District as of May 23. The 6th Army Corps has to pass final examinations. The conclusions that the commission from the central apparatus of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine in the Carpathian Military District, one would think, will be taken into account there.
