Talks between the Indian prime minister and Russian officials will focus on problems of military and military-technical cooperation between Russia and India. In technical respect, the Indian armed forces are predominantly oriented to Soviet-made and Russian weapons. According to the data available, 85 per cent of the military hardware in the Indian Navy are Russian-made, the Indian Air Force is equipped with Russian-made hardware up to 80 per cent, the Army -- to 65 per cent and the Air- Defence Troops - to 100 per cent. Russia, which had faced the threat of the loss of the Indian market which would have resulted in tens of billion dollars losses, after a certain stalemate in this sphere, finally determined the Indian direction as one of those of priority importance. At present, Russia is not only supplying spare parts to the Russian-made hardware, but sells licenses for the production of weapons in India. Russian and Indian firms signed an agreement on the creation of a joint venture for servicing aircraft of the "MiG" series and producing spare parts for them. During the Indian prime minister's visit to Russia this document is expected to be approved at a government level. The modernisation of jet-fighters of the "MiG-21" series used by the Indian Navy will begin in the near future under a contract worth 350 million dollars. These jet- fighters will be equipped with controllable missiles, new systems of controlling weapons and modern equipment on board. The program of the production of jet-bombers of the MiG-27 series according to the Russian license is expected to be carried through in a year's time. A total of 120 such bombers had already been built, which makes up two-thirds of the planned amount. India intends to use its industrial potential for the production of a new type of jet-fighters of the Su-30 series. According to the data available, Moscow is prepared to offer about 30 "Su-30" jet-fighters on credit to India and sell a license for their production. In June, 1994, a high-ranking delegation of the Indian Defence Ministry led by the Air-Force Marshal Krishnaswami discussed these problems in Russia and visited the Irkutsk aircraft building plant, where the trials of the new jet-fighter were held. Indian experts qualified the "Su-30" jet-fighter as a plane, which in its technical characteristics equals the American "F-18" and the European "Tornado" jet-fighters and surpasses the F-16 and the French "Mirage-2000" aircraft. The "Su-30" is equipped with a 30 millimeter-caliber gun, 10 missiles of various types and equipment which enables to refuel the aircraft in the air, which maximally improves the aircraft's capacity to spot and destroy targets both in the air and on the ground. India might possibly buy 30 jet-bombers of the "MiG-29" type and six jet-fighters of the "MiG 29YB" type worth around 780 million dollars. In mid-May, a series of contracts for the construction of missile boats, frigates and border guard ships in India under Russian licenses were signed in New Delhi by the director general of the Russia "Rosvooruzheniye" company, Viktor Samoylov. All main units, completing parts and weapons for theses ships will be supplied by Russia. Both Moscow and New Delhi officials believe that the Indian prime minister's visit to Moscow is expected to give a new impetus to the development of military-technical cooperation between the two countries.
