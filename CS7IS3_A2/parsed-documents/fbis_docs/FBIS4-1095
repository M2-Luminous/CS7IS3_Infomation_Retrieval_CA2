Mr. Taylor was addressing a news conference in Gbarnga yesterday in the wake of the nomination by the chairman of the State Council of certain individuals [word indistinct] as coordinators of the disputed ministries, particularly the Foreign Ministry, Mr. Taylor said he had introduced a coalition government of compromise involving the factions. Mr. Taylor said any faction's attempt to seat the LNTG, will not be welcomed as anything done half way is not done at all. He said it would be a mistake on the part of the NPFL to form a part of any such seating of the LNTG. The NPFL leader said that officials of the IGNU [Interim Government of National Unity] faction in the transitional government have all taken their seats in the government, including public operations and deputy ministerial positions. Mr. Taylor said if the NPFL allows the IGNU faction to keep a deputy minister acting in a foreign minister capacity, then individuals will go on holding onto the Foreign Ministry for the rest of the transitional period. He stressed that the NPFL is not prepared to tolerate any such conditions. The NPFL leader said it would appear that a consultation or allocation of cabinet posts has developed into a personality clash where some people do not distrust cited individuals. Mr. Taylor said he cannot understand why anyone would have reservations about a qualified Liberian like Counselor Momolu Sirleaf becoming foreign minister of Liberia. The NPFL leader said there was an instance where he would have preferred swapped-in portofolio between Counselor Sirleaf going to the Justice Ministry, while Counselor Laveli Supuwood could have taken over the Foreign Ministry. He said this could be somewhat only a concession. [Words indistinct] Counselor Sirleaf as an individual who has been considered as an obstacle to peace in Liberia. The NPFL leader said he does not know where these reservations are coming from, but he said that Counselor Sirleaf is a qualified Liberian who can ably command the Foreign Ministry.
