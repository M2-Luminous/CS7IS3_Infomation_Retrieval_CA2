I am very rarely nervous in front of any audience but today I feel I am overcome by emotions. I am joining all those who regard today as an historic day. I hope that this spring day on the eve of Easter 1994 will become a truly historic milestone. Today's document, the Treaty on Social Accord, is based on accord between politicians and state and public figures. But I hope that this treaty is not for politicians, public figures, or the state. I hope that this treaty, which was signed today, is for ordinary people, Russians, and the entire people because it is ordinary people who are most of all fed up with the political battles which have been going on for the last five years, tormenting our society, and precluding Russia from working calmly for the benefit of ordinary people. In their every speech politicians are saying that they express the interests of these people. As a participant in the legislative process of the past years I can tell you in all openness that this document is of enormous importance for us, legislators, for the upper chamber, the Federation Council, and, I hope, for the State Duma. I know that in the past many laws were political in nature. I know that many Russian laws were adopted to suit specific political groups, to suit whichever faction was on top. Laws were adopted for the benefit of specific individuals or to spite specific individuals. This is the personification of laws. The worst thing that happens with legislation is when laws are passed for transient political purposes. I hope that this Treaty on Public Accord will give us, legislators, an opportunity to produce laws which are acceptable to our people, so that these laws really are geared to the development of our state. We must all think first and foremost of our citizens. This Treaty will make it possible for legislators to become legislators in the true meaning of the word and to stop adopting laws amid political battles because we all have been elected by the people and whoever has been elected by the people, whatever political party, group, or public movement he belongs to, has been elected by the people and has the right to have his say by adopting a law while relying on his electorate. So, the historic nature of this document has many aspects. Perhaps it is difficult for us to appreciate this today, at the moment of signing. Only after some time has passed will people understand what accord Russia has attained today. And I hope that, although signed only for a period of two years, it will become the basis of accord in the Russian Federation in general, an accord to bring together our citizens, and to urge us toward integration and maximum possible rapprochement of what is today called the Commonwealth of Independent States. I would like to say again that I hope this document will become an historic one. Thank you.
