The economic, trade, sanitation, and academic agreements were signed in the Carondelet Palace, seat of the Ecuadoran Government, at the end of the Argentine president's official visit to Ecuador. Both presidents highlighted the excellent level of diplomatic relations between their countries during an act in which a consortium of Argentine banks granted funds to build three roads in the Amazon region. The governments established an agreement for reciprocal investment promotion and protection, which became effective immediately. They also agreed on the mutual recognition of academic grades, certificates, and titles. In a political declaration, Duran-Ballen and Menem highlighted increased bilateral links in all fields during the first official visit of an Argentine president to Quito. Both governments ratified their pledge to bolster and consolidate the democratic system in Latin America, defend human rights, and boost peace in the area. Both presidents spoke in favor of dialogue and the peaceful solution to territorial and political problems that involve Latin American countries. They reiterated their support and assistance to UN and OAS efforts to maintain world and regional peace. In a joint news conference, President Menem denied he intends to impose an economic model that "has been so successful for Argentina," but expressed his willingness to cooperate with other governments' modernization efforts. He also downplayed the "circumstantial" social outbreak his government had to face in Santiago del Estero, which he attributed to the "incapacity" and bad administration of local authorities. Menem and his retinue, about 30 people including officials, legislators, and businessmen, were seen off by Ecuadoran authorities at the Mariscal Sucre Air Force Base in Quito at 1530 (2030 GMT), bound to Cartagena, Colombia. The Argentine president will rest during the weekend at this beach resort, and on Monday he will begin his official visit to Colombia.
