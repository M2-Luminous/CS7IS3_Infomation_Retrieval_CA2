The document caused public excitement and prompted a torrent of articles in the newspapers, broadcast reports, and also statements by officials. The Russian Federation Committee for the Press officially warned OBSHCHAYA GAZETA (founder and chief editor Ye.V. Yakovlev) that "its actions are perceived as a deliberate step aimed at destabilizing society and undermining constitutional authority." The Appeal Court has started receiving requests from citizens and the media asking it to speak out on the publication of so-called "Scenario No. 1" in OBSHCHAYA GAZETA and assess whether it was, on the one hand, freedom of expression or, on the other hand, an abuse of mass media freedom. The Appeal Court examined the case of the publication of "Scenario No. 1" by OBSHCHAYA GAZETA and the subsequent items in various publications and statements by officials and saw fit to make the following statement: OBSHCHAYA GAZETA had rather substantial grounds for publishing "Scenario No. 1" of an alleged coup d'etat in preparation. The promulgation of this material was preceded by a statement by a number of well-known politicians concerning the threat of a "palace coup," to the effect that "signs of a coup are already in evidence" and that "analytical memoranda are circulating and various coup scenarios are being discussed." All this was causing agitation in society and giving rise to rumors and conjecture. It was in these conditions of social tension that the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA editorial board decided to publish "Scenario No. 1." The subsequent reaction shows that it did not destabilize society, but defused the political situation. Even supposing that actions were actually being prepared, they were prevented to some extent by the publication of the "Scenario." The world has known of cases where a leak of information has prevented state upheavals, while dismissal of information has resulted in tragedy. The Appeal Court believes that by publishing "Scenario No. 1" OBSHCHAYA GAZETA did not break the Law on the Mass Media. The newspaper was right to inform citizens of actions in the offing or of insinuations about such actions. Nor can the publication of "Scenario No. 1" be seen as sensation-seeking, whereby information authenticity would be sacrificed. An editorial note plainly states: "Most likely what we have here is an obvious hoax, a 'letter of incitement.'" In other words, the editorial board's attitude toward publication was a balanced one. This is also indicated by the unsensational way in which the material was presented. Criminal proceedings have been instituted over the publication and an investigation is in progress, the results of which are not yet known. So far it has not been established whether the "Scenario" is a letter of incitement or instance of political hooliganism, or if it has a real basis. Thus, the Appeal Court has refrained from drawing any hasty conclusions about the authenticity of the publication. In this connection, the Appeal Court also regards as premature certain assessments of the actions of the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA editorial board, and in particular the taking of administrative action against it.
