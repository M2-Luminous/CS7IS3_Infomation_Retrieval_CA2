Habibie on Wednesday [22 June] said he has a "clean and clear" conscience on his role in the Indonesian Government's controversial purchase of 39 warships and a related clampdown on the country's media. "I always can sleep because I have a very clean and clear conscience," Habibie told reporters at a press conference held on the last day of a visit to Japan that began June 12. The minister's remarks followed a government decision Tuesday to immediately revoke the licenses of three leading magazines -- DETIK, EDITOR and TEMPO -- for failing to heed previous warnings not to step out of line. Habibie, a close protege of President Suharto and potential successor, refuted remarks attributed to him that an article in TEMPO about the warship purchase left him unable to sleep for a full day and made him determined to make the magazine "sleep" for the rest of its life. "What a fantasy," he said. "That remark I have never given and I sleep very well any time if I need to sleep." The government's purchase of warships used by the former East Germany has been widely criticized as the warships are outdated. Finance Minister Mar'ie muhammad approved only part of the 1.1 billion dollars sought by Habibie for the purchase and local refit of the ships.
