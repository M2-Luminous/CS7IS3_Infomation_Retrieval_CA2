FBIS4-32374 "dreeu121__a94029" FBIS-EEU-94-121-A Daily Report 22 Jun 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Official Predicts EU Application in 1995 Official Predicts EU Application in 1995 AU2206213094 Prague CTK in English 1828 GMT 22 Jun 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2206213094 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Bratislava, June 22 (CTK) -- Slovakia will likely apply for European Union (EU) membership after the ratification of its association agreement with the EU by the parliaments of the "Twelve," State Secretary in the Slovak Foreign Ministry Lubor Bystricky told CTK today. "It can happen next year," he added. "However, when Slovakia applies for EU membership will depend primarily on the process of ratification of the association agreement by the individual [EU] states. Neither from the formal, nor from the political points of view would it be wise to jump the gun in this process. It could be perceived as an expression of unprofessional impatience," Bystricky said. "It would also be of no use to apply for membership only out of prestige," Bystricky said, referring to the necessity of adjusting Slovakia's norms to the EU ones. Bystricky said his comments did not refer to Hungary or Poland which have already applied for EU membership. He said he expected the association agreement to be ratified by the EU countries' parliaments by the end of this year, despite the fact that to date only Denmark, Great Britain and Portugal have done so. "Slovakia will apply for fully-fledged membership at the next EU Council session," Bystricky said, adding that it could achieve its goal "at the turn of the millennium." However, a necessary prerequisite for this to become reality is that "there are not any changes in the internal political development in the autumn parliamentary elections and that forces rejecting the "four European freedoms" -- freedom of movement for work force, capital, goods and services -- will not gain the upper hand, Bystricky said. Under the association agreement, conditions for their introduction must be created in Slovakia in ten years. He said that the measures like an import surcharge or certificates (on goods imported to Slovakia) do not run counter to the efforts at integration. "The government could not afford to introduce measures that would be at variance with the association agreement; the agreement provides for sanctions if this happened," Bystricky said. He also dismissed the suspicion of an alleged discrimination of Czech exporters, unlike EU exporters, and spoke in favor of as quick as possible conclusion of a Slovak-Czech agreement on mutual recognition of certificates on goods quality on the basis of EU norms.
