Birkavs considers it is time to launch economic ties between Latvia and Chile. The sides are unanimous it is of special importance to enhance trade between the two countries. Nowadays, the volume of goods imported from Latvia by Chile comprises only 4,000 lats.

Birkavs, in turn, proposed that work be started on providing the economic ties of both countries with a legal basis, reviewing agreements on investment protection and on avoiding double taxation. Latvia would be the first country to have an agreement with this South American country on avoiding double taxation.

Parra, in his turn, called the experts in forestry and sea economy of Latvia to join launching the projects dealing with the research carried out in these branches in Chile.
