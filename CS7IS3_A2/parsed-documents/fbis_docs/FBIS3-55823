Early in the morning of 13 January the president has a one-on-one meeting with B.N. Yeltsin in St. George's Hall, then a walk around the Kremlin in the company of the Russian president, talks, talks...and a meeting with the patriarch, and in the evening a trip to Ogarevo, where he will be given supper at Yeltsin's residence. In the morning of 14 January, after laying the traditional wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Clinton will set off for a far from traditional tripartite meeting. His interlocutors will be two presidents: the Russian and the Ukrainian, Leonid Kravchuk. By all appearances, without quoting anyone, from this meeting unexpectedly great things can be expected. Let us call it a "breakthrough" beforehand. So Ukraine will acquire nuclear-free status and become a nonnuclear state. That would seem well and truly to put an end to a highly complex problem which, it has now emerged, three countries have been working energetically and without publicity to resolve. No more sensations can really be expected. Except that we are all to have a personal meeting with Bill Clinton on "Ostankino" on 14 January at around 1530 (keep an eye on the TV schedules). The president, in his customary manner, will not address the audience of young people that has been assembled for him, but will conduct an easy and elegant Clintonian dialogue with them. And so the collection of documents that is customary in these cases will be adopted and signed. A declaration, known, naturally, as the "Moscow" declaration, is bound to be chief among them. Its most important component is that the two presidents signing it will note that relations between Russia and the United States have entered the stage of mature partnership. What else is there of interest in connection with the summit -- sorry, the official meeting? They will announce the demise of COCOM [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls], which will come to an end in March, and the formation of a new monitoring organization in its place, in which Russia's rights are admittedly not fully defined. Most likely the total sum of U.S. aid, or rather, assistance, will be $2 billion a year. Russia will presumably put forward an unusual initiative on the formation of joint armed forces with the States, under UN auspices. At least, this matter has apparently been agreed at the top Russian military level. On our part, we are prepared to assign the 27th Motorized Infantry Division, with the 3d Infantry Division on the U.S. side. And in conclusion, for those who were expecting political sensations in connection with the unexpected -- for the Americans -- outcome of our elections: Although Clinton's very busy schedule allows time for a few events that are not indicated in the program, the president certainly will not meet with Zhirinovskiy. The scene of departure from Moscow for Minsk will be played out at Vnukovo, at 1015 on 15 January.
