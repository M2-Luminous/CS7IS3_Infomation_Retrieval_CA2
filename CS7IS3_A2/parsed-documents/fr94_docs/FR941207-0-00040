FR941207-0-00040 FR941207-0-00005 The FAA estimates that 173 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, and that it will not take any additional work hours per engine to accomplish the required actions. Replacement parts, prorated for the reduced life, will cost approximately $1,718 per engine. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $297,214. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES .

Compliance : Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent a seventh stage high pressure compressor (HPC) disk burst due to cracking attributed to corrosion, which may result in an uncontained engine failure, accomplish the following: (a) For seventh stage HPC disks that on the effective date of this airworthiness directive (AD) exceed the revised cyclic life limits described in R&hyph;R Mandatory Service Bulletin (SB) Sp72&hyph;1034, Revision 1, dated May 1990, remove from service and replace with a serviceable part within 60 days after the effective date of this AD.

(c) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Engine Certification Office. The request should be forwarded through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Engine Certification Office. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative method of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Engine Certification Office.
