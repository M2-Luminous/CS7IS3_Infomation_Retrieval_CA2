The youngest regional premier, Dipico, 35, is described by colleagues as an extremely vibrant and hardworking leader who spends up to 7 days a week in the office. He endorses Afrikaans as an official language for the Northern Cape, and wants whites and their skills to play an important role in its new government and mining- and agriculture-based economy. In a region with a 70 per cent illiteracy rate and years of underdevelopment, Dipico faces massive challenges in education, healthcare and unemployment. A decision also has to be taken on whether to keep the capital in Kimberley or move it to Upington, understood to be the preference of strong lobbies within the National Party. Dipico is believed to favour Kimberley as the capital. Latest election results show the African National Congress is likely to win 15 seats, the NP [National Party] 12, Freedom Front two and Democratic Party one, observers said. Born the eldest of four children in Kimberley's Greenpoint township on 21 April 1959, Dipico was raised by his domestic servant mother and matriculated from the prestigious St Boniface School in 1979. An early job on a diamond mine ended when he was fired after a wage strike, and Dipico enrolled for a BA at Fort Hare University where he became involved in the Azanian Students Organisation [Azazo] and underground ANC structures. By 1984 he was local Azazo treasurer and the organisation's delegate to the border region United Democratic Front. His detention that year for involvement in anti-Ciskei activities saw him refused readmission to Fort Hare. He returned to Kimberly to become full-time regional organiser of the National Union of Mineworkers [NUM] and an integral figure in the Northern Cape United Democratic Front. The 1986 state of emergency saw him detained for five months, and in August 1987 he was jailed for five years for furthering the aims of the ANC. Released from jail in June 1990, Dipico returned to the NUM head office, later becoming head of the union's education department, a post he still holds today. In May 1991 he was elected secretary general of the Northern Cape ANC, becoming chairman in June the next year. A keen football administrator, Dipico enjoys table tennis and jogging. He plans to marry soon
