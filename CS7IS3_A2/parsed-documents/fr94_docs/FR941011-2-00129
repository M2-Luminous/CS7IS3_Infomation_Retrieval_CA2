FR941011-2-00129 FR941011-2-00084 In addition, the Commission believes that it is reasonable for the PHLX to amend Section 10&hyph;13 to eliminate the PHLX's Executive Vice President from membership on the Exchange's Executive Committee in order to allow the PHLX's management to be represented on the Executive Committee. Although the proposal also increases the minimum number of Board members who are required to be on the Executive Committee from three to four, the Commission does not believe this change should substantially affect the governance of the Exchange. 7 The Commission believes that the proposal should make the structure of the Executive Committee less cumbersome and help to streamline the Executive Committee's proceedings while preserving the participation of the PHLX's management on the Executive Committee. 7 In this context, the Commission notes that the PHLX's By-Laws already permit the appointment of more than three Board members to the Executive Committee. Nevertheless, as the Commission has noted in other contexts, the Commission would be concerned if the Executive Committee were dominated by floor interests. See e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 31633 (December 22, 1992), 57 FR 62402 (December 30, 1992) (order approving File Nos. MSE&hyph;92&hyph;12 and MSE&hyph;92&hyph;13) (amending Constitution of the Midwest Stock Exchange (``MSE'') to require that the MSE's Board of Governors consist of sixteen member Governors and eight non-member Governors, and revising the composition of the MSE's Nominating Committee and Executive Committee); and 22058 (May 21, 1985), 50 FR 23090 (May 30, 1985) (File Nos. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;84&hyph;15 and SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;84&hyph;16) (disapproving proposed rule change to increase the minimum number of floor directors on the Board of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (``CBOE'') and approving proposed rule change to provide for election of a floor member to be the CBOE's Executive Committee Chairman). It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 8 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;PHLX&hyph;94&hyph;36) is approved. 8 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988).
