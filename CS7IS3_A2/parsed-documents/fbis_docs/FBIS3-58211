The agreement, the terms of which he did not specify, would come about, when the time comes, within the framework of a conversation between the two top leaders, who in fact have an official meeting pending for which no date has been set, although it is forecast that it could be held from January onward. The case Jordi Pujol cited of a negotiation currently under way was the negotiation on the police force model, on the basis of the draft bill on the police approved by the [Catalan] government, which he discussed this week with government representative in Catalonia Miquel Solans and which he plans to discuss next week with Interior Minister Antoni Asuncion, who will be visiting Barcelona in order to meet with the Generalitat premier, "because the agreement reached with Jose Luis Corcuera in 1990 is exhausted and must quite naturally, of course, be reviewed." Nevertheless, Jordi Pujol stressed that contacts with ministers -- "not just in this case, but in all cases" -- are not enough to reach agreements. To achieve this, he must hold contacts with Felipe Gonzalez. In practical terms, this was a reminder that his sole interlocutor is the prime minister and that, as he himself has already hinted on previous occasions, their mutual relationship does not allow the existence of intermediaries. The Generalitat premier would not assess relations with the government within this framework, "because they are evolving, and static assessments cannot be made," although he specified that "the abolition of civil governors is badly blocked."
