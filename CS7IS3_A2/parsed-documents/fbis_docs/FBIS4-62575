As he said, relations between the two countries "entered the phase of close cooperation." "Considering Argentina's weight and influence in Latin America, cooperation with it is very important to us," Kozyrev said. Upon conclusion of their talks the two men signed a protocol on consultations between their ministries and an intergovernmental agreement on visa-free travel for the holders of diplomatic and service passports; they also initialled a basic political document on the fundamentals of relations between the Russian Federation and Argentina. "The documents we signed are the basis and at the same time only the tip of the iceberg of our close cooperation," Kozyrev said. According to him, relations between Moscow and Buenos Aires develop not only on bilateral foundations, but also on the "global level." "Argentina is a key state in Latin America, and at the moment we are engaged in active work on that continent, establishing cooperation with the Organization of American States and with regional economic structures," Kozyrev said. As he said, Russia is interested in promoting interaction with Buenos Aires also in the framework of the U.N., since at present Argentina is a non-permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. For his part Guido Di Tella pointed out that Argentina views Russia as a great world power. We closely follow what happens in Russia, and we believe that your reforms deserve great respect, he said. According to him, the two countries' stands on many international issues approximate or coincide. When discussing the problems of world security and the future world structure, we speak in one language of cooperation and mutual respect, he concluded. As the political adviser to the head of Russian diplomacy, Galina Sidorova, told journalists, during the talks with his Argentinian counterpart Kozyrev drew his attention to the incident involving the Russian fishing ship Orel detained by the Argentinian authorities since February, 1993. "Our ship was detained on the pretext that it was engaged in fishing in the Argentinian economic zone. We view this pretext as far-fetched, and hope that an acceptable solution to this issue will be found after all," Sidorova said.
