Almonte said a "building block" composed of government and private individuals from ASEAN and four Indo-China nations was formed to formulate goals and guidelines which will be presented to their respective heads of state for approval. He made the announcement during a dinner in honor of the Philippine National Police hosted by the host committee of the Miss Universe beauty pageant at the Shangri-La Hotel in Makati Saturday night. Almonte said the group formally met 30 and 31 May in Manila and another meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia last week. The group is composed of 21 government officials, politicians, diplomats, college professors and technocrats from the Philippines, Malaysia, Australia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Myanmar [Burma], Cambodia, Thailand and Laos. "The main goal of the group is to advise our respective governments on how to strive to become a major force in the Asia-Pacific region and later be worthy as a building block of a global community, Almonte said. He said the think tank that includes non-members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations will tackle not only regional security and economic development but also mutual respect for each country's internal affairs with respect to the dignity of every person. "The group envisions a regional community, not patterned after the European Economic Community, but a new model of international cooperation based on the principles of peace, prosperity and justice with respect to individual rights," Almonte said. Almonte said the members of the think tank include people with a common vision of a borderless Southeast Asia. He said one of the initial proposals of the group are the holding of a SEA Summit as soon as possible to decide formally on the projected creation of more cohesive SEA cooperation. Another proposed project is the creation of the SEA Development Corporation to boost economic development and management skills in the region.
