If the Chernomyrdin government decree is fulfilled prices for newspapers will increase substantially. Yesterday your PRAVDA correspondent got in touch with Ivan Laptev, president of the association of chief editors and publishers. "I should like to draw the attention of PRAVDA employees and readers," Ivan Dmitriyevich stated. "It is not a case of dependent or independent publications -- it was a case of the economic stifling of the entire press. And unless the president and government repeal decree no. 1233, then soon we shall have only memories of the press. Incidentally, I should like to note that the decision which has been taken discredits the new Constitution, especially article 29." For our readers' information. PRAVDA, like many other Russian newspapers, states its readiness also to suspend the production of its publication from 10 through 17 January in protest against one more government pogrom.
