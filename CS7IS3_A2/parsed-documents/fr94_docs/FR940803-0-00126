FR940803-0-00126 FR940803-0-00040 (2)(i) For specific labels for gasoline-fueled, diesel-fueled, alcohol-fueled, and natural gas-fueled automobiles, multiply the highway model type fuel economy value determined in §600.206 (a)(iii), by 0.78, rounding the product to the nearest whole mpg; or (ii) For specific labels for alcohol dual fuel and natural gas dual fuel automobiles: (A) Multiply the highway model type fuel economy calculated from the tests performed using gasoline or diesel test fuel as determined in §600.206 (a)(2)(iii) and (4)(i) by 0.78, rounding the product to the nearest whole mpg; and (B) Multiply the highway model type fuel economy calculated from the tests performed using alcohol or natural gas test fuel as determined in §600.206 (a)(2)(iii) and (4)(ii) by 0.78, rounding the product to the nearest whole mpg. (c) If the resulting city value determined in paragraph (a) of this section exceeds the resulting highway value determined in paragraph (b) of this section, the city value will be set equal to the highway value. (d) For the purposes of calculating the combined fuel economy for a model type, to be used in determining annual fuel costs under §600.307, the manufacturer shall (except as provided for in paragraph (d)(2) of this section): (1)(i) For gasoline-fueled, diesel-fueled, alcohol-fueled, and natural gas-fueled automobiles, harmonically average the unrounded city and highway values, determined in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(i), or (a)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(i) of this section weighted 0.55 and 0.45 respectively, and round to the nearest whole mpg. (An example of this calculation procedure appears in Appendix II of this part); or (ii) For alcohol dual fuel and natural gas dual fuel automobiles, harmonically average the unrounded city and highway values from the tests performed using gasoline or diesel test fuel as determined in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(1)(ii)(A), or (a)(2)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section. (2) If the resulting city value determined in paragraph (a) of this section exceeds the resulting highway value determined in paragraph (b) of this section, the combined fuel economy will be set equal to the highway value, rounded to the nearest whole mpg. Subpart D_[Amended] 20. A new §600.301&hyph;95 is added to subpart D to read as follows: §600.301&hyph;95 General applicability. (a) The provisions of this subpart are applicable to 1995 and later model year gasoline-fueled, diesel-fueled, alcohol-fueled, natural gas-fueled, alcohol dual fuel, and natural gas dual fuel automobiles. (b)(1) Manufacturers that produce only electric vehicles are exempt from the requirement of this subpart, except with regard to the requirements in those sections pertaining specifically to electric vehicles. (2) Manufacturers with worldwide production (excluding electric vehicle production) of less than 10,000 gasoline-fueled and/or diesel powered passenger automobiles and light trucks may optionally comply with the electric vehicle requirements in this subpart. 21. A new §600.307&hyph;95 is added to subpart D to read as follows: §600.307&hyph;95 Fuel economy label format requirements. (a)(1) Fuel economy labels must be: (i) Rectangular in shape with a minimum height of 4.5 inches (114 mm) and a minimum length of 7.0 inches (178 mm) as depicted in Appendix VIII of this part. (ii) Printed in a color which contrasts with the paper color. (iii) The label shall have a contrasting border at least 0.25 inches (6.4 mm) wide. (2) The top 50 percent of the total fuel economy label area shall contain only the following information and in the same format depicted in the label format in Appendix VIII of this part: (i) The titles ``CITY MPG'' and ``HIGHWAY MPG'', centered over the applicable fuel economy estimates, in bold caps 10 points in size. (ii)(A) For gasoline-fueled, diesel-fueled, alcohol-fueled, and natural gas-fueled automobiles, the city and highway fuel economy estimates calculated in accordance with §600.209 (a) and (b). (B) For alcohol dual fuel automobiles and natural gas dual fuel automobiles, the city and highway fuel economy estimates for operation on gasoline or diesel fuel as calculated in §600.209 (a)(1)(ii)(A) or (2)(ii)(A) and §600.209 (b)(1)(ii)(A) or (2)(ii)(A). (iii) The fuel pump logo. (iv) The phrase ``Compare this [vehicle/truck] to others in the FREE FUEL ECONOMY GUIDE available at the dealer,'' shall be ``dropped-out'' of the top border as depicted in the sample label format in Appendix VIII of this part. The phase shall be in lower case in a medium condensed type except for the words ``FREE FUEL ECONOMY GUIDE'' which shall be capitalized in a bold condensed type and no smaller than 12 points in size. (v)(A) For alcohol-fueled automobiles, the title ``(insert appropriate fuel (example ``METHANOL ``(M85))'')''. The title shall be positioned above the fuel pump logo and shall be in upper case in a bold condensed type and no smaller than 12 points in size. (B) For natural gas-fueled automobiles, the title ``NATURAL GAS*''. The title shall be positioned above the fuel pump logo and shall be in uppercase in a bold condensed type and no smaller than 12 points in size. (C) For alcohol dual fuel automobiles and natural gas dual fuel automobiles, the title ``DUAL FUEL*''. The title shall be positioned above the fuel pump logo and shall be in upper case in a bold condensed type and no smaller than 12 points in size. (vi)(A) For alcohol-fueled automobiles, the title ``(insert appropriate fuel (example ``M85''))'' centered above the title ``CITY MPG'' and above the title ``HIGHWAY MPG'' in bold caps 10 points in size. (B) For natural gas-fueled automobile, the title ``GASOLINE EQUIVALENT'' centered above the title ``CITY MPG'' and above the title ``HIGHWAY MPG'' in bold caps 10 points in size. (C) For alcohol dual fuel automobiles and natural gas dual fuel automobiles, the title ``GASOLINE'' centered above the title ``CITY MPG'' and above the title ``HIGHWAY MPG'' in bold caps 10 points in size. (3) The bottom 50 percent of the label shall contain the following information: (i) The [vehicle/truck] description, as described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, when applicable. (ii)(A) A statement: ``Actual mileage will vary with options, driving conditions, driving habits and [vehicle's/truck's] condition. Results reported to EPA indicate that the majority of [vehicles/trucks] with these estimates will achieve between XXX and XXX mpg in the city, and between XXX and XXX mpg on the highway.'' (B) The range values for this statement are to be calculated in accordance with the following:
