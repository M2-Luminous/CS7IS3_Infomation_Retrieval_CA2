"I came to China to try to ensure that the Chinese side understands the importance of human rights to the United States in connection with the most favored nation (MFN) treatment," Christopher told reporters after a final meeting with Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. The high-level talks have been marked by China's point-blank refusal to accept any linkage between human rights and trade. It regards calls for progress in human rights as interference in its internal affairs. The May 1993 executive order on China trade issued by U.S. President Bill Clinton has linked the renewal of MFN in June with "overall significant progress" on seven issues concerning human rights. Billions of dollars in trade is at stake. During his trip, Christopher received a dressing down from both President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng on China's inflexibility over human rights issues. They made clear that China is ready to go on without MFN. Despite the difficult meetings, Christopher characterized his final talk with Qian as better than before and listed five areas where China has promised to cooperate. The two sides signed a statement of cooperation specifying a method to form "concrete assurances" that China is complying to a 1992 agreement concerning prison labor and which was specified in the executive order. The Chinese side also agreed "to work to resolve the few remaining outstanding emigration matters," Christopher said. Implementation of the prison labor agreement and the emigration problems represent the "two measurable conditions" in Clinton's executive order. The remaining five are considered "nonmeasurable" and call for significant progress in areas including the release and accounting for political prisoners, humane prison treatment and protection of Tibetan religious and cultural traditions. Christopher said the Chinese side handed over a "detailed accounting" on 235 political prisoners and is preparing information on 106 Tibetan prisoners. China would also review interference in the broadcast signal of the Voice of America and will soon continue talks with the International Red Cross on prison visits while confirming its support of the UN Universal Declaration on Human Rights, he said. Christopher said he urged Chinese authorities to free political prisoners as well as begin dialogue with the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled religious leader. In a contrast characterizing the tone of the meetings, China's foreign minister chose several different areas of agreement as the main emphasis of the visit. Qian said the two sides agreed to continue high-level meetings with Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi. He said Song Jian, minister of the State Science and Technology Commission, will visit the U.S. in April. The U.S. agreed to continue its support for China's entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Qian said the two countries would hold bilateral meetings on defense conversion this spring. Qian also mentioned the statement on prison labor and said China had agreed to help the U.S. try and locate several soldiers believed to have gone missing in action during the Vietnam War. "I wouldn't describe it as a breakthrough," Christopher said. "It was a business-like and productive meeting, we began to narrow the differences." Christopher also met with the U.S. business community in Beijing Sunday morning, with businessmen overwhelmingly calling for the renewal of unconditional MFN. Tens of billions of dollars of bilateral trade are at stake if renewal is not granted. The visit began in a tense atmosphere as Chinese police rounded up several of China's best-known dissidents in an apparent attempt at prevent activists from contacting the secretary. Christopher was to fly to Vladisvostock Monday to meet Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev.
