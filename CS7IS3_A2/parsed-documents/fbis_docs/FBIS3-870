The minister discussed his visit in an interview with (Seraphin Byiringuru): [Begin Delcroix recording] First of all, I am here to visit the Belgian soldiers who are members of UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission to Rwanda]. I came here to encourage them. This is my first concern. Second, I am taking the opportunity of this first visit to make contacts with my colleagues -- my colleague at the Defense Ministry, my colleague at the Foreign Ministry -- and to see the president, to hold talks on the situation in the country. [passage omitted] You know that Rwanda is the only country with which we have very special military cooperation. We have maintained it. We had similar cooperation with other countries, but it was suspended. It continued with your country, and I am happy about this. I will try to continue with it over the coming months and years, but there must be conditions to help me convince our public opinion and my colleagues within the government that it is worth continuing. That is why it is really necessary for the situation to improve within the next few weeks. This is the message I also want to address to your people. [end recording]
