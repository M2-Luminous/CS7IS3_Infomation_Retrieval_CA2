FR940111-0-00004 FR940111-0-00001 In §253.2(e) of the proposed rule published on October 20, 1987 (52 FR 39158), the Department proposed to amend the FDPIR definition of ``Indian tribal household'' to give ITOs and State agencies the option to serve a household which lacks a member of a tribe they represent, but which includes a member of another recognized Indian tribe. All 16 comments received on this proposed change supported it. During its 1992 annual meeting, the National Association of Food Distribution Programs on Indian Reservations (NAFDPIR) also supported the proposal. In resolution 92&hyph;7, NAFDPIR supported the broadening of the current definition of ``Indian tribal household'' to include ``any household in which at least one household member is recognized as an Indian.'' NAFDPIR believes that all Native Americans in near areas should be eligible to participate regardless of their tribal affiliation as has always been the case in FDPIHO service areas. The language in the proposed rule addressing this issue is therefore implemented in this interim rule with two clarifications. First, the definition of ``Indian tribal household'' in §253.2(c) is revised by changing ``recognized by the appropriate ITO as a tribal member'' to ``recognized as a tribal member by any Indian tribe as defined in this part.'' This change in definition would make those households containing a member of an ``Indian tribe'' as defined in Section 253.2(d) eligible to apply for FDPIR without regard to whether the person is a member of a tribe represented by the ITO or State agency administering the program in the near area. Thus, based on the definition of ``Indian tribe,'' any household containing a person belonging to any Indian tribe, band, or other organized Indian group on a reservation which is recognized as eligible for Federal programs and services provided to Indians, or which holds a treaty with a State government, would be eligible to receive FDPIR benefits if he/she also meets the income eligibility requirements. This same amendment is made to the definition of ``Indian tribal household'' in §254.2(d) of the FDPIHO regulations. However, in the FDPIHO, income-eligible Native American households residing in any program service area in the State have always been permitted to participate regardless of their tribal affiliation. Therefore, this amendment as applied to FDPIHO constitutes a clarification only and not, as in the case of the FDPIR, a substantive change which affects program eligibility. Second, §253.6(b)(1) is changed to clarify that all households which pass the program means test, reside in near areas and include a Native American must be allowed to participate in the FDPIR, regardless of the Native American's specific tribal affiliation. Thus, if a household member can obtain documentation from his/her tribe of origin that he/she is recognized as a member of an ``Indian tribe'' as defined in §253.2(d), the ITO or State agency administering the program in the near area must accept that recognition for purposes of program eligibility. The ITO or State agency itself has no discretion to decide which tribes it will recognize in the near area. It should be pointed out that the ITO or State agency also has no discretion to decide issues of tribal membership since each Indian tribe has always been responsible for defining its own members. Thus, for eligibility purposes, the ITO or State agency simply makes a determination as to whether or not an applicant household has official documentation of membership from its tribe of origin. If the tribe of origin is an ``Indian tribe,'' as defined in §253.2(d), the ITO or State agency must serve the household as long as it meets all other FDPIR eligibility requirements. The October 20, 1987, proposed rule did not clearly propose to mandate that all households with Indian tribal members be eligible for program benefits in near areas. Rather, its thrust was to remove a regulatory barrier to participation of such households. Thus the language authorized ITOs and State agencies to serve such households. Upon further consideration of the issue, the Department has concluded that ITOs or State agencies themselves should not be in a position to impose barriers to participation based on the tribal affiliation of a member of a household residing in a near area. Therefore, this interim rule mandates that such households be served under the program if they are determined income-eligible, rather than permitting the administering agency to serve them at its discretion. Given the shift from allowing such households to be served in the proposed rule to mandating that they be served, the Department is publishing this rule as an interim regulation with provision for public comment.
