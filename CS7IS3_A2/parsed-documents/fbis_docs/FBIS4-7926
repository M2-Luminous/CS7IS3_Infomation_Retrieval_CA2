The total sum paid out in compensation exceeds 2.7 billion korunas ($90 million), he said. Over a billion of this sum was paid in cash, the remainder in the form of government bonds. The "overwhelming majority" of applications have been processed now, he said, with only cases complicated by the destruction of archive material still remaining. These outstanding 4,800 requests should be solved by the end of the year, he said. Klaus said the cabinet and Justice Minister Jiri Novak in particular had often in the past been criticized for the slow pace of the rehabilitation process. He said he would welcome it if critics took a look at the "figure of 218,000 solved rehabilitations." Novak's approach had, on the contrary, considerably speeded up the whole process, he said, adding that on completing the process the courts would be relieved of a great burden and would be able to devote themselves to usual matters.
