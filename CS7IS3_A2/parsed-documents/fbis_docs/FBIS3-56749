That was declared in an interview with INTERFAX by Mikhail Gorbachev, the ex-Soviet president. In his opinion, no one in the government is thinking about what should be done next to advance the country, and for this reason "we are doomed to political and economic drifting with all the ensuing consequences." He warned that if the country's leaders "disregarded the popular mood, Russia would surely get into new serious political troubles with adverse social effects." However, he spoke out against returning the country to the old system. In his words, the course towards a market economy should be continued but substantially corrected. He suggested for one that market relations should be intensified at the small and medium business level and urged passing tough anti-monopoly legislation. "But there is nothing more important than to teach people how to live under market conditions, otherwise transition to a market economy will be violent," Gorbachev stressed.
