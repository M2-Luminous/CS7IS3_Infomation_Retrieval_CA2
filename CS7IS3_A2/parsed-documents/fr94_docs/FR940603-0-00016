FR940603-0-00016 FR940603-0-00010 5. K.A.R. 47&hyph;6&hyph;2(d) and (d)(3), Permit Revisions Kansas proposes to modify K.A.R. 47&hyph;6&hyph;2(d) and (d)(3) by adding the word ``significant'' so that the rules would read: (d) No application for a signficant revision shall be approved unless the applicant demonstrates and the regulatory authority finds that: (1) the reclamation required by the state act and the regulatory program can be accomplished; (2) applicable requirements under K.A.R. 47&hyph;3&hyph;42(a)(43) pertinent to the revision are met; and (3) the application for a significant revision complies with all requirements of the state act and the regulatory program. Prior to the proposed amendments, the State provisions at K.A.R. 47&hyph;6&hyph;2(d) and (d)(3) were substantively similar to the counterpart Federal regulation at 30 CFR 774.13(c). The proposed revisions at K.A.R. 47&hyph;6&hyph;2&hyph;(d) and (d)(3) render the State provisions less effective in meeting SMCRA's requirements than the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 774.13(c) because, as revised, the State provisions would apply the approval criteria of K.A.R. 47&hyph;6&hyph;2(d) only to significant permit revisions. In contrast, the Federal regulations require that such approval criteria apply to all permit revisions. Therefore, the Director finds Kansas' proposed revisions at K.A.R. 47&hyph;6&hyph;2(d) and (d)(3) to be less effective in meeting SMCRA's requirements than the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 774.13(c) and is not approving it. 6. K.A.R. 47&hyph;9&hyph;1(c)(43) Revegetation: Standards for Success, Surface Mining Activities, and K.A.R. 47&hyph;9&hyph;1(d)(39) Revegetation: Standards for Success, Underground Mining Activities Kansas proposes to add a subsection (3) to 30 CFR 816/817.116(A) that would read: (3) Data being used for bond release will be submitted to the surface mining section annually. This includes data for the last augmented seeding which will start the extended liability period. The following timetable for submissions shall be followed: (i) The planting reports including soil tests shall be submitted by March 31 of the year following the year in which they were performed. (ii) The production and ground cover data shall be submitted within 30 days of the date they were sampled. Ground cover must include species identification. Raw field data may be submitted at this time to fulfill this requirement. The tabulated results will then be submitted by March 31 of the following year. (iii) All data must be clearly identified as to the bond release management area that it represents. While the Federal regulations do not provide similar detailed requirements regarding submission of data used for bond release, as the above-quoted proposed Kansas provision, in accordance with section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b), the State regulatory authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on surface coal mining and reclamation operations that are more stringent than those imposed under SMCRA and the Federal regulations. Moreover, the State regulatory authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on surface coal mining and reclamation operations for which no Federal counterpart exists. Section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11 dictate that such State provisions shall not be construed to be inconsistent with the Federal program. Therefore, the Director is approving Kansas' proposed revisions at K.A.R. 47&hyph;9&hyph;1(c)(43) and 47&hyph;9&hyph;1(d)(39). 7. K.A.R. 47&hyph;9&hyph;1(f)(2). Special Permanent Program Performance Standards_Operations on Prime Farmlands Kansas proposes to adopt by reference the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 823.11, including 30 CFR 823.11(a) that addresses exemptions to prime farmland performance standards and which was previously deleted from the Kansas program. Kansas expressed its desire to readopt 30 CFR 823.11(a) in its letter dated March 10, 1994.
