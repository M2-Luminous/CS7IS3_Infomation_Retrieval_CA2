Today is "World No-Tobacco Day", on which who annually awards individuals and units which have made contributions to smoking control. The Chinese Association on Smoking and Health has made great efforts to institute smoking controls since it was established in 1990, said an official from the Ministry of Public Health. So far, 26 provincial associations on smoking and health and over 300 basic organizations for smoking control have been set up in the country. The Health Bureau of Jishan County of Shanxi Province has made remarkable achievements in smoking behavior intervention among farmers. It is trying to transform local custom through health education and formulating the villagers' pledge which advocates the good habit of "not offering cigarettes to guests in public places and at social activities." As a result, the smoking rate has dropped by six percent in the pilot villages of Jishan. Chen Minzhang, minister of public health, said at the awards ceremony that the Chinese Government has paid much attention to tobacco control and actively supported China's bid for the 10th World Conference on Tobacco or Health. "I believe that success in our bid for the conference would lead to far-reaching influences upon tobacco control in China," said Chen.
