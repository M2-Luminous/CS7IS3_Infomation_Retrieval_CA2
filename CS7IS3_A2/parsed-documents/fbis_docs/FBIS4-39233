IF: The media carry much information about the possible settlement of relationships between Russia and Chechnya. Some Chechen politicians even began to flare up passions speaking about the possible "local nuclear explosion" in Chechnya, allegedly organized by the Russian side. What is behind the incessant political interest and the hysteria of the "official Grozny" in connection of the current bilateral talks? SHAKHRAY: There are at least three reasons. The first reason is in the political course of the official Chechen leadership aimed at the republic's economic self-isolation. The result is that today all political forces in the republic are facing the need to find prompt solutions to pull the republic out of the economic crisis. The second reason is the uncontrolled growth of crime and the danger to people's security. The third reason is in the growing political competition inside the republic among several political figures. Also troublesome is the threat of smuggling fire arms and drugs and uncontrolled duty-free cargo transportation. The growing crime in the Chechen republic prevents from the safety of cargoes which pass along the republic. This forces the Russian Government to think about the construction of a 68-kilometer railway section which will go round the Chechen republic. The destruction of "fuel arteries", the violation of activities of the republic's oil-processing complex, the losses sustained by the republic's neighbors make the Russian government to boost the construction of an oil-processing factory in Daghestan. In addition, numerous "shuttle" flights of the Chechen planes to Turkey, the Middle East and other regions, which are violating international safety flight norms have put under threat the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, who are forced to earn their living by going abroad and buying goods there to sell them in their country. The Russian Federation receives notes of protest from foreign countries which say about the violation of the international norms of flight safety. The unsettled economic contacts between Chechnya and the Russian Federation, without any artificial blockades and sanctions, lead to the economic self-isolation of the Chechen Republic. Representatives of the financial and industrial quarters of the Chechen Republic will hardly see what is going on without taking appropriate measures. This forces both sides to look for the way out of the deadlock. IF: It was reported earlier that the Russian government is concerned over the situation in terms of pensions payment to the people living in the Chechen Republic. SHAKHRAY: Unfortunately, the non-payment of pensions to the people who earned them by their hard work, is a common practice in the Chechen Republic. Given that the pensioners, the Chechens, the Russians, and Ingushis and other nationalities are not to blame for the non-payment, the Russian government decided to pay pensions to them. But there are no guarantees that common people will get them because the money may be plundered even before the distribution. IF: Will the signing of a bilateral agreement between the Chechen Republic and the Russian Federation be interpreted as the refusal of Chechnya from its course for independence and sovereignty? SHAKHRAY: Independence is to dispose freely and voluntarily of one's possibilities and resources. That is why the mutual delegation of powers is a practical form for the materialization of independence and sovereignty. And to settle economic problems and combat crime is the top priority issue. IF: It seems that the lack of settlement of the Chechen issue is also due to the difference in the approaches to the political framing of Russian-Chechen relations displayed by certain Russian leaders. SHAKHRAY: I do not understand from what angle this issue can be discussed. Politically, the issue has been solved. The president's message to the parliament clearly said that the talks could be based on free elections in Chechnya and negotiations on power-sharing with the federal bodies. The State Duma has stated an analogous position. The formula on free elections is not an ultimatum or a pre-condition. This is a question of legalization of the reached agreements and of the package of economic agreements with no preliminary specific term for the elections must be set. This is not at all a question of political situation or one's personal predilections. That is why today discussion between the federal powers on this subject will be out of place. IF: How are the bilateral talks between the Russian and the Chechen power bodies going now? SHAKHRAY: Currently, there are consultations in the Russian government. The ministries and departments concerned and the governmental commission which I head are working on economic and juridical matters related to all the issues. This must result in a draft bilateral treaty and a package of necessary economic agreements. IF: Is it possible that President Yeltsin and President Dudayev will have a personal meeting within the scope of the talks? SHAKHRAY: The Chechen president has repeatedly addressed the Russian president asking for a personal meeting and for discussion of the problems concerning settlement of the conflict. If properly prepared for, such a meeting can play an important role. IF: Certain experts consider it quite possible that two well known Chechen politicians -- Dzhokhar Dudayev and Ruslan Khasbulatov will agree on division of "spheres of influence" in domestic political affairs. Will this have an impact on the position of the federal power towards Chechnya? SHAKHRAY: It may happen that Ruslan Khasbulatov and Dzhokhar Dudayev agree on a formula in accordance with which Dudayev will sign an agreement with Russia and elections to the Federation Council will be held on its basis. In this case there would be no reasons for doubting Khasbulatov's victory. It can be prognosticated that then the interests of the two politicians will really be placed to different spheres. [IF Note: The Chechen authorities deprived Russian Supreme Soviet ex-speaker Khasbulatov of the right for living on Chechen territory. The government, the parliament and the Security Council held a joint meeting on Sunday and decided to put an end to illegal activities of some Chechen opposition leaders by the same way. Among those accused of activities against the Chechen people and of a plot with Russian imperial forces, there were mentioned: Doku Zavgayev (the last Chechen-Ingush Communist leader currently living in Moscow) and Yaragi Mamadayev who leads the government of people's confidence which he had established himself.] SHAKHRAY: One point is obvious -- only that Chechen politician will be capable of ensuring his political future and do good to his people, who will hold talks and normalize relations with Russia. Specific names or family names do not matter. The reality is that innocent people, numerous refugees fled from their houses are suffering. Only gradual, careful and attentive work during negotiations will help to resolve this problem. Consultations between the federal power and Chechen different political forces will help to consolidate the society within the Chechen Republic. All Chechen politicians will soon ascertain that the subject of the talks -- the economic issues and struggle with crime -- is important for different political groups. The main point is that they be guided just by one aspiration -- to do good to their people. That is why the role of Chechnya's neighbors, kind peace Caucasian traditions is of importance. Everyone will have some work to do. We must try to compensate our lost urgently, to restore the broken relations, to bring people back to their houses and to halt growing crime.
