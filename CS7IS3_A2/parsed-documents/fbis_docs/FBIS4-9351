Such a policy only postpones a just solution to the lengthy crisis and widens the economic, social and cultural gap between the Balkans and the other parts of Europe thus providing a favourable terrain for longterm destabilization, Sainovic told today's session on the topic "Prospects for peace in the Balkans." Sainovic, who heads the Yugoslav delegation in Bucharest, said that the holding of the conference on the Yugoslav crisis depends on the fulfillment of three conditions: the equal treatment of all sides in the conflict, the abandoning of a policy of pressures and ultimatums, and the lifting of the sanctions against Yugoslavia. Sainovic recalled that the international sanctions against Yugoslavia, the first against a European country, represent the collective punishment of the entire population of a country and threaten some 60 [?million] refugees, of which 300,000 are children, and who found sanctuary in Yugoslavia. An enture nation has been denied the elementary and civilization rights: the right to health, education, culture, the freedom of movement and travel, and even the right to life, Sainovic said. The imposition of the sanctions against Yugoslavia only, represents the implementation of a policy of double standards which has no basis in democratic principles and can only be explained by the interests and revanschism of certain powers and states who have always had certain historic aspirations towards the Balkans, Sainovic said. The Balkans have dramatically been pushed into the spotlight of world public opinion and have become the stage for new divisions reflected in the disintegration of the former yugoslavia and the civil war in its territory, he said. Internal antagonisms and the in-advance prepared secessionist forces saw their chance in the changes in the balance of power in Europe and carried out the violent secession from an internationally recognized state and the founder of all major institutions of the international order, Sainovic said. The existing constitutional order has been disrupted, the universal principles of the Helsinki CSCE process violated and the rights of peoples who voted for the continuity of a joint state ignored, the Yugoslav vice-prime minister said. At this year's meeting of the Crans Montana forum, attended by some 1,000 prominent world figures, the Yugoslav delegation also includes Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic and Serbian Minister Without Protfolio Dragan Tomic.
