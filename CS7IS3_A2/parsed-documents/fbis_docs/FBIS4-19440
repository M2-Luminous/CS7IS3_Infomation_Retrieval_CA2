Dr. Mock, I do not think I need to emphasize that this is a bitter time for anyone trying to mediate and advocate principles of humanity and peace in this war [in Bosnia-Herzegovina]. After what happened in Gorazde, is there still a way out? [Mock] One must never stop searching for new ways in such tragedies, especially since there have always been proposals for a different course. Your U.S. correspondent quite rightly said that this is aggression constantly yiedled to, soemthing openly stated in mid-April of 1992 by CSCE. Why should the aggressor give up, withdraw, or keep his promise if he keeps getting accepted and his breach of promise is rewarded with new negotiations? I think you have to realize that the way to deal with an aggressor -- and we think we have learned something from World War II -- is to take diplomatic measures first, political means. But then, "all means," as the United Nations Charter says, including military means, should be adopted. In this case, it happened the other way around: Those against whom the aggression was directed -- originally the Slovenes, Croats, and Bosnians -- were deprived of the possibility to defend themselves by the arms embargo. This is against the UN Charter. The UN Charter clearly says that the entire community of states is to help fight aggression and that no one can be forced to enter a war. If this is not possible, then every nation has the right to defend itself. These nations were deprived of this right. Now we are paying the price with new casualties, new refugees, and a complete derogation of principles. I must say that this also involves risking the reputation the United States has acquired with special envoy Charles Redman and his mediating between the Croats and Bosnians being strained and lost soon. [Hochner] What could the next step be? One possibility would be -- and this does not seem very likely -- that NATO and the United States suddenly resort to military severity and bomb the Serbs back to the negotiating table. This will not happen. The second possibility is that the United Nations deploys an adequate number of combat forces to the country with a combat mission -- that it has not got yet -- in order to intervene on the Muslim side. This will not happen either. What is still possible in this difficult situation? [Mock] Even at the risk of repeating myself: I have never considered general invasion and intervention possible. We have thought -- and therefore it also comes as a disappointment to us -- that if a city is declared a security zone, military intervention can become necessary to protect this security zone. Why is Sarajevo a functioning security zone now, more or less the first time in two years? Because the threat of military strikes was meant seriously. I think that Sarajevo will be endangered again as of tomorrow. [Hochner] The United Nations not only declared Sarajevo a security zone, but also towns such as Tuzla, Srebrenica, and Gorazde. Was it not politically naive to think that the Serbs, who want to have a compact whole territory for the future Serbia in Bosnia, will tolerate Muslim enclaves in the middle of their territory? [Mock] I do not think this was naive, because we have seen that it works. Austria was the first country to propose security zones in the Security Council -- Bihac, Gorazde, Sarajevo, Tuzla, and Travnik. We used the security zone for the Kurds in northern Iraq as a model. Saddam Husayn has accepted this. How would the United Nations have known that the opponents in this war -- the Serbs -- would be even worse than Saddam Husayn? I think that was a realistic assumption. But it has never been handled with consistency. One resolution after the other was adopted; there are five Security Council resolutions saying that if humanitarian aid is obstructed, it can be protected by military means. There is a Security Council resolution saying that if a security zone is attacked, it can be defended by military means. Why should the aggressor think that any of this is true if there are never any consequences taken? In the cases where there were consequences, like in Sarajevo, these have had an effect. These consequences would be more effective today since even Vitaliy Churkin and Andrey Kozyrev are saying very clearly -- and this must be mentioned in acknowledgment of Russian policy -- that the way the aggressor is acting is irresponsible. [Hochner] You said there were consequences in the case of Sarajevo. There have been consequences in Gorazde as well -- two very limited and not very successful attacks. Does this not mean that an attack by NATO, if it is carried out, must be much more massive, more carefully directed, and more successful to achieve the consequences you have been talking about? [Mock] Yes, of course. If your house is attacked by criminals and the police come along, they cannot ask: Will one or two policemen be enough? They have the responsibility to provide adequate police protection that not only protects citizens from criminals but also protects the policemen themselves. [Hochner] The UN secretary general says this confusion is the superpowers' fault, the Americans say the Europeans are to blame, the Europeans say it is the European Union, and the European Union says it is the United Nations. Should not all these responsibilities be taken together and one organization or one group of states be given the right to decide in order to enable decisions -- if they are taken -- to be realized quickly and consistently? [Mock] This is right. I think the United Nations has enormous weaknesses, which I have frequently mentioned. But you must not forget that in spite of these difficulties, the United Nations has saved the lives of thousands of people. But the United Nations is only as strong as the major countries behind it, especially in the Security Council. The ultimate responsibility always lies with these countries. [Hochner] Thank you very much for the interview.
