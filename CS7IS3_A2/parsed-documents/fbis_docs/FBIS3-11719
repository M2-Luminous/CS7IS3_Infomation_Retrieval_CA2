Speaking in San Vicente de Chucuri, Samper said he responded to his advisers' suggestion that he not visit this conflictive municipality by saying he would "prefer to renounce his candidacy" rather than refrain from visiting a particular area. Samper said "not one inch of ground" will be relinquished to those who perpetrate violence, according to EL TIEMPO. During a campaign stop in Bucaramanga, the capital of Santander, Samper discussed his social policy emphasizing that "without jobs, there can be no peace." According to EL TIEMPO, the candidate's social program will focus on jobs, housing, and the problems facing Colombian women. Samper described this policy as the second phase of the "apertura" [economic liberalization] program, saying that up to now the model has been "incomplete" because "the focus has been on economic reform, and people have been forgotten." Samper said: "During the past five years an additional 2.5 million poor have appeared in Colombia. For this reason I've said it's now time to give `apertura' a heart because there is a direct relationship between social conditions and the prevailing violence," according to EL TIEMPO. Samper repeated his promise to generate 1.5 million jobs and said he would accomplish this by promoting recovery of the agricultural sector, stimulating exports, restructuring industry, assisting very small business, making housing available, and implementing social programs. He also emphasized that women would receive more recognition in a future Samper administration. He reportedly said that, if he is elected, women would be better represented at the decision-making level of government, more attention would be given to the needs of poor women, and that mechanisms would be introduced to help working mothers.

He invited all members of Congress to join him in promising "to be vigilant in the proper management of public funds." Samper promised to "protect and promote respect for the rights" of the country's 8 million blacks. Noting that the department is rich in terms of natural resources and biodiversity, Samper said he would like to see a center for the study of biodiversity established there.

In Bogota, Samper addressed businessmen at a forum organized by his campaign and offered a three-pronged approach to developing the telecommunications sector. His program consists in supporting incipient regional enterprises, increasing cooperation between public and private sectors, and developing human resources. Samper said national and international telephone communications systems must be modernized, and declared that he favors restructuring the National Telecommunications Enterprise (Telecom) and giving it greater autonomy. Samper stated that he would promote development of the nascent software industry through the creation of free-trade zones for technology and by making credit more accessible. During a later address to members of several business associations in Cali, the candidate reportedly warned that, if the current exchange rate policy continues, in five years the only thing the country will be able to export will be petroleum. Samper predicted that his administration would be able to generate 350,000 jobs in small and medium enterprises and said he will make it easier for small business to obtain credit. In addition to Bogota and Cali, Samper visited Medellin, Cucuta, Barranquilla, Pereira, Valledupur, and several smaller cities.

The recommendations, contained in a report presented to Turbay, reportedly stated that adjustments in macroeconomic policy and the "apertura" program must be made. According to the report, the exchange rate policy, which was initially aimed at fighting inflation, has had a negative impact on the agricultural sector by favoring imports over domestic products. The report recommended incentives and subsidies for certain producers selected on the "basis of efficiency and social equality." It further recommended providing facilities to provide cold storage during shipping from collection points to domestic and foreign ports. The commission report also stated that fixing tariffs on agricultural imports is in line with the constitutional mandate to provide adequate protection to domestic food production.

Among the projects directly benefiting the people of Cauca would be the construction of a highway from Popayan to the sea which would facilitate export of the department's agricultural produce within the framework of the "apertura" program. Pastrana also said preliminary studies on the feasilibity of building a hydroelectric plant in Micay looked favorable. The candidate also pledged that a future Pastrana administration would promote the interests of children, women, and the family. He said he would decentralize the Family Welfare Institute so that it could obtain the necessary resources. Pastrana also said he would promote public housing and expand food programs aimed at children in the poorest regions of the country. He also promised to promote equal rights for women, saying that while the situation has improved, there is still "much discrimination." Pastrana was scheduled to visit Valle and Huila Departments after completing his tour of Cauca. During later campaign stops in Cesar and La Guajira Departments, Pastrana said he is willing to conduct a dialogue with the guerrillas when they show a real desire for peace, but until then, the Armed Forces and the police must be strengthened so they can protect Colombians as the Constitution requires. Touching on the controversy surrounding accusations by Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff that Colombian bishops have had unauthorized contacts with the country's insurgents, Pastrana noted that the bishops are protected by an internationally recognized agreement which includes restrictions on investigating and prosecuting members of the church hierarchy. Pastrana said he favors constructing irrigation systems to restore productivity to 25,000 hectares of land in several La Guajira municipalities.

In his address, Pastrana reportedly asked all Latin American countries and the entire international community to take up the fight against corruption "immediately and with all possible force." Pastrana reportedly said this was the only way to prevent the destruction of the democratic system. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL ESPECTADOR 2 Mar 94 p 6A; 3 Mar p 5A)
