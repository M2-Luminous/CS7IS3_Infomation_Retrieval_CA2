In a press conference at the social service hall of Sungsil University, Chonnodae leaders said that if their demand goes unheeded, the unions of about 100 industries would go on general strikes beginning next Monday. The strikes will begin at some 30 firms including Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. and Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Machinery Co. where unionists have already voted for strikes. The Chonnodae leaders claimed that the use of police force against the striking train operators early Friday morning was "an express illegal action." They then demanded the immediate resignation of Home Minister Choe Hyong-u, release of arrested train operators and recognition of Train Operators Union (Chonkihyop) as an official dialogue conduit. The Train Operators Union (Chonkihyop), too, vowed on Friday to carry on their strike unless the police release all the persons arrested and apologize for use of police force against their striking unionists. Choe Chi-hwan of the union told reporters at the Christian Hall at Yonji-tong that his union, however, asked the Korean National Council of Churches (KNCC) to mediate between them and the government based on their demands. Meanwhile, the Seoul Subway Corp. reacted furiously against subway workers' strike on Friday, suing 41 unionists actively involved on charges of violating the law on labor disputes. The Corp. also relieved 24 leading union officials of their duties. Corp. President Han Chin-hi warned that striking workers should report to work by 11 A.M. Saturday or face disciplinary actions including dismissal.
