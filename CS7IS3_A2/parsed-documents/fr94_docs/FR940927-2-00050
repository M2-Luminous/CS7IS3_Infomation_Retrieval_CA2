FR940927-2-00050 FR940927-2-00036 INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION [Docket No. AB&hyph;103 (Sub-No. 8X)] The Kansas City Southern Railway Company_Abandonment Exemption_In Le Flore and Haskell Counties, OK The Kansas City Southern Railway Company (KCS) has filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR 1152 Subpart F_ Exempt Abandonments to abandon two intersecting rail lines totaling approximately 29.65 miles in Le Flore and Haskell Counties, OK, as follows: (1) approximately 9.50 miles of the Midland Valley Branch extending between the point of connection with KCS's main line at milepost 20.80 in Panama and milepost 30.30 near Bokoshe; and (2) approximately 20.15 miles of the Fort Smith and Van Buren Railway Company line extending between the point of connection with KCS's main line at milepost 20.12 in Coal Creek, and the end of the line at milepost 40.27 in McCurtain. 1 1 KCS was authorized to acquire The Fort Smith and Van Buren Railway Company (FSVB) in 1939 in Finance Docket No. 12475. FSVB no longer exists as a separate legal entity; it was merged into KCS on July 6, 1992. KCS has certified that: (1) no local traffic has moved over the lines for at least 2 years; (2) overhead traffic has been rerouted; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the lines (or a State or local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the lines either is pending with the Commission or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and (4) the requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7 (service of environmental report on agencies), 49 CFR 1105.8 (service of historic report on State Historic Preservation Officer), 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication), and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (service of verified notice on governmental agencies) have been met. 2 2 This notice has been delayed to allow KCS to comply with the filing requirements of 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1), to clarify the status of FSVB, and to confirm that the proposed transaction is abandonment and not merely service discontinuance. As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee affected by the abandonment shall be protected under Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen , 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption will be effective on October 27, 1994 (unless stayed pending reconsideration). Petitions to stay that do not involve environmental issues, 3 formal expressions of intent to file OFAs under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2), 4 and trail use/rail banking statements under 49 CFR 1152.29 must be filed by October 17, 1994. 5 Petitions to reopen or requests for public use conditions under 49 CFR 1152.28 must be filed by October 27, 1994, with: Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. 3 A stay will be issued routinely by the Commission in those proceedings where an informed decision on environ-mental issues (whether raised by a party or by the Section of Environmental Analysis in its independent investigation) cannot be made prior to the effective date of the notice of exemption. See Exemption of Out-of-Service Rail Lines , 5 I.C.C.2d 377 (1989). Any entity seeking a stay based on environmental concerns should file its request as soon as possible to permit Commission review and action before the exemption's effective date. 4 See Exempt. of Rail Abandonment_Offers of Finan. Assist ., 4 I.C.C.2d 164 (1987). 5 The Commission will accept late-filed trail use statements so long as it retains jurisdiction.
