Admiral Limberis is the head of a Greek military delegation which is on an official visit here at the invitation of General Petrov. A diplomatic settlement of the Yugocrisis is the most effective one, Admiral Limberis said. The two countries share the view that all Balkan countries should refrain from military intervention in the conflict, such intervention would be against the interests of the region, he said. The signing of the programme comes as proof of the excellent state of Bulgarian-Greek relations in the military area, Admiral Limberis said after the ceremony. The document opens up new prospects for broader cooperation, which would be to the mutual benefit, he added. Now that Bulgaria has signed the Partnership for Peace plan, there is one more challenge and reason for cooperation, he said. The programme envisages that joint exercises will have a new content, including purely peacetime and rescue operations, the guest said. The expansion of cooperation will serve the cause of peace, Admiral Limberis stressed. From this corner of Europe, Bulgaria and Greece are sending a message for peace dialogue, if the climate created by them spreads to the other Balkan countries, it would be very much for the good of the Balkan nations, Admiral Limberis said. The 1994 joint action plan is fully consistent with previous documents on friendship and cooperation between Bulgaria and Greece, as well as with the military agreement signed by the two Defence Ministers, General Lyuben Petrov said after the signing of the programme. Military contacts between Bulgaria and Greece after the fall of the totalitarian regime in this country in 1989 have been regulated by a cooperation agreement between the two Defence Ministries signed in Athens in 1991. Greece was the first NATO member with which Bulgaria signed a document on military cooperation. The new programme is also consistent with the documents of 1992 and 1993 adding new confidence and security-building measures to those envisaged in the Vienna Document of 1992, it is also consistent with NATO's Partnership for Peace plan, General Petrov said. The programme will undoubtedly be implemented and will promote security along the Bulgarian-Greek border, as well as stability in the region as a whole, General Petrov said. Work on programmes for cooperation between the Defence Ministries of Bulgaria and Greece began in 1992, the press learned from Lieutenant-Colonel Stefanov, head of the Information and Military Contacts Department of the Office of the Chief of the Bulgarian General Staff. This is the third document, it is of a practice-oriented nature. The training of Bulgarian Air Force pilots in Greece for rescue operations at sea, which started three years ago, is a priority for Bulgaria. Contacts in different areas have developed. Military units have exchanged visits. There is steady cooperation in military training. Bulgarian experts have been training Greek military officers and noncommissioned officers to operate the Osa missile system and BMP-1 armoured personnel carriers handed over by the army of what was formerly East Germany, said Lieutenant-General Stefanov.
