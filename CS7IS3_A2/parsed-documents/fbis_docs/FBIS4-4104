Prior to this, Sichuan Province has on two occasions promoted the sale of a number of enterprises suffering serious deficits with poor economic results to investors outside the border. This time, Sichuan plans to offer its resources, and markets as well, so that the state-owned enterprises to be sold will yield sound economic results and good returns for investors. In his briefing at a news conference at an international symposium on Sichuan's opening up to the outside world and talks on investment, Vice Governor Diao Jinxiang said that there were 33 state-owned enterprises covering an area of 10 million square meters, with fixed assets originally valued at some 3.6 billion yuan, a net value of some 2.4 billion yuan, and 77,000 staff and workers. Large and medium-sized enterprises are included in these 32 state-owned enterprises. They are mainly distributed in Chengdu, Chongqing, Deyang, Mianyang, Leshan, Zigong, and Neijiang, where communications, transportation, and telecommunications are developed and which have a solid industrial foundation. They involve such areas as machinery, electronics, metallurgy, chemicals, building materials, pharmaceuticals, textiles, and light industry. Of these, 84.8 percent are profitable enterprises. Although the remainder have some difficulties at present, they have comparatively great potential for development and comparatively bright market prospects. At the symposium, some 10 or 15 key enterprises, the cream of the batch, with comparatively good conditions in various aspects will be selected for sale. While dealing with the way the sale of this batch of enterprises would be conducted, Diao Jinxiang said: Regarding the enterprises to be sold, foreign investors can purchase any of the enterprises in their entirety, or in part, or they can invest directly as shareholders. Five specific ways can be adopted, namely: first, selling both the enterprise's property and land-use rights, with local governments making arrangements for surplus workers and staffers; second, selling part of the enterprise's property and land-use rights based on the buyer's requirements; third, selling both the enterprise's property and land-use rights under the prerequisite that the buyer makes arrangements for the enterprise's original staff and worker; fourth, selling part of the enterprise's property and land-use rights under the prerequisite that the buyer makes arrangements for some of the enterprise's staff and workers; and fifth, transferring the state's shares and those of the legal person to a joint-stock company. The five ways mentioned above can be selected through specific negotiations based on the different circumstances of the enterprises.
