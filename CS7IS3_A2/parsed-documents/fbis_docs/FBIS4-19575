In a statement today, Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said that Greece rejects the idea of an international or CSCE committee on the issue. The government spokesman noted that Albania must prove on a day-to-day basis that it respects the rule of law, something which Greece proves every day. Venizelos said an example of Greek policy is that our country accepts Albanian illegal immigrants, even beyond its limits.
