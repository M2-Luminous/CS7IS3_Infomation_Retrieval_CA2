By the end of this March, export volume of the whole province reached approximately $25 million, which accounted for 23.65 percent of the total export volume for the whole year, and registered an increase of 30.25 percent over the same period last year. This year the provincial economic and foreign trade department and various specialized companies have firmly grasped the fine opportunity of speeding up the pace of transforming operational mechanisms, unifying foreign exchange rates, and abolishing foreign trade enterprises' task of turning over foreign exchange to the state, to solve new problems arising in the foreign trade system through deepening reforms. They have also overcome various unfavorable factors such as an insufficient supply of goods and increases in export costs and loan interest rates. They have devoted their main efforts to tapping internal potential and enhancing economic efficiency. [passage omitted]
