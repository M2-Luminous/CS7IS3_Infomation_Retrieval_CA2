Sales of the wagon-type light car "Wagon R" are favorable and they are making a good showing with a contemptuous glance at the sluggishness of major auto manufacturers such as Toyota Motor and Nissan Motor. Behind their all-of-a-sudden "small but shining" existence since the burst of the bubble is the "Suzuki-style" management strategy which has abandoned haphazard obsession with technology and promoted thorough cost reductions (Tsuguaki Seki, Hamamatsu Branch Office). The representative types of auto for Suzuki are the "Wagon R," "Alto," and "Cervo." Actually, only the "upper part" of these three auto types, such as the body shape and interior are different. The "underparts" such as the drive which controls the running performance of the car are the same. About 70 percent of the total parts are shared. Many of those in the industry say sarcastically that "they are no more than dress-up dolls." As a result of the thorough sharing of parts, however, the Wagon R, the lowest-priced auto type, has a low price on the level of 700,000 yen. For consumers with tight purse strings, it is a price that fully arouses a desire to buy. The secret of favorable sales lies here. The initial monthly sales goal for the Wagon R was 5,000 cars. Currently, it has reached a level of double that with monthly production of 10,000 cars. Since it went on sale in the fall of 1993, they have sold about 44,000 cars in a period of half a year. It is popular, taking two months from order to delivery in one's hands. The sharing of parts is also linked to improving the capacity utilization rate of their production base, the Kosai No. 1 plant (Shizuoka Prefecture). That is because the underparts of the three auto types are built on the same production line. The number of cars produced has decreased for the Alto and Cervo where over three years have passed since they went on sale. However, combined with the favorable Wagon R, the capacity utilization rate has improved. Naturally, costs can be reduced. The sales policy also is clear and markdowns for cars that cannot be sold are quick. An example is the sports type light car "Cara" that has been OEM [original equipment manufacturer] supplied from Mazda. Because sales performance has been sluggish at 10 percent of the goal, they have decided to stop sales this fall, two years after it went on sale. The Suzuki-style management strategy does not much emphasize technology such as performance or improvement in fuel consumption. It is a method that is difficult to understand in their highly proud technology office, but Suzuki president Osamu Suzuki solemnly avers that, "It is no good to be too obsessed with technology development." President Suzuki is the son-in-law adopted as an heir in the Suzuki family who are the founders. Since he was appointed president in 1978, he has taken the command in the very front line of management. He has a record of having increased sales that were about 250 billion yen when he was appointed to four times that at 1 trillion yen in a 16-year period, and his influence and the sense of confidence placed in him by employees is very great. The fact that he has been able to create a thorough Suzuki style of management strategy is probably because President Suzuki holds strong leadership within the company. The cost reduction measure next set forth by Suzuki was the promotion of mergers of fellow affiliated parts manufacturers. At the beginning of the year, President Suzuki stated at a meeting of affiliated parts manufacturers that "I would like parts manufacturers with fewer than 100 employees to merge." The aim is to enlarge the scale of the parts manufacturers with whom they do business and cut part procurement costs. On 1 May, the first merger following this strategy just was born. If mergers increase in the future, the Suzuki stance will be strong and cost reductions will rapidly proceed. However, there is an uneasy element in this management strategy. First of all, it is supply capability. The order balance for the Wagon R with favorable sales is over 20,000 cars. With three hours of overtime a day at the Kosai plant, and implementation of over three days a month holiday work, monthly production has been increased to 10,000 cars, but an augment of facilities will be necessary to raise production capability further than this, and "makeshift contrivances" gradually are reaching a limit. Actually, Suzuki announced in March that they would OEM supply the Wagon R to Mazda, but the specific period for the supply and number of cars is considered "undecided." The lack of surplus supply cannot be denied. Considering the concept of the "Suzuki style" which holds costs to a minimum, it cannot help but be negative on new enlargement of plants. That is because it will be too much of a risk to bear if they fall into a sales slump after expanding facilities. The reorganization of affiliated parts manufacturers also really is not easy. The persuasion of parts manufacturers who have a strong sense of being master of their own domain to the point of attaining a merger probably will be unsuccessful by ordinary methods. On the contrary, there also is a fear that it will invite opposition. The problem of rebuilding Santana Motor, their Spanish subsidiary which is falling into a business slump, is also a cause of uneasiness. Suzuki announced in April that it reckons a bad debt loss of about 8.5 billion yen in the 1994 March settlement of accounts. It is quickly devising countermeasures, but it can lose its few production bases in Europe if it errs in handling it. The appraisal of Suzuki has increased along with the steady rise in consumer orientation after the burst of the bubble. It will be its policy in the future also to proceed with a thorough reduction of costs with the strong leadership of President Suzuki. The fast clip of Suzuki is giving momentum to moves for parts sharing by the auto industry as a whole and supplying each others' vehicles. Those trends probably will be bathed in more and more attention in the future.
