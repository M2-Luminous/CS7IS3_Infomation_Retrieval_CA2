In accordance with this, China has all along paid special attention to maintaining and developing relations of good-neighborliness, friendship, mutual benefit, and cooperation with the countries on its periphery. In its relations with big countries, China has not only upheld improving and developing Sino-U.S. relations on the basis of the three joint communiques, but has also in the past two years paid great attention to developing relations of friendship and cooperation with Russia. Russian President Yeltsin's visit to China at the end of the year before last, Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin's visit to China a few days ago, and the scheduled visit to Russia in the fall of Jiang Zemin, CPC general secretary and concurrently state president, are new developments in Sino-Russian relations. China's Party, Government, and Military Support Sino-Russian Friendship As informed sources in Beijing disclosed, the development of good-neighborly and friendly relations with Russia has won extensive support in the party, the government, and the military, including some party, government, and military elders. The reasons are: 1) Because of the disintegration of the former USSR, disputes over ideology which may lead to tense state-to-state relations between China and Russia no longer exist. 2) Since both China and Russia are carrying out reform, they need cooperation. 3) There is a history of friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and Russian peoples and the former USSR gave assistance to China in its construction in the 1950's. 4) The establishment of relations of comprehensive cooperation between China and Russia is in the interests of the two countries and the two peoples and can contribute to curbing hegemony and power politics. 5) Sino-Russian cooperation can contain U.S. hegemonic strategy toward China. 6) Russia's advanced science, technology, and military equipment are precisely what China needs in its economy and national defense. China's State Council has taken a positive attitude toward the development of relations of cooperation between China and Russia and not long ago worked out a three-year plan on providing aid for Russia in terms of light industry, foodstuffs, and textiles. Out of consideration of the necessity of upgrading the equipment of the three armed services of China, at the beginning of March the Ministry of National Defense and the General Staff Headquarters put forward to the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission a plan for strengthening cooperation between the armed forces of China and Russia. The plan includes organizing regular mutual visits of high-level personalities of the armed forces, carrying out regular exchanges in military equipment and technology, carrying out regular exchanges of information on the security of the two countries, exchanging cadets of military academies, setting up associations for promoting cooperation and friendship, and so on. Diplomats in Beijing hold that China has energetically developed its relations with Russia mainly out of the strategic consideration of contending with U.S. pressure on China each year on the issue of most-favored-nation trading status. As observed from the angle of the diplomatic strategy of "consolidating the periphery," Sino-Russian friendship and cooperation will benefit China's politics, economy, and military. Deng Xiaoping's Tactics Toward Sino-Russian Relations However, according to informed sources, Deng Xiaoping has unique views as to the relations which should be established between China and Russia. On the eve of Chinese Premier Li Peng's visit in the middle of April to countries of the CIS which separated from the former USSR, including Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan in Central Asia, Deng Xiaoping mentioned to members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee: "It is right to develop comprehensive relations with Russia, but it is necessary to have more observation and it is not advisable to be impatient to establish partnership or treaty relations. We uphold opening up and multilateral cooperation, but do not depend on (the other side); nor should we worry too much about what new relations will be established between the United States, Europe, and Russia. Russia has its own strategic plan. I think for quite a long time to come, there will not be major conflicts between China and Russia. Regarding economic aid to Russia, we should do what we are capable of and should openly state that in doing so, China is not aiming at a third country and does not seek any interests of its own." As diplomats in Beijing point out, Deng Xiaoping's idea of pursuing an independent foreign policy of peace had already fully manifested itself at the end of the 1980's and the beginning of the 1990's. While talking about the international situation and China's policy toward it with several high-level political figures of the CPC on 4 September 1989, Deng said three things: "First, observing coolly; second, securing our position; third, dealing with things calmly." He laid special emphasis on "the necessity of keeping cool, keeping cool, and keeping cool, and of engrossing ourselves in doing a good job of attending to our own affairs." In accordance with the three things put forward by Deng, China's diplomacy stood the test of a changeable international situation in which Eastern Europe experienced drastic changes and the USSR disintegrated, and was able to resist the pressure of sanctions imposed by the West. Talking about China's diplomacy with some high-level political figures of the CPC again on 14 December 1990, Deng put forward that China should "accomplish something" in foreign affairs and said: "Unpredictable factors in the international situation are now numerous and contradictions become more and more unexpected." "Some countries of the Third World hope that China will act as the head. However, in no way should we act as the head and this is a fundamental national policy. We are incapable of acting as the head and we do not have sufficient strength for that. There is no advantage in acting as the head because we may lose the initiative in many aspects if we do so. China will stand on the side of the Third World forever. China will never seek hegemony and China will never act as the head. However, we cannot accomplish nothing on international issues and we should still accomplish something. What should we accomplish? I think we should energetically promote the establishment of a new international political and economic order. We fear nobody, but we offend nobody. We handle affairs in accordance with the five principles of peaceful coexistence and we are firm in principle and stand." In these years, China has all along maneuvered among various groupings and developed in a flexible manner in the international arena in accordance with Deng Xiaoping's diplomatic ideas. China Wants To Accomplish Something in the World According to informed sources, in handling its relations with Russia, China of course will not deviate from the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's diplomatic ideas. To be specific, China follows four principles: 1. Uphold good neighborliness, friendship, and peaceful coexistence; 2. Develop mutual-benefit cooperation, promote common prosperity; 3. Respect the choice of the people of each country and do not interfere in each other's internal affairs; 4. Respect independence and sovereignty and promote regional stability. However, what has attracted people's attention is that people in charge of China's diplomatic, economic, and trade circles said a few days ago that China hoped the Russian prime minister's visit to China could promote development in depth of the relations between the two countries. This may imply that although it "will never act as a head" in the international arena, China wants to "accomplish something." When the Cold War ended, most people thought the big triangular relations between China, the United States, and Russia no long existed. As a matter of fact, the end of the Cold War only implied the end of nuclear confrontation between the two superpowers, but it did not imply that the differences in interests and contradictions between countries would also disappear. So long as the differences in interests and contradictions between countries remain among China, the United States, and Russia, the strategic interaction relations among the three countries will remain. If China can make good use of such strategic interaction relations, and develop Sino-Russian relations, such a move will be conducive to the political stability of Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang in China and to preventing chaos in Mongolia and Central Asia, and will raise China's position in the big triangular relations of China, the United States, and Russia. This is because after Russia widens its diplomatic gap with the United States, it will inevitably draw close to China, and this will increase China's chips in bargaining with the United States, compelling the latter to keep its eyes on the overall pattern of global strategy in considering its policy toward China, instead of merely making use of the lever of human rights. In this way, the issue of giving most-favored-nation trading status to China can be solved more easily, and the United States will also attach greater importance to the strategic position of U.S.-Chinese relations and will not lightly have confrontation with China.
