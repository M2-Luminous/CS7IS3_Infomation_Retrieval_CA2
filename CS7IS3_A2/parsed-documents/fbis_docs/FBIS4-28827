The sources said the decontrol will be incorporated in an economic deregulation package to be worked out by the government at the end of June. They said banks would be accused of violating the antimonopoly law if they manipulate interest rates on housing loans through behind-the-scenes negotiations. Fixed and variable interest rates on housing loans, introduced in 1983, have been linked to movements of the long-term prime lending rate charged by commercial banks on loans to creditworthy customers. The sources said commercial banks are studying the possibility of linking housing loan interest with the short-term prime rate, which reflects interest movements on the money market.
