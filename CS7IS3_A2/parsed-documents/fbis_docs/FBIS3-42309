Report on Deaths During Development of Market Relations"] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] In 1993 the landmark of 1,404 crimes involving the violent death of various categories of Muscovites and visitors to the capital was reached. And this -- as the reader has probably already managed to calculate -- is a 52.7-percent increase in the number of premeditated murders in just one year. However, if the figure 1,404 is enough to make you reel in horror, then prepare yourself, there is worse to come. Yuriy Fedoseyev also has aggravated assaults leading to death in store for you -- 983 last year. And if you add the corpses that are not found straightaway and are not entirely, to be blunt, fresh and intact, the militia's math virtually brings us to the figure of 3,000, which means that around 8.2 people are now murdered every day in the hero city of Moscow. [passage omitted] There is every indication that it is not only the militia that is learning, but also the people whom they are hunting down. I don't know about rope barriers, but, according to Yuriy Fedoseyev, the Moscow criminal world is now equipped with high-quality sniper rifles, assault rifles, grenade launchers, and TNT, which is apparently gradually coming into fashion. It has begun to be considered fashionable in the city to blow up a victim at his home, preferably at around 0400-0500 hours. The capital's defenders of law and order have already dubbed this the "have-a-nice-day" approach. The niceness of the day is complicated for the Moscow Criminal Investigations Department by the fact that radio-controlled detonators have appeared in the city. The art of murdering your fellow man without leaving a trace, without witnesses, and an obvious motive has become near-perfect of late. In 1993 the Moscow Criminal Investigations Department cleared up only 48.2 percent of the crimes involving premeditated murder. [passage omitted]
