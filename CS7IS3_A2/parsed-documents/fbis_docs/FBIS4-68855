We asked him to share his thoughts on the eve of opening the first session of the Supreme Council 13th term. [Kraslyanskyy] Oleksandr Oleksandrovich, you are, as they say, not a novice in the Supreme Council, since you were a member in the previous term and have now been elected a people's deputy of Ukraine for the second time. What would you like to reject of the things associated with the previous Supreme Council, what would you like to preserve, and what would you like to add in order for it to work successfully? [Moroz] Of the creative achievements of the Supreme Council, I would take the level of political professionalism, which last year began to acquire clearer shape. I feel that when the deputies worked on concrete legislative acts, they put aside ideological disagreements and the knowledge acquired over four years of deputy experience began to work. We really have gone through a great school of learning, and it would be imprudent to disregard it. The work of the previous Supreme Council, however, was replete with shortcomings, and they need to be consigned to history. For instance, we have to discard the system of lawmaking. The answer to the question recently asked by the then Prime Minister L. Kuchma--what we are building?--needed to be given back in 1990, at least after the all-Ukraine referendum. Had we such an answer, in its content we should have worked out the structure and sequence of steps in adopting laws. Then the commission on questions of legislation and legality, as well as other commissions, could function in accordance with a clear program. One of the deputies of the Supreme Council chairman should have put together a sort of a schedule of preparation of laws and "monitor the progress" of each law from conception to adoption and control over its "life." There was no such system. The process of lawmaking itself was chaotic, and this became one of the reasons that the laws did not correlate with one another; they lacked financial and scientific substantiation, and a forecast of the consequences of their action in society. One more thing. If we know what people themselves want to say regarding preservation in the constitution, for instance, of social guarantees regarding work, free education, and so on, then why do we disregard citizens' feelings? Why do we act against the will of the people? Is this democracy? Is this a proper position for the supreme organ of authority? The new parliament should develop an institute of lawmaking. It does not have to be necessarily a staff structure--it can be a small group of organizers-scholars, jurists, who would form a creative group and develop a system of making concrete laws, perhaps through a competition. [Kraslyanskyy] In the beginning of our conversation you mentioned the subject of ideological disagreements. Judging by the composition of the current parliament, it will also certainly have plenty of such disagreements. How do you see overcoming them? Finally, with whom are you going to join forces and with whom will you seek compromise? [Moroz] One can never make the Supreme Council free of ideological discussion--this simply would be against its nature. The point is to make it a mere addition to lawmaking work in the parliament. [Kraslyanskyy] In principle, law in itself is ideology... [Moroz] Undoubtedly. We understand very well that politics is relations between people and the corresponding spheres in the state that are regulated by laws or other normative acts. As to unproductive political clashes within parliament walls, much depends in this respect on the organization of the Supreme Council's work, on the formation of its governing structures, the order in which they will consider those draft laws and questions that concern people most today. Knowing their mood, I will say that current economic problems concern people more than anything. Speaking of contentions of individual politicians that the fault for all the troubles lies with the communists, who allegedly are in power even now, you may rest assured: People have figured out today who is who, who defended the versions of privatization that made the plunder of Ukraine possible. Here is economics and politics for you all at once. Knowing these circumstances, realizing that we have to climb out of the pit into which we have fallen, and giving the commissions some or other laws that deal with economic problems for consideration, I think that along this road we will have fewer ideological battles, since a concrete cause demands concrete action, and for the sake of it one can put aside irreconcilable views. As soon as we start moving in the direction of economic stabilization and people start feeling that the crisis is subsiding, then the intensity of issues will diminish considerably. [Kraslyanskyy] A logical question: Do you see a way of extricating Ukraine from its difficult economic situation? [Moroz] Today this is the most difficult question for anyone. The Supreme Council apparently must first resolve the main problem on this path: forming a capable, competent, decisive government. I know this is not easy. But Ukraine has never had its own government--a government of a state. Ukraine has not had and still does not have its own economy. It is still not treated by our executive authority as a single organism. We need to find in the state a first person who will measure up to this task, be able to get a grip on the situation as a whole. [Kraslyanskyy] Do you have a candidate in mind? [Moroz] There are various proposals and options. Without naming any persons in particular, I will only say that in this matter we need to resolutely reject strictly ideological criteria. This has already done great harm to our economy. Today, of course, there are many who are regretful, while perhaps some are rejoicing, carrying out someone's instructions, that this has happened, but it is true that since the fall of 1990 every new government has been weaker than the previous one. From a political viewpoint perhaps it would be unsuitable to turn to the specialists of the past, but I would step over all these nuances for the sake of having good professionals in the Cabinet of Ministers. Although usually new people, new approaches, and a fresh team generate faster hope and confidence in the authorities. There are options. And we are not talking here about a return to the command-administrative system. Thus, to start with it is necessary to form in the Cabinet of Ministers a team that will understand all these tasks and nuances and will not strive to turn to the methods of leadership that have already brought great harm to our economy. At the same time, power structures need to resolutely rid themselves of corruption and abuse, and repulse anyone's desire to profit from others' misfortunes. On the other hand, they need to create conditions so as to eliminate the possibility of engaging in dirty business in the corridors of power. And one more thing. Labor can be effective only when economic incentives begin to work instead of compulsory forms of state orders or detailed planning. At the same time I think that at the macrolevel the state sector of the economy must have clear leadership. And we see that current economic management is being conducted in such a way that the state sector is being destroyed, consistently and purposefully. Already about 20 percent of the means of production at state enterprises has been privatized. They somehow still operate, agonize, but at the same time produce the main part of the gross output. The state sector has been placed in mortal circumstances; it is being deliberately strangled and destroyed. [Kraslyanskyy] Judging by everything, you now support a change of authority, the creation of conditions that would put an end to the chaos and, as you put it, abuse and irresponsibility. Would it be correct to say that in this current difficult period you support a restoration of the dictatorship of authority? [Moroz] I am for the dictatorship of order. And in this respect it is not necessary to bring dictatorship to authoritarian methods of organizing the authority. What I mean is that everyone and everything should be subordinate to the law, and that the latter should deal ruthlessly with whoever attempts to violate it. For this we have to build up the structure of power. I am convinced that the Council, which in one form or another exists all over the world as the mechanism of authority, presents great opportunities for establishing order. [Kraslyanskyy] So, Oleksandr Oleksandrovich, which form of authority do you support: parliamentary, parliamentary-presidential, or presidential? [Moroz] For the current stage of development of Ukrainian statehood I think the most suitable form of authority is parliamentary-presidential. Although in the future, when the situation in the economy stabilizes and society emerges from cataclysm onto a straight road, we could do with a parliamentary republic. [Kraslyanskyy] I disagree with you in this respect. Knowing the character traits of our people, their eternal striving for Cossack freedom, where each is his own master, I think that broad democracy in the form of a parliamentary republic may turn into all-out anarchy and harm our statehood. And did you not yourself feel at the time of the election campaign that people want a strong authority concentrated in the hands of one person? [Moroz] I think what people want is order and confidence in tomorrow. They are not looking for salvation in a hetman or a tsar. They are searching first of all for a way to realize their labor potential. When we create motivation for labor, people will respect both the law and the state. [Kraslyanskyy] I would like to finish the conversation where we started. Which is: Although the new parliament has not convened yet, to my knowledge deputy factions have already been practically formed. You head one of them. With whom are you planning to work, and with whom to reach compromises? [Moroz] Regarding leadership of a faction--thank you. This is news to me. And differentiation is indeed emerging. As to compromises, I will say this: It depends on the purpose and for the sake of what a compromise is being sought. If it is for the fulfillment of the task I consider to be the most important--overcoming the economic catastrophe--I am ready to work with anyone. What is currently needed is action instead of quarreling; we need to find the rational in different positions. As they say, pick grain by grain, and you will have bread.
