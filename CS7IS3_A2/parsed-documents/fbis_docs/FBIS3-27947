The outline of the prime minister's speech was worked out on 31 January. While keeping in mind the passage of political reform bills through the Diet, the prime minister will display his attitude toward tackling domestic affairs from the viewpoint that "reform in domestic politics is indispensable for promoting diplomacy." For example, he will declare that the Hosokawa cabinet intends to continue to tackle the task of "promoting reform" as the administration's top priority. His speech can be described as a "Hosokawa vision" which indicates what Japan ought to be like to prepare for the 21st century. In concrete terms, Prime Minister Hosokawa will clearly state his intention to speed up the following tasks: 1) securing transparency in procedures for deciding on government policies; and 2) changing the current economic structure to a consumer-oriented one. Moreover, the prime minister will call for building "stable and strong relations between Japan and the United States." He will also spell out his intention to strengthen the cooperative relationship between the two countries in view of building a new order in the Asia-Pacific region in the post-Cold War era. The prime minister's speech will last about 20 minutes. He will deliver the speech in English as he did at the meeting of the UN General Assembly last September.
