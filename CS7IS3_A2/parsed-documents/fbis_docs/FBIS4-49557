The circular says: In March 1991, the People's Bank of China, the Public Security Ministry, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the Press and Publications Administration, and the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television jointly issued a "circular concerning the use of the renminbi, foreign currency, and treasury bond designs on publicity articles, publications, and relevant commodities." This circular played an active role in strengthening the management of the renminbi and treasury bonds. But the use of the renminbi and treasury bond designs on publicity articles, publications, and commodities occurs frequently, providing opportunities for criminal elements to cheat and disturb financial order. To safeguard the reputation and dignity of the renminbi and treasury bonds, the newly issued circular says: Without the approval of the People's Bank of China, no units or individuals are allowed to print, in any form, certificate or notes imitating the renminbi. Nor are they allowed to print renminbi and treasury bond designs on publicity articles, publications, and other commodities. It is necessary to strengthen the supervision and management of printing, publication, movies, television, and advertisement units, as well as other commodity manufacturers. If publicity articles, publications, and other commodities are found to be printed with such designs without the approval of the People's Bank of China, they should be confiscated immediately and destroyed on the spot. For those which have been sold, the illegal income from the sales shall be confiscated and a fine of no more than the sale income shall be imposed. Personnel directly in charge of this activity or involved in this activity shall be investigated. The circular urges that all localities and departments should conscientiously organize inspections, that press units should conduct propaganda campaigns, and relevant units should strengthen their supervision and management so as to stop the misuse of such designs.
