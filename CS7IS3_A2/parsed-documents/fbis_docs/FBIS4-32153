"Turkey's principled position is that people should not be forced to leave the country where they were born and have lived," the Turkish head of state says. Asked what Turkey had done to help the financial development of Bulgaria's Muslim-populated borderland areas, he answers that every state is obliged to improve the economic conditions of its citizens. He expresses the conviction that the economic situation of the Bulgarians living in those parts can be improved by expansion of trade and economic relations between Bulgaria and Turkey. "To this end, the country should discuss ways and means to widen trade and economic contacts," Mr. Demirel observes. The Turkish president says that relations between Bulgaria and his country have been "good" so far with the exception of the 1984-1989 period. He sees the recently growing number of high-level visits as a clear indication of the two countries' political will to promote their relations in all spheres. Bulgarian-Turkish trade has increased considerably, from $60-70 million in the early 80's to $329 million in 1993, Mr. Demirel says. This is an encouraging sign for the tendencies of bilateral relations, in his view. The Turkish president describes as "promising" the prospects of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Region, recalling that Bulgaria and Turkey initiated its establishment. In an area overwhelmed by past and present political and economic difficulties, regional cooperation can help a lot to overcome these difficulties, he emphasizes. "If together with the other member countries we manage to do so, we will be able to reap the fruits of regional peace and stability," Mr. Demirel notes. Discussing the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina, President Demirel describes as major progress the Muslim-Croat agreement signed in Washington and expresses the opinion that the process started with that agreement could provide a sound basis for comprehensive peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The economic difficulties experienced by Turkey, the Kurds' struggle for independence in Southeastern Turkey and the successful performance of Islamic fundamentalists in the local elections are also discussed in the interview.
