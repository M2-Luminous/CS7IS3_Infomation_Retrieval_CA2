Wang gave his guests a detailed account of China's economic development over the last few years, especially the reforms with respect to the fiscal and taxation system, foreign exchange, foreign trade, and prices. He said China has put into effect more reform measures than ever this year, adding that facts show the situation regarding economic operations has been good. If these reform measures prove finally successful, this will mean that China has taken a decisive step forward toward the socialist market economy, he added. Wang said: China will continue to develop steadily and open wider to the outside world. With the economic development, China has great market potential. Many big companies in the world, including quite a few U.S. companies, are interested in exploring the China market, while China is also in great need of U.S. funds and technology. The two sides can intensify cooperation to their mutual benefit. Wang emphasized: China and the United States have a common duty to safeguard world peace, including peace in the Asia-Pacific region, and this is in their common interest. Improved Sino-U.S. relations will be beneficial to both countries and to peace and development in the world, including the Asia-Pacific region. Wang said the large numbers of Overseas Chinese constitute a valuable opportunity for China's development. He hopes Overseas Chinese and Chinese-Americans in the United States will contribute to promoting Sino-U.S. relations, help China to develop into a prosperous and powerful country, and help develop the U.S. economy.
