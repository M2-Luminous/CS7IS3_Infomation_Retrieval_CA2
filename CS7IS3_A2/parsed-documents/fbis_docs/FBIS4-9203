Accordingly, one can speak of a certain decommunization of Croatia in both the state administration and the ruling structure. Josip Manolic's departure from all duties in the ruling Croatian political party is certainly one of the biggest personnel changes in the Croatian state since its emergence. That is why we asked Ivic Pasalic, the republic president's adviser on domestic policy and a member of the HDZ Presidency, and the party's new "personnel officer," as some better informed journalists claim, for a more detailed interpretation of Manolic's departure. [Dujmovic] Why did Josip Manolic have to leave? Are the newspaper analyses correct which are emphasizing three possible reasons for Manolic's departure these days: the open conflict with Gojko Susak, the revival of the old divisions between the winners and losers from 1945--which was mentioned in one of Manolic's controversial interviews--or a real and open conflict with the republic president? [Pasalic] Josip Manolic did not have to leave. Everything that has happened is his choice, and the motives are primarily known to him personally. The decision on removing Mr. Manolic from his party duties clearly cites the reasons, namely disagreement with the HDZ's policy. In the last few months, on several occasions he has publicly, as a party official, expressed positions contrary to the established party policy and to the decisions of central party policy. Since Mr. Manolic even said very clearly at the last meeting of the HDZ Presidency that he was not retreating from his political positions, and he did not accept a compromise offer from President Tudjman (that he would remain an HDZ deputy in the Chamber of Parishes, but not its president), the decision that was adopted by the party leadership is completely logical and based on the HDZ Statute. I am mentioning this because this does not have anything to do with any sort of personal conflicts, or conflicts between the "left" and "right," but rather an attempt to impose a parallel policy contrary to the one conducted by the president and the HDZ Presidency. [Dujmovic] What is the difference between the political positions of Mr. Manolic and the HDZ Presidency? Manolic is stubbornly emphasizing that he advocates a law-governed state, an integral Bosnia-Herzegovina.... [Pasalic] Those are mere political phrases. Every policy occurs in a specific time and area, and is governed by domestic and international circumstances. When someone says now that he advocated an integral Bosnia-Herzegovina, then the following question arises: Who did not advocate an integral Bosnia-Herzegovina? The HDZ's fundamental goal, very clearly expressed in the first multiparty elections, was the establishment of an independent and sovereign Croatian state. At the same time, our policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina was conducted by ensuring the strategic interests of the Croatian state, and by ensuring for the Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina the rights of an equal constituent people within the internal order of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a complex state, without calling into question Bosnia-Herzegovina's territorial integrity. The situation, however, was such that it was questionable how that policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina could be carried out, especially since the solution to that problem did not depend and still does not depend solely on Croatian political positions and interests. Therefore, there simply had to be a back-up possibility in circumstances in which the Muslims wanted to create their own state, in which the Serbs did so, and in the event that the international community adopted different solutions. Croatia was simply in a situation in which it also had to be prepared for that possibility. In spite of all that, in all the international plans that were offered Croatia did not aim for a single moment at the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We accepted Cutilheiro's plan, the Vance-Owen plan, and the plan for Bosnia-Herzegovina as a union of republics, but we did not want to accept in any way the establishment of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a civil (Muslim) state. Consequently, when Mr. Manolic wants to show today that the policy of an integral Bosnia-Herzegovina is "his" policy, contrary to any other policy, then it is obviously just throwing dust in people's eyes. [Dujmovic] When it is said that Manolic was in conflict with the established state policy, what, specifically, does that mean? [Pasalic] Consequently, if we are talking about Bosnia-Herzegovina, then the conflict is evident in the fact that Mr. Manolic, in all his statements in the last few months, has said that Croatian policy turned around after Washington, and "that that policy first had to run up against a wall" and only then could be changed. You see, that is quite incorrect; it is petty politics, and in the end, it is directly contrary to the policy that we really did conduct toward Bosnia-Herzegovina. We conducted a principled but realistic policy in the given framework. Consequently, that assessment of Manolic's is simply not true. Furthermore, at the Presidency meeting, Josip Manolic took Mr. Susak solely as a symbol of that mistaken policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Consequently, if Mr. Susak is only a symbol of a mistaken policy, that means that the president of the Republic is conducting a mistaken policy! Accordingly, he spoke out directly against the policy that President Tudjman is conducting! All of the statements made by Manolic in support of this were incorrect, and this was simply a case of manipulating the facts. Next, Mr. Manolic was also stating that he advocated a law-governed state. Putting the matter that way indicates that the Croatian state leadership presumably does not advocate a law-governed state, and that the Croatian authorities are opposing it!? In one interview, Manolic said that the perpetrators of crimes are not prosecuted in Croatia, and that the state has a tolerant attitude toward violence, smuggling, drugs, and planting explosives, which is untrue, which can be verified, after all, by comparing the data of the Interior Ministry, the State Attorney's Office, and the courts. Furthermore, Mr. Manolic was the prime minister, he was chief of the Office for Protection of the Constitutional Order, from the beginning of the party's establishment he was the vice president of the HDZ, and if we are talking about a law-governed state, it is precisely Mr. Manolic who was in the most sensitive positions, where a law-governed state had to be realized. Accordingly, even if what Mr. Manolic is saying is true, then that also indicates his own irresponsibility, since for three years he was in jobs that regulated those issues. In one interview, I think directly before leaving the position of head of the Office for Protection of the Constitutional Order, he stated that he was not satisfied with the military and civilian police! But that was his job then! The third thing that Mr. Manolic is talking about is his disagreement with how the party was being led. You see, the HDZ's supreme party body is the party congress. At the last congress the HDZ's statute and program were adopted, and arguments and different political solutions and different personnel solutions could be confronted and clarified at that congress. At that congress President Tudjman openly invited Mr. Manolic, as the alleged head of the so-called left wing in the party, and Mr. Seks, as the alleged head of the so-called right wing in the party, to campaign openly as candidates opposing President Tudjman, if they did not agree with the declared policy. Accordingly, if Mr. Manolic thought that that policy was not the policy that was backed by the membership at large, then he could have verified that by presenting himself as a rival candidate. He did not, however. The congress occurred partly because an atmosphere of dissension had started to be created within the party, and when a program is adopted at the congress, then the only thing left is to carry it out, or else to leave the party. [Dujmovic] Manolic is mostly criticizing the conduct of the policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina. Talking about the Washington agreement, he is expressing fear that people will start to obstruct it. After all, the opposition is also emphasizing that the same people cannot support a Bosnia-Herzegovina union and a cantonal Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that personnel replacements are logical. [Pasalic] Those are all political insinuations. The Washington agreement was signed by President Tudjman on behalf of Croatia, and by Kresimir Zubak on behalf of the leadership of the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina. What are the arguments that would indicate anyone's opposing implementation of that agreement? Accordingly, this assessment of his once again suffers from a lack of arguments, but unfortunately, in some political circles it will be interpreted as a statement by someone who was at the very top of the Croatian government. Even though that assessment is completely wrong, it can inflict both damage and problems on Croatian interests. With respect to Herceg-Bosna, for the most part the same people there have been conducting policy since 1990, and as the political situation changed, because both the Serbs, the Muslims, and the international community changed their positions, they also had to adapt to that. The whole problem is that he is stubbornly insinuating that there has now been some sort of reversal in policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina, and from that fundamental distorted viewpoint he is deriving conclusions that necessarily have to be wrong. [Dujmovic] Is is true that at the HDZ Presidency meeting the departure of Mesic, Greguric, and Valentic was mentioned? [Pasalic] That is completely untrue; there was not a word about it. Of course, all the Presidency members, in their statements, supported the established party policy and appealed to Mr. Manolic to take a reasonable step. [Dujmovic] How do you view the assessment that this is the beginning of a schism in the HDZ? [Pasalic] Those are the wishes of certain people who want to strengthen their own political position in that way, but unfortunately for them, and fortunately for the HDZ and Croatia, none of the preconditions for that to happen exist. It is worth noting, however, that different political and interest groups have attempted and are attempting to bring about a schism within the HDZ. Their goal is to bring about a split within the parliamentary majority in order to achieve a different balance of power and a different parliamentary majority in the Assembly. Then they would probably either aim at early elections or at changing the constitutional position of the president of the Republic. Certain opposition parties have held this political platform, and even made plans to cause such a situation. The immediate occasion for carrying out those plans was supposed to be a universal staged uproar, even within the HDZ, over the failed policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina. Those who are more intelligent and politically experienced enough gave up those ideas, because of the obvious successes of Croatian state policy, but some people are obviously on a path of no return and are still acting in accordance with the planned scenario. The HDZ came out of the second general congress stronger, the membership fully accepted the program, and the parliamentary majority is completely stable. The proof is the voting in the deputies' club in the Chamber of Parishes, where 36 deputies were in favor of replacing Mr. Manolic as president of the Chamber of Parishes, and only three were opposed. Of those three, two deputies clearly stated that they would respect the party decision and vote for replacement at the meeting of the Chamber of Parishes. Certainly the HDZ majority in the Chamber of Deputies is absolutely stable, and thus those estimates that about 30 HDZ deputies would go over to certain other political options turned out to be completely wrong. Accordingly, there is no schism in the HDZ, there is no parliamentary crisis, and there will be no early elections. [Dujmovic] That would mean that the newspaper ideas about the possible counterbalancing departure of Minister Susak are unfounded? [Pasalic] The defense minister enjoys the confidence of the republic president, and thus I do not see any arguments in favor of those ideas. [Dujmovic] I would like to go back to the functioning of a law-governed state. The fact is that every day we can follow some sort of financial scandal in the press. In spite of what is occasionally quite solid proof of financial embezzlement, I have not yet heard of anyone being held accountable. If everyone in the leadership really is equally supportive of a law-governed state, how is that phenomenon possible? [Pasalic] I would like to see any solid proof of embezzlement that has not been followed by sanctions. Specifically, we have insinuations and slanders among our political public before those issues come to trial, and even before an investigation is conducted. I maintain that the law-governed state is functioning, while one has to take into account the conditions in which we are living and the situation that we inherited. [Dujmovic] So there is no financial embezzlement in Croatia? [Pasalic] I did not say that. After all, there is no country in the world where those things do not happen. [Dujmovic] For several days now, the slightly improbably news has been spreading in Croatian political circles that there is a certain list of internationally objectionable Croatian politicians, a list that was compiled at the Vatican. Is there any truth to that? [Pasalic] No, I am hearing that for the first time. It is well-known what His Holiness the Pope has said on several occasions and it is known that he sent a thank-you letter to President Tudjman. Possibly someone might draw certain conclusions from that, because it says that it is difficult for the new democratic states to establish themselves on the ruins of atheistic socialism. Perhaps this part sends certain hidden messages to some people, and they can draw certain conclusions from it, but there are no lists that came from the Vatican with the names of objectionable Croatian politicians. But, you see, we really have created a state on the ruins of atheistic socialism. The idea of the reconciliation of all Croats, however, has been woven into the foundations of the creation of Croatia, and that must not be forgotten. At the same time, those who have adhered to firm communist positions, as well as those who have adhered to extreme right-wing positions, have to be told that the time has come when those who have not accepted the HDZ's centrist policy have to give way to those who will build Croatia and the HDZ on centrist positions. Accordingly, one can also speak of a certain decommunization of Croatia in both the state administration and the government structure. [Dujmovic] It is also said that Manolic's departure is the outcome of a conflict between the Drava basin and Herzegovina lobbies. [Pasalic] Those are political terms by which people have tried to depict the situation within the party for a long time. That is said because those whose positions have not been accepted choose stories about lobbies in order to obscure the essence of the problem. [Dujmovic] Does Ivic Pasalic belong to the Herzegovina lobby? [Pasalic] No, Ivic Pasalic does not belong to any lobby. [Dujmovic] How much truth is there in the rumors that Mr. Mesic could also leave his position, in view of the similarity between his views and Manolic's? [Pasalic] I would not like to be a prophet, but I personally think that it will not happen. Specifically, my opinion is that there will not be any sort of chain reactions, as people want to insinuate now, and instead I think that we will all learn certain political lessons from these circumstances. [Dujmovic] Taking into account the way in which negotiations are being conducted with representatives of the Serbs in the UNPA's [UN Protected Areas], as well as Churkin's idea of a "state within a state," doesn't it seem to you that a back-door attempt is being made to impose the federalization of the state upon Croatia? Specifically, even the U.S. representative is talking about the UNPAs as an area with "significant" autonomy. [Pasalic] With respect to the Croatian areas under UN protection, there are certainly different desires: from Greater Serbia to the confederalization of Croatia. The Croatian position is quite clear, however: Any sort of federalization or confederalization of Croatia is out of the question. It is the territory of the Republic of Croatia, and we will do everything possible to return those parts to Croatia's constitutional and legal order through political negotiations. [Dujmovic] On several occasions, Mr. Galbraith has diplomatically and cautiously mentioned his own impressions that the Serbs are particularly bothered that they have been "left out of the constitution." In the context of these negotiations with the Serbs, is it possible that the Croatian constitution may be changed along those lines? [Pasalic] No, that is out of the question, because the Serbs cannot be a constituent people in Croatia.
