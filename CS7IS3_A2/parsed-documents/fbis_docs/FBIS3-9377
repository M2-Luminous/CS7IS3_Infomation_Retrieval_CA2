The trucks had left Zagreb in the morning with 90 tonnes of food and other relief material and were seized in the Tezlic region southwest of the Moslem city, officials said. The drivers were abducted and held for several hours, and turned up later in the town of Zepce, controlled by Bosnian Croat forces, said Kris Janowski, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. "It's a very serious incident," he said. One of the trucks was later recovered but it was empty, he added. Maglaj received its first aid convoy in five months on Sunday after Serb forces that had been attacking it eased their siege. The town has a population of around 16,000.
