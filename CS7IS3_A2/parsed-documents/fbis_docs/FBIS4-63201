Political instability in the Crimea and the situation around naval bases, says an official statement issued by the Black Sea navy press centre today, engenders moral and psychological tension in military units. No matter how the situation develops, the Black Sea navy will not be able to keep aloof of the processes occurring around it. This alarms the command of the navy, its officers and noncoms. The statement says that not a single regional conflict was solved by armed force over the past twenty years. The wars in Nagorno- Karabakh, Yugoslavia and Abkhazia show that the ordinary people suffer from the hostilities, but not those who unleash them. The Black Sea navy command relies on the wisdom and good will of the peoples and the political representative they had elected. The winter training is about to end on the Black Sea navy. The press centre's statement says that exercises of different forces are proceeding according to schedule. Taking part in them are warships, auxiliary vessels, and aircraft.
