This military-political alliance, established at the end of the 1940's to provide for the collective defense of Western Europe under U.S. leadership from a possible "invasion of communism from the East," has presently fulfilled its main historical mission. It would seem logical, with the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, disintegration of the USSR, and disappearance of the threat of invasion, that we might expect the disbandment of NATO as well. Adherents of this point of view are to be found in the West, including in the United States. However, the voices of those who are fighting for preservation of the bloc, its transformation, and even expansion and adaptation to the new realities of postcommunist Europe, are ringing out with far greater volume. What arguments and proposals are being advanced in this regard? To what extent do they conform to reality and to Russia's interests? What kind of policy can the Russian Federation have with respect to NATO? This article makes an attempt to find answers to these questions. Serving as a starting point for the search is the work of American analysts R. Asmus, R. Kugler, and S. Larrabee from the well-known RAND research corporation--"Building a New NATO," recently published in the journal FOREIGN AFFAIRS. (Footnote 1) (FOREIGN AFFAIRS, September-October 1993, p. 28-40) The arguments of proponents of preservation of the bloc are propounded most clearly and concisely here. Arguments `For' American analysts justify the need for maintaining the alliance proceeding from a unique understanding of the problems of European security in the postcommunist era. In their view, threats to security on the European continent are at present issuing chiefly from two "arcs of crisis," "zones of instability"--eastern and southern. The eastern arc encompasses the area between Germany and Russia, from Northern Europe to Turkey, the Caucasus, and Asia Minor. The southern arc--Northern Africa, the Mediterranean Sea region, Near East, and Southwest Asia. The greatest danger is presented by the eastern arc, whose states have been oversaturated with arms following the collapse of the USSR. They are unstable, infected with "aggressive nationalism," and at the same time incapable of defending themselves. "Central and Eastern Europe are saturated with potential mini-Weimar Republics, each of which is capable of unleashing an avalanche of violence upon the others," the authors write. In addition, there exist strong fears with respect to a rebirth of imperial Russia, which itself is manifesting signs of instability and a possible shift to the right. All this, in the opinion of the American analysts, demands that the structure of security in the region be preserved. In what manner, according to the authors' concept, should the West react to the most dangerous challenges? They believe a "general strategy" must be developed for "the propagation of collective defense, democracy, and security along the arcs of crisis." The obvious instrument for implementation of such a strategy is NATO. In the opinion of the authors, the Persian Gulf War and the crisis in Yugoslavia have shown that the European Community (EC) is incapable of handling such a task, insofar as consensus among the 12 EC member states is virtually unattainable. Even less suitable for such a role is the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), which consists of 53 members. "Only NATO, with its tested command structure, developed logistics network, and effective arsenal, is capable of dealing with challenges to the security of Europe following the conclusion of the Cold War," the authors believe. But if NATO is unable to accomplish its mission, its existence will then be all the more inappropriate. In order to implement such a strategy, in the view of the American analysts, certain significant steps must be carried out. First and foremost, NATO, as an organization based on a need for collective security against a specific threat, must be transformed into an alliance directed towards the propagation of democracy, stability, and regulation of crises in the broad strategic sense. A second measure, directed towards realization of the "general strategy," must be the conclusion of a new "trans-Atlantic agreement" between the United States and Western Europe, i.e., intensification of the role of the European states within the framework of the alliance, in other words, the "Europe-ization" of NATO. To this end, the United States will have to abandon its ambiguous attitude towards European integration within the EC framework. It will have to support this more energetically and thus encourage a more active role for France, which does not recognize American hegemony in Europe and without whose consent it will be impossible to transform NATO. In addition, to successfully transform the bloc the authors believe it is necessary to have a strong Germany, more interested than any other party in maintaining the stability of its eastern borders. The political leaders in Bonn should abandon their present passive role. Germany should be actively included in ground operations outside the borders of NATO's "zone of responsibility." The American political experts believe that another important means of transforming NATO is expansion to the east, primarily by virtue of including within it states of the "Visegrad group"--Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and possibly Slovakia. These countries must be simultaneously included within the EC. Entry into NATO can be accomplished gradually, in stages, and non-simultaneously. The authors understand that until now the West has related negatively to the possibility of NATO moving eastward out of fears of encroaching upon Russia's security interests. In their concept, however, the attitude of the Russian Federation towards possible expansion of the alliance by virtue of the former socialist countries would depend only on Russia itself. They write: "Expansion of the alliance to the east should be perceived more as a step taken by the West towards Russia than as a step taken against it. As a partner to the West, Russia could play a decisive role as a pillar of security and stability in Europe and Asia. Whether expansion of NATO to the east becomes a new offer of partnership or a step towards formation of an anti-Russia alliance depends almost exclusively on the outcome of internal transformations in Russia itself... But turning the future NATO into a hostage to the outcome of Russian transformations--is a way to eliminate the alliance." The authors believe that development of a "constructive policy" with respect to Ukraine is an important step in "movement eastward." In their view, in light of the indeterminate nature of prospects for democracy in Russia and the geopolitical position of Ukraine as "an important strategic buffer between Europe and Russia," Ukraine is "the best guarantee against a Russian imperial rebirth, bearing in mind Eastern Europe and especially Poland." The West therefore "must strongly resist any attempt by Russia to again incorporate Ukraine" within any kind of confederation. The Europe-ization of Ukraine must also be encouraged--the development of close ties between Ukraine and Central Europe, Ukraine's entry into common European and regional structures. These, in abbreviated form, are the main arguments and proposals of the American analysts regarding the need for possible transformation of the NATO bloc at this time. Interests of the United States If we are to critically analyze the main provisions of the article written by RAND researchers, the first thing that strikes us is the farfetched nature of their assertions--as though the former socialist countries of Central and Eastern Europe represent just about the main threat to European security in the postcommunist era, constituting a kind of regional powder keg ready to explode at any moment. It is entirely inappropriate to compare these countries with minor versions of Germany at the time of the Weimar Republic. There, as we know, a fragile democracy was unable to confront the rise of militant German chauvinism, and this led in the final analysis to the emergence of a fascist dictatorship inimical to the West. We also know that in addition to everything else, this German fascism was the reaction of Germans to the colossal national degradation they experienced as a result of their defeat in the First World War. The fall of the communist dictatorships in the countries of Eastern Europe was accompanied by directly opposing processes--emancipation, the rectification of nations, the acquisition of their proper dignity, clearly pro-Western tendencies. If here and there there have been flare-ups of "aggressive nationalism," these have been mainly anti-Russian in orientation, which aspect is explained by decades of Soviet domination. Therefore, a view of these countries as potentially fascist mini-dictatorships simply fails to conform to reality. Naturally there exists among the former socialist countries certain friction and contradictions, and there is the threat of their "Balkanization." But if we compare the degree of intensity of these contradictions with the levels of conflict and national irreconcilability in the former Yugoslavia, or in the Caucasus, where we see underway the bloodshed of interethnic wars, it is then clear even to the casual observer that this is on the whole a fairly prosperous and tranquil region. The peaceful division of Czechoslovakia without conflict into two sovereign states provides further confirmation of this. Why do the American analysts need to artificially demonize the former European socialist countries to such an extent? It is not difficult to find the answer if we proceed primarily from the "national interests" of the United States in Europe. NATO always was not only an organization for ensuring collective defense, but also a major instrument for domination--hegemony, if you will, of the United States in Europe. The preservation of NATO following conclusion of the Cold War is necessary primarily, according to the proponents of such a point of view, to avoid losing the role of leadership in European affairs. This explains to a significant degree the energetic search by the Americans for various new pretexts and justifications for prolonging the existence of the bloc. This search includes establishment of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, a distinctive forum for discussion of security issues which the former socialist countries and states of the CIS have joined; adoption of resolutions on the possible conduct by NATO of peacemaking missions by mandate of the United Nations or CSCE; the striving of the leadership of the alliance to effect release from control by the United Nations, in particular with respect to the possible conduct of operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina. (Footnote 2) (See NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, 17 September 1993; SEGODNYA, 23 September 1993) It is in this vein that we find the proposal of R. Asmus, R. Kugler, and S. Larrabee on the movement of NATO eastward to join the "Visegrad Group." It appears that the deliberate demonization of these countries is just a means of concealing their true intentions--of maintaining the dominant role of the United States in Europe. It should be noted that these proposals are supported most energetically by Germany which, as has been noted, is interested more than others in the stability of this region, and by the leadership of the alliance, in particular its Secretary General M. Woerner, who has expressed support for the swift joining of Poland and the Czech Republic but called for a more cautious approach with respect to Hungary and Slovakia, which are categorized as "regions of potential disturbances on ethnic grounds." Membership of these countries in NATO is advantageous to Washington at present, insofar as the geopolitical situation makes them interested to a significant degree in preserving the bloc and in maintaining the dominant role of the United States in it. Historically these states found themselves in the sphere of geopolitical confrontation between Germany and Russia. Today they fear not only a threat on the part of Russia, but on the part of the West as well--though to a lesser degree--in the form of a possible revival of Bonn's hegemonist aspirations. They view the United States and NATO as a counterweight and protection from the one as well as the other. It is from this consideration that the striving of these countries to join the alliance quickly proceeds. American analysts do not hide the interest of the United States in the former socialist countries. They write: "Their inclusion in NATO would strengthen the Atlantic orientation of the alliance and would ensure more significant internal support for U.S. positions on key security issues." At the same time they strive to present this as an unessential, secondary factor. With the end of the Cold War, the American Congress has appreciably reduced the military budget. The pull-out of American troops from Europe is proceeding fairly intensively and certain military bases and facilities are being closed. An appreciable reduction is being seen in the number of American officers in NATO command structures. Although they continue to reserve key positions for themselves, the armed forces of Germany are playing an increasingly significant role in the joint forces of the alliance. The process of integration of Western Europe within the EC framework is proceeding in parallel fashion. Following conclusion of the Maastricht accords and their approval by EC member states, a definitive course has been charted towards gradual transformation of the community into an economic and political alliance, and in the longer-term perspective--into a federation, i.e., a unified state. The military function has been entrusted to the West European Union, which should become a unique kind of ministry of defense of the European Community. (Footnote 3) (See USA--EPI, 1993, No. 2) France and Germany constitute the motive power for West European integration. In addition to everything else, they have set about creating a joint French-German army corps with strength of up to 35,000, which should become the nucleus of a future European army. The Euro-corps is subordinate to the West European Union but, as observers note, it could be transferred under certain circumstances to NATO command as well. On the whole, the West European Union is also considered to be the "European support" of NATO, but the relationship between the two organizations is far from finally resolved. While supporting West European integration in words, the United States is in actuality rather uncomfortable at the prospect, viewing this, and not without justification, as the emergence of a new competitor in the world arena. But the EC leadership is unambiguous in placing in doubt the advisability of NATO's continued existence and the current role of the United States in Europe. (Footnote 4) (Speaking in Brussels in September 1993, J. Delors, chairman of the Commission of European Communities, stated that NATO entails tremendous, unproductive expenses, that Europeans do not understand the meaning or necessity of the presence in peacetime of hundreds of thousands of American soldiers and dozens of military bases in Europe. He believes that even if NATO is preserved, Europeans must still create their own reliable defense, that it is intolerable for the United States to endlessly continue carrying out its mission in Europe--See NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, 17 September 1993.) By virtue of this, the proposal of the authors of the article in FOREIGN AFFAIRS to actively support West European integration can hardly be expected to find a response in the Clinton administration. After all, the stronger the European Community and West European Union are, the less the need on the part of West Europeans for security guarantees from the United States and NATO will be and the more inappropriate their presence in Europe. It is interesting that in calling for the Europe-ization of NATO, the authors in fact pay no attention to the main issue: To what extent is the United States prepared to allow a stronger role to be played by Europeans within the alliance, the Germans and French primarily? The answer, though veiled, can be found in the following passage: "Europe-ization of the alliance is just as much in the interests of the United States as it is in the interests of the Europeans. The United States may lose the ability to play a leading or significant role (emphasis mine--S.S.) in guaranteeing European security, unless it becomes part of a more equal partnership." In other words, the proposals on developing a new "general strategy" of the West, a new "trans-Atlantic agreement" between the United States and Western Europe serve in actuality only to conceal the following objective: in leaving Europe, to remain in it--and not just remain, but play "a leading or significant role." It is proposed that Europeans, Germany and France primarily, actively involve their armed forces in peacemaking and other missions of NATO outside the bounds of its "zone of responsibility" (in this regard, the strength of American forces in Europe is diminishing significantly; in the long term they may be withdrawn entirely). But the Americans intend, as before, to command the armed forces of the alliance--otherwise "a leading or significant role" will not be maintained. Incidentally, the U.S. leadership and NATO are proposing that Russia employ its armed forces in the execution of peacemaking missions of the alliance under similar conditions ("your soldiers--our command"). (Footnote 5) (See IZVESTIYA, 31 March 1993) It is not difficult to discern behind such approaches one of the traditional principles of American foreign policy--to attempt to secure its national interests using the hands of others. It is understandable that France, the most European-oriented country, might have every justification under such a version of NATO Europe-ization to continue to suspect the United States of hegemonistic aspirations. It is no accident that French Minister of Foreign Affairs A. Juppe stated in September 1993 that the country's foreign policy would continue to reject the possibility of dictatorship on the part of other states and would be aimed against aspirations to world leadership on the part of any country whatsoever. France sets European solidarity as the main priority, insofar as it cannot in isolation "maintain an equal footing" with the United States or with the rapidly developing countries of the Asian Pacific. Paris places Atlantic solidarity, i.e., cooperation with the United States and NATO, in second place as a means of guaranteeing security. As far as Germany is concerned, that country can hardly be expected to sharply broaden its participation in NATO operations as the American researchers are proposing, unless its role in the command structures of the bloc is appropriately enhanced. At the same time, if in the future a "Franco-Germanization" of NATO takes place in some manner, i.e., if the United States loses its command role in the alliance, the bloc will then be not NATO, not a trans-Atlantic organization, but rather a West European security structure. At that time, the need for existence of the West European Union may disappear as well. American taxpayers and the Congress, however, can hardly be expected to agree to finance U.S. presence in a military-political alliance in which their country is not playing the major role. Thus, the future of the North Atlantic alliance is not determined, and the proposals of R. Asmus, R. Kugler, and S. Larrabee regarding its "transformation" turn out upon close examination to be just new methods of attaining an old geostrategic objective--the preservation of United States leadership in Europe into the postcommunist era. How do the aspirations of the United States to preserve NATO and its position in Europe correlate with Russia's European-oriented interests? Is it really true, as the American analysts believe, that Russia's posture towards NATO and its possible expansion eastward will depend only on Russia itself--on whether democracy will be victorious or the country will revert to authoritarianism? How realistic are the West's opportunities to geopolitically "sever" Ukraine from Russia, as the American researchers propose? The Interests of Russia The main national state interests of Russia, including those oriented on Europe, proceed from the main historical mission Russia must resolve today. This mission may be concisely summed up as follows: Russia must transform itself in a historically brief period of time from a military superpower with an ineffective, half-destroyed economy and fractured self-consciousness into a great multinational, democratic power which is confident of itself, which possesses economic might and a high level of spiritual and moral authority. Clearly, Russia's natural partners in the outside world may come from among those centers of economic might that strive more than others to objectively cooperate with it and are prepared to render it assistance on nondiscriminatory terms. Russia's most natural partners are primarily its geographical neighbors who, proceeding from their own security considerations, are interested in preserving a stable--and consequently, a territorially integral--Russia. In Europe this is the integrational nucleus of the European Community--France and Germany. It should not be forgotten, of course, that the Roman-German civilization has historically related to Russia in a haughty and guarded manner. At the same time, however, history has taught Western Europe that the preservation of stability throughout the European continent depends to a great degree on the situation in Russia. The fact that the European Community, at the initiative of France, reacted instantaneously to the dramatic events in Moscow on 3-4 October 1993, through proposals to expand cooperation--is further confirmation of this. Naturally, if the United States is uncomfortable at the prospect of unification of, let us say, its Western civilization fellow comrades within the EC framework, a West European-Russian rapprochement can be expected to arouse in them far greater fears. And there can be no doubt but that the main instrument of opposition to this rapprochement may be NATO, as the simplest and most effective lever for exerting pressure on the West Europeans. In other words, in retaining command positions for the United States, NATO constitutes one of the main obstacles and impediments over the long term, standing in the way of resolving the Europe-oriented aspects of Russia's main historical mission. Thus, the strategic and long-term interests of Russia are served either by the dissolution of NATO, or by its unambiguous Europe-ization. Also running counter to the strategic interests of Russia is the possible eastward expansion of the alliance as a means of strengthening and "Atlant-izing" it. Does the foregoing mean that Russia should immediately demand that the alliance be dissolved? No, it does not. First of all, the future of NATO is basically a problem of American-West European relations, and Russia cannot seriously influence the fate of the alliance. But an interest is present on the part of Western Europe to preserve the alliance primarily on an anti-Russian basis. As researcher A. Arbatov writes, justifiably: "...the chief reason for preserving NATO in the foreseeable future remains all the same the unpredictability of the further development of events within Russia and the evolution of its foreign and military policy. (Footnote 6) (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, 1 October 1993) This is inevitable until such time as Russia either establishes a durable and stable democracy, or the West European defensive structure becomes so strong that it is able to replace the United States and the present NATO in the role of guarantor of security. Both of these processes will most likely require more than a decade to achieve. Over the course of this lengthy period of time, it is perhaps foolish for Russia to propose initiatives on the dissolution of NATO. Especially since preservation of the alliance during the transition period also meets certain of its interests, those related primarily to the German problem. Presently it is unclear as to what limits and in what forms the most powerful economic country in Europe--united Germany--intends to augment its political role in the world. Its striving to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council is just one orientation of this augmentation. Without a doubt, the FRG is today an integral part of the West, through its system of bilateral and multilateral agreements, and its return to the military imperialism of the past is impossible. But it is also a fact that fears exist among the West European countries under Nazi occupation during the years of World War II regarding a revival of German hegemonism, perhaps in an economic form. Historical memory is also alive in Russia with respect to the misfortunes and horrors brought by the war against Nazism. Russia is therefore interested first and foremost in preserving NATO during the transition period as a tried and tested instrument of exerting control over Germany on the part of the West. Here the interests of the United States and Russia coincide. How long interest in this question remains depends chiefly on the course of Germany's foreign policy. But NATO is unsuited to the role of effective peacemaker in Europe, a role R. Asmus, R. Kugler, and S. Larrabee are promoting, despite the presence in it of the required military command and control and logistics infrastructure, and the low efficiency of the EC and CSCE in settling interethnic conflicts. As Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs A. Kozyrev noted, the expansion of NATO itself will not accomplish the tasks of providing effective counteraction to interethnic conflicts, and will even "lead inevitably to a unique kind of hidden confrontation, and thus in the final analysis--to instability." (Footnote 7) (MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, 26 September 1993) Moreover, NATO has retained its anti-Russia orientation even after the end of the Cold War. Following President B. Yeltsin's statement in Poland on Russia's understanding of the problem of Poland's possible entry into NATO, steps followed in factual disavowal of this statement. Specifically, a letter was sent to Western leaders bearing the president's signature which expressed a warning against NATO expansion by virtue of inclusion of the former socialist countries of Eastern Europe, and which proposed that the security of this region be provided through joint guarantees on the part of the alliance and Russia. (Footnote 8) (IZVESTIYA, 2 October 1993) In addition, the very existence of NATO, in the mass consciousness of Russians, at a time when the Warsaw Pact and the USSR have collapsed, is perceived as a symbol of national humiliation and as the victory of the United States in the Cold War. Whether or not these ideas--emerging from decades of Soviet propaganda--are false is a separate issue. But the ideas are entirely real. In other words, the very existence of NATO, not to mention the possibility of its eastward expansion, creates a foreign policy background favorable for the strengthening within Russia of the positions of anti-American political forces. In this sense we cannot help but share the view of O. Harris, editor in chief of the American journal NATIONAL INTEREST, who writes: "To attempt to incorporate Eastern Europe within NATO's sphere of influence, at a time when Russia is in a state of dangerous disarray and its national prestige and self-confidence are deeply undermined, would definitively constitute an act of extreme stupidity." (Footnote 9) (Quote from FOREIGN AFFAIRS, October 1993, p. 43.) In his opinion, extremist and chauvinist elements both within Russia itself and outside it would use this against the West. He believes that with the disappearance of the Soviet threat, the need for a political organization of the NATO variety has also disappeared. Possible NATO actions would not remain outside the field of view of Russian public opinion and would exert an influence on the political leadership of Russia regardless of who is in power. Russian public opinion would most likely react negatively to NATO operations in the former Yugoslavia if Serbian positions were subject to bombing or if peacemaking operations were carried out near the Western Russian borders, i.e., in the eastern "arc of instability," especially in territory of the CIS. A mandate from the United Nations or CSCE would hardly change anything. The reaction of Russians to possible NATO expansion by virtue of including the former socialist countries would most likely be negative. In this manner, active peacemaking by NATO beyond the confines of its own territory on the European continent or possible NATO expansion eastward with the objectively retained anti-Russia orientation of the alliance--is not a path towards enhancing stability but, on the contrary, will intensify mistrust and alienation between the West and Russia. Consequently, in the final analysis this is a path of intensifying instability in Europe. What are the possible outlines of Russian policy with regard to NATO? It is felt that in the long-term perspective, the existence of NATO contradicts the strategic interests of Russia in Europe, insofar as the anti-Russian orientation of this alliance is objectively maintained in the postcommunist era. NATO has fulfilled its basic historical mission, and the continued existence of this alliance can be viewed only as a temporary measure necessary for a transition period, until such time as a new security system in Europe is built naturally. The structural foundation of such a system must be West European and Russian forces, the "blue helmets" of Europe. It is felt that Russia must abandon any provision of support to initiatives aimed at artificially prolonging the existence of NATO. In particular, it must not move towards active interaction with the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, should not support the striving of the alliance leadership to remove itself from United Nations control, and must be especially rigid in opposing the possible expansion of NATO eastward. Insofar as continued existence of the alliance meets most of all the national interests of the United States, it is best to allow the American politicians themselves to justify before the world community, Europeans, and their own people the need for extending the life of their offspring even following the end of the Cold War. At the same time, it is not in the interests of Russia to fight in favor of immediate dissolution of the alliance, first and foremost because of the German problem. A gradual, natural process is underway of withdrawal of the Americans from Europe, the Europe-ization of NATO, and simultaneous strengthening of the European Community and West European Union, which suits the interests of the Russian Federation. It would be foolish to attempt to incite these processes onward--as they are mainly outside the realm of Russia's influence. Time will tell as to what form and which of the two (or even both military-political alliances) will survive in the final analysis. It is important for Russia that there be no organized structure in Europe capable of effectively opposing the expansion of its cooperation with the West Europeans. But if during the course of the transition period, an armed conflict flares up near the western borders of Russia that demands NATO involvement, a settlement of the conflict must be pursued only jointly with Russia, in which regard not only the peacemaking forces themselves must be united, but their command elements as well. With regard to security guarantees for the former socialist countries of Eastern Europe, in my view Russia should encourage their convergence with the EC and West European Union and strongly oppose their striving to join NATO. It seems that such an approach will find the support of the Europe-ists and Germany. And this will secure for the former socialist countries the Western guarantees of security they so desire. The main road leading to creation of a system of common European security must be transformation of CSCE from an amorphous mass into a strong international organization with its own Security Council and its own peacemaking forces capable of swiftly and effectively providing warning and extinguishing armed conflicts. The directive organs of such an organization could be located in the former socialist countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
