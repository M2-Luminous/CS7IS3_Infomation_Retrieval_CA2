FR940928-2-00033 FR940928-2-00029 [OPP&hyph;30354A; FRL&hyph;4909&hyph;9] Ciba-Geigy Corp.; Approval of Pesticide Product Registrations AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice announces Agency approval of applications submitted by Ciba-Geigy Corporation, to conditionally register the pesticide products Dividend Fungicide and Technical CGA-169374, containing a new active ingredient not included in any previously registered products pursuant to the provisions of section 3(c)(7)(C) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Cynthia Giles-Parker, Product Manager (PM) 22, Registration Division (7505C), Office of Pesticide Programs, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 229, CM #2, Environmental Protection Agency, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy, Arlington, VA 22202, (703&hyph;305&hyph;5540). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA issued a notice, published in the Federal Register of October 21, 1993 (58 FR 54351), which announced that Ciba-Geigy Corp., P.O. Box 18300, Greensboro, NC 27419&hyph;8300, had submitted applications to register the pesticide products Dividend Fungicide and Technical CGA-169374 (EPA File Symbols 100&hyph;TUN and 100&hyph;TGO) containing the active ingredient difenoconazole [(2S,4R) / (2R,4S)] / [2R,4R/2S,4S)] 1-(2-[4-(4-chlorophenoxy)-2-chlorophenyl]-4-methyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-yl-methyl)-1 H -1,2,4-triazole at 32 and 92 percent respectively~, an active ingredient not included in any previously registered products. ~ These applications ~were approved on August 4, 1994, as Dividend Fungicide (EPA Registration Number 100&hyph;740) as a seed treatment for control of diseases on wheat and Technical CGA-169374 (EPA Registration Number 100&hyph;739) for formulation into end-use fungicide products. A conditional registration may be granted under section 3(c)(7)(C) of FIFRA for a new active ingredient where certain data are lacking, on condition that such data are received by the end of the conditional registration period and do not meet or exceed the risk criteria set forth in 40 CFR 154.7; that use of the pesticide during the conditional registration period will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment; and that use of the pesticide is in the public interest. The Agency has considered the available data on the risks associated with the proposed use of difenoconazole~~ and information on social, economic, and environmental benefits to be derived from such use. Specifically, the Agency has considered the nature of the chemical and its pattern of use, application methods and rates, and level and extent of potential exposure. Based on these reviews, the Agency was able to make basic health and safety determinations which show that use of difenoconazole~~ during the period of conditional registration is not expected to cause any unreasonable adverse effect on the environment, and that use of the pesticide is in the public interest. Adequate chemistry, toxicological, ecological effects, and environmental fate data have been submitted and reviewed to support the conditional registration of difenoconazole for use as a seed treatment fungicide of wheat. The terms of the conditional registration will require Ciba-Geigy to submit Stability of the Technical Grade Active Ingredient (TGAI) to Metal Ions Study [Guideline Number 63&hyph;13], Storage Stability of difenoconazole in other Raw Agricultural Commodities [171&hyph;4(e)], and additional Wheat Field Residue Trials [171&hyph;4(k)]. Consistent with section 3(c)(7)(C), the Agency has determined that these conditional registrations are in the public interest. Use of the pesticides are of significance to the user community, and appropriate labeling, use directions, and other measures have been taken to ensure that use of the pesticides will not result in unreasonable adverse effects to man and the environment. More detailed information on these conditional registrations is contained in an EPA Pesticide Fact Sheet on difenoconazole. ~~A copy of the fact sheet, which provides a summary description of the chemical, use patterns and formulations, science findings, and the Agency's regulatory position and rationale, may be obtained from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. In accordance with section 3(c)(2) of FIFRA, a copy of the approved label and the list of data references used to support registration are available for public inspection in the office of the Product Manager listed above. The data and other scientific information used to support registration, except for material specifically protected by section 10 of FIFRA, are available for public inspection in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. 1132, CM #2, Arlington, VA 22202 (703&hyph;305&hyph;5805). Requests for data must be made in accordance with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act and must be addressed to the Freedom of Information Office (A&hyph;101), 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Such requests should: (1) Identify the product name and registration number and (2) specify the data or information desired. Authority: 7 U.S.C. 136.
