[passage omitted] The Pakistani ambassador presented his credentials to the president of Kyrgyzstan. [Begin Akayev recording] Esteemed ambassador, I am pleased to receive your credentials on this important day and congratulate you sincerely on the occasion of your appointment as ambassador of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan to Kyrgyzstan. You represent the country with a centuries-old unique history and rich culture, which gained its independence in 1947 and achieved great success on this path. The founder of the state Mohammad Ali Jinnah [the first governor general of Pakistan] saw Pakistan as a democratic state and [word indistinct] where the ideas of humanity and equality have been embodied in the [word indistinct] state institutions. A great many of Pakistan's leaders dedicated their lives to that, among whom we can name Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, and the current Prime Minister of Pakistan Benazir Bhutto, and of course the president of Pakistan. Today's event is an important stage for Kyrgyzstan and Pakistan. Pakistan is one of our closest neighbors and we cooperate within the framework of different international organizations, including the Organization for Economic Cooperation, the Islamic Conference Organization, and on a bilateral basis. Representatives from different ministries and departments of our countries have established their first but very promising contacts. The fact of Pakistan granting us a credit worth $10 million last year was an important stage in our relations. It was channelled for the development of health care of Kyrgyzstan. Dear ambassador, by accrediting you as the first ambassador of Pakistan to Kyrgyzstan, we give a new impetus to Kyrgyzstan-Pakistan cooperation today, which I believe could become mutually beneficial and fruitful in future and serve the purpose of strengthening peace, stability and security in our region. To sum up, I would like to assure you, Mr. Mohammad Khan, that you can count on full support from me and the Government of Kyrgyzstan in fulfilling your historic mission. [end recording]
