He made his request at a meeting with members of the Dutch Government in The Hague. It is not yet clear whether the Netherlands is prepared to take on the role of mediator. 'Arafat said the peace talks with Israel have reached a critical phase. If agreement on Palestinian autonomy is not reached soon, he said, the credibility of the peace process will be threatened.
