FBIS4-53821 "dreas100_j_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-100 Daily Report 22 May 1994 Indonesia Czech Minister Arrives on Trade Mission Czech Minister Arrives on Trade Mission BK2305142394 Jakarta ANTARA in English 1541 GMT 22 May 94 BK2305142394 Jakarta ANTARA English BFN [Text] Jakarta, May 22 (ANTARA) -- The Czech Government will help promote Indonesian export products to the East European country with a view to correct the imbalance of trade between the two countries which last year was in Indonesia's disfavour involving four million US dollars. The promotion through a trade fair was expected to be one way of exploiting the potentials of the Czech market, said Czech Minister of Industry and Trade Vladimir Dlouhy upon arrival in Jakarta Sunday. Through the exhibition in that country, the public and businessmen there will have the opportunity to know more about Indonesian manufactured and plantation products, Dlouhy said at the Sukarno-Hatta International Airport where he was greeted by Director General of Foreign Trade Joko Mulyono. Last year, Indonesia's exports to the East European country reached a value of 10.5 million US dollars and the imports from that country were estimated at 14.5 million dollars. Another way which would be tried, according to the first Czech high government official who visited Indonesia, would be to increase the meetings between the businessmen of the two countries to enable them to know their respective market potentials. He said his mission to Indonesia included 25 businessmen of major companies engaged in the automotive, aviation, steel, road construction, textile, funding, rubber, chemicals, cement and engineering industries. They were expected to explore possibilities of trade and investment between the two countries, he added. Indonesia's export commodities to the East European country included textile, tin and natural rubber, while the commodities imported from that country included machinery and chemicals. On the occasion, Dlouhy said during his stay in Indonesia he was also scheduled to sign a new trade agreement between the two countries after Czechoslovakia split into two. The Czech officials will also discuss matters relating to investment guarantee and the prevention of double taxation with Indonesian Government authorities. While in Indonesia from May 22 through 25, Dlouhy will meet Coordinating Minister for Industry and Trade Hartarto, Trade Minister Judono, State Minister for National Development Planning/Chairman of the National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas) Ginanjar Kartasasmita, Finance Minister Mar'ie Mohammad, Bank Indonesia Governor Sudrajad Jiwandono, head of the National Agency for Export Promotion (BPEN) and the board of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KADIN). In the meantime, third secretary of the Czech Embassy in Jakarta Zdenek Darebnik [name as received] said trade between the two countries can now be conducted by l/c [letter of credit] and payment with the US dollar as hard currency. He said the dispatch of goods from Indonesia to his country no longer posed a problem to the trade between the two countries because the Czech airline company also made a stopover at Singapore. The shipment of goods by sea can also be carried out via the ports in Germany and Poland, he said.
