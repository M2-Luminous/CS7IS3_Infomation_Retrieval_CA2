In order to gain in political life, Serb doctors call on Milosevic administration to radicalize their policy towards preventing the natality of Albanians. Alexander Andrijevic, installed director of the maternity ward in the Clinic in Prishtina, told Serb-run Prishtina Television, that besides the measures taken up to date, "births for the Republic of Kosova continue and there is no sign that the rate of birth among the primitive world of Albanians will drop." Recent public declarations of Andrijevic finally reveal their clear political intentions. He was determined to "stop this flow of babies," even if he must commit crimes. The project in which Andrijevic is engaged intends to control the birth rate by deciding how many babies should live and how many should die, how many Albanian women should undergo surgery in order to eliminate their uterus, etc. Yet, in order to reach some results, Andrijevic requires the assistance of Serbian administration, ends an article published by today's Prishtina-based BUJKU.
