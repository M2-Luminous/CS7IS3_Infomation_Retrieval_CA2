FR940406-2-00178 FR940406-2-00096 Wednesday April 6, 1994 Part XIV Department of Energy Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for Waste Management at the Savannah River Site; Notices Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 66␣/␣Wednesday, April 6, 1994␣/␣Notices DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for Waste Management at the Savannah River Site AGENCY: Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy (DOE) announces its intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for waste management at the Savannah River Site, and to conduct a public scoping process pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.). The purpose of the Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS is to provide a basis for DOE to select a sitewide strategic approach to managing present and future Savannah River Site waste generated as a result of ongoing operations, environmental restoration activities, transition from nuclear production to other missions, and decontamination and decommissioning programs. This EIS will support project-level decisions on the operation of specific treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within the near term (10 years and less). In addition, this EIS will provide a baseline for analyses of future waste management activities and a basis for the evaluation of the specific waste management alternatives. The preparation of the Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS will be in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act, the Council on Environmental Quality National Environmental Policy Act Regulations (40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508), and the DOE National Environmental Policy Act Regulations (10 CFR part 1021). Background information on the Savannah River Site and issues proposed to be considered in this EIS are presented in the Supplementary Information below. DOE is also announcing today its intent to prepare a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement on the Defense Waste Processing Facility at the Savannah River Site. (See the notice in this issue of the Federal Register .) DOE invites individuals, organizations, and agencies to comment on issues to be considered, alternatives to be analyzed, and environmental impacts to be addressed in the Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS. Written and oral comments will be given equal weight. Written comments should be directed to Stephen R. Wright at the address below. Oral comments may be presented by voice mail at the telephone number below. Interested parties are invited to present comments at three public scoping meetings to be held at the dates and places indicated below. Additional notice will be given in appropriate local media. At the scoping meetings and informal information sessions to be held one month earlier, DOE also will provide the public with an opportunity to have information discussions with DOE representatives regarding waste management at the Savannah River Site. The scoping process and procedures are described in the Supplementary Information below. DATES: The public scoping period for the Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS begins with the publication of this notice and continues until May 31, 1994. Written comments submitted by mail should be postmarked by that date to ensure consideration. DOE will consider comments mailed after that date to the extent practicable. DOE will host a series of informal information sessions to provide the public with additional information on waste management at the Savannah River Site and the proposed actions and alternatives discussed in this Notice of Intent. These sessions are intended to promote conversation with DOE representatives available to answer questions. These informal sessions are scheduled at the following times and locations: April 12, 1994; 1&hyph;4 and 6&hyph;9 p.m.; North Augusta Community Center, 495 Brookside Avenue, North Augusta, South Carolina.

DOE will then conduct public scoping meetings to assist in defining the appropriate scope of the Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS and identifying significant environmental issues to be addressed. DOE representatives will be available at the meetings to discuss, in informal conversations, Savannah River Site waste management. These meetings are scheduled at the following times and locations: May 12, 1994; 1&hyph;4 and 6&hyph;9 p.m.; Coastal Georgia Center for Continuing Education, 305 Martin Luther King Boulevard (Battlefield Park), Savannah Georgia.
