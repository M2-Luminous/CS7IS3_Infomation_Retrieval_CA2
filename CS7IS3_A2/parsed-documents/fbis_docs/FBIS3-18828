He disclosed that he had today formally agreed that the UK would contribute to the training of a Baltic joint peacekeeping battalion composed of contingents from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. This was part of a phased multi-national programme of assistance, Mr Rifkind said at question time. He added: "The UK's contribution will be led by the Royal Marines who will provide individual and company level training." A Defence Ministry statement said the move followed a recent meeting at which the defence ministers of the three Baltic states indicated their wish to accept UK and Nordic offers of assistance. The statement added: "The UK fully supports the Baltic states' intention to form a joint peacekeeping battalion and welcomes the prospect that, once established and trained, the battalion would be available for UN peacekeeping duties. ``This is an important venture, both politically and militarily, and provides a tangible demonstration of outward-looking Baltic cooperation, and an opportunity to further consolidate and build on the excellent progress already made in strengthening political and military relations between the UK and the Baltic States.'' The precise nature of assistance was now being examined by experts and officials would meet later this month in Copenhagen to agree the next stages, the statement added.
