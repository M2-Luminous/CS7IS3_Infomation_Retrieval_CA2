During the meeting Dr. Sayf Sa'il briefed the press and news agency correspondents on the latest developments in the military and political situation in the Yemeni arena. During his briefing, he said that the social and political forces, which were organizing and pushing the war were fossilized fundamentalists, besides some shaykh-based and backward tribalist forces and some totalitarian bureaucratic civilian and military leaders in the Sanaa regime. He said that the basic objectives of these forces was not the defense of unity but the imposition of a backward, fundamentalist, military, totalitarian and dictatorial regime in Yemen which would strike down everything relating to modernism, democracy, and civilization, thus taking Yemen many steps backward. He said that the victims of this war were the Yemeni people who had no control over their affairs regardless of their groups or whether they were elderly people, heroes, men or women. The war had consumed thousands of people, destroyed the economic and military foundations of Yemen, and destabilized the moral and cultural ideals of the Yemeni people [passage omitted] In his reply to a question connected with the position of the Governorate of Aden, Dr. Sayf Sa'il said that Aden would be a hard nut to crack and we would not allow it to fall, whatever the price. He pointed out that great victories had been achieved in the governorates of Shabwah, al-Dali, and Radfan and yet one should not talk about victories in this war because the Yemeni people were its fuel. With regard to the position relating to the UN Security Council decision and the mission of Lakhdar Brahimi, the envoy of the UN secretary general, Dr. Sayf Sa'il said: We welcomed the Security Council resolution when it was issued and announced our commitment to it. However, the other side is the one that violates this resolution. It verbalizes its commitment to it but on the ground it practices the opposite under the illusion of achieving victories and imposing a fait accompli. This is false and deceptive for those laboring under it. In conclusion, he referred to the importance of the role of Lakhdar Brahimi and said: We are awaiting his arrival in Aden because the urgent task is to stop the war and later settle the dispute through dialogue.
