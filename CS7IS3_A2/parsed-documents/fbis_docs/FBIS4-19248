The foreign minister announced this morning that the 430 men taking part in the UN mission in Rwanda, UNAMIR, would in no circumstances stay in Rwanda whatever the UN Security Council might decide tonight. The Belgian Government feels that the UN mission has become pointless. Jean-Michel Moestart reports: [Begin recording] [Claes] This is not a purely selfish reaction aimed just at the Belgian blue helmets. We do not think that the presence of blue helmets of whatever nationality, in the current circumstances, with their current mandate, or even with a stronger mandate, has any raison d'etre. [Moestart] Does this mean that we are getting ready to shoot the Africans in the back? [Claes] Not at all. We are as concerned as anyone else about the plight of the Rwandans, who are, it seems, all in a stadium in Kigali or in the [name indistinct] hospital in Kigali. We have received a lot of calls in the last 24 hours from people, from members of organizations, telling us we should evacuate some Rwandan or another. I fully understand that, and I respect it, but I would also like to ask all these people how they think we can do this, by what means. How many risks can we ask our paras to take? At the moment they can only travel in armored vehicles. [end recording)
