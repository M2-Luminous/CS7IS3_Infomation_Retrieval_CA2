FR941006-2-00229 FR941006-2-00114 Thursday October 6, 1994 Part V Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration Truck Size and Weight; Vehicle Size and Weight Limits in Metric Units; Notice Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 193␣/␣Thursday, October 6, 1994␣/␣Notices DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Highway Administration [FHWA Docket No. 94&hyph;20] Truck Size and Weight; Vehicle Size and Weight Limits in Metric Units AGENCY: Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of interpretation; opportunity for comments. SUMMARY: The FHWA has initiated a phased 5-year plan to convert its activities and business operations to the Metric System of Measurements as required by the 1988 amendments to the Metric Conversion Act of 1975. Details of the FHWA metric conversion policy and plan were published in the Federal Register on June 11, 1992 (57 FR 24843). The plan calls for the conversion to be completed by September 30, 1996. FHWA regulations currently specify vehicle size and weight limits and certain distances in English units. This notice converts the most commonly used of these units to their metric equivalents and provides guidance for the public to make similar conversions. DATES: Comments on this interpretation should be submitted by January 4, 1995. ADDRESSES: Submit written, signed comments to the FHWA Docket No. 94&hyph;20, Room 4232, HCC&hyph;10, Office of Chief Counsel, Federal Highway Administration, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. All comments received will be available for examination at the above address from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., e.t., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. Those desiring notification of receipt of comments must include a self-addressed, stamped postcard. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Thomas Klimek, Office of Motor Carrier Information Management, (202) 366&hyph;2212 or Mr. Charles Medalen, Office of the Chief Counsel, (202) 366&hyph;1354, Federal Highway Administration, Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. Office hours are from 7:45 a.m. to 4:15 p.m., e.t., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The English unit values for Federal size (length and width) and weight limits are set by law (49 U.S.C. app. 2311, 2316 and 23 U.S.C. 127, respectively). The conversion of these values to metric equivalents is not intended to change the law. However, public acceptance of the metric system will be considerably delayed unless regulatory limits are reasonably easy to use, remember, and enforce. The Congress enacted the current single-axle, tandem- axle, and gross weight limits_20,000, 34,000, and 80,000 pounds, respectively_for economic and engineering reasons, but it obviously chose round numbers to promote compliance and ease of enforcement. That policy is also embodied in the Bridge Formula, where calculated weights must be rounded to the nearest 500 pounds [23 U.S.C. 127(a)], producing a weight table with increments of exactly 500 or 1,000 pounds. In other words, the legal limit could be nearly 250 pounds higher or lower than the figure generated by the formula. The Congress balanced its interest in establishing precise and accurate weight limits with the need to make a complex proposal more workable. Similarly, the FHWA believes that some compromises are necessary to reconcile the statutory mandates to enforce size and weight limits denominated in English units with the goal to promote conversion of all measurements to the metric system. Consider, for example, the maximum weight for a tandem axle, 34,000 pounds. The precise metric equivalent is 15,422.4 kilograms. Converting to a fractional value is obviously impractical, and the nearest whole kilogram is an awkward number also. One kilogram represents 65 ten- thousandths of 1 percent (.0065 percent) of 15,422 kilograms. In an industry where scales are considered acceptable if they are accurate to within 0.2 percent, 1 kilogram has little meaning. Similarly, a 48-foot trailer is 14.6304 meters long. Enforcement officers are not in a position to measure ten-thousandths of a meter, but all Metric devices for measuring length are calibrated in hundredths of a meter.
