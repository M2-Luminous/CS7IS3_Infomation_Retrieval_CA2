However, we have to probe and address the specific issues that still exist on how to make the shareholding transformation truly invigorate enterprises and how to operate state-owned property more effectively. 1. The issue on rationalizing the purposes and the behaviors. Motives are varied for people to feel enthusiastic for the shareholding transformation of enterprises. Individuals who buy stocks wish to become rich. Some enterprises conduct the shareholding transformation either for the purpose of raising funds to develop themselves and repay debts or for winning preferential policies, and others do so as they are ordered. Government departments chiefly want to promote reform or to show off their reform achievements. The objective existence of the various purposes of the shareholding transformation should be permitted, but effective policy and organizational measures should be drawn up to standardize the behaviors of the various sectors so that their purposes and behaviors will become rational and the healthy development of the shareholding transformation can be guaranteed. This writer holds that the shareholding transformation of state-owned enterprises is, in essence, a reform of the organizational system of the ownership of state-owned assets and a change in the measures for operating the ownership of state-owned assets. The purpose of the reform, from the microeconomic viewpoints, is to suit the needs in developing the market economy and, through the change in the organizational form of state-owned assets, to rationalize enterprises' property right relations, determine the legal person status of enterprises, strengthen enterprises' internal mechanism of restraint, and manage the value of state-owned assets. From macroeconomic viewpoints, the purpose is to effectively develop the leading role of state economies, adjust the operating scope and structure of state-owned assets, establish a perfect monetary market system, and improve the mechanism for the optimal distribution of state-owned assets. When the purposes of the shareholding transformation of state-owned enterprises are clarified, we should, starting from the experimenting period of the reform, attach great importance to the organic combination of reform with development and with management and strengthen the specialized functions of the departments in charge of the ownership of state-owned assets and the macro-control and guiding role of the departments in charge of overall economic functions and the departments in charge of various trades, so that the shareholding transformation will truly facilitate the change of enterprises' operating mechanism and the adjustment of the industrial structure. 2. The issue on defining property rights and appraising assets. Unclear enterprise property ownership is a common and major difficulty and obstacle to the current shareholding transformation. Under the traditional planned economy system, enterprises' property right relations and their administrative relations were identical, but the property ownership relations of many enterprises have become very complicated due to the several changes in the managerial system. In some enterprises, ownership has changed several times due to historical reasons. Their assets were first invested by collectives and then invested by local government departments. This plus their later implementation of the managerial system similar to local state-owned enterprises has resulted in the very unclear original property right relations and the great change in the property right owners, making it very complicated to define the property right. In addition, unified and clear policy regulations are lacking on the ownership of the property resulting from tax reduction and exemption and the definition of central and local ownership of state-owned property. This writer holds that the definition of property right is a kind of policy work concerning not only the protection of the rights and interests of the ownership of state-owned property but also the appraisal of relevant historical policies. It requires that the state study and formulate unified policies. When enterprises' property right is clarified, appraisals of assets are needed, which involve the standards for the appraisals and the measures for converting assets into shares. As far as specific work is concerned, there are two measures. One is converting assets into shares according to the original book value and using the income from selling the shares at higher prices to make up for the losses resulting from the appreciation of the assets after the appraisals. The other is converting the assets into shares according to their appraised value. This writer holds that the former is not a proper measure. First, the current shareholding transformation of state-owned enterprises is conducted on the basis of the newly established limited liability stock companies or limited liability companies. It is not meant to increase the funds and expand the original state-owned stock companies. Therefore, the transformation, in fact, consists of two stages: 1) making inventory of the original assets or some assets of enterprises and determining the current prices of the assets and 2) establishing new shareholding enterprises and canceling the original legal person status of enterprises. By then, the original assets of enterprises, as the property of the founders of the new enterprises, are invested in the new enterprises along with the property of other shareholders to become the capital of the new enterprises. The combination of the appraisals of enterprises' original assets with the fund raising of new enterprises embodies the principle of same profits for same shares, and assets should be converted into shares according to the current prices only. Second, correct appraisals of assets and converting them into shares constitute the key to safeguarding the proper rights and interests of the various beneficiaries. If the original state-owned assets of enterprises are converted into shares according to the book value and the difference between the book value and the appraised value is made up for with the income from selling the shares at higher prices, the rights and interests of state-owned shareholders and other shareholders, no doubt, will be damaged. 3. The issue on converting the right to the use of state-owned land into shares. Many enterprises, especially large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, take up large areas of land, and some of them are even located in the high-priced "golden" sections of cities. If all the land use right is converted into shares, the value of the assets of these enterprises will be doubled and redoubled, and the profit rate of the assets will definitely decline, which is detrimental for shareholding enterprises to attract investment from society when they issue shares. In doing their specific work, all localities have adopted fairly flexible ways to handle this issue. This writer holds that the essence of this issue is the optimization of the efficiency in operating the two types of state-owned assets (the original assets of state-owned enterprises and the right to the use of state-owned land). We should correctly distinguish the state-owned land used as assets and that used as resources and include the right to the use of the state-owned land that is converted into shares in the management of state-owned assets. Meanwhile, to improve the efficiency in using and operating state-owned land, the right to the use of state-owned land should be managed like enterprises, and companies specializing in the management of assets should be established to change the administrative management of assets. An enterprise should consider two factors to determine whether to convert the land use right into shares. On the one hand, the advantage in converting land use right into shares is the increase in the state-owned capital of the enterprises transformed in line with the shareholding system and the reduction of cost resulting from the exemption of the new shareholding enterprises from paying rent for the land. The disadvantage is the decline of the profit rate of enterprise assets during the transformation, which makes the shares less attractive. On the other hand, when the land use right is not converted into shares, the shares of the enterprises become more attractive, but state-owned funds will decrease because the operation cost of the transformed new enterprises will increase after they pay rents for the land. Under such circumstances, initiators of the new shareholding enterprises will have to weigh the cost of fund raising upon establishment and the later cost of operation; and managers of the right to the use of state-owned land will have to weigh the collection of dividends and the collection of rents. 4. The issue on the shareholding transformation of some assets of enterprises. The shareholding transformation of state-owned enterprises can be conducted in two ways. One is transforming all the assets of the enterprises, which leads to the cancellation of the legal person status of the enterprises. The other is transforming some assets of enterprises and, while retaining the legal person status of the enterprises, establishing new shareholding enterprises whose shares are also held by the original legal persons. Due to numerous reasons, some large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises have difficulty in transforming all their assets for the time being. They tend to convert some of their assets (certain branch plants or workshops) into shares. This writer holds that both ways are feasible, but attention should be given to the following when doing specific work. First, both ways of transformation are restructuring of the ownership of state-owned assets, on which the ultimate decisions should be made by the owners of the assets of the enterprises, namely the government, and which should be included in the local plans for the operating scope, organization, and structural adjustment of state-owned assets and never be decided by enterprises themselves just because they transform some of their assets. Second, the shareholding transformation of some assets should be conducted in such a way that they hold the legal person status. In other words, when transformed in line with the shareholding system, these parts of the assets are separated from and become subcompanies of the original enterprises and hold the civil responsibilities independently with their own property. Third, attention should be given to the difference between transformation of all the assets and transformation of some parts of the assets. Generally speaking, the former is the lateral reform of the organizational system of the property right of state-owned enterprises, which, in general, leads to a change in the enterprises from ones exclusively funded by the state into shareholding ones with mixed ownership. The latter is the vertical reform of the organization of the property right of state-owned enterprises, which leads to a dual ownership of state-owned assets, splitting the enterprise assets directly owned by the state formerly into two parts, with one directly owned by the state and the other indirectly owned by the state. Due to the different structure of property right, the government will adopt different ways to manage their property right.
