The sources said the major shipbuilder in the Sumitomo conglomerate made a consultant contract with a company run by the head of the rightist group in Osaka Prefecture, after the shipbuilder won a contract last August to build the incinerator in Tsukuba, Ibaraki Prefecture. The company paid 140 million yen into the account of the company run by the rightist under the name of a consultation fee, the sources said. Rumors of bid-rigging surrounded the incinerator project and another rightist group had criticized the bid from a truck equipped with loudspeakers near Tsukuba's City Hall and at the mayor's house in late November last year, just before the ceremony to begin building the incinerator. The president of the rightist group which made the consultant contract with Sumitomo Heavy Industries requested the other rightist group to stop its criticisms at that time, according to the sources. A public relations official of Sumitomo Heavy Industries refused to comment on the allegations.
