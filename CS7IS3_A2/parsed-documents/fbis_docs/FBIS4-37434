In a statement in Amman today, the deputies said: We think that these agreements represent a Jordanian retreat from the constant principles reiterated repeatedly by the officials, mainly, rejecting unilateral peace, adhering to the Islamic and Arab character of Jerusalem, and the right of the refugees to return to their usurped country. The Jordanian IAF deputies stressed their condemnation and rejection of this approach that is being pursued by the Jordanian government, contrary to the attitudes of the Jordanian people who reject all these concessions, noting that the opinion of the Jordanian people and their representatives was not sought on these negotiations that target their land, destiny, and future. Also, the Jordanian Arab Constitutional Front Party has asserted that Syria represents the strong spirit of the Arabs in the face of the enemies of the Arab nation and their supporters. In a statement today, the party said: At a time when we were expecting to consolidate and expand cooperation and coordination between Jordan and fraternal Syria to overcome this serious, decisive stage of the peace talks, the new Jordanian position to resume the Jordanian-Israeli negotiations in Washington came as a destructive turning point for the Arab position in its stronger Damascus-Amman-Beirut front. The statement went on: Our Jordanian people were surprised by this serious turning point which was peddled by diverting the attention of the people by what preceded the recent cabinet reshuffle and the statements about more coordination and cohesion between Syria and Jordan. The Jordanian officials themselves said that coordination enhances the Arab negotiating position to a level that can force the occupiers to submit to the resolutions of international legitimacy by withdrawing from all the occupied Arab territories. The statement added that the new position of the Jordanian government, whose head had led the negotiations before he assumed the premiership, constitutes an imminent danger to Jordan and the Palestinian cause and is an offense to the requirements of coordination and cooperation between the Arab brothers in Syria and Lebanon. It added that all that Syria is facing is on account of its adherence to Arab rights, embodied in the constant principles of the nation, noting that Syria is standing like a solid wall in the face of all international pressures and Arab deviations. The statement concluded: The new policy of the Jordanian government will lead us to an inevitable national disaster. Jordan -- land and people -- does not stand to gain from turning its back on its brothers. Its interest lies in harmonizing its steps and policies with the steps of its Arab brothers. Tujan Faysal, member of the Jordanian House of Representatives, said the Jordanian government has shown reservations over the question of comprehensive coordination among Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. In an interview with the Lebanese newspaper AL-HAYAH, the Jordanian deputy added: I am against this position. I believe that if I am looking for solutions to the economic problems, then I should coordinate my cooperation with any Arab party so that we can achieve what is better and more useful for both of us. Answering another question, Deputy Tujan Faysal said the opposition deputies at the Jordanian parliament have felt that the Jordanian government opposes Syrian proposals because it thinks these proposals aim at something wider than what we want. Mrs. Tujan asked: Is this reasonable and logical? How can it be in our interest to coordinate with Israel and the PLO leadership and ignore coordination with the Arabs, such as Syria and Lebanon? Answering another question, Mrs. Tujan said: The popular forces that stood with Iraq during the Gulf war today want to coordinate with Syria. This stems from our feeling that we are facing a common enemy and that Syria still refuses to make concessions to this enemy. So is it in our interest to leave Syria and adopt a unilateral stance in the face of this enemy? She added: If we cite the pretext that we are doing this because we are a small, weak nation and our economy is suffering from difficulties, then we can reply to this by saying that it is in our interest to cooperate and coordinate more closely with Syria, since it is a big country that has a strong economy. This will be more secure for us than dealing with Israel, which only thinks about how to swallow us and devour our rights after dealing with us individually. She added: The Jordanian people demand coordination with Syria while the government insists on heading west toward Israel. It was no coincidence that the Jordanian information minister's statements about the details of the agreement with Israel came in the wake of increasing promises that the people will see economic boom and prosperity.
