The launch began at the interim test range at Chandipur-on-Sea in Orissa at 1144 hours [0614 GMT] today. The first launch in the series fully met the mission's requirements. Our correspondent Rizwana Akhtar who witnessed the launch reports: [Begin Rizwana Akhtar recording] Prithvi, India's surface-to-surface short-range missile, was successfully launched from the interim test range at Chandipur this morning. The missile executed a perfect takeoff at 1140 hours [as heard] soaring into the clear blue sky followed by a trail of fire and smoke. The missile was clearly visible to the naked eye for a short time before disappearing. In the morning when countdown began, there was an air of expectation and people clamored to get a vantage position to witness the launch. The tense atmosphere was broken by a surge of spontaneous applause. Scientists of the DRDO [Defense Research and Development Organization] who have helped develop the missile and officials monitoring the launch were jubilant at the success and were seen congratulating each other. The silver-white Prithvi with red stripes is smaller in size and dimension than the Agni [Fire] missile. But the sense of achievement of mission accomplished was greater than any I have seen before.
