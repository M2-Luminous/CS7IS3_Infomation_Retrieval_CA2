His political opponent, Dimitrij Rupel, is particularly vociferous. "No, I do not want to polemicize with him. When he was a minister he did not know how to protect the Slovene fishermen, whereas now, for every single problem he has the best and the only possible solution...," Peterle ironically comments on the diplomatic achievements of his predecessor in the informal part of the interview. In this moment, Croato-Slovene relations are really in a crisis. Only a day after our conversation with Minister Peterle, one of the most critical problems between two states -- the Krsko nuclear power plant -- reached a climax again: Croatia was disconnected from the power grid after the station was overhauled! Nevertheless, calmly and composedly, Minister Peterle claims that the problem, just like all others, can be solved in a peaceful and civilized manner, to the satisfaction of both sides. [Klancir] Recently you stated to the Viennese KURIER that the Slovene-Croatian relations had been broken up completely. Which political moves -- on the Slovene or Croatian part -- do you think are to blame for such a situation? [Peterle] No, the KURIER journalist did not understand me well. The relations between Slovenia and Croatia have never been completely broken up at any time. Some contacts always exist. The truth is, however, that the relations between the two states are not developing as quickly as we would like them to. [Klancir] Have the activities of the expert groups been interrupted, who are working on the maps regarding some delicate issues of territorial demarcation? [Peterle] Those activities have not been completely interrupted. It is true that the mixed diplomatic commission is not working for the time being, because the Croatian side has not yet designated the new chairman, a successor of Mr. Rudolf, which prevents the commission to work normally. Right now we, the Slovene side, are preparing a response to the Croatian attitudes regarding the border in the bay of Piran. As for the Ljubljanska Banka and the Krsko nuclear power plant, the attitudes are going through the process of harmonization, while one can say that the agreements on trade and the cultural cooperation are ready to be signed. The agreement on trade [as published] is also ready to be signed.... Which is to say, if we were to "open" the package of agreements, some of them could certainly be signed that very moment. However, all those agreements are dealt with as a whole, rather than individually. That is, we are working, we are making progress, but not as quickly as we would want to. If one insists on assessing failures, then it can be said that both sides have failed to improve the mutual relations, rather than only one side. [Klancir] In a confidential document of the Slovene Foreign Ministry, which was partly brought out by the Slovene REPUBLIKA, a more severe Slovene attitude in future negotiations with Croatia is announced. What is that more severe attitude supposed to be like? [Peterle] Personally, I do not use such words in diplomatic endeavors.... No goal is accomplished by severeness. I think that a much better term is -- consistency. So, I think that, in the relations with Croatia, we have to be consistent. Concretely, as far as borders are concerned, we shall continue our efforts to reach the agreement on implementing the first, general criterion regarding the demarcation. We are still proposing that one should start from the criterion of land registry districts. However, if both sides agree that such a criterion is not applicable, we shall pick a new one, or perhaps some additional criteria. We shall be consistent also in our insisting on the agreement on borders that was reached after the declarations of independency of both states, which is to say, we shall demand that the state of affairs as it was on 26 July 1991 be observed. In that respect one needs no severity -- consistency will do, whereas sometimes we cannot be consistent without a high tone. [Klancir] How will the Slovene severity reflect itself in the case of Krsko? [Peterle] The Slovene attitude should also not be marked by severity in that case. That case is above all about a business relationship, rather than about politics. If the nuclear power plant produces power for both the Slovene and Croatian consumers, and the Slovene consumers are paying for it much more regularly than the Croatian consumers, the protests on the part of Slovenia are quite justifiable. The question is raised: Why are we crediting the Croatian consumers? So, the issue is about a purely business relationship. Both sides ought to pay their bills, and one should not make interstate problems out of that.... I personally insist, despite all the criticisms, on constructive talks, rather than on the hammer policy. I have agreed with [Croatian] Minister Mate Granic that we should be creating a constructive atmosphere, without tension, in which we shall be able to settle all problems more easily. A different issue is the question of a new legal arrangement of relations regarding Krsko, where many questions are still open. [Klancir] REPUBLIKA has written that, in the aforementioned document, the sincerity of the Croatian side in the negotiations is called into question. Why is the Croatian sincerity called into question? [Peterle] We do not need REPUBLIKA. Let us put it this way: While Mr. Franjo Greguric was prime minister, we signed the agreement on economic cooperation with him. However, the Croatian Parliament did not ratify that agreement, although Greguric's party, that is the Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ], has a great majority in the parliament. It was a slap in the face for the Slovene side.... We also have a fresher example of Croatian inconsistency in the policy on Slovenia. I was personally at the HDZ convention this year. In the contacts with many politicians, I got the impression that the Croatian side was seriously working on the improvement of Croat-Slovene relations. Many nice things were said.... However, as soon as I left Zagreb, the problem with the accommodation of refugees in Slovene resorts [in Istria] broke out, although we agreed quite concretely that we shall settle the issue in cooperation and as carefully as possible. That problem resounded in the Slovene public very negatively. It was all the same to the Slovenes whether the accommodation of refugees in the resorts was ordered by the Croatian defense minister or somebody else -- they felt that somebody made fools out of them (still, the situation is much better now). [Klancir] You have just said that you were at the HDZ convention. Rupel assessed your attempts to make progress in Slovene-Croatian relations through meetings of the two parties, that is your Christian Democrats and the HDZ, as completely unsuccessful. [Peterle] Rupel will have to get used to the fact that democratic changes in two states bring about such contacts as well. That is nothing unusual. In Croatia, the HDZ is the most powerful political party, whereas in Slovenia the Christian Democrats are the second strongest party. The foreign ministers of those countries are members of those two parties, and it is logical that they cooperate, and communicate. [Klancir] When the Commission for Interstate Relations in the Slovene Parliament proposed, for the first time, as a new phase of Slovene-Croatian negotiations, a top-level meeting, that is with Milan Kucan and Janez Drnovsek on one side, and Franjo Tudjman on the other side, you refused. Why? [Peterle] So long as we have not worked out any concrete solutions on the expert level, I think it is senseless to listen to the principled assessments and good wishes regarding Slovene-Croatian relations. Which is to say, it is the experts who should be given priority, and only then a confirmation on the highest level. Drnovsek shares that opinion.... Until we arrange the balance of the Ljubljanska Banka, until we work out a solution for the nuclear power station -- it makes no sense to listen to the statements saying that we should by all means get down to solving those problems. After all, that has already been said before.... [Klancir] In your interview with KURIER, you presented the problem of the border in the bay of Piran as a serious matter of conflict. Do you think that is the most difficult problem in Croat-Slovene relations? Are there any new suggestions for the settlement of the problem? [Peterle] I am not sure whether I would place that problem on the top of the list of our problems, that is to say, whether I would define it as the most difficult. Perhaps.... It is certainly difficult -- because the Croatian and the Slovene concepts of the solution are quite different. Slovenia rejects the model of condominium in the bay. The Slovene attitude is clear -- one ought to start from the borders defined by land registries. One cannot expect Slovenia to agree to a limitation of the rights it had before. Slovenia has the right to free access to the sea that it had in former Yugoslavia. [Klancir] How high is the problem of Krsko ranked on the list of problems? [Peterle] There are really no reasons for Krsko to be a stumbling block in political negotiations. What is necessary is to prepare the foundations in the newly-created legal circumstances for a new agreement, that is, one ought to settle the question of ownership, debts, prices, nuclear waste. Yet, there are no reasons for the consumers not to pay for the power they are obtaining from Krsko. That is a matter of the business relationship. [Klancir] If many agreements are almost ready to be signed -- as you yourself say -- why are not they signed then? Where are the obstacles to be found? [Peterle] After the Slovene-Croatian meeting in Bizeljsko, the work on the expert level did not start developing at the expected pace. On the Slovene side the opinion prevails that the Croatian side is slowing down the process, that it is not responding quickly enough to our proposals. Of course, it is possible that the Croatian side will say that the problem lies in Slovene slowness. Perhaps the Croatian negotiators have counted a much faster Slovene response to the latest Croatian idea regarding the settlement of the Piran Bay issue. However, we are preparing a very comprehensive respond to the proposal. Besides, it is clear that Croatia has some other priorities in foreign policy -- for instance, the problems in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- so that it cannot engage itself in relations with Slovenia as much as we would like it to. [Klancir] So, you have understanding for the fact that Croatia is in a state of war.... [Peterle] The opposition reproaches me that I have too much understanding for Croatia! [Klancir] In his interview with GLOBUS, Rupel expressed a sort of threat. He said: "It is clear that Slovenia might just as well inflict a lot of harm to Croatia on the international stage." [Peterle] That could perhaps have happened during Rupel's mandate, who stated before that he did not want Croatia to be a millstone around his neck (excuse me, but Rupel does not represent the entire Slovene people). The political relations with any neighbor cannot be arranged in that way.... I am against any threats or blackmails in Slovene-Croatian relations. Croatia will certainly advance in its getting involved in the work of various international organizations.... All those organizations have certain criteria for the admittance, and if Croatia fulfills them -- it will be admitted into those organizations. The same applies to admittance to the European Council. It is pretentious to claim that the European Council will take into consideration whether Slovenia is for or against it. [Klancir] How do you comment on the results of a public opinion poll that was carried out in Slovenia, showing that Slovenes view Croatia as being their greatest enemy, and that they are not excluding the possibility of a war? A similar poll in Croatia shows that Croats do not hold such a view of Slovenes. [Peterle] I admit, I got seriously worried about the results of that public opinion poll. If it is authentic, those are quite alarming results. It is difficult to develop the relations between two countries if a considerable part of the population views the neighboring country as being the greatest enemy. If we are trying to find out any rational reasons for such a view, perhaps we can find them out in the steps that the Croatian Government has made with regard to the Slovene resorts in Istria, and even with regard to the Buzet brewery. That has caused a considerable revolt among the Slovenes. Many of them have vacation houses in Istria, and the fear has been provoked that they might be soon taken away from them. [Klancir] What is being concretely undertaken in order to improve Croat-Slovene relations? [Peterle] We have to bring the work on the expert level to a conclusion. That is to say, we are awaiting the settlement of the problem of Ljubljanska Banka. In several days we will hold a meeting with the representatives of all sectors whose relations with Croatia are problematic. Tomorrow I am having a meeting with Zagar, the Croatian ambassador.... Besides, a written proposal made by Slovenia regarding the settlement of the Piran Bay issue is supposed to be finished soon. The experts are still working on it. I hope that the negotiations about the nuclear power station of Krsko will also advance; State Secretary Sovic has just told me that some new ideas are being worked out -- ideas that might bring about a satisfactory solution for both sides. Which is to say, we are constantly working on it.... The Croatian side will probably designate the head of the diplomatic negotiating group. And then, quite calmly, we could go for the signing of certain agreements.
