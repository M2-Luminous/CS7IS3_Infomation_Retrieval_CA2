FBIS4-51595 "dreas084_c_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-084 Daily Report 30 Apr 1994 North Korea WPK Secretary Delivers May Day Report WPK Secretary Delivers May Day Report SK0205115694 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 0803 GMT 30 April 94 SK0205115694 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 0803 GMT 30 April 94 Korean BFN [Report by WPK Secretary Kim Chung-nin at the central report meeting marking May Day held at the People's Palace of Culture in Pyongyang -- live] [Text] Comrades: Today, we are meaningfully marking May Day, the international holiday of the workers around the world, at a time when all working people, including the working class, are vigorously waging the general onward movement of socialism in the high revolutionary spirit under the banner of the chuche idea and under the anti-imperialist banner for independence. On this day, I warmly congratulate the entire working class and working people, who are striving hard for the development and enrichment of the socialism of our own style and the victory of the chuche revolutionary cause, under the authority and in the name of the Workers Party of Korea [WPK] Central Committee. [applause] I extend militant greetings to the workers and people of different strata in South Korea, who are fighting courageously for the anti-U.S. struggle for independence, democratization, the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, and the right to live, looking upon the Republic as the beacon of hope. [applause] I offer warm compatriot greetings to .7 million fellow countrymen in Japan and all other fellow countrymen abroad, who are retaining the nation's sovereignty and honor and are vigorously waging the patriotic struggle for the prosperity of the socialist fatherland and the independent, peaceful reunification of the fatherland. [applause] I, in the name of the WPK Central Committee and the Korean working class, extend militant greetings and firm solidarity to the working class and working people around the world, who are fighting for independence, peace, social progress, and justice while opposing all sorts of domination and subordination. [applause] Comrades: Over a century of history has passed since the working class, who has a noble mission to realize the ideal of mankind and to forever relinquish the exploitation system from earth, began celebrating the militant holiday demonstrating its international solidarity and united strength. This period has been a history of a righteous struggle and brilliant victory waged by the working class throughout the world that strenuously struggled for the freedom and liberation of the maltreated proletarian masses against the imperialist reactionary forces, holding aloft the banner of unity. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Unity is the mightiest weapon of the working class. Since its first days in the arena of history, the working class has always regarded unity as its most precious weapon in the struggle against international capital, and has won formidable struggles on the strength of unity. The historic mission of the working class lies in building socialism, communism, and a new world in which the independence of humans can be fully realized. The working class has waged audacious struggles befitting the leading class of the revolution to build a new society free from exploitation and oppression by breaking the chains of capital. The working masses have demolished the bulwark of capitalism and triumphantly blazed the trail of socialism with the weapon of unity, the might of unity, overcoming manifold difficulties and trials. Thanks to the international working class' long and difficult struggles to realize independence, a revolutionary upheaval has been brought about in the development of human history and the features of the world have been fundamentally changed. In an old era, the working popular masses were suppressed, exploited, and forced to endure all sorts of social unfairness for a long time. However, such an era has ended and a new one has opened in which all nations of all countries can pioneer their fate voluntarily. Breaking through the capitalist and imperialist positions which had dominated the world for centuries and opening a broad avenue to socialism -- this is the great change achieved on the course of implementing the working class' revolutionary cause and the historic triumph achieved by the world revolutionary people with blood. [applause] The working class' cause is accompanied by the serious struggle of whether it is socialism or capitalism, and thus this can never be realized smoothly. Under the condition in which the reactionaries of history, in united forces, are running wild to desperately block the popular masses' independent onward march, and the imperialists and reactionaries are perpetrating endless attacks and all kinds of armed maneuvers, there could be unexpected difficulties and heartbreaking sacrifices in the confrontation between revolution and antirevolution. Amid the imperialists and reactionaries' antisocialist blockade, which has become unprecedentedly vicious in recent years, socialism in some countries, which had been defended and developed for tens of years, has suffered a setback and capitalism has been restored. Taking advantage of this abnormal situation, the imperialists and reactionaries vilify the idea of socialism, the idea of the working class, itself as wrong, claiming that socialism has met its end. But this is no more than a reactionary sophism of the foes of socialism and its renegades. Even though socialism has suffered in some countries, this is nothing but a limited and temporary phenomenon. Socialism, which has vibrant vitality, is the future of mankind. No force can hold back the basic trend of the history of mankind marching toward socialism. Today, billions of working people around the world are waging the struggle for the right to live and freedom in defense of independence. In particular, former socialist countries are now vigorously pushing ahead with the struggle to carry out their independent demands, being well aware of the fact through their actual experiences that capitalism only devoted to the pursuit of money will only bring poverty to their working popular masses and that socialism is the only way to live. Everywhere in the world now, fraternal unity is being rebuilt, and communists and the working popular masses are rising in the grand struggle for socialism. The widespread movement for the revival of socialism is being waged in the countries where it has suffered a setback. The extensiveness of such a mass movement and political struggles can be clearly seen from the fact that the number of foreign parties signed the Pyongyang Declaration "Let Us Defend and Advance the Socialist Cause" has increased from 70 to 213 in two years. All these facts vividly show that no matter how the imperialists and those who attempt to return to the bourgeois vilify the idea of socialism, socialism is alive in the hearts of thousands of people; mighty revolutionary parties for socialism still exist in the world; and no force can check the working class' struggle for socialism. If the international working class is to defend the cause of socialism and promote it, it must constantly strengthen the driving force of the revolution with a correct guiding idea and must resolutely uphold the principles of socialism and strengthen solidarity based on independence. This is an important lesson that the history of the international working class struggle which has suffered setbacks and twists has taught. The working class of our country has victoriously waged an arduous struggle to defend and adhere to socialism, firmly upholding the chuche idea--the guiding idea of the revolution of our times founded by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song--and under the outstanding leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, thus always being loyal to the national and international duties. The working class of our country upheld the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song as the center of unity and the center of leadership. By dint of this, the working class of our country was able to enter the road of a new struggle with precise struggle line and with organized force. The respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song founded the immortal chuche idea and awakened and organized the broad sections working masses including the working class under its banner, thus providing the revolution with its strong main force. Based on this, he led the difficult and complicated Korean revolution along the single road of victory. Over the past years, our people were single-handedly able to win a shining victory in the long, arduous anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle against the 1 million-strong well-armed Japanese imperialist army. This was possible only because the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song organized the anti-Japanese patriotic force of various strata, including workers and peasants, into an independent revolutionary force under the anti-Japanese banner, rousing this force to the anti-Japanese war, while continuously expanding and strengthening it Our working class and people, firmly united around the party and the leader, established our-style people's democratic system free from exploitation, oppression, poverty, and unemployment in the northern half of the republic after the liberation under very difficult and complicated circumstances by their independent chuche might. In the fiercely-fought three-year Fatherland Liberation War, they won a great victory of defeating the U.S. imperialists, the leader of world imperialism, for the first time in history. [applause] Our working class and people waged a steadfast socialist revolution and socialist construction in the period of trials after the war as well based on strong chuche force, turning our country into a strong independent, self-reliant, and self-defending socialist state. Truly, the entire course of our revolution that involved stern trials and epochal changes has been a proud triumphant history in which we strengthened the independent main force of the revolution and made a long march flushed with victories based on its might under the leadership of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song. The revolutionary cause of the working class does not end in one generation. It is a cause inherited and completed generation to generation. To achieve an ultimate completion of this historical cause, the problem of leadership succession must be solved properly. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is an outstanding ideologist and theoretician, great statesman, great military strategist, and the paragon of a true loyalist and dutiful child who has both literary and military accomplishments and is distinguished in his loyalty and filial duty. The sacred chuche revolutionary cause pioneered by the great leader is brilliantly inherited and developed in our country today by upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who has excellent traits and qualifications of the leader [suryong] of the working class and the leader [yongdoja] of the people, at the supreme top [choego suwi] of the party, the state, and the army. [applause] The ultimate victory of the chuche revolutionary cause is firmly ensured because the entire party membership, all the people, and the entire army uphold the great leader's lofty will in wholehearted unity around the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and are exerting their creative might thoroughly in the revolution and construction in conformity with the intent of the party and the leader. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has wisely led the struggle to accelerate the revolution and construction based on the might of the wholehearted unity of the leader, the party, and the masses by persistently keeping up the three revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--as a general line of socialist construction in conformity with the new conditions after the socialist revolution triumphed and a socialist system was established in our country. What is most important in accelerating socialist construction and defending, adhering, and adding luster to the cause of socialism is to arm the members of the main force of the revolution firmly with the socialist ideology so that they can cherish socialism as their firm faith. Whether we can arm people with socialist ideology or not is a fundamental problem connected with the fate of socialism. The superiority of socialism is the superiority of ideology, and the might of socialism is the might of ideology. Therefore, neglecting the ideological revolution is losing the life line in building socialism. For this reason, our party has consistently maintained the principle of giving definite priority to the ideological revolution in the struggle to build socialism, and is continuously deepening and developing it in conformity with the advance of the revolution and construction. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il further developed and enriched the socialist ideology based on the chuche idea, and exercised his wise leadership so that all the people can make the chuche socialist ideology their faith and morality. By so doing, he ensured that our socialism takes root deep in our people's hearts and actual life. With firm faith that socialism means victory for those who keep it and death for those who abandon it, the working class and people of our country today are devoting themselves to the rewarding struggle to further strengthen socialist might with overflowing faith and optimism for the future. The communist ethos of working and living in a revolutionary manner, helping and encouraging each other from the principle of collectivism of one for all and all for one, is highly displayed by them. The ranks of unheralded heroes, men of merit, and forerunners of communist virtue who wage a devoted struggle silently are increasing with each passing day. The leader, the party, and the masses are firmly united as a sociopolitical living organism sharing life, death, and destiny so that the entire society consists of a great revolutionary family of loyalists and dutiful children. This is the true feature of our society of which we can boast with pride to the world. [applause] This shows that the slogan of abolishing class, which was raised aloft on the very first day when the working class appeared on the stage of history, has come true in our country today. Today when we can clearly see at hand the day of the complete victory of socialism under the wise leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, we take great pride and faith in the superiority of our-style socialism which we ourselves have chosen and pioneered on our own and its future. Socialist society is the world for the working class. Our-style socialism, in particular, is the chuche socialism in which the party and the popular masses are firmly united and chuche is firmly established in all areas--political, economic, cultural, and military. It is the popular mass-centered socialism in which the people's independent and creative life thrive fully and in which the working class and the working people are masters of everything. It is the most solid and vital invincible socialism in which society develops continuously by the might of wholehearted unity. The most precious wealth that our party brought forth in the long struggle for socialism under the banner of the chuche idea is the realization of the wholehearted unity of the leader, the party, and the masses. Our wholehearted unity is the ideological, volitional, moralistic, and fidelity-oriented unity and cohesion, and a revolutionary unity having eternal vitality. There is no power in the world that can destroy our wholehearted unity. [applause] The complete unity among the leader [suryong], the party, and the masses, which we have achieved, is the basic factor, in resolutely smashing [chipusigo] any challenge of the imperialists and determinedly defending and safeguarding our-style socialism, and it is a strong driving force with which to brave a raging wind of antisocialism and to forcefully accelerate the socialist construction. Indeed, the greatest dignity and pride of our working class and people are to build an invincible socialist powerful state which opens the path to becoming ever victorious only with its trust in its own strength and with its own might, while carrying out everything in our own way holding faith in chuche, in an unflinching manner in the teeth of any change in situation and the pressure from the imperialists. Our working class and people are setting store by our-style socialism like their own lives and are full of the revolutionary determination to defend socialism to the end with the firm faith in the justness of the socialist cause and its future path. The revolutionary cause of the working class is the international one, and the Korean revolution is a part of the world revolution. To consolidate the solidarity with the international revolutionary forces is an (?important) guarantee to advance the victory of the Korean revolution and carry forward the socialist cause throughout the world. The slogan "The world's people defending independence, unite!" is a slogan for struggle which all people of our era should hold jointly. In the preceding period, our country's working class exerted itself to consolidate the militant unity and international solidarity with the working classes and progressive people of all world countries on the basis of its (?faith) in independence and socialism under the party's leadership. It actively contributed to the struggle to reliably defend the eastern outpost of socialism and make the whole world independent. Under the anti-imperialist, pro-independence banner, we have supported the anti-imperialist, national liberation struggle of the world's oppressed people and the revolutionary movement of all countries' people and have endlessly developed the relationships of friendship and cooperation with those countries that treat our country favorably, including developing countries. We have firmly struggled to check and frustrate the imperialists' maneuvers of aggression and war and to defend the world's peace and security. Our party has always adhered consistently to the principle of complete equality and mutual respect on which to solve, in conformity with the common interest of our people and the world's people and in an independent way, all problems arising from foreign relations, respecting other countries' sovereignty while thoroughly safeguarding our people's national sovereignty. Our country's international relations have endlessly been developed and our people have numerous friends and sympathizers [tongjongjadul] everywhere in the world thanks to our party's correct foreign policy based on the idea of independence, peace, and friendship and its active activities in (?foreign relations). The experience of our revolution, which is forcefully advancing the socialist cause even under the unusually difficult international environment, has shown that when the working classes of all the world's countries struggle jointly in firm unity supporting and cooperating with each other under the anti-imperialist, pro-independence revolutionary banner, they, as unified international revolutionary forces, can vanquish the imperialists and certainly build a peaceful and prosperous new world of independence, while defending each individual country's sovereignty and independence. In the future, too, our country's working class will actively contribute to accelerating the completion of our revolution and making the whole world independent by endlessly strengthening the militant unity and cooperation with the working classes and progressive people of the whole world. [applause] Comrades, Because of the international reactionaries' vicious challenge, the working class' revolutionary movement to build a new world of independence and peace is today entering a grave phase of history. The imperialists and reactionary forces are all the more running amok to crush [apsal] the revolutionary cause of the working class and the socialist cause, and here, they are especially turning the brunt of the attack toward our Republic, the fortress of socialism. The U.S. imperialists are all the more openly carrying out anti-Republic oppressive commotions in the international arena by finding fault with our nuclear issue, thus clinging to the military adventure to crush our socialist cause. Our nuclear issue, which the U.S. imperialists and their followers are babbling [ttodunun] about, is a product of the antisocialist and anti-Republic maneuvers the U.S. imperialists are persistently pursuing. Whenever they have had the opportunity, the U.S. warmongers have made violent remarks by saying that pressure must be put on North Korea through a practical action and so on, thus openly revealing their attempt to resume the Team Spirit joint military exercise. Also, as part of an oppressive commotion against us, they are carrying out all kinds of military commotions such as deploying from the continental United States Naval ships, including the Patriot missile unit and a nuclear powered aircraft carrier, into South Korea, and are scheming to deploy more new military equipment. The treacherous Kim Yong-sam clique undisguisedly made public its plan to invade the North, which had already been worked out under the instigation of the U.S. imperialists, made the entire puppet Army assume a posture of attacking the North under a special alert order, and while babbling about a strong punishment and retaliation on someone, it is blowing a very provocative bugle of war to link this as an opportunity to invade the North and achieve reunification. The Japanese reactionaries are also persistently obstructing the resolution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula by talking about a special inspection [tukpyol sachal] and sanctions. They are revealing the aggressive attempt to come forth in the military action against us in case of an emergency. Because of the reckless military threat and confrontational maneuvers by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique, the danger of war is increasing by the minute on the Korean peninsula. The U.S. imperialists and the international reactionaries are running amok to isolate and suffocate our Republic and crush our socialism by finding fault with the nuclear issue, but if they think that they can submit us through any kind of pressure, threat, and blackmail, that is nothing but an anachronistic fantasy. However precious peace is, our dignified people will not by any means beg for it, and are fully prepared to answer war with war and dialogue with dialogue. We are possessed with the wise leadership of the great leader and the respected and beloved supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il; the complete unity of the leader, the party, and the masses; and a one-a-match-for-100 revolutionary force that can defeat in a single blow any strong enemy; and a strong self-supporting economy. Our working class and people will never tolerate [yongnap] our national dignity and sovereignty being hurt [kondurinunkosul]. If the enemy dares to launch an attack, the whole country will turn into a place of guns and shells [chongpotan], giving the enemy only corpses and death. Our working class and all the workers should march forward invariably upholding the banner of unity in order to continue to forcefully carry forward the socialist cause of chuche while smashing the maneuvers of the imperialists and reactionaries against socialism and the Republic. The first, the second, and the third priorities, in terms of the basic way to advance the socialist construction while being confronted with the imperialist reactionary forces, are all to achieve the single-hearted unity of the revolutionary ranks. Because of the might of the single-hearted unity nothing can destroy, the invincibility of our-style ever-victorious socialism exists and the bright future path to the revolutionary cause of chuche is firmly guaranteed. The complete unity among the leader, the party, and the masses, which constitutes the eternal vitality of our country's socialism, originates in the endless love toward and faith in people held by the great leader and the dear (?leader) and in people's boundless sense of admiration and their absolute sense of trust in the leader [yongdoja]. Upholding the great leader and the dear comrade leader and more firmly rallying around the party, our working class and all the people should be firmly prepared as genuine communist revolutionaries of chuche who deeply bear in mind their loyalty to the party and the leader as their firm faith, conscience, and sense of moral obligation and highly display such a spirit in every moment of their life, solidifying in every way the single-hearted unity of our revolutionary ranks. Upholding with our heart the party's militant slogan as to accomplishing the socialist cause to the end while all the party, all the people, and all the Army are united in single-heartedness, we should resolutely smash--with the might of the single-hearted unity in which the leader, the party, and the masses are in complete unity--all the enemy's challenges and obstructions against socialism, thereby accomplishing the socialist cause of chuche to the end. An (?important) issue in defending, safeguarding, and carrying forward the socialist cause of chuche at the present time is to defend the purity of socialist ideology and hold fast to the basic principle of socialism in a consistent way. If the socialist ideology is shaken, the basic principle of socialism will be renounced and, then, the socialist system will degenerate and collapse [pyonjildoeo homulojigi maryonimnida]. It is necessary to be armed with the chuche idea in order to firmly defend the purity of the socialist ideology. The chuche idea is the revolutionary one which most correctly reflects the aspirations and demands of the working class and it is the leading guideline of our era's revolution which illuminates the basic principle and method of socialist and communist construction. Thanks to the great chuche idea, the status and role of the working class as the leading class of revolution have been scientifically illuminated; and a new world in which the working class serves as the masters of everything under the brilliant banner of the chuche idea is being unfolded. Only when it thoroughly carries through the basic principle of the chuche idea can the working class see realized its demands that it enjoy independent rights and a genuine life, while breaking away from all kinds of restrictions and oppression and can it see the cause of remodeling the whole society after the pattern of the working class brilliantly accomplished. By being firmly armed with the socialist ideology of chuche, our working class and all the people should resolutely defend their chuche-oriented position and the revolutionary principle under all circumstances, reject revisionism, doctrinism, and flunkeyism in a thorough-going manner, and thoroughly smash the enemy's maneuver of conciliatory tactics of trying to disintegrate [wahae] us through a reactionary ideological and cultural blockade [pongsoe]. What is most important in defending, safeguarding, and carrying forward the socialist cause in a victorious way is to faithfully uphold the party's leadership. The party's leadership is the life and soul of the working class and the basic guarantee of all victories. Only when it is faithful to the leadership of the party--its vanguard organization--can the working class, the leading class of revolution, smoothly carry out its mission and duty it holds before the times and history. Our era is the glorious one which shines thanks to the name of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. A bright future path to further prosperity and advancement, when we follow his leadership, is firmly guaranteed. [applause] All the working class and workers should hold the absolute sense of respect for the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il every time and everywhere and should live and fight on as the lifeguards, shock brigade members, guards, and death-defying corps members, loudly chanting the song of faith "Without you, there is no fatherland; with you alone we can win!" upholding his ideology and leadership. In order to further illuminate our-style socialism, it is necessary to consolidate the might of self-reliant economy and highly display the superiority of our country's socialist system by accelerating the socialist construction. The superiority of the socialist system is demonstrated in people's independent and creative living. To endlessly increase the people's living standard is the highest principle of our party's activities. The important purpose that our party has established a period of adjustment in the socialist economic construction and put forth a new revolutionary economic strategy also lies in trying to more smoothly guarantee the people's living standards. By thoroughly accomplishing the party's revolutionary economic strategy and forcefully waging the three revolutions, ideological, technological, and cultural, our working class and all the workers should help the popular masses' independent and creative living be put into fuller bloom in all fields of their social life, including political, economic, and cultural ones. Upholding the party's militant slogan "Let us forcefully accelerate the general onward march of socialism through the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude!" for which all the party, the whole country, and all the people are generally mobilized, we should thoroughly accomplish the agriculture-first policy, light industry-first policy, and trade-first policy with the spirit in which the speed of the nineties is added to chollima, filled with the ever-victorious confidence and should achieve a new great revolutionary upswing on all fronts of socialist construction, including coal, electricity, railroad transportation, and metal industries. To end the national division and achieve the fatherland reunification is the supreme task that our working class and people can no longer put off. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, the sun of the nation, has put forth the 10-point program for the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the country, thereby brilliantly illuminating the path to achieving the national reconciliation and unity and to establishing an independent, peaceful, and neutral reunified state. He has taken all kinds of measures for their materialization. The 10-point program for the great unity of the whole nation is the grand charter for reunification--the most aboveboard and devoted to the country and people-- which embodies the pure desire of the 70 million countrymen aspiring to achieve the national reunification and prosperity in which the whole nation is firmly united as one, transcending the differences in ideologies, ideas, and systems. [applause] The 10-point program for the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the country is arousing wide sympathy among the world's progressive people. The South Korean people and the compatriots abroad are also waging a forceful struggle to achieve by any means [kioi] the country's reunification in the nineties under the banner of this 10-point program. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, however, is marching toward the path to North-South confrontation, not to national independence, and to national strife [tongjok sangjaeng], not to peaceful reunification, while turning its face away from our broadminded proposals and the whole nation's desire for reunification. Without checking and frustrating the maneuvers of the splittists within and without, we can neither desire the fatherland reunification nor the country's security and peace, nor can our nation avoid the disasters of a nuclear war. The South Korean puppets should give up their silly fantasy of trying to block the fatherland reunification and harm their compatriots, relying on the foreign forces; abrogate all kinds of anticommunist, fascist evil laws, including the vicious National Security Law; immediately release all people, including patriotic figures fighting for the cause of reunification, who have been illegally arrested and imprisoned; and show with acts their genuine will for reunification. The United States should stop its reckless maneuver of obstructing Korea's reunification and threatening the security on the Korean peninsula; no longer interfere with our country's internal affairs; and withdraw without delay from South Korea taking away all armed forces of aggression and lethal weapons. Today, too, even political freedom and rights, and South Korean workers' basic human right to live, under the U.S. imperialists' occupation, are being ruthlessly trampled upon, under the world's worst working hell. The Kim Yong-sam civilian fascist clique, which has assumed power while advocating building a society in which hard-working people can live in opulence, is abusing the workers like horses and bulls while appeasing and deceiving them under the reactionary slogan of industrial peace. The puppet clique is even carrying out a fascist violent act of vicious suppression of the labor movement by even putting into action a so-called emergency arbitration, while branding the workers' just struggle for their right to live and for democracy as the so-called collective egoism. The Kim Yong-sam puppet regime is the most vicious blood-sucking one and the most cunning and ruthless one against workers. It is no coincidence that a slogan "Let us smash the Kim Yong-sam regime, which kills workers!" has been shouted out among the South Korean workers. The only way for the South Korean workers to get out of their present plight of a dead-end alley is to unite into a struggle to realize the independence and democratization of South Korean society and to achieve the country's reunification. The South Korean workers should firmly unite under the independent democratic labor unions and wage a struggle against the civilian fascist dictatorship with the might of unity. In firm unity with the people of all strata, including the youth and students, they should build a new world of independence and democracy in the land of the South. They should wage a more daring struggle to realize the cause of the country's reunification. It is an intolerable national tragedy for one nation of the same blood to live separated for half a century between the wall of division imposed by outside forces. All the Korean compatriots who love the country and are concerned about the future of the nation should be united under the banner of independence, the banner of the great unity of the whole nation, and wage a pannational struggle to open a new phase for the country's reunification by the independent strength of the nation. [applause] We will make every effort in the future as well to realize the country's reunification by means of a confederal system based on one nation and one state and two systems and two governments according to the three principles of independence, peaceful reunification, and great national unity. Our people's just cause for national sovereignty and peace and peaceful reunification of the country is receiving warm support and encouragement from the broad sections of the people of the world. I take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the parties, governments, and people of all countries of the world for their invariable sincere support and encouragement for our people's just cause. At the same time, I express our conviction that they will accord our people firm solidarity with our people's reunification cause in the future as well. [applause] Today, the world situation is very tense and complicated, and the struggle between socialism and imperialism, between the progressive and the reactionary is waged more acutely than ever in the international arena. The prevailing situation demands that the working class of all the countries of the world further strengthen internationalist unity and solidarity for the victory of the anti-imperialist cause for independence. The cause of socialism is not only a national cause, but a common cause of mankind. Therefore, its victory cannot be expected without the joint struggle of the revolutionary people of the world. Under the condition where the imperialists and reactionaries are trampling upon the independence of the popular masses with a combined force and are viciously maneuvering to crush [apsal] the cause of socialism, the working class and people of all countries of the world should wage a joint struggle firmly united under the revolutionary banner of anti-imperialist cause for independence in order to frustrate the imperialists' interference and aggressive maneuvers and realize the cause of independence of the entire world successfully. It is the firm will of our working class and people to fulfill their sacred mission and responsibility for the cause of independence of the Korean people and mankind by continuously intensifying the international solidarity and joint struggle with the working class of the entire world under the banner of the great chuche idea and the banner of socialism. The U.S. imperialists, bragging that they are the only superpower on earth, are engaged in all sorts of tenacious maneuvers, out of an ambition to dominate the world, to isolate and stifle [chilsik sikigo] socialist countries, to block the revival of socialism, and to prevent the developing countries from following the road of socialism. Yet the antisocialist maneuvers of the imperialists and reactionaries are doomed to fail, and it is the law of the development of history that the cause of socialism triumphs ultimately overcoming temporary confusion. Defending and adhering to socialism from the antirevolutionary offensive of the imperialists and reactionaries at this time is a common pending struggle task facing the working class of the countries of the world. Under the ideology of independence, peace, and friendship, our party and people will continue to endlessly strengthen and develop the ties of comradely unity and international solidarity with the world's progressive people based on independence, equality, and faith in socialism. Therefore, we will put an end to the imperialists' domination and interference, and actively contribute to man's common cause to defend, adhere to, and advance the socialist cause. [applause] Our working class and people who are resolutely fighting for the just socialist cause by highly upholding the banner of the chuche idea under the great party's refined leadership, will always be victorious. [applause] Let us all highly uphold the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and single-heartedly unite around the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il to all the more vigorously fight for the victorious advance of socialism of our own style, the fatherland's independent and peaceful reunification, and for man's bright future. [applause] Hurrah for Comrade Kim Il-song, the great leader of our party and our people! [shouts of hurrahs and applause] Hurrah for General Kim Chong-il, the respected and beloved supreme commander, who is the great leader [yongdoja] of our party and our people! [shouts of hurrahs and applause] Hurrah for May Day, the international holiday in which it is demonstrating the united might of the world's working class! [applause]
