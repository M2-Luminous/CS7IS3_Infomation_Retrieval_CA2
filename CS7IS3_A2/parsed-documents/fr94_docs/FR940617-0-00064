Background The Office of Foreign Assets Control is amending the Cuban Assets Control Regulations, 31 C.F.R. part 515 (the ``Regulations''), to eliminate the requirement that the arrival and departure of planes providing travel between Cuba and the United States occur during the normal business hours of the U.S. Customs Service. This change is being effected to allow greater flexibility in arranging for authorized flights to Cuba. In addition, the Regulations are being amended to add references to the Cuban Democracy Act, 22 U.S.C. 6001&hyph;6010, and to correct an error in §515.701. Section 515.417 is removed. Because this rule involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, does not apply.
