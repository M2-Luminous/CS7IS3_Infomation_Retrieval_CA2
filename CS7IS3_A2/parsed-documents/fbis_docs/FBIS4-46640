The black clouds crawled across Carpathia and immediately covered the ground with heavy rain and powerful lightning. The meteorologists, of course, would not give the go-ahead to the missile-bearing aircraft under such conditions. The pilots can take up the aircraft in a combat situation, and even in peacetime, under extraordinary conditions, since they are fighters. All-weather fighters. The likelihood that one of the fiery bolts that were tearing from the clouds could hit an aircraft, however, was quite large. The flight operations officer and the commander of the 14th Air Army, Lieutenant-General Viktor Lyashenko, who headed the commission to summarize the results of the performance evaluation, decided not to risk it. The start of the flight shift was moved from 1500 to a later time, which forced certain corrections to be made in the flight schedule. This had no better effect on the mood of the aerial warriors. It is well known that a pilot begins his flight while still on the ground, readying himself psychologically and performing these or those operations in his mind, reflecting on each minute of the flight. And now the start was being pushed back, until who knows when, for what period of time, or whether it would go at all. The engines of the MiG-29s roared to life at 2000 hours. Regimental commander Colonel Bohdan Spodarko took off. Behind him, in the rear cockpit, was the commander of the division, Colonel Ivan Ivanchuk, who performed the role of instructor during this flight. The commanders, as usual, were the first into the sky. Reports soon started coming in from the aircraft to the command post--the headings of the route to the training area and some of the zones themselves, according to the data on the meteorological conditions, could be used for making the flights. The aircraft called Hosha in the regiment was the next to taxi out to the runway. Whence the name? I would point out, before answering that question, that there is also a Kesha here. Those names were taken from an animated film, and the pilots called the aircraft that for their particular coloration, which reminds some of a parrot. We have already noted in our newspaper that two MiG-29 aircraft had made demonstration flights to the United States and Canada more than two years ago. They were painted over at that time accordingly. The missile aircraft returned to their Fatherland after the completion of the air show. They were once more in the order of battle, they were making planned flights, and it is worthwhile to point out that it is considered quite prestigious in the regiment to take up the Hosha or the Kesha. Many interesting elements can be discerned in this story. First of all, the fact that the pilots have never lost their sense of humor, even during the harshest of testing. One also senses that they love their aircraft, so they even give them names. The main thing is that our Air Forces are getting their own history, their own traditions. Possibly these two aircraft, which were the first to announce to the Canadians and the inhabitants of the United States the existence of the state of Ukraine and its armed forces, will someday take their place of honor in some museum. Major Serhiy Dorofeyev once had occasion to make a flight on the Hosha. It is worth noting that he performed the exercises in piloting technique quite successfully, and made a takeoff and landing. During subsequent flights that were made before nightfall, as well as at night, all of the pilots demonstrated good aerial proficiency. Squadron commander Yuriy Protsenko received outstanding ratings in aerial navigation and for the interception of airborne targets. His colleague, Major Volodymyr Veherynskyy, also made a weapons-delivery flight in excellent fashion. Regimental Navigator Major Mykola Romanov received the highest grade for piloting technique and for the interception of airborne targets. Senior pilot Captain Serhiy Doroshenko and other aerial warriors also "brought home" a high rating to the airfield. The officers displayed considerable combat proficiency, flight experience and diligence. All of them are pilots of the highest qualifications, have been on combat alert duty to protect the airspace of our nation dozens of times, and strove to show themselves in the best light in the evaluation. But do high results obtained in control flights testify to a high status of flight proficiency and combat training among all of the pilots in the fighter regiment? It would be a considerable exaggeration to say so. It should be noted that there were disruptions in the operation of aircraft hardware during the flight shift as well. The transmitter was not working for a certain time, for example, during the second flight on the aircraft of the regimental commander. The experienced pilot, of course, was able to get out of that non-standard situation successfully. There were also other problems that were not very substantial. The main argument that was not in favor of the fliers, however, was the fact that the plan for combat readiness was not entirely fulfilled in the regiment. Fourteen flight shifts were carried out in all, on which the pilots spent just 240 hours in the air. Why so little? That almost sounds like a rhetorical question. But the fact that the air units have a miserly quantity of fuels and lubricants has been discussed repeatedly in the pages of our newspaper. No aircraft can go up without aviation fuel. The motor vehicles that support the flights cannot leave the motor pool without gasoline and diesel fuel. The sharp reduction in the number of pilot sorties also tells on the level of readiness of these aerial fighters. A considerable portion of them have already lost their professional skills--more than half of the pilots in this regiment. Lieutenant-General Viktor Lyashenko emphasized when summarizing the results of the evaluation. The pilots should either be flying or they have to be let go to the four winds--this quite categorical conclusion of the commander has solid grounding. A pilot who has not taken an aircraft up for more than a year, after all, cannot now even be called a pilot, since he needs to learn again almost from square one. And this should not be taken as an insult, but rather as reality; such is the specific nature of the profession of the pilot. He can lead the life of a vagabond if he does not have his own apartment, he can agree to a reduction in his ration of flights or his material supply, but he cannot fail to fly. The principal conclusion that could be drawn, after the performance evaluation conducted in this and other flight units, can be phrased roughly as follows: the most important problem, which requires immediate resolution, is the provision of fuels and lubricants. There will be true aerial warriors--not just a handful of them, but the overwhelming majority who hold flight positions today--when there is fuel.
