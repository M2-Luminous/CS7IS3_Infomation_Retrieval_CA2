What are your height and weight? [Ota] Height is 186 centimeters and weight is 84 kilograms. [Oshima] Come to think of it, Former House of Representatives Yoshio Sakurauchi was also tall. [Ota] Yes. For his generation, he was on the tall side. [Oshima] I would assume you inherited your tallness from your mother's side. [Ota] My mother (who was named Toshiko and was the younger sister of former Speaker Sakurauchi of the House of Representatives) was 168 centimeters. And, that was on the tall side for someone born in the Taisho era. [Oshima] By the way, how many years did you spend as a college instructor? [Ota] Six years, since I worked in universities from the age of 28 to 34. [Oshima] Had you hoped to become a college professor from your younger days? [Ota] I did not feel that way when I entered college. When I finished college, I felt I did not want to restrict my lifetime outlook and went on to graduate school. Once you proceed to graduate school, you become restricted to a teaching career. The more time you spend in graduate school, the harder it becomes to find employment. [Oshima] Did you have your eye on potential future career paths when you decided to teach at Fukuoka University in your hometown? [Ota] I accepted a job there because the chairman of the Economics Department strongly urged me to take the job at the school. It was a case where I did not have the luxury of selecting the university I would teach at. [Oshima] For someone who later became the action group leader of the LDP, I admire you for having tolerated research work for as many as six years. [Ota] Oh, but I never disliked working in a college environment. Even now, I feel that I would like to return to the college environment if my political career were to come to an end. Given a preference, I feel that my real place in life is to engage in economic research. Strict Assistant Professor [Oshima] What was your specialty in the area of economics? [Ota] Economic theory. I taught economic theory. Another name for economic theory is mathematical economics, but I did not treat the study of this discipline as something trivial but as the starting point for my career. [Oshima] Did you feel you were popular among your students? [Ota] No. I was not popular among my students. I was strict with my students. Roughly 40 percent of the students failed my courses. Of special note is that 60 percent of the students failed the test that immediately preceded my candidacy as a member of the House of Representatives. Thus, the students that I graded in my final year at the college held ill feelings towards me. The situation was such that the students formed a "group to demand the firing of seiichi Ota" (laugh). [Oshima] Why is it that an assistant college professor changed careers to the political world which is a maelstrom of Machiavellianism? [Ota] Economics involves the construction of models of the real world and attendant analysis of results emanating from their prescribed manipulation. The discipline is a world in which one performs a constant check on the accuracy and realistic traits of the model. I would imagine that anyone specializing in economics will at one time or another hope that he could participate in the real economic world. He should aspire to join the political world, if the opportunity were to present itself. [Oshima] Would I be correct in saying that politics was one of your career options from your younger days? [Ota] During my college days, I used to journey to Shimane Prefecture for each House of Representative election to make roadside speeches on behalf of my uncle (former Speaker Sakurauchi of the House of Representatives). I always held in the back of my mind the idea that life does provide that particular career option. Once he became a Diet member, Mr. Ota began to demonstrate himself to be a combative type far removed from scholarly characteristics. He consistently attacked the Tanaka and Takeshita forces. His attacks were such that they were not typical of a member belonging to the "noble members" of the Miyazawa faction. When former Prime Minister Tanaka was found guilty in his initial trial, an LDP consensus was formed to "remove Tanaka" which was led by Mr. Ota. When suspicions were directed at Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita in connection with the Recruit scandal, Ota joined Shizuka Kamei, Takeo Hiranuma, and Katsuhiko Shirakawa to form the "Jiyukakushindoshikai" and initiated a movement to overthrow the Takeshita cabinet. In this connection, when Prime Minister Takeshita designated Mr. Sosuke Uno as his successor, this group reacted by attempting to promote the candidacy of Mr. Ganri Yamashita. Further, this interview was hurriedly conducted, after 1600 hours, 12 August immediately following the plenary session, in Room 432 of the House of Representatives Members Building No. 2. [Oshima] I was following the activities of the "Jiyukakushindoshikai" which was formed by Mr. Ota and others with interest because of its lively activities, but it seems the organization is no longer active. [Ota] Of the four leaders, Mr. Katsuhiko Shirakawa later lost an election, although he has since been reelected. And, Mr. Shizuka Kamei and Mr. Takeo Hiranuma have been appointed responsible positions in the Mitsuzuka faction and no longer participate in antiestablishment movements (laugh). That leaves me all by myself. In the past, there were very few LDP Diet members who assumed a clear-cut critical stand against Mr. Kanemaru. During the broadcasting of my political views during the last House of Representatives election, I gave a speech on the theme that we must eliminate the two-tier power structure. At least until the first half of last year, I was the only one that assumed an unequivocal stand against the Keiseikai (Takeshita faction). [Oshima] What sort of position did your next-door associate take? [Ota] Mr. Shokei Arai (Room 433 of the House of Representatives Diet Members' Building No.2) assumed a clear-cut anti-Keiseikai position from the summer of 1992. [Oshima] Were any threats posed by the Keiseikai? [Ota] Various things happened, but they were not of a nature that would prompt me to become discouraged about my ideas. Even now, some politicians do harbor Keiseikai-type concepts. Waging struggles against such concepts is one of my life philosophies. Even Mr. Kanemaru and Mr. Ichiro Ozawa know that I am that type of individual. We Are the True Reformists of the Founder [Oshima] As I recall, it was the fall of 1992 that you initiated a move to impeach Kanemaru. [Ota] We formed the "Group To Recover Confidence in the LDP" for the purpose of impeaching Mr. Kanemaru. We started out with a group of seven, but by the time Mr. Kanemaru resigned, it had grown to about 20 members. [Oshima] I understand that group evolved into the "Group To Create a New LDP." How many members do you have now? [Ota] Forty-six. [Oshima] I see that does not equal the 47 warriors of the feudal days, but was there not a time when the various political incidents prompted the group of 45 to secede from the party? [Ota] What point in time are you speaking of? [Oshima] I was thinking of the middle of June of this year, just before and after the vote of no confidence was cast against the Miyazawa cabinet. [Ota] At that time, both myself and Shokei Arai had no perception that a problem existed. It was a time when the situation was in great turmoil. At that time, the issue did not concern an overall political reform, but simply the issue of election system reform. Both myself and Mr. Arai are of the opinion that election system reform should be implemented, but we cannot agree with the position that that alone will cover the entire issue. I also cannot logically understand the creation of a new party on the premise of election system reform. The term reformist is used too lightly. They say that reformists are involved in the revision of the election system, but the question arises as to how things stood if we turn the clock back to the fall of last year. At that time we were the reformists. At that time our foremost political reform issues concerned the proposed resignation of Mr. Kanemaru who was the unquestioned symbol of money corruption, breakup of the Keiseikai, and an end to control of Diet members by factional alliances. [Oshima] So I see. The members of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] were sustaining Mr. Kanemaru. [Ota] It was not a case of sustaining Mr. Kanemaru, but acting as if they were Mr. Kanemaru himself. Further, young politicians such as Shigeru Ishiba of the "Group Calling for the Establishment of Political Reform" did not utter one word during the Kanemaru incident. That particular reformist group failed to play any role in connection with the Kanemaru incident or the breakup of the Keiseikai. Era of Political Parties Is Gone [Oshima] Many things have happened, but I get the impression that party politics stands at a crossroad. [Ota] I believe the era of political parties has ended. I believe it would be detrimental to allow the political party known as the LDP to remain in control of the situation. The Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is detrimental and so is the Japan New Party (JNP). In essence, the struggle between socialism and liberalism has ended. The significance of having established political parties no longer exists. [Oshima] Oh. [Ota] Why was the LDP formed in 1955? The right and left factions of the Socialist Party combined and the Liberal Party and Democratic Party combined as if to follow suit. It was a case of the SOPJ creating the LDP. Now that the reason for existence of the SDPJ no longer exists, the same is true with the LDP. A middle-of-the-road political party was created because the confrontation between the two parties was not a desirable situation. Once the significance of LDP-SDPJ existence is gone, the significance of a middle-of-the-road party is also lost. [Oshima] Then, what happens to the political world? [Ota] We should organize the Diet into an organization that respects the independence of individual Diet members, because differences in opinions among individual Diet members do exist in the final analysis. Political parties can be left in ruin, but political actions should be taken on the merits of the visions and convictions of individual Diet members. I believe the parliamentary democracy found in the United States would be a good format. Members of the U.S. Democratic and Republican Parties are not restricted by party decisions. Individual congressmen cast their votes based on their own responsibility and then seek a showing of confidence from individual constituents. Although they belong to a party, the system provides for a very high degree of independence on the part of the congressmen. [Oshima] In Japan, it appears little consideration is given to the independence of Diet members. [Ota] Differences in views between Diet members are greater than differences in views between political parties. As an example, differences in opinion between Mr. Koko Sato, formerly of the LDP Executive Department, and me were greater than those between me and SDPJ Diet members of the same age group. This fact becomes readily obvious when individual comparisons are made. When a majority vote is sought in the Diet, the individual parties begin to pressure their members and the situation is wrought with complications. Individual executive departments establish ties with any one to protect their predominant positions. The result is Diet decisions which are biased. I believe an entirely different outcome would result from a true majority decision. [Oshima] I will pose a vulgar question, but relative to orders from LDP President Yohei Kono, orders from Kochikai leader Kiichi Miyazawa, and the will of the Group To Create a New LDP, where do you place your priorities? [Ota] The LDP president is not allowed to issue orders. The LDP acts only on the basis of consensus. The question becomes one of how much of a role I play in the creation of a consensus for the LDP. Even Mr. Miyazawa does not issue orders. When the Kochikai is in the process of forming a consensus, I make a variety of statements in an attempt to reflect my opinions. [Oshima] If Mr. Masayoshi Ohira were still alive, you would have complied with his orders. I believe you're saying that no such person exists at the present time. [Ota] No, you're in slight error. Each individual Diet member enjoys the confidence of the general public. If I were required to comply with orders from Mr. Miyazawa, you would think that constituents of the Third District in Hiroshima ranked higher than the constituents of the First District in Fukuoka. I believe we should not be placed in the position of being issued orders. Needless to say, I do compromise and make concessions in order to form a consensus, but if I were placed in the position of receiving unilateral orders from someone, I would be guilty of a breach of trust in relation to my constituents. [Oshima] I understand there are a number of political parties where rank-and-file Diet members are unilaterally issued orders (laugh). [Ota] The LDP has some value because it does not act in compliance with someone's orders as they do in Shinseito, Komeito, and the Japan Communist Party (JCP). They speak of strict control by the faction or strict control by the Executive Department, but in comparison to other parties, the LDP is relatively free of strict control. [Oshima] Yes, that seems to be the case. Now that you say so, I understand the situation. [Ota] I believe the highest estimate of those LDP Diet members who can say the party did something for them in the process of becoming politicians is 10 or 20 percent. That gives you an idea of how small a role the party plays in the creation of a single LDP Diet member. I was fortunate in being officially recognized from the very beginning, but there are very few junior Diet members who waged their first election campaigns with the blessing of the party. Diathesis of Shinseito and Komeito [Oshima] Have you ever met a senior politician who was willing to sacrifice himself for a cause? [Ota] Never. I have done a number of things in the establishment of the Miyazawa government, thinking that it would be a good cause, but without his orders. Even in connection with the Kanemaru scandal, his downfall should have provided for conditions conducive to placing Miyazawa in a position to more easily exercise leadership. We took action for the downfall of Kanemaru, but Miyazawa failed to assume leadership in forming a second cabinet. I was very disappointed because of his failure to act. I will not say that I was the only one to continuously advise Mr. Miyazawa within the Miyazawa faction to run in elections for party president, but there were only a few who did so. In fact, there were more individuals who according to the circumstances then prevailing advised him that it was not the right time and that he should side with someone with more potential. [Oshima] What do you fear most about the Hosokawa government? [Ota] I believe the Hosokawa government is in reality the Shinseito government. Very strong leadership is being exercised by Shinseito and Komeito. I am very concerned about this situation. Although this may sound just like the criticism addressed relative to the Keiseikai at one time, the reason is that Keiseikai was not a place for healthy debate within the faction. It was of the same diathesis as the Communist Party and Komeito. In previous times, when Mr. Kanemaru or Mr. Ozawa said, "Face right," everyone faced right without any discussion whatsoever. If one were to speak of the strong unity, the flip side of the coin would have revealed that particular situation. It was a unified group in which individualism was suppressed, giving birth to such a situation. The faction was plagued by those circumstances from the days of Mr. Tanaka. I for one rebelled at the situation. Both Komeito and the Shinseito are plagued by such a diathesis. [Oshima] True. They have much in common. [Ota] Yes. They are similar. I believe that organizations that do not allow for open debate by individual Diet members are a very detrimental existence to the principles of democracy in this nation. Even Mr. Morihiro Hosokawa first said, "I will follow a third path," next spoke of "cooperation from outside the cabinet" and then became prime minister. He went through three stages. In effect, he took advantage of Shinseito and Komeito. Leadership is being exercised from and everything is influenced by pronouncements from these two parties. I believe that situation makes for a very frightening future. [Oshima] Both Shinseito and Komeito are formidable opponents. [Ota] And, they are able to wage strong election campaigns. Setting aside the question of whether one should join Shinseito or Komeito, there is an atmosphere that indicates individuals who are not sympathizers will not be able to survive. If the situation remains unchanged, they'll be able to win 70 percent of the Diet seats. If one were to think of the future, he might visualize fascism. If an election were to be held under the single-seat constituency system under current conditions, I believe we will see the creation of Japanese politics controlled by fascism. The general public will probably awaken to reality when that happens, but then it will be too late. [Oshima] You are speaking of a loud victorious laugh coming from Ichiro Ozawa and Taisaku Ikeda. [Ota] Yes. [Oshima] How do you view the relationship between these two prominent individuals? [Ota] I believe an agreement had been reached before [Ozawa] left the LDP. He was able to leave the LDP with confidence because an agreement had been reached beforehand. [Oshima] Is this a case of a two-phased material and psychological alliance? [Ota] I cannot address the material facet because I have not seen the evidence, but reality shows evidence of a monolith. Agreement on this point had been reached way back, because before the Shinseito was established, there was constant agreement in utterances by Hata, Ozawa, and the Komeito from the time the duo became public information. [Oshima] How would you respond if one questioned you about a future for the LDP? [Ota] At the present time, we have seven parties and one faction or eight parties, depending on how you count, but if the various non-LDP parties and factions were to unite, the LDP probably has no future. If the small electoral district system is approved, there is a strong possibility that our party will go from 40 percent to 30 percent of the Diet seats. If that happens, I feel we're not going to be able to make a recovery. Even if a recovery were possible, it'll probably take 10 years. [Oshima] The statement that there is no tomorrow for the LDP reflects some degree of reality. [Ota] You are right. Regaining control of the government will require fundamental change. I believe doing so is the mission of our particular generation. [Boxed item: Representative Seiichi Ota was born 30 October 1945 in Fukuoka city. He is currently 47 years old. His father Seinosuke was chairman of the Hakata Daimaru Department Stores. He was graduated from Keio High School and Keio University Economics Department and earned a doctorate in economics from the Keio University's Graduate School. He served as assistant professor in the Economics Department of Fukuoka University and visiting assistant professor at Brown University in the United States before being elected to the House of Representatives in June 1980. He has since been reelected five times from the First District of Fukuoka and is a member of the Miyazawa faction. He has served as parliamentary vice minister of finance and chairman of the House of Representatives Finance Committee and is currently chairman of the LDP Finance Committee. As this background suggests, his next career objective would be to become minister of Finance (under the condition that the LDP resumes control of the government). Between himself and his wife Yasuko, eldest daughter of Former Fukuoka Prefecture Governor Kamei, he has two daughters. Among books published are coauthored "Summary Theory Concerning Macroeconomics" and jointly translated "Samuelson's Economic System." On 25 June 1993, he formed a group to create a new LDP and became its representative sponsor.] [Interview Postscript] The name and face of Dietman Seiichi Ota became known throughout the nation on 26 July [1993], when he quickly announced himself as candidate for LDP president. As I watched the tall Mr. Ota announce himself for the candidacy with the words, "I am resolved to sacrifice myself for the position," I could not understand why such a young leader would want to take such a step. Frankly speaking, I asked for this interview because I wanted to seek an answer to that question. I was able to dispel myself of the question in my own peculiar way as a result of that interview. I can cite as one factor the sympathy that he inspired among young politicians because of his consistent actions against Kakuei Tanaka and Shin Kanemaru. In essence, there is an aura about Mr. Ota. Just as absurdly amicable relationships formed among politicians because of being in the same initial election year group or next door neighbors in the Dietmen's office building lead to unusually important factors, this aura about Mr. Ota can play a decisive role in determining whether he becomes a leader. However, future prime ministers will probably be determined on the basis of intellectual capacity. Sooner or later, Mr. Ota may just be called upon to fill that position.
