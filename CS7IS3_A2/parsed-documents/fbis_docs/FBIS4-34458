The bill proposed is meant to modify agrarian reform to increase the country's agricultural production. The Indian and peasant communities, however, think the new measure is harmful because it offsets the agrarian reform's increased benefits and empowers the government to confiscate land presently owned by Indians and hand it over to wealthy landlords. Before the bill was approved, Indian organizations closed roads and organized marches to the Congress. Now that the bill has been signed into law, the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador [CONAIE] threatens to intensify the protests until the law is repealed. Traditionally, the Indians' protests have been marked by the closure of highways and confrontations with the police but without excessive violence.
