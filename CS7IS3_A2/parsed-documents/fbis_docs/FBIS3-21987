On the one hand, Washington wants more legal weaponry to be given to judges and to the police "this year," incorporating -- for example -- the case of "repented" persons in Argentine law, in reducing the penalty of detainees who provide information on drug trafficking. The U.S. administration also pointed to the need for the military to provide logistical support (without engaging in combat with drug traffickers) to security forces. Foreign diplomatic sources, however, have told CLARIN that the powerful DEA (the U.S. antinarcotics agency) believes that "for the time being" this step is not necessary. These precise and clear signals of what Washington wants were conveyed by DEA head Robert Gelbard [as published] to officials at the Foreign Ministry, the Interior Ministry, and the Antinarcotics Secretariat during his stay in Buenos Aires last week. The sole reference to the Argentine military becoming indirectly engaged in the fight prompted a debate within the government, causing its anticipated rejection by the military. However, according to the same sources -- who preferred to remain anonymous -- the DEA has another priority that comes before this one: incorporating, among others, the following provisions in the antinarcotics legislation: Informers: Depenalize the actions of persons who, while not being criminals, provide information about drug traffickers. The repented: Judges should be allowed to reduce penalties in return for information. This case is regulated by law in other countries. In Spain, for example, it was applied to the case of "repented" Andy Cruz Iglesias, who reported to Spanish judges the Argentine connection of an international dollar laundering gang, which originated the so-called Yoma affair in Argentina. Undercover agents: Policemen should be allowed to infiltrate traffickers' organizations, under judicial branch control. Judicial branch controlled shipping: International drug trafficking operations should be allowed to continue in order to arrest the gang in the receiving country. The objective of these measures, which are added to the reiterated claim for increasing control over the "laundering" of narco-dollars, is to prevent the crimes linked with drug trafficking and to try to catch the heads of the organizations. DEA priorities for Argentina are consistent with the U.S. concern about the releasing of Colombian John Arrayave Arias, one of the men involved in the "Shrimp Operation." However, and despite the fact that Secretary for the Prevention of Drug Abuse Alberto Lestelle has submitted a bill with several of these measures, Peronist Deputies and Senators are not too enthusiastic about "adjusting" the legislation in this regard. Opposition sources in Congress maintain that the first two provisions in particular will, in addition to contributing to fighting drugs, facilitate investigations into reports on corruption. During a stay in Buenos Aires on his way back to Washington, Gelbard was seen in Recoleta on Friday, in an informal lunch with Foreign Ministry Secretary General Andres Cisneros. The statements by the U.S. principal deputy assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, Michael Skol, that the Latin American military should engage in logistical support actions in the antinarcotics fight has revealed that the Foreign Ministry and the Defense Ministry disagree on this controversial proposal. (Skol proposed that the Armed Forces cooperate in intelligence, transportation, logistics, and river, coast, and airspace control activities). "The Armed Forces should not have any type of engagement whatsoever, because antinarcotics action is a police task," said a high-ranking Defense Ministry source consulted by CLARIN. This opinion is shared by the Radical Civic Union. Before adopting that position, Defense Minister Oscar Camilion consulted with the four chiefs of staff about the proposal. According to military sources, the answer was unanimous: It is not a central or a secondary mission of the Armed Forces. However, considering that drug trafficking is a growing problem, Camilion is advocating the idea of "giving more infrastructure" to the Border Police, to the National Prefecture, and to the Police, instead of engaging the Argentine military in the fight against this scourge. Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella, however, adopted a legalistic position: Argentina "has already fulfilled" the request by Skol by including in the National Defense Law a provision under the terms of which the Armed Forces will be allowed to intervene in the hypothetical cases in which drug traffickers overwhelm security forces, high-ranking Foreign Ministry sources told CLARIN.
