In addition, Lasic is one of those who revived Napredak (Progress), the Croatian cultural society, he is president of the Croatian Intellectual Forum, cochairman of the Croatian Section of the International Society for Human Rights (IGFM), and before the war he was director of the Sarajevo theater festival MES for a number of years. So it is not difficult to find a topic for conversation with him. Nevertheless, we restricted ourselves to the political present and future of the Croatian people in Bosnia and Herzegovina. [Sabic] "Well-informed sources" have been talking for a long time now about world (U.S.) pressure on the Croatian and Muslim side to revive the alliance between these two peoples who are victims of the aggression of Serbian expansionism. It can now be said that the pressure has borne fruit. Did the Muslims and Croats have to get in a situation of being subjected to pressure? [Lasic] We are in a historical situation in which the international community has an interest in a Croato-Muslim alliance. We are well aware that the armed conflict between the Muslims and Croats was artificially stimulated and provoked in a dirty way. Without going into all the reasons on this occasion, both sides were involved in bringing about the conflict: The Muslim fault, 70 percent of the total, came from the central government, and the Croatian fault, representing 30 percent, was manifested at the peripheral level. Almost the same proportions, but in reverse, occurred during the lengthy period of the peace initiative. "Offers" of peace were issued from the Croatian Supreme Command and from the Muslim peripheral level. So, the sporadic and local conflicts occurred through the Croatian fault, but the all-out war, such as was waged in the Lasva Valley, occurred because of the strategic moves and decisions of the Muslim leadership. It now seems that even in the Muslim General Staff they have finally committed themselves to accepting the Croatian peace initiative, and we should expect the disagreements to be resolved around a green baize table instead of on the battlefield. Now, just as in the past, the key is in the hands of the Muslim leadership. The Option of Contact Did Not Die [Sabic] Did the United States necessarily have to become involved for the Croats and Muslims to agree? [Lasic] U.S. policy did not need to use any pressure at all on the Croatian side. All we needed was for our position to be understood, and when that finally occurred, there was the first constructive result, the preliminary agreement with the Bosnian Muslims. What is more, the Americans did not put anything together by force, but they precisely noted the most favorable realistic opportunities, and they could be recognized and read in Croatian policy. Let us not forget, even in the worst moments of the conflict with the Muslims there were always flickering options of contact and possible agreement, a process was taking place in the background with attempts to resolve the crisis and revive the alliance, which Franjo Boras was persistently initiating in the Presidency, but without a real response. The Americans were certainly well aware of that, and I would not say it was a question of their dictate, but of their understanding and correct orientation--to which their skillful ambassador, Victor Jackovich, I believe, also contributed. That is essential for us, because this is the most powerful force in the world, and it opened up for Croatian efforts and Croatian policy an immediate occasion for application and realization. [Sabic] Many people are inclined to say that a change of direction occurred in Croatian policy toward Bosnia and Herzegovina. Do you agree with that assessment, and to what extent? [Lasic] Croatian state policy is conducted in an unbroken continuity, and those "many people" are just "some people," specifically those who talk about this and judge it either from a lack of understanding and misconception or out of some petty political interest of their own. The Croatian national objective has always been peace. Aggression and war were imposed on the Croats, both in Croatia and also in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Defense, which was a grave necessity, implies both counteroffensives and various tactical moves. One cannot always go in a straight line. Even back in Lisbon in February of 1992 during Muslim, Serb, and Croat talks, I set forth views which were verified in the center and supported by President Tudjman, and mostly they have been taken over in the present preliminary agreement between the Croats and Bosnian Muslims. The effective instructions of President Tudjman were never directed at any point toward the breakup of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I can personally testify to that. Of course, on every occasion he explicitly called for the protection of all the Croats and the Croatian interest. The Croatian Defense Council Was a Lightning Rod In March 1992, the Serbs established authority by hook or by crook over a large part of the territory, and the Muslims imposed their hegemony more and more wherever they could. Some of our political leaders hesitated and gave in to foreign domination out of opportunism. In April 1992, Mate Boban, with the help of the center, organized the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] as a defensive energy, as a lightning rod for the Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The creation of Herceg-Bosna as a part of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina occurred when the HVO, in a period of grave crisis, in a balance of armament and strength of the armed forces that can be said to have been disastrous for the Croats, was defending undefined territory and organizing life under wartime conditions. The Muslims, the worst victims of aggression, were getting extensive and unselfish humanitarian, logistical, and armed aid from the Croatian people, which was itself threatened. Herceg-Bosna thus became a provisional historical fact, a symbol and reality of Croatian defense, and that is beyond dispute. There is something wrong with the Croatism of anyone who does not see and recognize that. What kind of policy and whose (Croatian) policy deserves the credit for the Croats finally having become an important principal with an internationally recognized decisive role? Everyone knows the answer, and perhaps that is precisely what has caused the frustration and paranoic reactions of those "many people" who have seen the lines of the battlefields only on the map. As the popular saying goes: Where were they during the thunder and lightning? [Sabic] When Bosnia and Herzegovina is discussed, people inevitably talk about the peoples who live in it living together. One often hears that these nationalities have been condemned to live together, but also that life together is no longer possible after all that has happened. Which of these assertions is closer to the truth? [Lasic] When you talk about life together today--that is a great dilemma. The impression that life together could still be revived and preserved comes from historical inertia, because everyone is in trouble, all the nationalities want peace, the world wants peace, and it is almost certain that the invective of war and the fateful tensions could cease in Bosnia if they could all finally understand one another. If we do not want an agreement, we will have war. Regardless of the injustices during the period of communism, when every nationality was neglected and frustrated--but the Croats constantly and most of all -- this bloody war certainly would not have occurred had it not been for Serbian expansionism and intervention from outside for conquest. The principle of living together in Bosnia has had various manifestations and arrangements of human relations. That would have prevented this dirty war, and that is beyond any doubt, but war was imported into Bosnia. Indeed even the drastically altered conditions that resulted in two nationalities being crammed together in a tight space -- 65 percent of the population on 30 percent of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina--could not have caused major armed conflicts, although that fact did create tensions. In other words, even under the impossible conditions coexistence among the nationalities, in particular between the Croats and Muslims, victims of the same aggression, could have been maintained through goodwill and mutual respect for each other's interests. [Sabic] Can it be said that you are an optimist concerning the final Croato-Muslim agreement that is to follow after the preliminary agreement? [Lasic] I cannot speak for the Muslim side. The Croats, one can confidently say, accept the agreement generally as the result of the Croatian peace initiative. An Open Appeal to the Third Nationality [Sabic] If all the documents from the negotiations in Washington and Vienna are adopted, what has to be done? [Lasic] I think that a temporary transitional government must immediately be set up to conduct the affairs of state on the basis of the agreement until the next democratic election, which would be in a period of one or two years, i.e., until the safe return of the displaced persons and refugees. Officials should be appointed by the legal political parties in the proportions in which they obtained ethnic legitimacy in the last election: For the Croats, this is the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Union], which took 94 percent of the Croatian seats in the Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and all 100 percent in the Presidency. [Sabic] You mention elections, but still they are far away. But that is a question of democratic procedure, and this must be put on the "agenda" sooner or later. [Lasic] Electoral procedure is one of the decisive issues. Each nationality should elect its own representatives. Otherwise, because the balance between the Bosnian Muslims and Croats in the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina is 72:28, the Croats would get "representatives" who in both practice and theory would in every respect be determined by someone else and not they themselves. That is the case in Sarajevo today. Which means ethnic voter lists must be drawn up. Incidentally, that is one of the virtues of the Vienna negotiations, which, according to the reports, are going favorably, which means in the interest of both nationalities. [Sabic] Many people familiar with Bosnia and Herzegovina are ready to say that the prospects are not good when two of the three nationalities in it reach agreement independently of the third. Can that rule also be applied to the Croato-Muslim preliminary agreement? Are there prospects for the Serbs to join the agreement as well? [Lasic] The opportunities of joining are open to them, because the preliminary agreement has been drafted in such a way that an open appeal to the Serbs is implied in its context. If we are to judge by the public signals of Serbian policy, at least for now there are no prospects of the Serbs, as an ethnic entity, entering the federal arrangements and confederal relations with the Bosnian Muslims and Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We should not forget that the Serbs carried out aggression and they are still behaving aggressively. But we should be mindful that the agreement between the Croats and the Bosnian Muslims alters the political reality of Bosnia and Herzegovina, toward which the Serbs, like it or not, must take a position and define their policy. In other words, they will not be able to behave as though nothing had happened, and things do not happen in a vacuum, but in a world context, so that it is logical to expect the consent of the world, of the United States and Russia first of all, to a solution that would not be the temporary situation of a temporary truce, but the firm foundation of a lasting peace. [Sabic] This crucial time is being marked by meetings of the Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina. There have been particularly significant meetings in Sarajevo on 6 February and in Livno on 8 February. These and other meetings indicate that the Croatian people in Bosnia and Herzegovina should rally around a policy which will be viewed as their joint program. But the approaches and points of departure differ. Who is right? [Lasic] In the present reality in Bosnia and Herzegovina, viewed in isolation, it is absolutely certain that all the Croats, that is, the representatives of the Croatian people, from all the areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina, are right. There are causes and reasons which brought the Croats to a historical impasse precisely now when they are waging a decisive struggle for the natural right of Croats in their native country of Bosnia and Herzegovina. But we must not omit from our thinking that a right can result in harm to the person seeking it if the scope of that right does not offer a future. And the future of Croats and of their right in Bosnia and Herzegovina can only be the entire Croatian interest, and here that entirety for us Croats is based on the outlook, security, and strength of the state of Croatia. Was It a Case of "Petty Folklore"? [Sabic] Is the expected reconciliation with the Muslims a reflection of our inability--either because we were not strong enough or because of the inhibiting force of the world community--to resolve the situation "in the field"? [Lasic] There is no real historical chance of reviving concord between the Croats and Muslims, nor of finding a modus vivendi with the Muslims, but also with the Serbs, and achieving an authentic agreement, if we are disunited and weak. Every Croat must keep that in mind. The alliance with the Bosnian Muslims does not assume that we are weak and would therefore enter into an alliance and back off from legitimate Croatian policy. In that case, we would not be equal, but we would be in a subordinate position. Our strength is great, but the more united we are, the greater that strength. [Sabic] If that is so, that means that the alliance with the Bosnian Muslims is a thrust that comes from our increased strength. [Lasic] Right. We can enter into an alliance with the Bosnian Muslims, under the final agreement, in two ways: forced because we are weak or oriented because we are strong and united. This is one of the historical moments which every Croat must recognize. This is, after all, everyone's personal destiny as well. For example, if all the Croats in Sarajevo were put ad hoc into positions of power in the government of the Bosnian Muslims, there would be no guarantee of their fate. It would be up to someone else, just as is the case today of the Croats who out of the kindness of the Muslim leaders are part of the administration of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Sarajevo or are organizing "rallies" there. Without a guarantee of the Croatian entity, the Croats as individuals, and also as groups, have no future whatsoever. This does not mean that we should not understand the vital necessity and human attempt to do something to make that position easier. That is why that meeting in Sarajevo should be seen as a real reflex on the part of those 300, or more precisely 306, people who attended out of the 35,000 Sarajevo Croats. In principle, if procedure is respected, and that means legitimacy, support should be given to the effort for the Croats to meet, to become stronger, to enter into association, to study and inquire into their possibilities. [Sabic] You and the writer Andjelko Vuletic were unable to take part in the meeting in Sarajevo. Ivan Lovrenovic, one of the organizers of the Sarajevo meeting, recently declared in an interview that preventing your coming to Sarajevo was "petty folklore." What actually happened? [Lasic] That is well-known to the organizers of the Sarajevo meeting; in the end, they stood behind that. Only one of them, Ivan Lovrenovic, used the phrase "petty folklore over everything" to describe the effort to keep away those political Croats who by all parameters which they themselves have proclaimed should have been on the list, present and active. The only thing Lovrenovic, as is evident from his statement, was afraid of was that no one from the Muslim government would come to the meeting--and he knew, in "consultation" with Ivo Komsic, back in Zagreb, not only who would come, but also where they would sit and what they would say. The news about the unprecedented incident, in which even the Croatian ambassador, Dr. Zdravko Sancevic, was also held back, which Lovrenovic refers to as a mystification, traveled around the world. Our ignoramus does not mention that this provoked negative comments and marked the entire Sarajevo meeting as a totalitarian ruse of proven advocates of their own exclusive doctrine. The people on the program for that meeting did not include any new names, new people, those who authentically suffered, but mainly those who in the democratic election did not win the confidence of the people for their policy, and so they are attempting to "fish in muddy waters," using real troubles in their manipulation. That is nothing new. This is familiar ground. The sad thing is that a Croatian intellectual, a writer, should pretend not to know what the suspension of democratic procedure means and where it leads. The real issue was not whether particular people could take part, but the procedure itself, and Western civilization is based on procedure, at least that is well-known. [Sabic] And in the end, how close are we to peace or far from it? [Lasic] Peace must be closer and closer to us. If we are to favorably regulate our relations with the other two nationalities, the Bosnian Muslims and Serbs, in a truly civilized way, in a possible reconciliation of interests, because only this can be lasting, we must be strong, and that means united. That is the sense in which one should understand the gist of President Tudjman's policy and his vision of the entirety of the Croatian interest. Croatian state policy, which is legally and legitimately, by the political will of the Croatian people, conducted by President Tudjman, must under wartime conditions be valid for every Croatian patriot and conducted in a unified fashion. Our point of departure must be the historical imperative, which is that we do everything we can so that we Croats, in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in general, are unified so that each individual, with his pledge to that unity, has his own prospects for resolving his own crucial issues in the entirety of the general interest of the Croatian people. The Traps in the Washington Agreement [Sabic] What is your view of the preliminary agreement? Is there a trap concealed in it? [Lasic] The preliminary agreement is a superbly drafted legal document. From the standpoint of constitutional theory and practice, in particular there are two critical points for me. The legislative body with two chambers--the House of Representatives and the Chamber of Nationalities--copies the model of the SFRY [Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]. In the House of Representatives, which might be superfluous in the federal interethnic state community at the highest level, where there are only two principals representing two nationalities, the membership is made up on the formula "one man one vote." The Bosnian Muslims will always have a more than two-thirds majority--72 percent--so that by the nature of things the Croats would always be in a minority if there should be a difference of views. It is good that a correction has been envisaged in the Chamber of Nationalities. But the function of the latter chamber must be defined precisely. If at the highest level of the state we are to achieve ethnic reciprocity of rights in all institutions with government prerogatives, the constituent nationalities, regardless of numbers, must have equal rights. Unless absolute parity is pursued in the legislative, judicial, or executive branches, I see a danger in that one ethnic majority could be set against the other ethnic minority. That could become a generator of tension and conflict. The longevity and stability of the federation are guaranteed only by parity, consensus, and every office open to change. Another critical point might be the provision on the central government, where parity is also essential. This is an institution familiar from the Belgian Constitution (the Council of Ministers consists of an equal number of ministers representing the French and Flemish languages). But, as Dr. Mate Granic, who headed the Croatian delegation in Washington, has stated, every agreement presupposes reconciliation of views, i.e., compromises. In the interest of the federation and its future, I believe that it would be worthwhile for our side and the side of the Bosnian Muslims to envisage certain institutions that would eliminate the possibility of ethnic confrontation in both practice and theory. [Sabic] Negotiations are being conducted in Vienna concerning the constitution of the federation. What might arise as a problem in the wording of the constitution? [Lasic] A big job was done with the signing of the preliminary agreement in Washington. Nevertheless, the constitution is the fundamental document of the state, and one must show maximum caution. Dr. Ivo Sanader, who heads the Croatian delegation at the negotiations in Vienna, said that the territorial arrangement is perhaps the most difficult problem. Every Croat who lives on "problematical" territory will agree with Dr. Sanader. The duty to undo the knots which have been tied for almost an entire century has fallen to our generation. Let us start with the first level of government--the opstina. In territorial terms, the opstina arrangement of Bosnia and Herzegovina was done to suit the holders of power at the time, in the sixties, so perfidiously as to make the Croats a minority wherever possible. The borders of the opstinas and kotars that came down from Austro-Hungary were altered in minute detail and with the same objective back in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. For instance, Mostar is frequently referred to as a community in which the Muslims have the majority--about 44,000 Muslims, it is said, as against 42,500 Croats--that is a difference of 1 percent on behalf of the Muslims. That is a striking half-truth, because those figures apply to opstina territory. In the actual city of Mostar, according to the official 1991 Census, which is the most unfavorable to the Croats, there are about 27,000 Muslims and 31,000 Croats. But on one side a locality inhabited by Muslims was added to Mostar Opstina, while another with 100-percent Croatian population was taken away. The example of Dobretici, where there are 4,500 Croats, today driven from their century-old homes, is also significant. By administrative decision, Dobretici was annexed to Skender Vakuf Opstina, with which it does not even have direct highway links. If Dobretici had been in Travnik or Jajce Opstinas, the Croats would have an absolute majority, as they did before. There are several such examples: Derventa, for instance. If new/old opstina boundaries that are fair should be established, we would have a territorial situation much more favorable to us.
