FR940912-1-00047 FR940912-1-00010 V. Administrative Requirements A. Public Hearing A public hearing will be held, if requested, to discuss the proposed rule in accordance with section 307(d)(5) of the Act. Persons wishing to make an oral presentation on the proposed NSPS for SOCMI Wastewater should contact the EPA (see FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT ). Oral presentations will be limited to 15 minutes each. Any member of the public may file a written statement before, during, or within 30 days after the hearing. Written statements should be addressed to the Air Docket Section (see ADDRESSES ), and should refer to Docket No. A&hyph;94&hyph;32. A verbatim transcript of the hearing and any written statements will be available for public inspection and copying during normal working hours at the EPA's Air Docket Section (see ADDRESSES ). B. Administrative Designation and Regulatory Analysis Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the EPA must determine whether a regulation is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the requirements of the Executive Order. The order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. This action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations are documented in the public record. C. Compliance With Regulatory Flexibility Act Under section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq .), federal agencies are required to assess the economic impact of federal regulations on small entities. The Act specifically requires the completion of a Regulatory flexibility Analysis in those instances where small business impacts are possible. Because the impact of the proposed rule on all entities is likely to be insignificant in terms of changes in industry output, changes in expansion plans, and employment loss, it is reasonable to conclude that small entities, regardless of their number, are not significantly affected. Therefore, because these standards impose no adverse economic impacts, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has not been conducted. Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. D. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements for this proposed rule have been submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act , 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq . An Information Collection Request (ICR) document has been prepared by the EPA (ICR No. 1697.01), and a copy may be obtained from Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch (2136), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460, or by calling (202) 260&hyph;2740. The public recordkeeping and reporting annual burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 13 hours per response for reporting and 203 hours per respondent for recordkeeping. These estimates include time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch (2136), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW.; Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' Responses to any OMB or public comments on the information collection requirements contained in this proposal will accompany the final rule.
