Ruiz made the statement in the Monimbo neighborhood of Masaya one day after announcing his candidacy for the FSLN secretary generalship. At a preparatory meeting for the FSLN Special Congress, Ruiz urged Sandinists to elect a secretary general who will promote a strong party. He urged them to choose "a secretary general who represents unity, not bands or gangs," because that would turn the FSLN into a minority party." Ruiz stressed that all FSLN members are revolutionaries and leftists. It is not as some people "have been saying over the past two days, that there are Sandinists on the right and the left." In a speech before some 200 Sandinists at the Minimbo gymnasium, Ruiz said he is "totally convinced that unity is the only solution" for Sandinists. Ruiz, who is known as Modesto among the Sandinists, said that this unity is urgent. "While we are here talking, (Managua Mayor Arnaldo) Aleman is creating an army of between 40,000 to 50,000 activists. What are we doing in the meantime?" he asked. "If we are defeated (in 1996), it will be because we are divided while they are united and working together," he warned. Ruiz, who is also FSLN treasurer and member of the Ethics Commission, said the renewal of the FSLN is necessary because Nicaraguan society is becoming more democratic every day. "The FSLN's renewal is not treason; it is a revolutionary step. Anyone who takes a defensive stance is not on the right track," Ruiz noted. This renewal process, however, requires one line of ethics, Ruiz added. "A revolutionary cannot have a set of ethics different from those held by his party," he stressed. Those ethics should be based on peace and should help resolve the problem known as "la pinata," an aspect that Ruiz described as an ethical flaw that "stains the Sandinist record." "Ideas cannot be fought by disqualification," Ruiz said, demanding an open and fair debate among Sandinists. "I am still opposed to the use of dirty methods in the debates," he stressed. "If this is what happens on the eve of the convocation, what can be expected at the Congress party?" Ruiz asked those present, among them Deputies Doris Tijerino, William Ramirez, Danilo Aguirre, and Julio Marenco. During his visit to Masaya, Ruiz said he favors keeping the National Directorate name, which can be expanded and renewed to maintain some historical factors and ensure continuity. At the same time, he said the current trends "will be dissolved if we find the correct solutions for our problems." He also noted his contributions to the debates among the Sandinists, to which the National Directorate was opposed. "We are glad we supported those trends (of opinion) because now we have the opportunity to discuss our views," he concluded.
