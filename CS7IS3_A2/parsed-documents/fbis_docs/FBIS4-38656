Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigoriy Karasin, who read out the document at a news briefing for journalists, noted that this was not the first act of terrorism against Russian servicemen. "These acts are planned and executed," said the diplomat, "by those who are not interested in defusing the situation in Tajikistan and who want to drive a wedge in Russian-Tajik relations". The statement points to the need for the Tajik authorities thoroughly to investigate the murder, and catch and punish the perpetrators. The Foreign Ministry expressed condolences to Borisenkov's relatives. Russian diplomatic sources told RIA that within minutes of the act becoming known, Emomali Rakhmonov, the Tajik head of state, phoned to the Russian frontier troop headquarters and said all measures would be taken to catch the criminals and asked to convey condolences to the family of the killed man.
