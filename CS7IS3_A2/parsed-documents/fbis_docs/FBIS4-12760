Israel has arbitrarily imposed blockades and an economic siege on them. This situation has alienated the people and the leadership from the accord and implementation. Clearly, by this policy, Israel wants to create a rift between the leadership and the people. If pressure on the people in the occupied territories is coupled with concessions by the negotiators abroad, the result will be -- or so Israel thinks -- that trust between the inside and outside will be shaken. If this is the aim of the multipronged offensive, Israel and the United States will discover that this policy will fail because the Palestinians, who have been burned by the fire of repeated offensives, know how to wage these battles. This policy will not succeed in paralyzing the Palestinians' power of confrontation. [passage omitted] Israel has repeatedly tried to avoid dealing with the PLO to no avail. Ultimately, it was forced to conclude the Oslo accord with the PLO. Has Israel returned to its old attempts to confuse the Palestinians and raise doubts about the Palestinian people's real address? As if they can find another address to peddle their schemes and avoid commitment to the Oslo accord's clauses, or at best to implement the accord in accordance with the Israeli interpretation. Israel fails to realize that all these attempts are doomed to failure. It would be better for Israel to accelerate implementation of the peace process in a way that responds to legitimate Palestinian demands. This is the only way to prevent the deterioration of the situation and stop acts of violence from both sides. The situation cannot endure maneuvering and foot-dragging. Israel might be thinking that time is on its side. This may be so in the short-term, but over the long-term Israel will realize that it has lost a golden opportunity for achieving a settlement with the Palestinians. If Israel is betting on fragmenting the Palestinian people's national fabric, this is not in its interest because it will have to return to square one, namely, to the cycles of the conflict from the beginning. If today Israel is rejecting the Palestinian address, in the future it will find not one but several addresses for negotiations -- one more radical than the other.
