Everyone will shut up. Telegrams will be sent to the Kremlin: We surrender. Where is the Russian sanitary corps?" (Vladimir Zhirinovskiy [V.Z.]) [ZAKAVKAZSKIYE VOYENNYYE VEDOMOSTI] The NIPG was the only party in Georgia that congratulated Vladimir Zhirinovskiy on his election success. The telegram states, in particular: "The successful outcome of the elections manifested the aspiration of the Russian people toward independence. We wish you success in following this course. We hope that the victory of the LDPR will have a positive influence on the achievement of genuine freedom in Georgia...." [SOKOLY ZHIRINOVSKOGO] "We have so many bacteriological and chemical weapons that we can contaminate the entire planet. We will infect everyone. We will have a crater but the whole world will perish. In two weeks...." (V.Z.) [ZAKAVKAZSKIYE VOYENNYYE VEDOMOSTI] "Certain politologists call Zhirinovskiy a fascist out of ignorance. In actual fact, he is not a fascist but a nationalist in the best sense of the word." (Zurab Gagnidze [Z.G.], chairman of the NIPG, candidate of philosophical sciences) [SOKOLY ZHIRINOVSKOGO] "Furthermore, we are not seeking praise. However, the fact that President Saddam Husayn received us as the leaders of an opposition party and did not receive anyone else -- I was the first Russian received by him after the war.... He received me because a friend had arrived, a person whose position was well known. We exchanged gifts." (V.Z.) [ZAKAVKASKIYE VOYENNYYE VEDOMOSTI] "I believe that Gaydar is a bigger fascist...." (Z.G.) [SOKOLY ZHIRINOVSKOGO] "We can frighten [them]. I can tell you straight away: I will blackmail them. I'll tell them: If you start interfering in Russia's affairs in the south, we will take effective measures.... We already have military platforms in space. They don't know where they are. The weapons are ready there and targeted on the United States. If Yeltsin tells them that he has apparently given instructions to remove some of those weapons targeted on the United States, I, on the contrary, can tell Clinton that we have targeted all our weapons on America...." (V.Z.) [ZAKAVKAZSKIYE VOYENNYYE VEDOMOSTI] "The LDPR is trying to preserve the national originality of its people...." "One can't help being attracted to.... The main thing is the struggle against American aggression. For a long time now, the Russian and Georgian intelligentsia have been alarmed by the spiritual expansion of the United States." (Z.G.) [SOKOLY ZHIRINOVSKOGO] "Troubles for Russia have always come from the south. All corruption began in the south when Stalin created favorable conditions for his native Georgia. This despot ruled Russia for 30 years during which time Georgia became perverted and tainted with corruption that spread to Armenia and Azerbaijan and subsequently to the East and central Asia; it crept to the surface and finally engulfed the whole country." (V.Z.) [ZAKAVKAZSKIYE VOYENNYYE VEDOMOSTI] Correspondent: "Aren't you afraid that Zhirinovskiy will carry out his promise to create the provinces of Tiflis and Kutaisi on the territory of Georgia?" [Gagnidze] We have to understand one another and locate the painful spots.... [SOKOLY ZHIRINOVSKOGO] "The most effective method -- perhaps the only method -- of putting an end to the bloody conflicts in the south and the Near East is to create a so-called `sanitary corridor' and, thereby, separate the irreconcilably bellicose countries. Russia is required to implement this division, a country that, in the process of historical development, has been called upon repeatedly by countries in the East to act as an arbitrator and protector (defender) of weak [states] who have been subject to the aggression of neighboring peoples. This was the case with Georgia and Turkmenistan that voluntarily attached themselves to Russia...." (V.Z.) [ZAKAVKAZSKIYE VOYENNYYE VEDOMOSTI] "One would like to believe that all his recent assurances are sincere...." (Z.G.) [SOKOLY ZHIRINOVSKOGO] "The small nations can raise an objection; they will say that they also would like to have their own states. My answer will be: You should have thought about this a few centuries ago." (V.Z.) [ZAKAVKAZSKIYE VOYENNYYE VEDOMOSTI] "I am very sorry that Shevardnadze has refrained from giving an assessment of the victory of the liberal democrats." (Z.G.) [SOKOLY ZHIRINOVSKOGO] "The ideal variant would have been to preserve the Russian empire. Some people do not like the word "empire" but I like it very much. It is a normal good word." (V.Z.) [ZAKAVKAZSKIYE VOYENNYYE VEDOMOSTI] "In such conditions, our party has every reason to rely upon the support of the broad mass of the people. Let no one be worried by our small numbers. It is not a matter of quantity. The Communist Party suffered a crisis due to the excessive increase in the number of its members. The main thing is that there is support for our party's ideology. The future is ours." (Z.G.) [SOKOLY ZHIRINOVSKOGO] "The principal aim is the restoration of the Russian state (within the borders of the USSR)" -- from the LDPR program.
