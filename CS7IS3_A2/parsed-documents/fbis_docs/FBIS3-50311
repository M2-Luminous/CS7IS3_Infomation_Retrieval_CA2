They are suspected of having committed the crime of incitement against a community which is punishable by Par. 269 (1) of the Penal Code." The impeachment followed a Tuesday rally, at which the party, registered with the Budapest Metropolitan Court in October 1993, defined itself as successor to the Hungarian fascist Arrow Cross party and its leader, Ferenc Szalasi, who was executed in 1946 for crimes against humanity. The participants in the rally denied that the holocaust had ever taken place. As reported earlier, in Thursday's NEPSZABADSAG, government spokeswoman Judit Juhasz said that the Tuesday rally had violated constitutional order. She added that the government found the activity of the party unacceptable.
