Shanxi courts handled a total of 9,413 economic disputes and finalized 8,264 of them in 1993. They also settled through mediation 4,268 economic disputes involving overseas partners. These cases involved more than 1.2 billion yuan. The positive role being played by the judicial bodies of the province has guaranteed proper and timely settlements of cases of bankruptcy, patents and contracts, which have burgeoned in recent years as China pursues a market economy. According to provincial authorities, 90 percent of the economic disputes in Shanxi concern economic contracts and often drag in large and medium-sized enterprises. Courts in Shanxi have zeroed in on the `knot of triangular debts', a lingering problem featuring a host of parties. Officials said that courts in the province's Yangquan city have helped enterprises collect debts worth more than 57 million yuan and saved 40 enterprises from bankruptcy. To tackle the increasing number of economic disputes arising from the rush to profitable markets, many courts in Shanxi have set up mediation centers, which have helped settle cases involving more than 270 million yuan for some 2,300 enterprises. The courts also have helped local tax departments gather 310 million yuan in taxes and collect some 730 million yuan in overdue loans. The money, in turn, was used to redeem IOU scrip issued to farmers [sentence as received]. In co-operation with their counterparts nationwide, the courts have broken down local protectionism to settle cross-province economic disputes. Incomplete statistics show that Shanxi courts helped to collect more than 83 million yuan from outside the province last year. Shanxi courts have also kept a close look at the latest developments in the forms of economic disputes, in a bid to provide legal protection for the establishment of a modern enterprise system in the province.
