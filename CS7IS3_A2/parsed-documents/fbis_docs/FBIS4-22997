Arbatova, M. Reeben, A. Koestner, Tallinn Engineering University and Chemical and Biological Physics Institute at Estonian Republic's Academy of Sciences, Tallinn; UDC 577.122] [Abstract] The unique ability of cyclodextrin glycosyl-transferase (CGTase, EC 2.4.1.19) to form cyclodextrins--carbohydrate macrocyclical compounds--from starch and the high commercial and research value of cyclodextrins prompted an attempt to produce and characterize antibodies to the Bacillus macerans CGTase without known monoclonal antibodies to this enzyme. It is noted that poly- and monoclonal antibodies to CGTase may be used for detecting small quantities of enzyme, even in complex mixtures, and for enzymatic inactive studies of the CGTase molecular structure, comparative immunology analyses of CGtases of various bacteria species, and for specific enzyme immobilization on a solid carrier, making it possible to screen a broad range of microorganisms which are likely CGTase producers. To this end, a Bacillus macerans BKMB-506 strain with the culturing liquid was obtained from the national microorganism collection of the Microorganism Biochemistry and Physiology Institute at the USSR Academy of Sciences. The experimental procedure is outlined. The production and cloning of the hybridoma-producing antibodies to CGTase, the production of large quantities of MCAs and their purification, the production of MCAs conjugated with horse radish peroxidase, studies involving indirect, direct, and sandwich enzymatic immunoassay analyses (IFA), the classification of MCA subtypes, and immunoblotting of the 5B1 clone (one of 15 positive clones) are described in detail. The purified enzyme was used to immunize BALB/c line mice; as a result, MCAs and 15 different hybridoma which produce MCAs to CGTase are successfully produced for the first time. The MCA and polyserum interaction with alkalophilic B. macerans CGTase is examined. The MCA to the 5B1 clone recognizes both native and denatured B. macerans CGTase forms. Moreover, the CGTase dimer molecule has two closely positioned epitopes recognized by antigens to the 5B1 clone. Figures 3; references 17: 3 Russian, 14 Western.
