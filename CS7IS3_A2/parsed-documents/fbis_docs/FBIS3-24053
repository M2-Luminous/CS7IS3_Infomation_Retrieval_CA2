But there inevitably remains outside of the framework of this approach the immense and fundamentally important inner sphere of spiritual, cultural, and religious-moral national existence. For Russia, though, this sphere has traditionally performed an outstanding, if not to say determining, role. The thousand years of our history unambiguously confirm that we are an idealist-people, a dreamer-people, an ascetic-people frequently guided in our practical activity not by the arguments or reason and considerations of advantage or sober calculation but by sincere urges of incredible force. It is they that at times elevate Russia to the pinnacles of almost unattainable selflessness, sacrifice, heroism, and sanctity, it is they, on the other hand, that cast it at times into the abyss of nihilism and moral decline. For many centuries the zealous custodian of national ideals and shrines was the Russian Orthodox Church. It carefully made sure that the boundless breadth of the Russian nature engender holy ascetics and sovereign builders sooner and more often than brilliant adventurers and insatiable power-seekers. The very emergence of stable Russian statehood is connected with a spiritual phenomenon--the baptism of Rus in 988. Having already been in existence for roughly 150 years by this time, the union of East Slav tribes, which had withstood the difficult struggle against the khanate of Khazaria, represented nonetheless a formation that was diffuse and infirm and threatened by the minute to fall apart under the pressure of intertribal contradictions and localistic tribal interests. And only the adoption of Christianity, which united the freedom-loving Polyane, Drevlyane, Krivichi, Vyatichi, Radimichi, and others by a strong philosophical union of common religious ideals, stabilized its state form, initiating also the start of the formation of that unique ethnopolitical and spiritual-ideological community that is known to the world as the "Russian people." Since this time each in the least bit significant period of our history has inevitably coincided with stages of the spiritual formation of Russia. The people's memory has carefully preserved the visible symbols of this coincidence--the figures of all-Russian spiritual mentors such as Sergiy Radonezhskiy or Nil Sorskiy and sovereign Russian leaders like the lord-and-master princes Aleksandr Nevskiy and Dmitriy Donskoy. Saviors of the fatherland Minin and Pozharskiy, the legendary Suvorov and the "White General" Skobelev, Marshal Zhukov, and the present state-absolutist patriots, unreconciled to national disgrace and the humiliation of the Russian State, to an equal extent--whether they were aware of this or not--professed one and the same geopolitical principles, whose ideological, spiritual, and religious content were the ancient prophesies of the Monk Filofey. Russia came by this continuity, however, at a high, immensely high price. Beginning in the 18th century, which had been marked by Peter's drastic, "shock" reforms, small cracks began to appear in the state-philosophical monolith of Russia. The point is that the "Russian idea" in its classical form does not recognize state power as being of self-sufficing significance, defining as its purpose merely the creation of the optimum conditions for the achievement of justice and the moral ideals of personal, family, and social justice. The entire ideology of the "symphony of powers"--spiritual, moral-religious and state, and secular--is based on this fundamental assertion. But it was this "symphonic" principle that was disrupted by Peter, who unambiguously made paramount the imperial, majestic might of the country as the highest priority. The two centuries that followed were a period of continuous growth of the state might of Russia. But simultaneously with this the internal contradictions in society, the spiritual state of which ceased to be a paramount concern of the state, became increasingly profound. A severe crisis of Russian national self-awareness was the inevitable consequence. As a result, when the discrepancy between the external sovereign greatness of the enormous country and its internal ideological state passed the critical level, Russia fell under the burden of its own contradictions. End of Empire, Take Two It seemed that the storm and calamities of revolution had become an irreparable geopolitical catastrophe for the state that had taken shape. Russia's continental nucleus became disarticulated (the Far East Republic and the newly formed states of Ukraine, Crimea, the Transcaucasus Republic, and the Baltic countries, isolated from vitally important coastal zones). The spiritual continuity of Russian life was brutally and abruptly severed. Nonetheless, the centuries-old sovereign-state inertia was able to overcome the pathogenic energy of disintegration. In spite of everything--the ideological Russophobia of the radical party wing, the temptations of "world revolution," and the class antagonisms that raged in the fire of the civil war--the country restored its natural geopolitical shape incredibly quickly. The people paid a fearful price for this, shouldering the horror of punitive measures and starvation, devastation, the all-hands-to-the-pump work at the industrial construction sites, and the burdens of forced collectivization. But they believed in the ideals of justice and human brotherhood. By their heroic efforts the state rose again from the dead, in spite of everything, before the eyes of an astonished world, rising up like a phoenix from the ashes. The main strategic problem for the long-term survival of Russia arrayed in the new state body of the Soviet Union was that of the discovery of a constructive world outlook and the restoration of the spiritual life of the nation. It was in this sphere that things were most difficult: The totalitarian trends of state power had acquired an ugly, exaggerated form, having become deadened in ideological tenets ruthlessly suppressing the least spark of free, inquiring thought. This situation, however, began to change rapidly in the years of the Great Patriotic War, which became the pivotal moment of the Soviet period of Russian history. Without getting into assessments of the personality of Stalin, it has to be acknowledged that he more than anyone else understood the need for philosophical renewal within the framework of the geopolitical form of the USSR. He also understood the urgent need for the harmonization of the new realities with age-old Russian tradition. The result of this understanding was the abrupt change in the official ideology of the Soviet Union in the period 1944-1953. The basis of the new policy was the aspiration to create an effective "ideology of patriotism" corresponding to the demands of contemporaneity which could be a dependable philosophical basis for the functioning of the state mechanisms of the enormous Soviet state and its allies. Many pages of authentic Russian history were restored and all persecution of the church was emphatically terminated as the first order of business to this end. The USSR won the most dreadful and bloody war in the history of mankind. Fully in accordance with its interests, it expanded to the utmost the zones of influence in the sea and oceanic directions, blocking henceforward any attempt at direct threats to the borders of the state. The postwar devastation was overcome and an autonomous, self-sufficient economic system capable, given the competent domestic use of the country's colossal natural wealth, of providing for the steady growth of national well-being was created in record time. Were its pace to have continued, the "ideological restructuring" left no doubt that within 10-15 years the USSR would have fully overcome the negative spiritual consequences of the revolutionary storms, having developed their constructive results to the maximum here. The creation of native nuclear weapons ruled out all possibilities of power interference in our internal affairs. Such prospects evoked in the West--the traditional citadel of "oceanic geopolitical strategy"--a state close to panic. There were reasons for this. A most powerful alternative center of world influence personifying justice and the power of the people and the social, political, cultural, and economic principles of the "continental" line of development of human civilization was taking shape in the person of the USSR--the continuer of the Russian geopolitical tradition. The centuries-old efforts of the commercial and financial cosmopolitan elite to create a "world system of the international division of labor"--the economic basis for the subsequent political standardization of mankind within the framework of a "new world order"--were in jeopardy. This dramatic global encounter of the two archetypes of world politics, economics, and culture was personified in the opposition of the two superpowers--the United States and the USSR--which acquired the forms of the cold war. The anticommunist rhetoric of the "free world" and its hypocritical concern for "human rights" here were the ideological screen behind which the invariable age-old geopolitical interests of the West demanding the weakening and, if possible, the destruction of Russia were concealed from the gaze of the uninitiated. This hypocrisy has become particularly obvious now, when the unconcealed flouting of the rights of millions of Russians and Russian speakers, who in the new ethnocratic states of the CIS have found themselves in the position of second-class citizens, not only is not evoking condemnation but is being tacitly welcomed by the "civilized world." From the moment of the start of the cold war, when the secret mechanisms for the destruction of the Union were engaged, through the final act of the drama in 1991, three stages--three consecutive periods of the development of the geopolitical sabotage against the USSR--may, conditionally, be distinguished. The first began immediately following the death of Stalin and was conducted beneath the slogans of "de-Stalinization" and "Khrushchev's 'thaw.'" History does not know the subjunctive mood, alas: The some 57 years of life were not enough for Stalin to have made his "ideological restructuring" irreversible and to have ensured the restoration of the Russian spiritual-state tradition, which had been unjustifiably interrupted. The leader's body was not cold in the Mausoleum before his successors were abruptly turning back the ideological course. The "entire civilized world" clamorously welcomed this maneuver, maintaining a modest silence about the labors it had cost its politicians, diplomats, special services, and "agents of influence." The era of "stagnation" naturally continued this pernicious process. Dogmatic teachings that were patently out of date were preserved by the efforts of many of the present "outstanding" democrats who were at that time implacable conformist types. The absence of a healthy philosophical base was echoed in painful confusion in the sphere of Soviet geopolitics also. On the one hand geopolitically substantiated attempts to expand the zone of Soviet influence in the strategic continental directions--in Afghanistan, for example--assumed a categorically impermissible radical-militarist nature. On the other, measures like the attempt to "install" Nicaragua in the "world socialist system," which were utterly pointless from the geopolitical viewpoint, swallowed up giant forces and resources. Deprived of an adjusted geopolitical concept, the USSR succumbed to the temptation of a "symmetrical," "socialist" mondialist response to the strategic challenge of capitalist mondialism on the part of the United States. Year after year this insupportable burden exhausted our powers. Year after year we strained the resource and industrial and military and demographic potential of the country in the chase after mirages of global world leadership entirely alien to the very spirit of the Russian geopolitical tradition. The result was soon reflected: The economic situation within the USSR began to deteriorate consistently, and the ideological, religious, and cultural vacuum created unprecedentedly favorable conditions for the infiltration in society of alien values, destructive philosophies, and egotistically parasitical stereotypes of social consciousness. Such was the general situation when the "generational change" in the highest Kremlin echelons enabled Russia's enemies to embark on the second stage of the dismantling of the USSR--the creation of the ideological base for its collapse. Its chronological framework encompasses 1985-1990--the bulk of Gorbachev's "perestroyka." I have in previous articles dwelt in sufficient detail on the specific mechanisms of the "slow-moving catastrophe" that ensured the destruction of the USSR, so to avoid repeating myself I would note merely that the main areas of the ideological war against the Union were the avowed Russophobia of the denationalized part of society, the incitement of antipatriotic hysteria cleverly linked "in a package" with furious anticommunism, and the deafening, importunate propaganda of the "charms" of the liberal-democratic philosophy. The third, culminating stage of the global geopolitical sabotage took just two years (1990-1991) and was aimed at political assurance of the disintegration of the single Union state. In the domestic political sphere it was characterized as a "struggle against reactionaries" in the directive machinery of the party and government, an abrupt outburst of outlying-area nationalism and regional separatism, the paralysis of the central authorities, and use of the "democratic" Russian leadership as a battering ram to destroy the general economic, legal, political, and cultural space of the country. Today, with the passage of two and a half years filled with dramatic events that have been the natural consequences of the collapse of the USSR, it may be maintained with confidence that the backstage sponsors of this operation were, for all that, unable to achieve all their strategic goals. And the plan was this: By way of speeding economic and political changes within the Soviet Union and the broad-based, single-minded ideological indoctrination of the populace in a "democratic" spirit, to cause in the disoriented society a loss of natural immunity connected with intuitive healthy conservatism and the self-preservation instinct. Having suppressed the protective mechanisms of social self-awareness, to ensure the collapse of the unified state against the background of the buffoonish Emergency Committee "putsch." On the wave of this powerful state-ideological cataclysm accompanied by the most powerful shock to the mass consciousness to occupy the key positions in all the leading spheres of social life. To ensure the maximum possible degree of Russia's economic, political, and military dependence on foreign (Western) influence. And, most important, having availed themselves of this, to trigger on a par with the ongoing chaos, economic crisis, and shocked state of society the mechanisms of internal Russian disintegration, taking as a basis the separatism of the national outlying areas, regional contradictions, and the fratricidal struggle of Moscow's political clans. The "architects of perestroyka" evidently had in mind a broader timeframe for the realization of their far-reaching operation. The studies of social psychologists and practical experience show that the "period of shock" of the mass consciousness which is caused by sudden social upheavals and which "switches off" the mechanisms of social self-protection cannot be long. In the case of Russia-USSR the engineers of the collapse could have counted on four or five years, no more. Taking as the initial reference point of the shock processes on the territory of the USSR the year of 1989, when "perestroyka" had entered its "revolutionary" phase, we see that this timeframe is today at an end. Here are the true reasons for the "surprise" results of the recent elections, this is the cause of the growth of the "neoimperial" mood in society! "The sleep of reason gives birth to monsters," the sharp and shrewd Goya once said. Today the collective reason of our people is beginning slowly and with difficulty to awake following many years of an arduous and tormented half-conscious state. Choice of Destiny The charges against Russia of a "revival of Great-Russian chauvinism" and the "pursuit of an imperial policy," which have become fashionable as of late, reflect the increased agitation of the world's backstage players aware that the entire global decades-long anti-Russia and anti-Russian intrigues are now on the verge of being thwarted. For it is obvious that, having regained consciousness from the long semi-comatose state, having recognized their true national-state interests, and reviving on the basis of millennial historical traditional values, Russia will not accept the humiliating role being imposed on it and will restore its natural position of great world power. So: Today, as in past centuries, the vital interests of Russia consist by no means of "subduing," "conquering," or "subjugating" anyone. Not of endlessly expanding its territory, which is the most vast in the world as it is. Not of straining the people's efforts in vain attempts to impose on someone or other its own view of the world as the "sole correct" and uncontested view. They consist primarily of gathering on its land, under its own roof, under the protection of a single powerful state, all Russian people, all who consider Russia their motherland, all the peoples that agree to link their historical destiny with it. And Moscow does not have the right to abandon this traditional role of "gatherer of the lands"--and will not do so, however much some people would like to "hound the Russian bear in his den." Further, our vital interests consist of ensuring in our own home unconditional and lasting peace guaranteed against all encroachments from outside and from within, the corresponding foreign policy conditions having been created for this. Of protecting our historical individuality and distinctive spirituality against the aggression of alien, perverted stereotypes of mass consciousness and against the noxious influence of immorality elevated to a norm of life and individualistic egotism extolled as a virtue. In order to create for our fellow citizens all the necessary conditions for education and health care, labor, and recreation, the development of science and culture, and a happy childhood and serene old age. Russia is today experiencing a unique moment in his existence. We have in the past century acquired invaluable experience, by which we have come at an exorbitant, irreplaceable, excruciating price. Are we unable to take advantage of it; to consider the tragic lessons of the past, multiply the heroic traditions of national history, and from the height of the present dolorous days finally overcome the internal disagreements, having restored the successive and consistent current of our life? Today, for the first time in three centuries, we have a real opportunity to restore the symphonic unity of our spiritual and state traditions. We are now all too well aware of how heavy the yoke of aspiritual statehood can be, and sense all too well what a fearful moral price would have to be paid for the loss of the ideals that could impart to our conciliary, national, social being sacred, eternal, and nontransient meaning.... But in order to realize all our actual potential we must learn to take a sober view of things, without illusions or embellishment. This means first and foremost that we must recognize that far from everyone in the world around us will be happy that Great Russia is reviving. Life's realities are such that the age-old struggle of the two rival geopolitical principles will not end merely because Russia's democrats have suddenly become smitten with a tender love for the Western way of life. And this being the case, let us recall, nonetheless, that: the state exponent and most complete spokesman for the competing geopolitical model is the United States of America superpower with its strategic allies constituting altogether the geopolitical bloc that we are accustomed to designating by the term the "West"; the economic exponent and industrial pillar of this model is the commercial and financial cosmopolitan oligarchy straining after world domination and constituting the main driving force of the contemporary mondialist plan of the "new world order"; its philosophical exponent is liberal-democratic ideology, whose basic features are extreme individualism, militant aspirituality, religious indifference, a devotion to mass culture, antitraditionalism, and the principle of the domination of the quantitative over the qualitative principle.... There are, unfortunately, exponents of this geopolitical principle within Russia also. A fifth column of politicians and public figures and parties and organizations of a "pro-West" persuasion united by a commitment to the "wild" market and the unchecked "integration of Russia in a single world community" and the unconditional priority of "values common to all mankind" are appearing primarily in this unattractive role. Let us say at once that the affirmation of these facts is under no circumstances a call for confrontation and enmity. On the contrary, a clear understanding of the situation only increases the chances of a reasonable compromise and mutually beneficial cooperation. I would like in conclusion to emphasize once again the thought that serves as the leitmotiv of the entire article: We are today faced with a choice that will determine Russia's fate for a long time to come. A choice that we should be helped to make by our entire age-old history, our entire tragic and heroic experience, and by all our incalculable and nameless compatriots who from age to age created the great state and defended it against encroachments and adversities. We simply do not have the right to make a mistake in this choice!
