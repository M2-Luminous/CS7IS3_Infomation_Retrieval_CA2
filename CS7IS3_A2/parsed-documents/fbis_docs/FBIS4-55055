Yesterday [6 May], the Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers [KERM] debated the draft law; KERM is then to send its remarks over to MPW. A preliminary version of the draft law which will take KERM's remarks into account, will most probably be announced on Tuesday [10 May]. It is quite possible that a first reading of the governmental draft reprivatization law and the already prepared draft coming from Sejm deputies, will take place in the Sejm at the end of May and the beginning of June. A Limited Reprivatization MPW wants reprivatization to include not all those who have claims but only those whose property was taken away from them illegally in the 1944-58 period, as well as all those who have still not received the reimbursements they had been promised. Those former owners who have already received some form of benefit -- even if the benefit does not equal the value of the property lost -- would not be entitled to reimbursements. The current residence of persons applying for reimbursements, would be irrelevant. Anybody who at the time of nationalization had Polish citizenship and has not lost it up to now, could apply for reimbursements. So reprivatization would also cover persons of dual citizenship. The issue of heirs to those whose property was nationalized, has not been settled yet. According to preliminary estimates, reimbursements would be paid exclusively in the form of reprivatization coupons (this would also apply to former owners of Warsaw-area land). But former owners would not get as much as experts would assess their losses to have been. For instance, if the value of the property taken away from an owner does not exceed 1 billion of today's zlotys, then the former owner would receive 1 billion zlotys in coupons. Former owners of property which was worth more than 1 billion would not receive the property's value in coupons. They would get 1 billion plus some part of what remains above that amount. One would be able to introduce these reprivatization coupons (which should actually be called reimbursement coupons) into circulation for a period of up to 10 years. In order to retain the coupons' real value, they would be valorized by an indicator of investment price increases (there is preliminary talk of about 10 percent per year). Therefore, an owner of such coupons could sell them for cash, could buy with them real estate put up for auction by gminas [small administrative units] and by the State Treasury, or exchange them for shares of enterprises being privatized. Former owners would receive the right of preemption of their old real estate being sold by the State Treasury or by a gmina. Ownership Transformation Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek stated yesterday that he is opposed to holding a referendum in which all citizens would speak out on whom to return property to, and how much of it (the government is also considering such a possibility). An Unlimited Reprivatization Another draft reprivatization law has been sitting in the Sejm for six months now. It was prepared jointly by MPW and associations comprising former owners in the summer of 1993 (when there was no Sejm). The draft law found its way into the current Sejm as an initiative by Sejm deputies from virtually all deputies clubs. Among other things, the draft law envisages a very comprehensive reprivatization (without the restrictions suggested by the government). In those cases where it is possible, property would be returned either in its natural form or in the form of a so-called unwanted property which means for instance waste land. Reprivatization coupons would be handed out as a last resort. The law would not conflict with the interests of "third persons who acquired nationalized property in good faith" (for instance farmers who received land as a result of agrarian reforms, or factories established on the basis of nationalized plants). Owners Protest A reprivatization council at MPW demands reimbursements in a natural form. According to Krzysztof Laszkiewicz, the council's chief, 2.5 million hectares of land is not being cultivated whereas there are some former owners who could utilize the land. Yesterday, the council expressed sharp criticism of the governmental initiative, and announced that the former owners will protest and will file a law suit over the governmental draft with international institutions designed to watch over observance of human rights, among them the UN and the Helsinki Committee.
