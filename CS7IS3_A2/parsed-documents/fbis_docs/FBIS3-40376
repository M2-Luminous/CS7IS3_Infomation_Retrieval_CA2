These fructose polymers offer new industrial possibilities which were inconceivable using conventional glucose polymer starch. The Van der Have refining company is investigating whether the production of fructans is economically profitable. Fields of sugar beet stretching as far as the eye can see. This is how the future looks if we make everything from sugar, from phosphate substitutes in detergents to plastics components. Theoretically, sugars are cheap raw materials which are easily decomposed in the environment. However, one problem is that not all sugars are equally suitable for use as building blocks for new products. So far, starch, which is easily recoverable, has been used with varying degrees of success. Recent results obtained by Dr. Sjef Smeekens' research team (Molecular Cell Biology research group at the University of Utrecht) bring high-polymer fructans within the reach of industry. Smeekens obtained the high-polymer fructans by transferring a gene from the bacteria Bacillus subtilis to plants. Only a limited number of plants produce fructan with a chain length of between 10 and a few 100 fructose units. Certain bacteria, including types in our oral flora, can easily produce fructans consisting of 100,000 units. The genetically engineered plants are now equaling this performance. Delft University carbohydrate chemistry Professor Herman van Bekkum welcomes this discovery under the motto: "The longer the chain, the better. The very fact that you can safely cut up the raw material or make derivatives from it gives you far more possibilities." Spin-off The fructan-producing plants came about more or less as a spin-off of the fundamental research carried out by Smeekens. He investigated how the end products of photosynthesis, such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose, are processed by plants. An increasing concentration of sugar in the cell may possibly inhibit photosynthesis and therefore the growth of the plant. By studying the effect of various types of sucrose polymerization on photosynthesis, you obtain a clear picture of this inhibition. Using genetic engineering, the researchers endow the plant cell with enzymes which can produce specific types of sugar chains, for example fructans. If a plant is to produce an alien sugar chain without problems, it is also important that the increase in this chain takes place in the right place (in the cytosol, the vacuoles, or in the extra-cellular environment itself). To ensure that this happens, the genetic information about the storage location of the final sugar chain is controlled, as well as the gene which codes for a specific polymerization enzyme. By combining these properties, Smeekens' group was the first to succeed in making plants produce high-polymer sugars. In follow-up research funded by the EC and other institutions, Smeekens will delve further into the possibilities of the technique. "We want to condition the polymerization enzyme in such a way that specific polymerization occurs. This means that we can also produce sugars other than fructans. Ultimately, we can make any plant produce any sugar." Scaling Up The SON and STW [Technical Sciences Foundation], which are financing the research, have now filed a patent application for the principle of producing specific sugars using genetically engineered plants. Furthermore, the Zeeland-based Van der Have company has bought the operating rights. Research leader Cees Noome believes it is now time to select a suitable crop (sugar beet or chicory for example), so that the high-polymer fructans can be profitably produced. Noome says we will have to wait and see whether a useful result will be produced quickly. "Such long-term projects are risky because of the many stages involved in producing an ideal, stable strain. It will be a few years before we can say we have an industrially useful raw material."
