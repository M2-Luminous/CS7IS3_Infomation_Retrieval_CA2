FR940822-2-00122 FR940822-2-00061 A special accelerated cycle has been established for considering such projects. In order to be considered during the special cycle, concept papers proposing implementation projects must be mailed by October 6, 1995. They will be considered by the Institute's Board of Directors at its meeting in November, 1995. Applications based on those concept papers will be considered by the Board at its meeting in March, 1996. j. Assessing the Impact of Health Care-Related Issues on the State Courts. This category includes projects to develop educational curricula and other materials to assist judges in: •Determining and preparing approaches for dealing with the impact on the State Courts of proposed or enacted changes in the State and Federal health care systems, including the anticipated increase in the number of disputes regarding the scope and nature of insurance coverage; •Understanding and responding to the scientific, legal and ethical issues raised by the continuing advances in the application of biotechnology to health care, including the use of gene therapy and genetic testing; and •Using effective innovative remedies in long-term environmental and toxic substance exposure cases such as medical surveillance orders. In previous funding cycles, the Institute has supported projects to: develop guidelines for judges in cases regarding the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment; prepare benchbooks, handbooks, videotapes, and training materials on guardianship, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and AIDS; conduct a series of health science-law workshops for judges and judicial educators; and develop a deskbook for judges on medical-legal issues arising in juvenile and family cases. k.
