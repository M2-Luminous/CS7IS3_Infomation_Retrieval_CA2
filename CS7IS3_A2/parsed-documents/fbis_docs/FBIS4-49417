These currencies must not be used on the mainland, unless they have been changed into renminbi at designated exchange points. As for when foreign businesses and foreign banks can begin the renminbi business, Zhou Zhengqing said: "It is not time yet. I think it is impossible even by the end of this year. This policy will not be pursued until the tax rates for mainland banks and foreign banks are the same." In light of the mainland's current economic situation and inflationary pressures, he stressed: There is no such thing as an overheated economy in mainland China, although a few real estate markets are overheated because of speculation. However, it is now completely under control. In particular, the new anti-inflation measures introduced recently have worked more effectively. Wang Xuebing, president of the Bank of China, also told these reporters: The Hong Kong dollar will gradually be banned from use and circulation in the Zhujiang Delta. Travelers from outside China must change their Hong Kong dollars into renminbi for use, that is to say, the Hong Kong dollar will be allowed to be changed at exchange points in stores on a basis of "immediate exchange and immediate use." Wang Xuebing said that the number of these money exchange points will gradually be increased to meet the needs of travelers from outside the borders to reduce the inconvenience brought about by the ban of the circulation of the Hong Kong dollar.
