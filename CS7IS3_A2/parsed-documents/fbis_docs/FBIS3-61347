I Served 15 Years For It'"] [Text] We met with Mustafa Dzhemilev, chairman of the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar people, immediately following a session of the Presidium. The third in the past week, and not, by all accounts, the last, since the question of the Crimean Tatars' participation in the presidential elections has yet to be decided. The appeal to the people to boycott these elections has been suspended, meanwhile. [Pronina] Mustafa-aga, on New Year's Eve you met with Leonid Kravchuk, president of Ukraine, and on 2 January the Mejlis announced a boycott of the elections for president of Crimea, although the Congress of the Crimean Tatar People had adopted a directly opposite decision. Is there some connection here? [Dzhemilev] You do not have it quite right. The question of elections to the Supreme Soviet, where we are allocated a particular quota, for which I voted myself and called on others to do likewise, was considered separately at the assembly at that time. As were, separately, the presidential elections. As far as the latter are concerned, I have been opposed from the very outset since I am convinced that neither the Crimean Tatars nor people of other nationalities are, if it is viewed realistically, interested in the institution of a presidency in Crimea. The presidency is only for a particular group of people, which aspire to the creation of a strong power for the solution primarily of their own problems. I pointed out in my report at the assembly that the Presidential Election Act was adopted by the Supreme Soviet of Crimea, which we did not elect, and on the basis of a constitution which we consider unacceptable for ourselves and which entirely ignores our legitimate sovereign rights. But at the same time, considering the alignment of political forces that is shaping up (there is a great evil and a somewhat lesser evil, which is mirrored in the fact that people wholly of the Zhirinovskiy level are straining after power on the peninsula), we are allowing of the possibility of use of the votes of Crimean Tatars in the election of the least of all the evils. The assembly's decision was, therefore, a compromise. Although there was mention of the unacceptability of the institution of a presidency in principle, the final decision on participation in the elections was at the same time left to the Mejlis. We are prepared to support the candidate who honestly declares the indivisibility of the evolved borders, that is, allows no mention even of a reconsideration of the question of the current territories of Ukraine and Russia and the affiliation of Crimea, inasmuch as our people see their self-determination in a national-territorial autonomy within the framework of Ukraine. He must be a candidate who will at least state that he sees the strengthening and restoration of Crimea's statehood on the basis of respect for the Crimean Tatar people's right to self-determination on their territory. [Pronina] Judging by the decision of the Mejlis, none of the present presidential candidates as yet meets these requirements? [Dzhemilev] We have had discussions with many politicians, with candidates for the office of president included. I should say, incidentally, that as of late everyone has greatly loved the Crimean Tatars, and even Leonid Grach, the candidate of the Communist Party, sent his people to us, via whom he promised the positions of deputies in all the rayon soviet executive committees if the Crimean Tatars vote for him. So it was that, having analyzed all the election programs and having assured itself that not one of our conditions is observed in them, the decision not to take part in the elections was made after stormy debate at the Mejlis Presidium session on 2 January. But I had a meeting, which took place after the decision of the Mejlis, with Nikolay Bagrov, and some of our comrades believe that we should take part in the elections for all that. Because there is a real danger that instead of Nikolay Bagrov, whom they consider the lesser evil, real extremists could come to power. It is these members of the Mejlis who are insisting that the decision be reconsidered. After two days of stormy debate, a decision to boycott the elections was adopted all the same. But on 5 January 12 members of the Mejlis submitted to me, in accordance with the standing orders, a petition requesting the convening of a new session and a conclusive decision on the matter on 8 January and for the appeal to the people to be suspended meanwhile. [Pronina] So Nikolay Bagrov's candidacy was, for all that, preferable to the others? [Dzhemilev] Yes. All the other candidates, including, unfortunately, Ivan Yermakov, who declares that he would lift the moratorium on a referendum on Crimea's independence, could by their actions create an explosive situation on the peninsula before which the Dniester region and Karabakh could seem like just a game. And when barricades have to be built, a solution of the problems of the Crimean Tatars would go by the board. [Pronina] Mustafa-aga, I would like to return to the start of our conversation--your meeting with L. Kravchuk. [Dzhemilev] I was forced to tell him that I know what democracy is. I served 15 years for it, but a democracy where presidential candidates raise the question of a change in the current borders and a violation of the country's constitution I do not understand and do not accept. A self-respecting state should not be treating this with such nonchalance. I spoke in great detail about the most difficult situation in which our people have found themselves and about the fact that the assistance which Ukraine allocates from its sparse budget should be more specific. All the monies that have been allocated us thus far have ended up with the Administration of Crimea. They have been used to create a parasitic managerial machinery. We have dozens of examples of this money being stolen and used for purposes having nothing in common with the return of the Crimean Tatars. Ukraine has allocated us 240 billion karbovantsy for capital construction in 1994. I asked L. Kravchuk to ensure that this money be channeled directly into the national bank which we have organized in order that we might purchase building materials with it and distribute them to people. A commission with the participation of representatives of the Administration of Crimea and the Mejlis, which would monitor its expenditure, should be created. Some 300-400 homes could, via trusts, be built with the amount allocated, and if the funds are distributed directly to the individual builders, we could resolve the housing problem for 30,000 families. Leonid Makarovich agreed with this and promised to render us every assistance here. The president and I also discussed the enlistment of the help of other countries. Primarily Turkey, whose government is not indifferent to the lives of a kindred people. Prior to my meeting with Kravchuk I had an interview with the Turkish ambassador. He said that the matter could be resolved only with the participation of an official delegation of Ukraine, in which there should necessarily be representatives of the Mejlis. He promised to draw up a program indicating whom we should meet and how the questions of assistance should be decided, but on one condition--that the resources allocated go directly to the Mejlis, not the Administration of Crimea. L. Kravchuk agreed with this also, and such a visit will soon take place, I believe.
