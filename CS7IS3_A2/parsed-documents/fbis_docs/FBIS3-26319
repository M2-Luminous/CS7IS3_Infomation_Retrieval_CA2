After hearing a brief report by the government-funded Taipei Agricultural Products Company, which assured Lien that supplies of all products are sufficient, Lien expressed his satisfaction over the bounty and wished a happy New Year to all market workers. In addition to raising questions about product prices and market administration, Lien told Taipei City Mayor Huang Ta-chou, who accompanied Lien during the inspection tour, that the city government should continue its efforts to promote automation of and direct sales from production sites to offer better service to consumers. The supply of vegetables, fruit, fish and meat has increased by as much as 60 percent with the coming of the holidays, and the supply of flowers and potted plants -- used for holiday ornamentation -- has increased by 20 percent. Calyx canthus, gladioli, chrysanthemums, lilies and anthuriums are especially popular this time of year, and their prices are an average of 10 percent higher than they were for last year's lunar new year. This is the first time that Lien has toured the two wholesale markets since he assumed the premiership a year ago. The markets will close on Feb. 10, New Year's Day, and reopen on Feb. 15. Meanwhile, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry under the Taiwan provincial government also instructed all county and city authorities to increase supplies of all kinds of necessities to satisfy the growing holiday demand.
