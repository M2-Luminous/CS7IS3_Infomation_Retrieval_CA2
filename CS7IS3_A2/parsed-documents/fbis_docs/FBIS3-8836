Meksi said that with the canceling of the contract with the Italian firm Frascino, the responsibility rests on those who have signed the irregular agreement in circumstances which perhaps need to be investigated. Due to the cancellation of the contract, the International Arbitrage Court decided that Albania must pay a fine worth 48 billion and 289 million lira. "With the price for the compensation of the site, the value of the site referred to in the contract amounts to nearly 100 million dollars. We could not allow that someone become owner of a site through an irregular agreement reached with the Albanian Government of that time," Mr. Meksi said, adding that the task of the governments is to put right irregular actions. Regarding different comments in the press about the fine that the Albanian Government has to pay, Mr. Meksi said that he could not realise why the press treats the present government which is restituting an ownership to the Albanian people and not those who caused these damage to the Albanian economy. With regard to the prospective of the issue, Mr. Meksi said: "Our jurists and other experts will consider the best legal solutions for Albania concerning this unjust question which has damaged the country's interests. We hope that a positive solution will be found."
