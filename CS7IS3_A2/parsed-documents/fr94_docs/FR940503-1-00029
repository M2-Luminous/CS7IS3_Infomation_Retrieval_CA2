FR940503-1-00029 FR940503-1-00010 It is unlikely that Congress intended either of these results, and EPA's proposed interpretation avoids them without in any way sacrificing full implementation of Congress' goals for this program. The Agency will be able to fully consider all the factors required under section 113(e), including the number of violations, and the field citation program will still involve significantly lower penalty amounts than the other civil penalty programs in section 113. EPA's interpretation is supported by the legislative history in section 113(d)(3). The field citation provisions finally adopted by Congress originated in the House of Representatives. While an early version of the provision called for a maximum penalty of ``$5,000 per day for each violation,'' this was changed without explanation to a maximum penalty of ``5,000 per day of violation.'' 5 While the House Committee Report fails to explain this change in language, it is important to note that the phrase ``per day of violation'' had long been interpreted by the Agency as establishing a maximum civil penalty for each day, for each separate violation. Various judicial decisions were consistent with this interpretation. 6 Congress' adoption of language with a long-standing Agency interpretation is strong evidence that despite the difference in language between section 113(a) and section 113(d)(3), Congress did not preclude EPA's proposed interpretation but instead authorized the Agency to adopt the same interpretation for the field citation program that EPA had long employed for the maximum penalty provision found in the pre-1990 version of section 113(a). 5 As originally introduced, the field citation program contained a limit of $5,000 ``per day for each violation.'' H.R. 3030, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 283 (1989). A similar provision was employed for civil judicial penalties under ยง113(b) and the new authority for administrative penalty orders under ยง113(d)(1). The Subcommittee on Health and the Environment of the Committee on Energy and Commerce retained this provision for judicially imposed civil penalties, but for the field citations program limited field citations to $5,000 ``per day of violation,'' adopting language from the judicial civil penalty provision in the then current Clean Air Act. House Subcommittee on Health and the Environment, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute of H.R. 3030 at 309 (Comm. Print, November 9, 1989). This version of the field citation penalty provision was later reported out by the Committee, adopted by the House and finally included in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Pub. L. No. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399 (1990). 6 Supra n. 2. The legislative history in the Senate also makes it clear that Congress intended to authorize EPA's proposed interpretation. In the Senate, the bill reported out by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works authorized a field citation program with a maximum civil penalty of ``$5,000 per day for each violation.'' 7 The bill passed by the Senate contained a very different provision, establishing a $5,000 maximum ``per inspection.'' 8 In conference, the Senate's clear mandate for a maximum dollar amount, no matter the number of violations, was rejected in favor of the version passed by the House. This indicates that Congress did not intend to mandate a similar interpretation for the field citation program. 7 S. Rep. No. 101&hyph;228, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 550 (1989). 8 S. 1630, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. (1990).
