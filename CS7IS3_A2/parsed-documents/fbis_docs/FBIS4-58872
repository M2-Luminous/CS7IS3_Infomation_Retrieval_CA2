By this new plight we mean the outbreak of unprecedented vicious fighting among the sons of fraternal Yemen in the north and the south. [passage omitted] Seeing such an Arab plight and painful tragedy, it was inevitable for Egypt, as always, to rush to save the people of Yemen from destruction. Egypt proceeded from its historical and pan-Arab responsibility toward the Arab nation. The swift Egyptian moves were embodied by the many contacts President Husni Mubarak held with Arab leaders to put an end to the bloody conflict in fraternal Yemen, and by Egypt's call for an urgent Arab League Council meeting to appeal to the warring parties to end the armed struggle, stop the bloodshed, and preserve the unity of fraternal Yemen. Thanks to his pan-Arab sentiments, farsightedness, and discerning vision, President Mubarak realized the seriousness of the Yemeni crisis at its eruption. He worked seriously, in cooperation and coordination with the Arab leaders, to avoid the bloody conflict. He repeatedly sent special envoys to Sanaa and Aden in an attempt to heal the rift and bring the viewpoints of the brothers closer. But it seems that the Arab nation has hired forces, blinded by fanaticism, working for their own interests. They worked to escalate the crisis, not realizing its serious implications against the unity of the people of Yemen, its negative impact on the course of Arab solidarity, and its direct threat to the entire pan-Arab security. Yemen's important strategic and geographic position cannot be ignored at all. [passage omitted] Egypt is once again appealing to the leaders of Yemen to fear God and heed the interests of their country, nation, and religion. It is appealing to them to rise to their pan-Arab responsibility and to rush to suppress the sedition before it becomes too great to control. This requires that the parties sit down together at the negotiating table in a spirit of brotherhood and love and renounce enmity and hatred. More importantly, the people of Yemen should be given a chance to express their will and give their decisive word as to who should rule them through constitutional channels. Then, the enemies of the Yemeni unity will not be able to sell their commodity, the masks will fall from their faces, and peace will once again prevail on the land of fraternal Yemen. Woe betide those who want to turn the wheel of history backward.
