Akashi's spokesman Michael Williams said this afternoon that the Moslem delegation, dissatisfied with the situation around Gorazde where they said armed Serbs still remained, was about to return to Zagreb. The delegation's statement was understood among conference circles as a fresh blackmail rather than the definitive decision. In the afternoon at the Palace of Nations, three news conferences were held at which Williams spoke about Moslems's fresh assertions about the presence of armed Serbs on a hill 200 metres within the 3-km zone from central Gorazde banned for armed soldiers. The final destiny of the talks is most likely to be known around 7 p.m. when Akashi would speak to reporters, Williams said. There are many who believe that the undermining of the talks so far had been a scheme aimed at harming the good name of the Japanese diplomat. In Sarajevo, UNPROFOR (U.N. Protection Force) Commander for the former Yugoslavia General Michael Rose said on Sunday that the evacuation of Serbs from the Gorazde zone had been completed and that this fact was well known to the local Moslem commander on the ground because he was combing the zone together with UNPROFOR. The French AFP news agency learned from General Rose's aides that two or three Serbs were still on a strategically insignificant and hardly accessible hill a few metres within the banned zone. Sarajevo UNPROFOR spokesman Major Baker Halloway told the AFP that these three Serbs were not a threat to Gorazde, an eastern Bosnian enclave designated a safe area. On Sunday morning, the delegation of the Bosnian Serb Republic, headed by President Radovan Karadzic and Army Commander General Ratko Mladic, arrived at the Palace of Nations on time. Karadzic reiterated to TANJUG's correspondent that the Serb side was prepared to sign peace. In the afternoon, leaving the Palace of Nations, Karadzic said the Moslem delegation's behaviour meant the Moslems' dealing a blow to the international public. In Karadzic's words, well-informed circles in Europe assert that those who want Moslems exterminated were in fact pushing the Bosnian Moslems into conflicts now with Serbs and at other times with Croats. Karadzic believed that the Moslems were not sabotaging the conference on their own initiative but that they, to their detriment, were persuaded to choose a wrong tactic.
