I have been deeply interested in the Russian parliament's giant steps toward creating a new history and visited in 1989 and 1990 during the period of the former Soviet Union. [passage omitted] This time, I have again come to Moscow, a city of beautiful culture and long history, in order to build ROK-Russian relations. [passage omitted] I recognize the potential power of Russia in the fact that it repelled invasions by Napoleon and Hitler to be the last fortress of world peace. Russia was twice the focus of changes in the world history of the 20th century. Its advanced science and technology, which launched the world's first space rocket, were precious assets for mankind. I firmly believe in the great spirit and potential power of the Russian people who created the culture and arts that shine today in the history of mankind. Council members: This morning I exchanged frank conversations with President Yeltsin. I firmly believe that the ROK and Russia can become reliable partners for mutual prosperity in the upcoming 21st century. We can cooperate with each other for success in each other's ongoing reforms. We can closely cooperate for the reunification of the Korean peninsula and for our common prosperity. The ROK and Russia are today enveloped in the surging waves of great change and reform. With the collapse of the Cold-War structure and the settlement of the Uruguay Round negotiations, the world order is undergoing rapid reorganization. Some people refer to this as the beginning of an era of globalization, and others say that the post-industrial era has come to an end. However they may all be called changes of the times, and history will make stragglers of not only all countries, but also all individuals, who remain idle in the existing system. The ROK and Russia are carrying out reforms, while surmounting many sacrifices and pains, in order not to become stragglers in the new era and, furthermore, in order to pioneer a more stable and affluent era. The ROK is stepping up its reforms in order to strengthen its competitive power based on the democratization and economic development it has achieved so far. With the success of these reforms, the ROK will see a decisive opportunity for another leap. I firmly believe that the ROK's reforms will create a new prosperous ROK and achieve a peaceful, reunified ROK [pyonghwaroun tongil hanguk] without fail. I pay my respects to the patience and passion [innaesim kwa yolchong] of the Russian people who are participating in democratic reforms and new economic construction. I firmly believe that the sweat and tears shed today by you council members and Russian people for reform will eventually bear the fruits of joy and hope. A new, stable, and prosperous Russia will be a sign to the Russian people, Asian people, and all the people of the world that a new, mutually prosperous era has emerged. Next, I would like to stress the need for the ROK and Russia to make greater efforts for greater mutual understanding between them. The ROK and Russia established modern diplomatic relations in the 1880's. For one hundred years since then there was a period of friendship and cooperation during which Russia assisted our independence movement. On the other hand, our history is also marked by bitter discord and severance. While Stalin's rule imposed blood and sufferings on the Russian people, it brought the miserable tragedy of war to the ROK people. Until ROK-Soviet diplomatic relations were established in 1990, the ROK and Russia had to suffer a period of dispute characterized by mutual distrust and hostility, as evidenced in the shooting down of the Korean Airline plane. We should rid ourselves of this unhappy past to open a new era of mutual understanding. Any form of mutual cooperation will be impossible if we fail to understand one another. I foresee an era of mutual understanding and cooperation between the two countries bearing its fruit. The documents related to the 25 June Korean war that we have received from the Russian Government this time means the liquidation of the dark past that existed between the ROK and the Soviet Union. The volume of trade, which was $900 million in 1990, increased to $1.6 billion last year. The ROK people's investment in Russia amounts to $24 million in 15 cases. As of March 1994, 29 prominent ROK business firms established their branch offices in Russia. With my current visit to Russia as an occasion, practical and substantive cooperative relations will be further expanded rapidly. Supplementary economic cooperation and technological cooperation based on mutual needs will make the ROK and Russia even closer neighbors. [passage omitted] The change in the position of Koreans living in Russia is an important example symbolically showing the change in relations between the ROK and Russia. Council members, another task that we should jointly pursue is to make Asia a zone of peace free from oppression and war. Peace is a long-aspired desire of mankind. However, mankind suffered various wars for the past 100 years. In particular, east Asia has suffered from the imperialists' war of aggression [cheguk chuui ui chimyak chonjaeng] and from the harsh trial of the Cold War system during the past century. The Korean peninsula had to confront such a historical trial right in the front. The Korean peninsula still remained in the state of division. The ROK people and I are making consistent efforts to achieve peace and peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula. Among other things, dispelling [haesosikinuniri] the international community's suspicion over North Korea's nuclear weapons development as quickly as possible is important. This is because peace on the Korean peninsula and, moreover, peace in Asia can never be ensured without clearly resolving the nuclear issue. In addition, world peace cannot be ensured either. The ROK people and I are fully prepared to give economic assistance to North Korea, which is facing a difficult economic situation, for its rehabilitation and reforms [chaegongwa kaehyogul wihae], only if the nuclear issue is resolved. I sincerely call on Russian parliamentary leaders to positively cooperate to resolve this issue. Since I came to office, I planned to visit Russia, the United States, Japan, and China, the countries that are exerting the most important influence over east Asia, and have completed the visit to three countries except Russia. I asked the government leaders and people of these nations to actively cooperate for peace in east Asia, and acquired their support. Now, I am visiting Russia and sincerely discussing the measures for peace in east Asia with Russian leaders, including President Yeltsin. Without Russia's cooperation, peace in east Asia cannot be ensured. This will be the starting point for opening a new history of mutual prosperity between the ROK and Russia. Cooperation of the Russian Government and parliamentary leaders for opening the history of peace will expand peace of the entire world. Let us all unite our strength and become the main force for opening the era of peace. I have experience in leading my life as a parliamentarian for over 30 years. Therefore, I have special affection and friendship toward you all. [passage omitted] I believe that the Russian people will exert more important influence upon mankind's civilization in the 21st Century than any other people of the world. This is because the Russian people have great cultural assets and capabilities of leading the world's civilization in the 21st Century. One of the central pillars of new civilization is being formed in the Asian-Pacific region. I believe that Russia, together with the ROK, will become one of the important main forces of the Asian-Pacific era, because Russia has the great people with unlimited natural resources and boundless potential. The ROK people and I, together with all other people of the world, expect for the Russian people's creative activities. I believe that politics is a process of realizing justice and at the same time, a work of linking the people with the future hope. I hope that the Russian parliament and your Council, be a plaza of consensus of the people toward change and reform, and be a beaconfire illuminating dream and hope of the future to the Russian people who are going through transitional difficulties. I sincerely hope that the Russian parliament will play the key role in creating a new stabilized and prosperous Russia, and that the proud days when Russia again takes a great leap for the world and for mankind will come at an early date. Let us all unite our strength and make efforts for the new long history of mutual prosperity between the ROK and Russia and for creation of new civilization of the world in the 21st Century. Thank you all. [applause]
