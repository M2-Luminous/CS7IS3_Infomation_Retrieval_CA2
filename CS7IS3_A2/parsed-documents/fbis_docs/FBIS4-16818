Is it a forgery? Another attempt to sound out public opinion? A practical joke? The latest sensational leak -- everyone is still talking about the scandal over the notorious "Theory No. 1" -- may well prove to be a canard. But the situation in the Russia-Ukraine-Crimea "triangle" is too serious for us to ignore the confidential document we have received. About a year ago the Ukrainian Defense Ministry elaborated plans for landing Ukrainian troops in the Kuban and the Don which are to be implemented "in the event of an exacerbation or destabilization of the situation in Russia and a deterioration in relations between Kiev and Moscow to a critical point." Back then the Ukrainian leadership began to take measures to create arms systems designed for mass destruction. In particular, the Pavlograd chemical plant was set the task of organizing the production of more efficient missile fuel on the basis of technological documentation obtained from Russia's "Soyuz" Production Association. At the same time the Yuzhmash plant has been developing production of tactical missiles, an experimental batch of which was to be produced in the first quarter of 1994. A number of chemical and biological institutes received additional funding and instructions to step up work to develop binary chemical and bacteriological weapons. The Cybernetics Institute (Kiev) and the "Monolit" MPO [expansion unknown] (Kharkov) began work to study the possibility of recoding the guidance system of the strategic missiles stationed in Ukraine. In December 1993, concerned at the situation in Russian-speaking areas of Ukraine, Kravchuk instructed the Kiev Psychology Institute to carry out secret sociological studies in the Donbass, Odessa, Nikolayev, Kherson, Kharkov Oblast, and the Crimea, which established that between 50 and 80 percent of the population of these regions advocates unification with Russia or a transfer to its jurisdiction. This prompted the start of the personnel reshuffle among the leadership of power [silovoy] structures and the stepping up of work to staff them according to ethnic and nationalist principles. In west Ukraine, particularly in Lvov, paramilitary camps and volunteer militia detachments began to be set up under the control of the local security services; according to certain of their members, they are being readied in order to "smash the Muscovites soon" (the reference is to pro-Russian citizens of Ukraine). At the same time Kravchuk and his team attempted via the pro-Ukrainian lobby in the U.S. Congress to secure support for their position regarding Russia, as a result of which they received assurances and approval from Washington for vigorous action with respect to Russia, the Black Sea Fleet, and especially Crimea and Ukraine's Russian-speaking population. During his U.S. visit in March 1994 Kravchuk allegedly received confirmation of this. In late March 1994 the upper echelons of power and Ukraine's power structures actively worked on former Crimean Supreme Council Chairman Bagrov to get him to agree to lead the pro-Ukrainian nationalist movement in the republic in opposition to the Crimean president. Meanwhile the movement of firearms and other weapons to Crimea, intended primarily for the Crimean Tatars living on the peninsula, from Chechnya was begun via structures in opposition to the republic's president and taking part in deliveries of oil and petroleum products to Crimea. On 23-24 March 1994 Ukraine's security organs received instructions whereby Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet stationed in Sevastopol were categorized as prime targets of intelligence and counterintelligence interest. In view of this they were set the task of carrying out operational monitoring of the political situation in the region, setting up contacts with the opposition to the Crimean president and total monitoring of the command and personnel of the Black Sea Fleet, and forming in Crimea, especially in Sevastopol, operational combat groups made up of pro-Ukrainian, opposition, and nationalist elements. The ultimate aim of all these actions is to declare a state of emergency on the peninsula, introduce direct presidential rule by the Ukrainian president in Crimea, and declare the extraterritoriality of the Black Sea Fleet and then make demands for the withdrawal of the Russian troops. At the same time it is believed in Kravchuk's immediate entourage that the Black Sea Fleet problem should be solved through its simple forcible seizure by the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The most "convenient" and likely pretext for starting to implement this plan may most likely be the staging of a provocation in Crimea during the holding of the "nationwide poll," resulting in mass disturbances providing legitimate grounds for an "appropriate" reaction by Kiev. As a result of an assessment of the development of the economic and political situation in Russia, Ukraine, and Crimea the U.S. National Security Council concluded that the preconditions had emerged for the formation of another "trouble spot" in the CIS capable of destabilizing the situation in the Black Sea region. On the basis of this, they worked out the following as one of the most probable scenarios for the development of events in the region favorable to transnational companies: Subjective factors will not make it possible to begin normal dialogue between Russia, Ukraine, and Crimea. In these conditions Crimea independently holds a referendum and announces its secession from Ukraine. Ukraine declares a state of emergency in Crimea and moves in its troops. Then a clash begins between Ukrainian troops and pro-Russian movements in Crimea, and the troops of the Black Sea Fleet are inevitably drawn into the conflict. Russia is forced to intervene vigorously in the process, as a result of which the two states become involved in a military conflict. It is very noteworthy that the Americans are currently taking specific steps to secretly evacuate members of the families of embassy officials from Russia by May and to introduce restrictions on travel both to Russia and on the territory of Russia by U.S. citizens. [Signed] "Russia-Ukraine-Crimea" independent expert group [Dated] 15 April 1994 Ukrainian Embassy's Reaction Vadim Dolganov, counselor at the Ukrainian Embassy to Russia: Neither the embassy nor any other official Ukrainian organs are going to comment on this document. This is all nonsense. But it is rather dangerous. What is assembled here can be gleaned from the Russian mass news media. I myself come from Kharkov. The document says that between 50 and 80 percent of the oblast's residents advocate reunification with Russia. That is nonsense! It is simply impossible to comment on it. But, once again, this nonsense is tendentious. That is, you can discern a clear attempt to drive a wedge between eastern and western oblasts of Ukraine, which are indeed different in their ethnic composition, and to play the "Crimea card." But, you know, the problem is that the people who are staging this whole thing fail to understand a simple thing, or maybe they do understand it -- you could swap Ukraine and Russia around in these dirty documents. And you could say the same thing about Russia. What is most terrible is that such material is appearing at a time when the Ukrainian and Russian leaders are beginning to reach agreement on some complex problems. Consultant's Viewpoint Oleg Rumyantsev, president of the Russian Foundation for Constitutional Reforms and independent consultant on Crimea: It is difficult to say that this document is totally accurate. However, when I was executive secretary of the Constitutional Commission I traveled to Crimea at the invitation of a number of public associations to find out the attitude taken by Crimea's residents to the draft Russian Constitution and the prospect of restoring our unity (August 1993). At that time I received from extremely well informed sources data partially reminiscent of this. Russian Foreign Ministry's Opinion We were told in confidence by the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry that no information that Kiev is working on tactical missiles or binary weapons has been officially received by Moscow. Special Services' Commentary We learned from a confidential conversation with a senior officer of Russia's intelligence organs that they very carefully studied the U.S. CIA's secret report to President Clinton regarding the situation in Ukraine. This report fell into the hands of the British press by unknown means. Some of its theses chime with the text of the document published today. Representatives of Russian intelligence services displayed particular interest in those passages in the CIA report analyzing Ukraine's economic position and concluding that, if the present rate of development of the crisis is maintained, the republic may split up within two years, leading to the emergence of several new state formations which will possess nuclear weapons. On the whole, the source noted, the U.S. intelligence agency's conclusions largely coincide with the Russian experts' assessments. Moreover, it was learned recently that Ukrainian military specialists are attempting to decipher the launch codes of intercontinental missiles. The source also added that he agrees with the U.S. report's conclusions regarding the possibility of a social explosion in Ukraine. Clashes between the Russian-speaking population of eastern oblasts and the west Ukrainians cannot be ruled out here. The source believes that Russia should relax the economic pressure on Kiev and be more flexible in its approach to the problems of Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet.
