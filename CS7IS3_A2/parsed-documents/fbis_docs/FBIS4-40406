Tuesday's phone call between Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton was mainly devoted to the Korea crisis. Judging by the statement made by the Russian president after the conversation, the Moscow and Washington positions are now essentially similar [sushchestvenno sblizilis]. The United States, as Yeltsin put it, no longer objects to the Russian idea, put forward a few months ago, of holding an international conference on Korea. The Kremlin, for its part, has agreed to discuss at this forum the question of introducing sanctions against the DPRK -- U.S. diplomats are insisting on on the need for them. The Korean problem will be one of the main points on the agenda for the talks to be held very shortly between Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. The exact date is not yet known. President Yeltsin had gotten somewhat heated and told journalists that Kozyrev would be flying to Brussels to meet with his U.S. colleague virtually tomorrow. But it transpired that the secretary of state has a Near East tour planned and will only be able to see the Russian minister once it is over. As of the morning of 15 June the Russian Foreign Ministry and the State Department had not yet coordinated the question of a timetable for the forthcoming meeting. IZVESTIYA was told by Kozyrev's entourage that, apart from the situation on the Korean Peninsula, the minister and secretary of state plan to discuss preparations for the Russian president's visit to the United States, scheduled for September.
