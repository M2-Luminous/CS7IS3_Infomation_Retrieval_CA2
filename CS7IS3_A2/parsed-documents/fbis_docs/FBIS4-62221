Duma Security Committee Chairman Viktor Ilyukhin informed deputies of this during yesterday's plenary session of the Federal Assembly's lower house. He noted that the reason for the shooting was a conflict between Skorochkin and a group of people who, according to the deputy, "did not let the parliamentarian's automobile pass in the direction of his home" in the city of Zaraysk, Moscow Oblast. Skorochkin reported that after the conflict had been resolved one of those who had not allowed the deputy's car through -- Tbilisi inhabitant Irakliy Shanidze -- started to take an assault rifle out of his car. But the deputy managed to snatch the weapon, after which he headed for the local internal affairs administration to report the incident. However, according to Skorochkin his passage on the way to the internal affairs administration was again blocked by Shanidze, who was carrying another assault rifle. At this time local inhabitant Oksana Guseva was nearby. Shanidze shot at the deputy, who managed to get out of the way. But Guseva was killed. In turn Skorochkin shot and killed Shanidze. At present, Ilyukhin stressed, the Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office is considering whether Skorochkin acted within the bounds of necessary self-defense.
