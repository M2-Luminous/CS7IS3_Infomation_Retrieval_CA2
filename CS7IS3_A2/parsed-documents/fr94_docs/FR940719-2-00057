In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR Part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed the application for minorlicense for the proposed West Springfield Project, located on the Westfield River in Hampden County, Massachusetts, and has prepared a Draft Environmental Assessment (EA) for the project. In the DEA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the potential environmental impacts of the project and has concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate enhancement measures, would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Copies of the DEA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426. Any comments should be filed within 30 days from the date of this notice and should be addressed to Lois D.
