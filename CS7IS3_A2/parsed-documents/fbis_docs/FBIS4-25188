In the January-May period, Shanghai exported $3.244 billion worth of goods, an increase of 26 percent over the same period last year. Shanghai's imports increased simultaneously. The Shanghai municipal government readjusted its strategy for promoting foreign trade last year. The move, including the organization of large foreign export companies, has facilitated the formation of many great exporting armies, brought the role of Shanghai as a trading port into full play, linked Shanghai with export enterprises across the country, encouraged export enterprises to directly participate in international market competition, and developed technological and service trade. At present, there are more than 10,000 export enterprises in Shanghai, which make up six great exporting armies -- foreign trade, industrial trade, local trade, self-run export enterprises, the three kinds of enterprises that are either partially or wholly foreign-owned, and enterprises run by the central authorities in Shanghai. Since the beginning of this year, all of them have experienced an increase in exports. About 460 overseas enterprises set up by Shanghai's companies in 60 or more countries and regions have begun to play an important role in foreign trade. They have helped increase export earnings. In addition, by providing an international sales network for Shanghai's enterprises, they have enabled a large amount of commodities to be exported to other countries in the world.
