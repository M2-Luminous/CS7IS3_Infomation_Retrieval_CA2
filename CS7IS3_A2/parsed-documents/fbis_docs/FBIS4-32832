The Army will dismantle artillery, armored cavalry, and infantry units due to lack of operating budget, based on a plan drafted in 1989. The Armed Forces eliminated a battalion of territorial forces and an artillery brigade in 1992, "and we are going to continue with the reductions due to the current crisis in the country," Andino said without giving specific numbers. The armored battalion, which has approximately 50 British and Israeli-made tanks and armored vehicles will be part of a single military unit to be installed at the Nicaraguan border, in the southern part of the country. A communications battalion currently stationed near Tegucigalpa will be merged with an infantry unit in the eastern part of the country. The Honduran Armed Forces are made up of approximately 24,000 soldiers, including at least 6,000 policemen. Gen. Andino said the gradual reduction plan began five years ago. The military budget totals 270 million lempiras (a little over $37 million) and according to Gen. Luis Alonso Discua, commander in chief of the Armed Forces, it has been reduced 10 percent more. During the eighties, the Army received approximately $500 million in U.S. military aid. The United States also armed the Nicaraguan "contras" in an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the Nicaraguan Sandinist Government from eastern Honduras. U.S. military aid, however, was drastically reduced in the nineties and currently amounts to less than $1.5 million.
