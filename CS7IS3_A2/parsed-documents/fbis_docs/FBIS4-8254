FBIS4-8254 "dreeu070__a94022" FBIS-EEU-94-070-A Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Trade Union Organization Holds First Congress Trade Union Organization Holds First Congress Unionists React to Klaus Address AU0904155394 Prague CTK in English 1808 GMT 8 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0904155394 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Prague, April 8 (CTK) -- The speech delivered by Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus at the union congress today did not satisfy the congress participants too much, according to a mini-poll conducted by CTK. The delegates expressed their disapproval mainly of what they called Klaus's effort to "atomize the unions and force them merely to the enterprise level". The unionists already expressed their disapproval when Klaus was speaking. In one moment a slight whistle could be heard. Andreas Botsch, an aide to the general secretary of the Trade Union Advisory Committee affiliated with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (TUAC-OECD), called Klaus's speech an address of a "neoliberalist economist listening with one ear and seeing with one eye only." Botsch was loudly applauded for his statement. According to Botsch, Klaus said that it would be necessary to "tighten belts" even in the future. When Botsch finished his speech, one of the delegates proposed that his address be adopted as the congress's official response to Klaus's speech. Some delegates expressed their displeasure at the fact that Klaus had not apologized for his comparing the union demonstration on March 22, 1994, with the communist putsch of February 25, 1948. In the morning Vladimir Petrus, chairman of the Bohemian and Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions (CMKOS) said Klaus apologized by his participation in the congress. "Klaus would have definitely not attended a conference of participants in a new February putsch. He came to the congress of his own trade unions in the Czech Republic and I am personally fully satisfied with such an apology," Petrus said.
