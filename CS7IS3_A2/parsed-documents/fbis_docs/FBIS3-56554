"We have not set such a task and are ready to live in friendship and mutual understanding with Russia, Belarus, and other CIS states," Brazauskas stressed in an exclusive interview with Interfax. Commenting on a recent statement by the Russian President's Spokesman, Vyacheslav Kostikov (who was puzzled by such a hasty step of the Lithuanian leadership and warned that "the expansion of NATO to include the countries situated close to Russia's borders can in the long run lead to military and political instability in the region so important for the fates of peace"), Brazauskas said that Vilnius would stay away from polemics with Moscow on the issue. Noting that Kostikov's statement was taken into account, the president called for careful analysis of Lithuania's decision to understand it properly. "In our step, there is no element of confrontation with Russia or an attempt to organize confrontation along with other Baltic states," Brazauskas stressed. He reported that he had addressed to NATO's Secretary General Manfred Woerner an application for membership after consulting all Seimas (parliament) factions, which backed up the move. "I must respect the parliament's view," he said. Brazauskas warned against making a big stir of Lithuania's decision to send an official letter to Woerner. "We realize that such an application cannot be approved in Brussels soon or as an exception. Writing a letter to NATO today and expecting it to grant membership tomorrow would be naive," he noted. The president welcomed the "Partnership for Peace" concept, endorsed at NATO's summit in Brussels earlier this month and stressed that through it Vilnius was going to promote cooperation with the alliance. He disagreed with those who fear that the success of nationalists at the elections in Russia on December 12 was the decisive factor that prompted Lithuania's application to NATO. He recalled that Vilnius had taken the first steps in this direction as early as the beginning of last year. "I do not see in our step any demonstration and desire to isolate ourselves. We are neighbors with Russia and we'll live side by side, all the more so since there is a unique situation with the Kaliningrad region of Russia," Brazauskas said. Although the region borders with Lithuania and Poland, it has no common border with the main territory of Russia. "It is conceivable that a collective security system should cover the whole of Europe, and it seems to me that all states, Russia included, should come to realize that. All of us want peace rather than confrontation on the European continent," the Lithuanian president noted. In his words, Lithuania's attitude towards Russia remains unchanged, "and we hope that Moscow will not change towards Vilnius either," Brazauskas said. At the same time, he warned that if the Russian leadership fundamentally changed and so did its policy in the Baltic states, Vilnius would have to correct its actions.
