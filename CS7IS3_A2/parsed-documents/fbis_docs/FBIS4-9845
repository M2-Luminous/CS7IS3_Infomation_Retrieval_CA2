[Vega] During the past 64 years the Air Force commanders' main concern has been to provide the Air Force with effective deterrent power. It is not just the Air Force but the nation's air power as a whole. This is what Arturo Merino Benitez [one of the founders of the FACh] envisaged when he established LAN [Chilean National Airline], the Main Hangars, and the Chilean Air Club, long before founding the FACh. The development of aeronautics is intertwined with the economic development of the nation. We canot expect to have the kind of air force developed countries have because there are priorities which have to do with social needs that must be taken care of. Within these limitations the FACh has an excellent professional team of outstanding potential in terms of human resources which are scientifically trained and know their job inside out. Within this context the FACh is technically and professionally a first class organization. [Oyarzun] Was the Hunter plane purchased in 1968 later modified in Chile? [Vega] Yes, it has been modified. We added several systems which made this plane more versatile and gave it some capabilities it did not have before. This plane was used to train more than half of the FACh personnel. [Oyarzun] What is the current status of the National Aeronautical Enterprise (Enaer)? [Vega] Enaer started operating under the military government. General Matthei [Fernando Matthei Aubel, former FACh commander] was the driving force behind the establishment of a national aeronautical industry. The initial steps were difficult because the aeronautical industry is complex, dynamic and amazingly prone to changes. This means that technicians, managers, and workers must keep up with these changes. An air force cannot remain in the past, it must be modern or else it is no air force. The need for such fast changes and technology requires excellent human resources because planes do not stay up in the air through magic but because man wants them to. Planes pose several requirements which means that those who operate them must be up-to-date on the technology in their hands. Thus, Enaer cannot stop working and neither can the very sophisticated DTS [Desarrollo de Tecnologias y Sistemas Limitada -- Technologies and Systems Development Ltd.] company specialized in avionics. All this means that we have to have a plane which will be more or less up-to-date bearing in mind that our technology cannot be similar to that of the United State or other developed countries, but in keeping with national priorities. [Oyarzun] It has always been said that the Air Force is in the third place after the Army and the Navy. In today's wars which is more important, the Army, the Navy, or the Air Force? [Vega] All three branches must be tightly coordinated and act in unison. The three are interdependent. This means that the three braches must develop at the same rate and plan along the same lines. The Armed Forces are a system whose subsystems must all have the same quality. [Oyarzun] United? [Vega] Total coordination and unity is essential. That is how Chile's Armed Forces do things. [Oyarzun] Have they always been united? [Vega] Always. The Army and the Navy gave the Air Force its start. We inherited the ranking system, discipline and uniforms from the Army. The star on the tail of our planes is the Navy star and the shield on the wings of our planes is the Navy shield. The Air Force has been fully integrated with the other branches of service from the very beginning. As of 1930 the FACh began moving toward autonomy because the technology, strategy, and doctrine applicable to this branch of service are different and so is the approach to the building up of capability. [Oyarzun] All this costs money... [Vega] Every action or movement in life has a cost. I believe that the point is knowing how to establish priorities for spending and how to direct the funds available to the fulfillment of objectives that can help each institution carry out its mission. There will never be enough funds and there will always be more needs than resources available, even in the U.S. Air Force. [Oyarzun] There are politicians who believe that the Armed Forces budget should be cut because "no military conflicts are expected" in the short or medium term, and because from looking at the overall international scenario, the phantom of war seems to be fading away. Do you agree with them? [Vega] Your question is very interesting. I do not reject outright any opinion, but one does not build an air force from one day to another. It takes years to build up operational effectiveness, train technicians, develop the infrastructure and the quality which is necessary to operate sophisticated materiel. An air force cannot become obsolete, it should either be maintained up-to-date or disappear. If it is no longer there one day, there is no room for improvisation. It takes years to train workers, pilots, mechanics, technicians, and to set up the logistic support for the highly sophisticated systems that an air force operates nowadays. There may be no conflict in sight, but no one can say for sure what will happen tomorrow. We have dramatic examples of what could happen. Perhaps a huge ideological east-west conflict is no longer likely, but regional conflicts are certainly possible. [Oyarzun] Why do you say so? [Vega] Because whenever regional interests are at stake there could be conflicts. We can see it in Yugoslavia and in many other parts of the world where they may be latent -- whether valid or not it is not for me to say -- but sometimes lead to the use of force. I would not like this to happen in our region. I believe that we have taken the course of reasonable regional understanding and the Latin American countries have taken an unprecedented approach. I agree that there is a new approach to development methods which does not necessarily mean that there are no conflicts. It is impossible to prepare for conflicts from one day to another and it is the responsibility of the Air Force leadership to prepare the branch as best they can with the funds available for this. [passage omitted] [Oyarzun] Did the FACh contribute to Chile's development during the military government? [Vega] I believe that it is not easy to quantify the results, but undoubtedly Chile is a very modern country, one that has prestige both domestically and abroad. This all began after 1973. [Oyarzun] Some people claim that the Armed Forces did not do enough for national reconciliation during President Patricio Aylwin's administration. What do you think? [Vega] I do not engage in political discussions, all I can do is voice an opinion. Chile is moving along amid widespread reconciliation. I have reached this conclusion on the basis of the opinions of politicians of different leanings and the motivation with which Chile is working and developing. [Oyarzun] The Eighth International Airspace Fair [Fidae] opened on the occasion of the 64th anniversary of the FACh. Is there anything that sets this year's Fidae apart from those of preceding years? [Vega] Just as Chile as a whole, the Fidae has experienced spectacular growth. Since technologically speaking our country is far behind the highly developed nations, the FACh is making a great effort to bring some of this technology down here. Not everyone around here can get a close look at high technology. The Fidae allows us to bring this technology to Chile. [Oyarzun] Why do so many foreigners attend the Fidae? [Vega] Because Chile's current image is excellent. It is a developing country clearly on its way up, and capable of becoming a developed country in the short term. There is no show like this anywhere else in South America, and I believe that it offers an excellent opportunity to display all the aeronautic technology available. I do not mean just planes and arms. The Fidae's strong point is that it displayes everything that has to do with aeronautic technology. All countries need a meeting place and this is an attractive one. [Oyarzun] What does Fidae show? [Vega] Aerospace technology. [Oyarzun] What does this technology include? [Vega] We would like to have a complete array of space technology items. It has not been easy but there are some interesting things. Russia is participating for the first time. [Oyarzun] What can Russia contribute at this point? [Vega] The Russian Academy of Sciences is the oldest in the world. Their level of development in rocketry, satellites, communications and aeronautic technology is very high. [Oyarzun] Haven't they become obsolete? [Vega] Russia has had a temporary setback, but I believe that their scientific potential is still there. They will have to streamline their production systems and their companies after the drastic changes they have undergone. They will have to find new ways to produce goods, that is not an easy task. They will have to redesign a number of systems taking into account new economic and production conditions, but I believe that they will find their way. The Fidae is an important meeting; 400 companies and 36 countries are participating. [passage omitted] [Oyarzun] How did the Air Force fare during the four years after the end of the military government? I am asking this question because you seem to have managed to keep out of the conflicts... [Vega] It is not that I do not want to answer your questions on politics; it is simply not appropriate for me to do so. I love my fatherland, and I have tried to serve it from this position that has been entrusted to me. I never expected to become the Air Force commander in chief. As a Chilean citizen I believe that this has been an extraordinary stage in Chilean history. It has been very positive, with pros and cons as any endeavor is bound to have. In any conflict among human beings each one tries to make his own legitimate interests prevail. Overall, Chile has moved steadily, calmly, and confidently forward on the wings of an exceptional development. [Oyarzun] What do you expect from the newly installed administration? [Vega] I do not believe that there will be any substantial changes. Steps will be taken to improve this positive development of ours. We have set a very stable course and all Chileans -- regardless of their political and personal interests -- are making a significant contribution to the nation's development. [Oyarzun] What is the status of the FACh on its 64th anniversary? [Vega] Good. It is surprising how many people join the FACh because of their inclinations! The results of this year's draft were very good. I admire the energy and knowledge that the new generations have. [Oyarzun] A person who joins the Air Force knows that he will make less than he could as an independent professional in private business. What prompts people to join? [Vega] Not all human beings aim at material achievements. Many people join the FACh because they have a calling, and they follow their instincts. The people who join the FACh do so because they have a calling, like the people who get involved in arts. [Oyarzun] What effect will the Chilean Copper Corporation's [Codelco] loss of $206 million have on the FACh? [Vega] It will have no effect on us this year, next year I do not know how much it will impact on our budget. We have a budget established by law and we operate within the framework of this budget. We streamline and rearrange our priorities in order to do our yearly programming... Institutionally speaking I would say that Codelco's loss will have no effect on us. [Oyarzun] It is not like you can spare the money... [Vega] One never has money to spare, especially in the case of small air forces like ours. Our budgets have been cut and are relatively small for the kind of technology we are operating with. [passage omitted]
