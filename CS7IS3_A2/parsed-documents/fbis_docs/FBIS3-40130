Some say it is necessary to Taiwan's survival. Others ridicule it as a quixotic scheme; they see it as an impractical plan. Does Taiwan indeed have an opportunity to become a regional headquarters for transnational businesses? What are Taiwan's advantages and disadvantages for becoming an Asia-Pacific operations center? What major changes are needed to attain the goal? A large market holding hidden vitality lies along the Pacific Rim of the Asian continent. This area has an annual 6 percent economic growth rate, and forecasts call for one-half of the world's gross output to come from here by 2040. Transnational businesses in advanced nations are anxious to establish a bridgehead here. At the same time, Taiwan, which is a way station in the area, is working hard to break out of an economic development stalemate by importing high value-added industries to accelerate internal transformation and to stimulate the desire to invest. In 1992, however, outside investment in Taiwan for the year fell to a new four year low of only $1.5 billion. A "national construction program" that seeks to vault Taiwan into the ranks of a modern nation, the Asia-Pacific Operations Center Plan, took shape during the surge to accelerate internal transformation and stimulate investment. The Asia-Pacific Operations Center is no new topic. This hope has attracted businesses from many nations to set up regional headquarters in Taiwan. Very many businesses long ago began to plan tactical alliances whereby their Asia-Pacific branch corporations engage in procurement, production, marketing, technical assistance, research and development, and the collection of information. Economic considerations aside, as a result of these tactical alliances, Taiwan will make itself a part of the global economic network, which will enable it to improve its international standing and national security. This is not a bad tactical conception; the question is whether the tactic is feasible. To go from Europe and the Americas to Southeast Asia and Mainland China does not require going via Taiwan. Countries other than Taiwan -- notably Singapore and Hong Kong -- can provide added value that Taiwan does not provide. Just what value does Taiwan add as a springboard for cooperation with the west? Can existing administrative regulations be reformed in time? Can the necessary infrastructure be put in place rapidly? These are the requirements for Taiwan's success as an Asia-Pacific Operations Center. People generally believe that Taiwan's professional scientific and technical brain power will serve as a solid contingent that will permit Taiwan to become a research and development [R & D] base, and a technical support base for Asia and the Pacific. Universal education and training in mathematical concepts will permit Taiwan to turn out highly capable engineers at low cost. According to a global competitiveness survey that the Swiss International Management and Development Institute (IMDI) made in 1992, Taiwan obtained 732 United States patents during 1990 for first place among developing countries. Taiwan also far exceeds major competitors such as Singapore and Hong Kong in R & D and manpower investment. During 1992, a total of 5,157 doctorate and masters degree holders returned home, but their skills were not needed in Taiwan, thereby creating a new dilemma of self-induced unemployment. Taiwan has a large number of people who work with their hands to match the engineers who work with their brains. It is small but fast, hardworking, medium and small businesses that have gloriously created the picture of Taiwan's economic growth. From Taipei to Taichung, and from Yunlin to Pingtung, they have expanded contacts into a closely knit industrial network that has become an asset that cannot easily be duplicated in the Asia-Pacific region. "As an Asia-Pacific manufacturing center, Taiwan is certainly a turnkey," Stanley Shih, chairman of the board of Acer Computer Corporation, says with conviction. Given its geographic position and its role as a cultural intermediary, Taiwan can become a bridge for the United States and Japan to enter this region, particularly the China mainland. Yeh Ying [5509 7727], director of the commercial section of the American Association in Taiwan believes this to be Taiwan's most powerful "trump card." Taiwan, which has ample foreign exchange reserves, lags behind Japan in investment in the Asia-Pacific region, it is true, but it is far ahead of Mainland China. This still expanding Chinese network is strengthened by a common language and culture. Because of Taiwan's experience in managing the mainland and the 70 percent Chinese Southeast Asian market, economist Soluo [phonetic] suggests that Chinese business can "use Taiwanese younger cousins to do business with mainland older cousins." Shanwen Computer general manager, Liu Shangen [0491 1472 2704], affirmed Taiwan's capability in a more humorous manner. He said, "Taiwan understands very clearly even the art of doing things through the back door." One Upgrade and Four Kinds of Expertise It is because Taiwan holds advantages in geographical location, and in manufacturing and technical capacity that 11 international firms that have been producing in Taiwan for many years have signed a tactical partnership letter of intent with the Ministry of Economics. For example, Motorola Electronics has not only established an electronic parts manufacturing center in Taiwan, but it has also set up a massive circuit research and development center to design products for Japan and South Korea. AT&T also plans to cooperate with Taiwan firms to contract the building and operation of telephone communications hardware abroad. Phillips of Taiwan controls the entire operating process from design to marketing of four major products including illumination equipment, electronic components, monitoring equipment and telecommunications, and information processing services. However, in planning an Asia-Pacific Operations Center, Taiwan will not be content with being only a production and technical assistance support base. If it is also to function as an entrepot and as a financial center, Taiwan will have to make one upgrade and become expert in four fields. The one upgrade is improved science and technology. The four fields of expertise are personnel, money, goods, and information. Taiwan has, in being a good foundation for developing and bringing forth new technology, and this is the road it must take to improve competitiveness. If it only concentrates on existing production and technology, Taiwan will be relegated to the status of a large export processing base. However, "What conditions must we have to build new and sophisticated industries" that bring in high technology? The general manager of Taiwan's International Standard Electronics, Mao Yu-nan [3029 3254 0589] came straight to the point in posing this question. In addition to upgrading domestic R&D capabilities, we must take the opportunity to bring in high science and technology brain power and high level professional talent. We also have to create an overall environment to match. Although Singapore's level of science and technology and its technical manpower cannot match Taiwan's, it has well-developed financial and economic regulations, and a high quality living environment that attracts scientific and technical talent from abroad. Although Taiwan is more friendly toward foreigners than other developing countries (including Singapore and Hong Kong), and does not practice discrimination (according to the IMDI appraisal), overall living conditions are not as good. Since signs are not in English, foreigners in Taiwan are reluctant to wander the streets. In Japan, all one has to do is dial the telephone, and emergency translation service in various languages is available 24 hours a day. Whenever it rains in Taiwan, people walking along the sidewalks in Taipei may step into mud holes. During free time on weekends, foreigners do not know where to go sightseeing. Traffic jams and air pollution problems exist as well. Consequently, a consulting company that Federal Express hired to make an evaluation listed Taipei as a "hardship city" for foreigners to live in. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

One of the main proponents of the Asia-Pacific Operations Center plan, Taiwan University Law Department Professor Hsu Hsiao-po [1776 1420 3134] says candidly that if Taiwan fully protects intellectual property rights, "more foreign businessmen will be willing to introduce technology." Taiwan, which is well-versed in the application and commercialization of science and technology can increase its technological innovation opportunities by increasing the sources of technology. If Taiwan becomes a general headquarters for the Asia and Pacific region, managers will shuttle back and forth to meetings in various countries; technicians will be on the move to help other areas solve problems that suddenly come up in the research and development and production process. Personnel from other countries will also congregate in Taiwan for training. Flexibility in the free entry and departure of personnel is necessary to the operation of transnational businesses. However, Taiwan currently regulates foreign white collar labor very strictly, thereby impeding channels for attracting outstanding brain power from abroad. Despite his holding a doctors degree from a French university and having formerly worked in the United Nations, a Japanese lawyer who founded a practice in Germany was still unable to obtain a resident's work permit for Taiwan. After a distressing two months wait, his wife -- a Republic of China citizen -- had to resign her job in Taiwan, and as of the time he boarded a plan, the Japanese lawyer had still received no explanation from the unit concerned. A lawyer in the Legal Affairs Office commented that Taiwan's employment law and associated regulations are "completely divorced from reality." In addition, foreigners resident in Taiwan must file a report every time they leave the country, small children included. Furthermore, a Taiwan transit visa is available in only a small number of countries, and it is valid for only a five day stay. Even South Korea, which is very security conscious, has increased the period to seven days. Several times when the 3-M Corporation in the United States held a conference in Taipei, high ranking officials of the corporation were unable to attend because their visas were not processed in time. In Singapore, by contrast, so long as an alien holds a work permit, he or she is free to enter and leave the country freely during the period of its validity. Even local military age males need only notify the authorities concerned by telephone, and they can pick up their bags and leave the country. Not only are procedures for entering and leaving Taiwan onerous, but Taiwan is not competitive even in the movement of goods. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 4: Taiwan Laws Not Up to Date; Many Restrictions | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Taiwan Ranking |Hong Kong Ranking |Singapore Ranking | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Legal standards o-|;8 |4 |1 | |f finance and ban-| | | | |king institutions | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Protection of int-|7 |5 |1 | |ellectual propert-| | | | |y rights | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Government contro-|5 |1 |2 | |l and troubling o-| | | | |f businesses | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Compatability of |12 |4 |1 | |environmental law-| | | | |s with business c-| | | | |ompetitiveness | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Extent to which a-|6 |3 |1 | |nti-trust laws pr-| | | | |event unfair comp-| | | | |etition | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Openness of the p-|5 |1 |2 Source of Data: | |ublic sector towa-| | |Swiss IMDI, "Worl-| |rd foreign compet-| | |d Competitiveness | |itive bidders on | | |Report, 1992" | |contracts | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 5.

Taiwan's administrative and building efficiency have suffered in the political tumult of the past several years. This is the main reason for the backwardness of Taiwan's infrastructure. Volume of cargo handled today in Kaohsiung's seven ports is only 63 percent that of Singapore and Hong Kong. Although Kaohsiung's civilian piers load or unload 27 standard cargo containers in 10 hours, thereby running neck-and-neck with Singapore and Hong Kong, the government piers handle only 13. Kaohsiung port still uses the longshoreman management methods of 1971 to figure wages. Consequently, some people draw more than NT$100,000 per month in wages. Worse yet, after they retire, their job is passed on to their son in a longshoreman "hereditary system." During July 1993, more than 50 ships waited to get into port, each ship waiting one to two weeks, the loss per day averaging $6,000. This caused the poor reputation far and wide for Taiwanese ports Slowness and high charges have, in fact, damaged the utilization rate of both Taiwan's airports and harbors. Although Taiwan's manufacturers break their necks to meet deadlines, cargoes are held for at least one or two days before clearance at Chungcheng Airport. In advanced countries, customs examinations are figured in hours. The average scheduled landing fee for an airplane in Taiwan is $2,430. At Hong Kong's Kaitek Airport, where an airplane takes off or lands once every two minutes, the fee is only about half that. Taiwan's future goal is the development of light, fragile, short, and small products, and the U.S. Federal Express is discussing a plan to establish a hub in Taiwan that can make the most of Taiwan's strength in being able to act quickly. The administrative efficiency and infrastructure problems relating to the movement of people and cargoes are crucial to whether Taiwan can become an Asia-Pacific Operating Center. In addition, the associated flow of money and information require even greater effort. Two years ago, the national finance and banking conference reached a decision to set up an Asia financial center, but so far nothing has appeared but publicity; no real action has been taken. Financial control limitations, inconvenience in moving money into and out of the island, insufficient financial commodities, and the lack of skilled financial personnel are old problems that hurt the effective use of funds. Likewise, they impede Taiwan's becoming an Asia-Pacific Operations Center. The uncertain quality of Taiwan's telecommunications and the lack of competitiveness of charges cloud the Asia-Pacific Operations Center plan even more, and they are also constitute a stumbling block for Taiwan's entry into telecommunications in which the exchange of graphics is the mainstream. A large number of obstacles and doubts about whether "we can or cannot" face us in proceeding with the Asia-Pacific Operations Center. No wonder that some entrepreneurs take a "I couldn't care less" attitude about it, and throw invitations to panel discussions into the waste basket without reading them. Taiwan University's Three Principles of the People Institute assistant professor Tu Chen-hua [2629 7201 5478] and six other members spent an entire year travelling around the United States, Hong Kong, and Singapore making comparisons to complete the report on "the feasibility of establishing an Asia-Pacific Operations Center in Taiwan" that the Ministry of Economics commissioned them to make. Their 300 page-thick evaluation employs various indicators to point out that the overall picture for Taiwan is not optimistic. However, if it is to be established, nevertheless, "the focus from top to bottom will have to be on making a more international and freer frame of mind in Taiwan, including the frame of mind of the middle level civil servants responsible for implementation, and the public in general, and well as amending regulations. Tu Chen-hua warned that the results of the study show that the biggest obstacle to moving ahead with this plan stems from the lack of a full international outlook on the part of middle level civil servants who oppose change. This includes government officials lacking a professional background. In order to become a regional operations center, Taiwan must be a customer-oriented organism that provides services around the clock. At Kaohsiung Port, which supposedly operates around the clock, repair personnel could not be found in the middle of the night. At Chungcheng Airport, the Customs does not clear cargoes after Saturday noon. Obtaining a clearance requires payment of NT$3,000. During an emergency once, China Airlines had to land at a small airport in Kaohsiung after midnight only to be refused. It had to turn back to Hong Kong where the airport is not open around the clock, but which is flexible. "What can be done to make the whole country aware that Saturdays and Sundays are not days off in an Asia-Pacific Operations Center?" is a question that Hsin-kuang Textiles general manager Hu Ch'iao-jung [5170 0294 2837] spelled out world by word at a panel discussion. The public in general also faces the challenge of an internationalization of their frame of mind. The understanding of the managerial level of Taiwan firms about trans-national culture, and their international management experiences are far behind those of places like Hong Kong and Singapore where English is commonly spoken throughout society. In 1992, America-Taiwan Telecommunications began to send technical personnel from Taiwan to Indonesia, Thailand, and Mainland China to prove assistance. However, general manager Yeh Tsu-yu [5509 4371 4416] found that these technical personnel had adjustment problems in the places to which they were sent. They were not accustomed to short temporary duty assignments outside Taiwan. "This is a psychological process everyone must go through. They must develop their own international frame of mind," he said. The greatest frame of mind transformation required is for government to go from regulation orientation to task orientation. The evaluation report that the Ministry of Economics commissions recommends at great length 50 administrative measures and legal regulations in need of amendment. In addition to citing regulations related to the corporation law, the employment law, the income tax law, and foreign exchange control regulations, it cites Singapore's leasing and tax concessions as an example in emphasizing that amendment of laws should emphasize benefits to be gained more than guarding against harm. Taiwan laws, which are a legacy of the Japanese system that came from Germany, emphasize guarding against harm. However, Law regulating commerce are based on the British and American legal systems." If Taiwan's laws are to be internationalized in the absence of people having this background, how can a law amendment draft be produced? is a question asked by Hu Ch'iao-jung who is a legal scholar. Most multi-national firms have set up operations centers in Hong Kong and Singapore to look after the southeast Asia market. Since it first began to promote a regional headquarters plan in 1986, more than 40 large firms have established a base in Singapore. These firms include IBM, ICI, Ch'i-i [1142 8381], Hsin-li [2450 0500], and International corporations. Taiwan is getting a late start. Only by offering something special can it win out over the competition. "We have to do well the things that they (Singapore and Hong Kong) do not do, gradually besting them. This is the only tactic," says Stanley Shih, chairman of the board of Acer corporation, which has set up a regional center in Singapore, but whose headquarters remains in Taiwan. According to Stanley Shih, Taiwan is still the best choice for R&D and for managing production. "At least, we should persuade foreigners to set up dual centers." Taiwan does not have to be a center in which everything is done including production, R&D, finance and banking, the entrepot trade, and marketing is done. "If we just get going, we can become a champion although possibly not being first in every particular," says Mao Yu-nan metaphorically. The process of training to be a champion in 10 areas requires standards for judgment. "At least, objective data for judging each area is needed to determine whether we are approaching our vision; otherwise, it is only an illusion," says Mao Yu-nan unceremoniously in pointing out priorities. During one of its visits to Singapore, the evaluation team that the Ministry of Economics commissioned brought back a 1 meter high stack of data and material in which even the added value produced by each employee at Singapore's airport was figured and reported. Even if there is only a slight decline in telecommunications competitiveness indicators relative to other countries, the Singapore telephone bureau readjusts its business tactics every year to catch up. Taiwan does not care about such data at all; it does not look at specific indicators. The Asia-Pacific Operations Center provides an orientation, but even more necessary is coordinated overall actions. Hong Kong Chinese University Professor Weng Sung-jan [5040 2646 3595] points out the importance of intangible competition indicators. Are foreigners happy about travel in Taiwan? Is bribery serious? "Maybe the international image needs adjustment!" As an Asia-Pacific Operations Center, Taiwan will have to compete not only with Hong Kong and Singapore, which are a step ahead, but its competitors will also include Thailand and even Pudong in Shanghai, which are itching to compete. Taiwan Phillips, which arrived in Kaohsiung 20 years ago, developed from simple processing into an international production center, and today it is a self-established fully functional operations center. Speaking as a person who has experience, Director General Lo I-ch'iang [5012 4135 1730], who is a staunch proponent of the Asia-Pacific Operations Center Plan states with conviction: "When Taiwan does something better than others, why won't other countries come? We have to decide ourselves." It is the time for Taiwan itself to make a decision about the Asia-Pacific Operations Center.
