As part of the continuing attempt to create new extractive reagents and sorbents that are more effective and selective than their existing counterparts, an attempt has been made to develop size-selective reagents containing two- and three-dimensional macrocyclic compounds (crown ethers and cryptands) as their active grouping. The distribution of gold in sorption systems containing polymeric crown ethers was studied by way of the example of model sulfuric acid solutions with a concentration of 0.5 to 9 mol/l HCl. Each model solution contained 1 x 10[.sup]-3[/] percent of each of 25 elements: Al, Au, B, Ba, Bi, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ga, In, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb, Sb, Sn, Sr, Ti, Zn, and Zr. Crown esters produced in the form of granulated spherical particles with a grain size of 0.3 to 0.6 mm were studied. Both macroporous and gel-type crown ethers were used. During the experiments, 0.1 g of polymeric crown ether was placed in contact with 10 ml of a model solution at a temperature of 23 +/- 1ï¿½C for 48 hours. The element content of each solution before and after sorption was determined on AESP-1 and ISAR-61 atomic emission spectrometers by using a specially developed method capable of detecting gold in concentrations as low as 0.04 ml/l with an error not exceeding 10 percent. As was initially hypothesized, the overwhelming majority of the elements included in the model sulfuric acid solutions behaved as in processes of extraction by monomeric crown ethers of analogous structure under comparable conditions. The gold, however, behaved quite differently in the sorption systems than it does during an extraction process. During the sorption process there was a virtually quantitative extraction of gold throughout the entire acidity range from 0.5 to 9 mol/l HCl. Sorption of the gold peaked in the range from 1 to 3 mol/l HCl, where the highest gold distribution coefficient [D[.sup]Au[/]] values were observed for all of the crown ethers tested. The gel-type crown ethers did not extract gold or any of the other elements and were thus eliminated from further consideration. The porous-type sorbents extracted trace quantities of gold effectively; however, the value of D[.sup]Au[/] was significantly dependent on both the sizes of the macrocycle in the polymeric crown ether and the type of attachment of the macrocycle to the polymer matrix. When the size of the macrocycle and number of oxygen atoms was increased in the series 18-crown-6, 21-crown-7, 24-crown-8 for one and the same type of polymeric crown ether, D[.sup]Au[/][.sup]max[/] decreased from 2686 for the crown ether PDB18K6 to 2289 for PDB21K7 and 1190 for PBD24K8. All of the specified crown ethers had nearly identical amounts of active groupings within the confines of 2.0-2.1 mgEq/g, which indicated that crown ethers containing derivatives of the macrocycle 18-crown-6 as active groupings are the most effective sorbents of gold. The selectivity of the polymeric crown ethers tested was found to depend on both the dimensions of the functional macrocycle and the method used to fix it in the polymer matrix. Greater effectiveness in extracting gold (higher values of D[.sup]Au[/]) were accompanied by decreased process selectivity. The polycondensation-type sorbents, i.e., PDB21K7 and PDB24K8 produced by reacting crown ethers and formaldehyde, were found to offer the best compromise between effectiveness of extraction and selectivity in processes of sorption of gold from 0.5- to 2-mol/l solutions of HCl.
