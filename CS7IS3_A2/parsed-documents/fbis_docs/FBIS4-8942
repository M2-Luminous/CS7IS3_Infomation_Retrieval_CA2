The protest note expresses indignation over the terrorist act, which threatened the life and property of the Yugoslav diplomat and members of his family. It is stressed that the Yugoslav Government considers the Turkish authorities fully responsible for the terrorist act, because -- despite the Yugoslav side's warnings about threats and hostile demonstrations against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia -- they have not adopted efficient measures to protect the Yugoslav diplomatic and consular missions, their personnel, and members of their families.
