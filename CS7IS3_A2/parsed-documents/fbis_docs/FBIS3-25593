The volkstaaters, mostly farmers dressed in khaki uniforms, gathered in small groups around the town to prepare for a procession and rally later in the day. Local Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front--AVF] leader Harry Schutte said the right-wingers were planning to deliver a letter of demands to Newcastle's mayor before their public meeting on Tuesday evening. Their demands included agreement that Newcastle should fall within a volkstaat and that a local Afrikaner town council be established. The rally in the evening is expected to be addressed by Volksfront leaders Ferdi Hartzenberg and Gen Tienie Groenewald. Mr Schutte said local right-wingers wanted to begin drafting the boundaries of their volkstaat at Tuesday's gathering. Local African National Congress [ANC] Chairman Mandla Cele said his organisation would consider a consumer boycott of white businesses should the Town Council act in favour of the volkstaaters. Handfuls of right-wingers in lorries and other farm vehicles bearing slogans such as "we don't want to fight, but we will" and "this is our volkstaat" gathered at entrances to the town from midday. Organisers said they expected as many as 4,000 supporters to converge on Newcastle later on Tuesday.
