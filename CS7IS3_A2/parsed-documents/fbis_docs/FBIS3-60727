It was deactivated by the emergency shutdown system because of a fault in the water make-up unit in one of the turbine generators. The reactor plant capacity thus became ineffective. The fault was quickly rectified, and the generating set was switched on again. At the same time, the information center reports, the civil defense alarm sounded while the technical staff was being informed of the incident. The cause of the alarm is being investigated. The incident at the AES poses no danger to the safety of its personnel or the population. Background radiation remains within the norm.
