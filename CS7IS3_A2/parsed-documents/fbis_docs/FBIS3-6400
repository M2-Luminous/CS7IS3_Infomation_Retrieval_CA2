Thus, the committee called on the government to change its diplomatic stance toward the United States. In this weekly situation analysis report, the situation analysis committee maintained that "public opinion is critical of the fact that ruling and opposition circles in the United States took on an interfering manner in our domestic affairs in calling for the abolition of the security law at the same time as North Korea's claim urging abolition of the South Korean National Security Law, thus leading one to believe that the United States was assuming a North Korea-leaning diplomatic attitude." The situation analysis committee also said that "by fully mobilizing former government officials, businessmen, and religious figures, the United States has diversified its diplomatic channels to highlight its position. Contrary to this, our country merely depends on official diplomatic channels." Thus, the committee proposes that we reexamine our methods of diplomatic activities with the United States.
