They also desire to continuously develop friendly bilateral ties and cooperation together with Eritrea, said Jiang during talks with visiting Eritrean President Isayas Afewerki here this afternoon. Jiang said the time since China and Eritrea established diplomatic ties has been short, but the relationship has developed rapidly, adding: "We are satisfied with the smooth growth of such ties." He expressed the belief that Isayas' current visit to China will lay a solid foundation for the enhancement of bilateral friendship and cooperation and the promotion of such ties to a new level. Jiang expressed his appreciation of the "one-China" policy that the Eritrean Government has pursued and its principled stand not to establish official relations with Taiwan. Isayas said though Eritrea and China are far apart geographically, their friendly ties bring them closer together. He thanked the Chinese Government and people for their recognition of Eritrea's independence and the results of its referendum. Isayas said that, in the long struggle for independence, the Eritrean Government and people have always regarded China as their reliable partner. Referring to bilateral economic cooperation, Jiang said China and Eritrea established diplomatic ties less than one year ago, but their mutually beneficial cooperation has gradually grown and shows great potential. China is willing to become actively involved in Eritrea's economic reconstruction, he said. Jiang noted that China is a developing country whose governmental assistance extended to Eritrea is limited. However, he said, the offer of assistance is a demonstration of friendship. "We place greater importance on conducting diverse non- governmental and economic cooperations with Eritrea on the basis of equality, mutual benefit and common development," he said. Isayas thanked the Chinese Government for its assistance to Eritrea, adding that his country experienced sufferings from an extended war. "It is badly needed to rebuild our country," he said. He described China's assistance as sincere and being full of kindness, saying: "We regard this kind of assistance as an important factor for Eritrea's reconstruction." Isayas said Eritrea agrees with China's point of view on actively conducting non-governmental economic cooperation. Eritrea will concentrate its efforts on cooperation with Chinese enterprises in every field, he added. On international issues, Jiang said that the new world political order should be established on the basis of the five principles of peaceful co-existence. The core of these principles is non- interference in other countries' internal affairs and respecting their peoples' choices of social systems and the modes for development in accordance with their own national conditions. He said that there are no unified political and economic modes suitable to all countries in the world. One country's specific political system and means for economic growth can only be established according to its actual national conditions, he added. Jiang stressed that the Chinese experience has shown that only by taking the development of its economy as its key work can a newly established country strengthen its political independence and get rid of its poverty and backwardness. Isayas said that he agreed with Jiang's view on the principles of non-interference in other countries' internal affairs, and that every country's cultural tradition should be respected. He said Eritrea attaches great importance to China's experience and is closely following its tremendous changes, which he said have inspired the whole continent of Africa, including Eritrea. During the talks, the two leaders briefed each other on their respective countries' domestic situations. They agreed that the two sides share identical or similar views on many major international or regional issues and the issues on democracy and human rights as well. After the talks, two agreements between the two governments were signed. One regards the Chinese Government's providing the Eritrean Government with loans. The other is a cultural agreement. The two presidents attended the signing ceremony. Prior to the talks, Jiang hosted a solemn ceremony welcoming Isayas and his party. This evening, Jiang gave a banquet in honor of Isayas and his entourage including Minister of National Defense Mesfin Hagos and Minister of Trade and Industry Ogbe Abraha. Qian Qichen, Chinese vice-premier and foreign minister, attended the banquet.
