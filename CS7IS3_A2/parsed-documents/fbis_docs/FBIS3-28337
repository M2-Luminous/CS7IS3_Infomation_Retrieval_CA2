Implementing tax cuts in such a manner would pose "a great problem" to the overall tax structure, Kato told a press conference after attending the commission's general meeting. He rejected the latest proposal by the Social Democratic Party (SDP) to first of all implement a tax cut to turn around the ailing economy, while a consultative body considers how to cover the cuts. The political wrangling over the tax issue turned serious when Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa decided to introduce the 7 percent "National Welfare Tax" last week. Faced with strong opposition from the SDP, the largest force in the coalition government, Hosokawa retracted the decision the day after announcing it. In a bid to break the impasse, SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama proposed setting up a consultative body and allowing it two years to decide how to cover the lost revenues. There is no guarantee that the consultative body would come to a conclusion within a fixed period of time, Kato said, terming the SDP's plan "a hypothetical guarantee." Kato then cited the possibility of tax cuts being slashed from the original figure of 6 trillion yen, if funds to repay them are not ensured. The Tax Commission is still firmly in favor of linking the tax cut and hike as proposed in its report to the prime minister last November, Kato said. Monday's general meeting by the commission is intended to wrap up a tax reform plan for fiscal 1994, starting in April. If the current political confusion continues, the release of a reform proposal would be delayed from the scheduled date of Wednesday.
