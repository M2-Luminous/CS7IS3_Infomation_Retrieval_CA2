The only reason the Europeans and the Americans have been paying any attention, however, is that white soldiers have gone there to evacuate white expatriates under the gaze of television lights. Once the operation is over, viewers will forget quickly that the slaughter in the former Belgian colony is only one example of many others on the African Continent. Ethnic cleansing is cause for scandal only in Yugoslavia. In Africa, it has become too commonplace to hold our attention beyond the first pictures of bloodshed and arson. In Liberia, Zaire, Angola, and Sudan the killing goes on every day. The Americans and their allies had made a great show of trying to save Somalia from starvation, only to leave in a hurry as soon as the military showcase turned into a real war. And that country reverted immediately to the law of the jungle. As in precolonial times, entire regions seem to have vanished from the map. Diplomats and businessmen from the industrialized north are paying no attention to landlocked countries racked by tribal conflict and concentrate on coastal areas. This is a return to the bygone era of mercantilism. Academic Jean-Christophe Ruffin compares the current situation with that faced by the Romans when, having destroyed Carthage, they were faced with a power vacuum. According to Mr. Ruffin, democracies deprived of their Communist foe since the collapse of the Soviet Union are now confronted by "new barbarians." But Europe can ignore this historical upheaval no more than the Romans could. Because, under the combined blows of fundamentalists and the army, Algeria is sinking further into bloodshed every day; Marseille, Barcelona, and Palermo may soon be submerged by "boat people," as were Thailand, the Philippines, and Hong Kong when thousands of Vietnamese began fleeing their country's Communist regime. The rift is not limited to North Africa. The civilization of the Old Continent is being threatened by a large ring of instability: from the republics of the former USSR, in the throes of nationalist and religious conflicts; to Turkey, whose regime's legitimacy is being challenged both by Kurds and fundamentalists. Mousy talk of human rights will not solve anything. Neither will the unabashed indifference of mercantile types, whose perspective on the world at large is restricted to market terms. A new solidarity must be invented to save the south while preserving the north. It is a paradox that the best way to maintain employment levels in industrialized nations is to create jobs in the Third World, through a distribution of tasks based on technology. Unless an original strategy is implemented, no European border will be able to contain the invasion of the wretched hordes. Because, says Senegal President Abdou Diouf, "extending one's arms will not turn the tide."
