FR941220-2-00058 FR941220-2-00036 [Release No. 34&hyph;35086; File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;38] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change and Amendment No. 1 to Proposed Rule Change by the American Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to the Listing and Trading of Stock Index and Currency Warrants December 12, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 notice is hereby given that on September 12, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1991). I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The Amex proposes to: (1) Amend Section 106 of the Amex Company Guide to revise the listing criteria for stock index (``stock index'' or ``index'') warrants and currency warrants (``currency warrants''); 3 (2) amend Rule 462 to specify the customer margin requirements for the purchase or short sale of stock index and currency warrants; (3) add a new Part VI to the rules of the Exchange to provide rules for the trading of index and currency warrants; and (4) rescind Commentaries .01 and .02 to Rule 411 (Duty to Know and Approve Customers) upon the adoption of new Part VI of the Exchange's rules. On Dec. 2, 1994, the Amex amended certain surveillance related matters addressed in the filing. See footnote 5 infra. 3 Currency warrants, as used in this filing, may refer to warrants on individual currencies (or cross currencies) or to warrants on a specific currency index group (``currency index warrants''). The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, Amex and at the Commission. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the Amex included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in item IV below. The Amex has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 1. Purpose The Amex proposes to: (1) Amend its listing guidelines and establish uniform rules for the trading of stock index and currency warrants; and (2) establish special customer margin requirements for positions in stock index and currency warrants. The Amex seeks to amend Section 106 of the Amex Company Guide to provide higher standards for index and currency warrant issuers than currently exists. In particular, such issuers would be expected to have a minimum tangible net worth in excess of $150 million. In addition, the aggregate original issuer price of all of a particular issuer's warrant offerings (combined with offerings by its affiliates) that are listed on a national securities exchange or that are National Market securities traded through NASDAQ would not be permitted to exceed 25% of the issuer's net worth. The proposed amendment requires that each warrant issuer will be automatically exercised on either the delisting date (if the issue is not listed upon another organized securities market) or upon expiration. Section 106 also will be amended to provide that opening prices (``a.m. settlement'') for all U.S. traded securities will be used to determine an index's settlement value where 25 percent or more of the value of the index is represented by securities whose primary trading market is in the U.S. Rule 462 is being amended to apply the current customer margin requirements for broad based stock index and currency options to stock index and currency warrants, respectively. Thus, purchases of stock index and currency warrants will require payment in full, and short sales of stock index warrants will require initial margin of: (i) 100 percent of the current value of the warrant plus (ii) 15 percent of the current value of the underlying broad stock index less the amount by which the warrant is out of the money, up to a maximum of five percent of the index value. Short sales of currency warrants will follow the margin requirements applicable to listed currency options. The Exchange proposes that its stock index and currency warrant margin requirements be permitted offset treatment for spread, straddle and covered positions. 4 4 The staff of the Commission has indicated to the Exchange that it must request and obtain appropriate interpretive or no-action relief from the Commission in order to permit its index and currency warrant margin requirements to allow offset treatment for spread, straddle and covered positions. Proposed Part VI of the Exchange rules applies to the trading of index warrants and currency warrants. Proposed Rule 1100 provides that, unless the context otherwise requires or a specific rule in part VI applies, the provisions of the Constitution and all other rules and policies of the Exchange apply to trading of such securities. Proposed Rule 1101 states that no member or member organization shall accept an order from a customer for the purchase or sale of index or currency warrants unless the customer's account has been approved for options trading pursuant to Exchange Rule 921. Accordingly, the Exchange will rescind Commentaries .01 and .02 to Rule 411, its current suitability standard applicable to warrants, which currently provide that the Exchange ``recommends'' that index and currency warrants only be sold to investors whose accounts have been approved for options trading. Furthermore, proposed Rules 1102&hyph;1105 require that the option rules pertaining to suitability, discretionary account trading, supervision of accounts and customer complaints be applied to stock index an currency warrants. Proposed Rule 1106 requires approval by a Compliance Registered Options Principal of all advertisements, sales literature and educational material issued by a member organization pertaining to stock index and currency warrants. The rule further requires Exchange approval of all advertisements and educational materials pertaining to stock index and currency warrants. Proposed Rule 1107 provides that position limits for stock index warrants on the same index with original issue prices of ten dollars or less will be fifteen million warrants covering all such issues. In addition, with respect to warrants on the Standard & Poor's MidCap 400 Index, the position limit will be seven and one-half million warrants covering all such issues, provided the original issue prices of the warrants are not grater than ten dollars. The rule provides that warrants with an original issue price of ten dollars or more will be weighted more heavily than warrants with an original issue price of ten dollars or less in calculating position limits. The rule also gives the Exchange the authority to require the liquidation of a position in stock index warrants that is in excess of the position limits set forth in the rule, and Commentary V to the rule provides procedures for allowing limited exceptions to the position limits. Proposed Rule 1108 provides for exercise limits on stock index warrants analogous to those found in stock index options and states that such limits are distinct from any exercise limits that may be imposed by the issuers of stock index warrants.
