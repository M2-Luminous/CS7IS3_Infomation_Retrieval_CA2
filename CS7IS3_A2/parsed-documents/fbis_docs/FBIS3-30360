Would you sit at the same table as Geremek? [Kaczynski] Unless we want the present ruling camp to win the presidency, a Solidarity candidate must have the broadest possible support. It would have to be someone who appeals to both the anticommunist community and to those voters who are not fundamentally anticommunist but who nevertheless appreciate our values. I have in mind the Democratic Union and Liberal-Democratic Congress electorate. I do not know if the candidate will be recognized by everyone. [ZYCIE] You have lost hope in Walesa? [Kaczynski] Yes. It is not true that I have changed my mind about him, as the mass media suggest I have. [ZYCIE] What are the principles that join Center Accord [PC], the Christian-National Union, Peasant Accord, and the Movement for the Republic into one bloc? [Kaczynski] Christian values, national traditions, the belief in a market economy, and mutual agreement as to the methods of safeguarding Poland's security and its pro-Western orientation. Just like Western right-wing parties, we have no intention of concealing our differences. The German CSU [Christian Social Union] consists of avowed traditionalists and liberals. [ZYCIE] How much is the idea of decommunization still realistic? After all, the heirs of communism won the last elections. [Kaczynski] I do not know how many votes they will have next time, but we are certainly not going to stop getting rid of the vestiges of the People's Republic. It does not matter what kind of label one attaches to the ruling coalition. Are we to accept the increasing autonomy of the Interior Ministry, the increasing distortions to the banking system, and the lack of equal opportunities? To change the administration, one can use various methods, such as promoting young people, who are not burdened by communist practices. [ZYCIE] But in a few years' time, the personnel relationships you are criticizing will be so firmly rooted that it will be impossible to remove them. [Kaczynski] Yes, it will be more difficult to combat them, especially because we do not accept revolutionary methods of struggle. But does that mean we have to accept a system that erodes our cultural standards? [ZYCIE] You say that the Pawlak Government is not only bad, it is also in favor of recommunization. [Kaczynski] The Polish left wing is really not interested in changes. The Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] is backed by red capital, which is eating away at the state budget. But, fortunately, the electorate is in favor of maintaining the present economic and social structures. Whatever Mr. Kwasniewski [leader of the SLD] tries to do, he cannot act against the interests of the electorate. [ZYCIE] What does recommunization involve? [Kaczynski] Among other things, it involves making local government bodies dependent on the wishes of the parties that form the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Suchocka fired good PC provincial governors because they belonged to the parliamentary opposition. We condemned this action, but what is happening today is quite different. Local bodies of the Social Democratic Party of the Republic of Poland or the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] are actually recommending candidates for various posts. That signals the return of a classic nomenklatura. [ZYCIE] The right-wing bloc has formed its own constitutional commission. What kind of principles will the right wing's draft constitution enshrine? [Kaczynski] Christian and Polish values, strong guarantees of ownership rights, and democracy. The Senate's draft constitution of 1991 was not supported by the PC. Any drastic increase in the president's powers is the first step toward a dictatorship, and not only with Walesa as president. Other public institutions are simply too weak. A strong presidency would turn everyone into the Belweder's clients. Even the comparatively weak provision in the Small Constitution, whereby the foreign, interior, and defense ministers are appointed on the president's recommendation, means that these ministries are dependent on the president. Does the Pawlak government control these ministries? I do not wish to defend the interests of left-wing parties. However, it is worth noticing that, even with their huge parliamentary majority, the SLD and the PSL are incapable of gaining control over these ministries. They are taking part in an opportunistic political contest with the Belweder, but at the same time they know how weak they really are.
