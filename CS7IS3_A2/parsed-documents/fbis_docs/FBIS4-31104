Meciar from the position of prime minister. Almost the same number of citizens (39 percent) disagreed with Meciar's having to step down. That is indicated by the results of the opinion poll conducted by the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic made public yesterday. According to the statisticians, almost one-fifth of those asked (17 percent) did not follow the events taking place in the parliament. The results of the poll show that the more educated the respondent, the more often he or she approved the recall of the prime minister. The change was very well received by citizens of Hungarian nationality, entrepreneurs, employees and adherents of the newly formed parties of "dissidents" from Meciar's camp. The vote of no confidence given to Meciar was welcomed by 70 percent of those queried who came from the ranks of supporters of the Christian Democrats and the left. Disapproval understandably was predominant among adherents of the Movement for Democratic Slovakia, somewhat less so among supporters of the Slovak National Party.
