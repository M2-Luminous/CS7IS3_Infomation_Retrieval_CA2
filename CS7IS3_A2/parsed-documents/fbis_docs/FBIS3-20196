Two years ago, in drawing up their medium-term financial plans, Dasa managers assumed that their German Airbus subsidiary would deliver about 215 aircraft a year. A year ago, they had to adjust their forecast to about 180 aircraft a year -- according to their latest internal calculations, Airbus can only sell 120 aircraft this year and next year. As a result, almost 3,000 jobs are to be shed by the end of next year. From 1996 onward, Dasa managers expect Airbus sales to improve: If their calculations are wrong once again, there is a danger that more jobs will be lost.
