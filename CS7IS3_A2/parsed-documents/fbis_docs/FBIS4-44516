The "CPC Central Committee Resolution on Certain Issues Involved in Establishing a Socialist Market Economy" passed by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee points out that: "A modern enterprise system dominated by public ownership is the grounds for our socialist market economy." "As establishing a modern enterprise system is a necessary requirement for developing socialized large-scale production and a market economy, it is China's state-enterprise reform direction." To implement this "Resolution" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the State Council has decided to choose 100 state enterprises as pilot units for practicing a modern enterprise system, charging the pertinent departments, such as the State Economic and Trade Commission and the State System Reform Commission, with the job of drawing up specific plans and organizing their implementation. I. Establishing a Modern Enterprise System Was Our Inevitable Option for State-Enterprise Reform Ever since China began to reform and open up, state-enterprise reform has held the central position in national economic reform, remaining our whole economic-reform priority and difficulty. This reform has adopted measures, such as profit commissions, conversion from profits to taxes in two steps, and the contract system, making a certain amount of progress in expanding enterprise decisionmaking power, and increasing enterprise operating vitality to a certain extent. And the putting into effect of the "Enterprise Law" and the "Forces-Conversion Regulations" has further promoted the implementation of enterprise decisionmaking power, laying the grounds for enterprise market access. But state-enterprise reform measures are still essentially the outcome of the authority-devolution and profit-concession ideology, not yet having involved an upgrading of our traditional enterprise system under our planned economic system per se, with longstanding state-enterprise problems, such as no separation between government administration and business management, unclear property rights, no enterprise autonomy, and unsound self-restraint forces, never having been essentially solved, leaving state-enterprise vitality obviously still relatively inadequate, enterprise activities hard to standardize, and economic efficiency less than ideal. The facts prove that further intensification of reform will mean resolving deeper conflicts, by adjusting the policy of mainly devolving authority and conceding profits to the creation of an enterprise system characterized mostly by clear property-rights relations, and through exploring effective ways to combine our state economy with a market economy, to find new ways for running state enterprises better. A modern enterprise system using the main form of company incorporation has four obvious features: 1. Property-rights relations are clear, effectively achieving the separation of investor's ownership rights from enterprise corporation property rights. 2. The relations between rights and liabilities are clear, with enterprises having corporate assets, giving them the right of independent decisionmaking, while reinforcing their liabilities for their own profits and losses and for preserving and multiplying the capital put up by investors. 3. The establishment and operation of corporate ruling bodies, such as shareholder meetings, boards of directors, executive departments, and boards of supervisors, forms balance and restraint forces to regulate the relations among owners, corporate delegates, operators, and employee collectives. 4. It contributes to fundraising, creating a good form for expanding production scale and achieving capital socialization. So reorganizing state enterprises into modern incorporated companies paves the way for cutting the umbilical cord between government administration and business management, rationalizing state-assets property relations, and genuinely converting the operating forces of state enterprises. II. The Planning and Methodology Involved in Choosing 100 State Enterprises as Pilot Units for a Modern Enterprise System The "Resolution" points out that: "As the establishment of a modern enterprise system will be a difficult and complex task, we will need to accumulate experience, create conditions, and proceed gradually." "Having state enterprises practice a corporate system will be a valuable exploration in the establishment of a modern enterprise system." The enterprise practice of a corporate system will be not simply a change of name, but rather an emphasis on converting forces, "which will proceed gradually through pilot units, with absolutely no formalism or precipitate action." To ensure that the pilot units proceed effectively, the pertinent departments, such as the State Economic and Trade Commission and the State System Reform Commission, have drawn up detailed plans and methods for the 100 pilot enterprises. 1. The Pilot-Unit Goals The goals to be reached through pilot units are: To search for effective ways to combine public ownership with a market economy, spurring enterprises to convert their operating forces, improving economic efficiency, and further freeing up and developing the productive forces; to explore ways to separate administrative and business functions, enabling enterprises to thoroughly break free from their status as subsidiaries to government administrative bodies, with the government not directly involved in enterprise production and operation activities, so that enterprises can truely gain access to markets and make their own operating decisions based on market demand; to accumulate experience for rationalizing property rights relations, establishing enterprise corporate property rights, enabling enterprises to become genuine corporate entities enjoying civil rights and charged with civil liabilities, and consolidating the capabilities of civil rights and actions, to conscientiously achieve liability for profits and losses; to perfect the leadership and organizational management systems within enterprises, advancing in the direction of standardization and more scientific, to evolve clear rights and liabilities, unity and cooperation, and mututal restraint forces within enterprises. 2. The Pilot-Enterprise Selection The selection of pilot enterprises was based on the following principles and terms: 1. As to enterprise size, it was mostly large and medium-size state enterprises, focused particularly on aging enterprises in urgent need of technological upgrading; 2. As to enterprise qualifications, it included the best, the intermediate, and the worst, mostly enterprises that better implemented the "Forces-Conversion Regulations," had leading bodies of higher quality, and had better economic efficiency, along with an appropriate selection of a few losing enterprises in line with state industrial policy; 3. As to industrial distribution, it was mostly industrial, commercial, and trade enterprises, with an appropriate selection of enterprises in other industries, such as transportation, construction, and high-tech; 4. As to regional distribution, it was mostly enterprises in regions and cities where market forces had developed faster and external conditions were better, with an appropriate selection of enterprises from other regions; 5. As to form of enterprise organization, it was mainly enterprises that had not conducted corporate reorganization, along with the selection of a few enterprises that were already corporations for standardization. 3. The Key Substance of Enterprise Reorganization to Corporations A. Perfecting the Enterprise Incorporation System The pilot enterprises had to first act in accordance with the relevant state provisions, by inventorying their assets and funds, delimiting their property rights, liquidating their bonded debts, evaluating their assets, verifying their enterprise corporate assets possession, and checking their capital funds. Capital contributors exercise assets ownership, enjoying legal shareholding rights in line with the percentage of shares held, such as asset income, and major decisionmaking and selection management, having limited liability to the enterprise based on capital contributed. Capital contributors are not directly involved in specific enterprise operations, being unable to directly budget corporate assets or withdraw assets or shares, but able to sell in accordance with law. Enterprises hold corporate property rights, independently enjoying civil rights and accepting civil responsibilities for all corporate assets, with legally independent decisionmaking power and liability for profits and losses, and charged with the liability to capital contributors for preserving and multiplying assets (capital). As independent corporate entities and market competitors, enterprises no longer have administrative subsidiary relations with government organs, no longer being ranked indiscriminately. B. Determining Enterprise's State-Assets Investors In line with the principle of separating the government's socio-economic management function from its state-assets ownership function, the state-authorized investment organ or state-authorized department is the state-assets investor, legally exercizing stock-rights management of state assets in enterprises. As to enterprises in which it is currently hard to determine the state-assets investor, the government can authorize a certain department to act as state-assets investor, to exercise state stock rights. The organs responsible for state-assets management in state-authorized investment organs or state-authorized departments do not perform any government administrative functions for enterprises in which they hold shares. C. Setting the Form of Enterprise Corporate Organization In line with the principle of graded guidance, enterprises that produce certain special products or those in designated industries should be reorganized as wholly state-owned corporations; most enterprises should be reorganized as limited liability companies; qualified ones can be reorganized as limited-liability companies, with only a few to be listed; while national industrial head offices can be reorganized as state holding companies, they should not generally operate as one company to monopolize a whole industry; enterprise groups are reorganized according to their parent-company systems. Reorganizing state enterprises into limited-liability companies in which multiple shareholders hold stocks is the focus of the corporate reorganization. This can be achieved through ways, such as converting creditor rights to stock rights, attracting foreign-investment shareholders, investment in shareholding among enterprises, and absorbing some institutional and fund investment into shareholding. Qualified enterprises can experiment with standardized employee shareholding. D. Establishing a Scientific and Standardized Corporate Administrative Structure Based on the principles of separation but mutual restraint among the rights, operating, and oversight structures and capability and efficiency, we have formed a corporate administrative structure composed of shareholder meetings, boards of directors, boards of supervisors, and managers, ensuring clear rights and responsibilities, with each performing their own functions, to effectively exercise decisionmaking, oversight, and executive authority. The shareholder meeting is the company's highest organ of authority. State-authorized investment organs or departments and other capital contributors select delegates to take part in shareholder meetings and exercise authority according to law. The board of directors is the company's operating-decision body. Boards of directors are elected by shareholder meetings, with shareholders recommending candidates, which become members of boards of directors acccording to legal procedures, to be liable to all shareholders. The board chairman is the company's legal representative. The manager is hired or fired by the board of directors, with no direct hiring or firing by government administrative organs or shareholder meetings. Managers are responsible to boards of directors, entrusted by company charters and boards of directors with all responsibility for the company's regular production and operating management. The board of supervisors is the company's oversight agency, responsible to the shareholders convention. Boards of supervisors are made up of shareholder representatives and a suitable percentage of company-employee delegates, produced through democratic elections by company employees. Board, manager, and financial officers may not serve concurrently on boards of supervisors.
