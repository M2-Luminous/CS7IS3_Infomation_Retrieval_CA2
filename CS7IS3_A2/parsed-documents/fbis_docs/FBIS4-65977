The enquiry is a normal procedure under European treaties to ensure that state aid does not interfere unfairly with competition between companies in different countries of the union. Air France is in severe financial difficulties. The Commission recently instructed France to give foreign airlines access to Orly airport south of Paris, effectively opening the French domestic market to competition. Air France, and its domestic subsidiary Air Inter, saw this as adding to their commercial problems. The Commission said that it wanted to be sure that aid for the restructuring of Air France would have the expected effect on the company and on the whole group and that the size of the recapitalisation was not disproportinate in relation to the problem, the spokesman said. At the beginning of March Air France had put forward a recapitalisation plan requiring the state to provide 20 billion francs. Under the plan the company would shed 5,000 jobs without redundancies. The new capital would be provided in three portions over three years. Air France, which made a loss of 8.48 billion francs (1.5 billion dollars) in 1993, has said that it plans to freeze pay for three years, to reduce the number of airliners it operates and to reduce its purchasing programme. The French Government put this plan before the Commission in March. The Commission, following the standard procedure, has now decided to open an enquiry to be sure that the aid is compatible with EU law. The Commission wanted to be sure that the aid would be the last to be received by the company and would not be used to acquire shares in other EU airlines, the Commission said. The aid must not disrupt the market on routes on which companies in the Air France group competed with other European airliners, it said. The Commission hoped to reach a conclusion before the summer holidays because it was conscious of the urgency of the case. The aid could not be paid until the investigation had been competed, the spokesman said. The Commission is already probing Air France, under an enquiry begun in November, in connection with the issue of shares to raise 1.5 billion francs (265 million dollars) which were underwritten by the French state-controlled deposit organisation the Caisse des Depots et Consignations Francaise. In Paris on Wednesday the government approved a bill which would enable the state to issue shares in Air France to employees who agreed that their pay be frozen for three years.
