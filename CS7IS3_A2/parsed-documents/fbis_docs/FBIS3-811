Speaking to the media before the Freedom Alliance meeting in Kimberly this morning, Dr. Mangope said he still regarded himself as president of Bophuthatswana, though operating from his residence. He said the executive management of his political party, the Bophuthatswana Christian Democratic Party, would meet later today to discuss a possible election alliance with the North-West Democratic Party. The Bophuthatswana Christian Democratic Party has not registered as a political party, but the North-West Democratic Party has. The alliance meeting is to be attended by the leader of the Freedom Front, General Constand Viljoen, the leader of the Conservative Party, Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg, and the leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
