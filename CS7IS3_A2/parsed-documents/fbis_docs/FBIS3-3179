Despite his busy schedule, Qiao Shi spared some of his precious time and answered the questions in detail. The topics covered issues people are concerned about in many areas, such as the establishment of the legal system for the socialist market economy, the acceleration of drafting economic laws, the coordination of the reform and opening up with the building of the legal system, and the improvement of the whole society's awareness of law and understanding of the legal system. Accelerating the Drafting of Economic Laws [Yao] The second session of the Eighth NPC is about to open. Chairman, what expectations do you have of this session? [Qiao] Before this NPC session, the NPC standing committee made some down-to-earth preparations. The objective we are striving for is to form a rough legal structure framework for the socialist market economy before the end of the current NPC's term. Since the first session of the Eighth NPC, the standing committee has adopted 19 laws or decisions related to legal matters. This year, another batch of important laws are due to be promulgated. We set great store by the building of the legal system and strive to integrate the reform and opening up with the building of legal system and learn to administer the economy by way of law. In pursuance of the principles provided in our Constitution, we shall accelerate the drafting of economic laws and, in the meantime, make a good job of the formulation, substantiation, and improvement of laws in other fields. We shall, with Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as the guides, make sure that the forthcoming NPC session will have the nature of being democratic, unified, truth-seeking, practical, trailblazing, and enterprising, so that the people of all nationalities in the whole country can be further mobilized to work as one, seize the opportunity, deepen the reform, expand the opening up, promote development, maintain stability, and promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. I am full of confidence about this. [Yao] This year, the tasks of deepening the reforms in the whole country are very heavy and many reform measures have been promulgated. How can the work of the NPC and people's congresses at all levels in localities adapt to the needs of the reforms? Could you please comment on this? [Qiao] As you have just said, the year 1994 is one wherein many measures for deepening the reforms will be promulgated. Each and every reform measure we adopt is of vital importance. For this reason, the NPC and local people's congresses at all levels will promote and support the smooth implementation of all reform measures through their respective efforts. This year, the NPC Standing Committee will continue to give top priority to the acceleration of legislation, especially the drafting of economic laws. We have made a legislation plan for this term and, according to its requirements, we shall make proper arrangements for the legislative work and guide, promote, and support the reforms with laws. As to the reform measures which have already been promulgated, we should sum up our experiences in good time and try to finalize them in a legal form to the greatest extent possible, so that they can be standardized and codified. Make a Good Job of the Legislative Work in a Number of Respects [Yao] In the course of establishing a socialist market economic system, we will encounter some contradictions and problems in the changeover from the old system to the new one. In what way does the NPC Standing Committee plan to make a good job of the legislative work, so that these problems can be smoothly solved? [Qiao] The coming few years will be a critical period for the conversion of our economic system. There has never been any successful precedent in the world of a smooth transition from a planned economy to a market economy. It is all up to us to explore. In the meantime, there is no existing model to follow as to how the framework of legal system for the market economy should be established and we must also make a big effort to explore this. The socialist market economy does not mean one can do whatever one wishes to or that each can go his own way with total disregard to laws. In a sense, the socialist market economy is one ruled by law. Therefore, the NPC and local people's congresses are faced with onerous legislative tasks. Only by guiding, standardizing, and supporting it with laws, can we ensure a healthy development of the socialist market economy. In the course of legislation for the market economy, we may encounter some contradictions and difficulties. To solve these problems, we will mainly resort to the following solutions. The first solution is that we will try to match legislation with the progress of the reform and opening up. On this point, Deng Xiaoping once said: Having laws is better than having no laws; fast legislation is better than slow legislation. For some matters which should be either promoted or eliminated, if the conditions for legislation are not ripe for the time being, we can first make administrative regulations or local regulations and, when we have had some experience, upgrade them to laws. The second solution is that we must stick to the principle of subordinating local interests to the overall interests of the country, avoid overemphasis on local interests and powers, and avoid passing the buck to each other. The third solution is that we must base ourselves on China's national conditions and boldly absorb and draw upon foreign experiences. We can directly transplant some legal provisions used by other countries which suit our national conditions and keep improving them through practice. Some market economy-related laws in our country should be made in such a way that they can converge with the relevant laws of other countries and international practice. The fourth solution is that local people's congresses and their standing committees should, in light of the actual needs of their respective administrative areas, step up efforts to formulate local regulations regarding the market economy, under the premise of not contravening the Constitution, laws, and administrative regulations. Besides, we also emphasize that the role of experts should be brought into play in the process of legislation and the quality of legislation should be enhanced. This way, laws are bound to be able to play the role of effectively supporting and promoting the development of the socialist market economy. Laws Which Urgently Need Promulgating [Yao] You once said the laws that urgently need to be promulgated in China at present include: Laws standardizing the subjects of the market; laws to regulate the relationship among the subjects of the market and maintain fair competition; laws which improve and strengthen macroregulation and control and promote coordinated development of the economy; and laws to establish and improve the social security system. Could you please elaborate a little on these? [Qiao] Making laws to standardize the subjects of the market is largely for the purpose of safeguarding the rights and interests of the subjects of the market and defining their obligations according to law, to ensure that they can operate by making their own decisions, assuming sole responsibility for profits and losses, seeking development with their own resources, and exercising self- restraint. For example, the "Company Law" that was adopted not long ago is important. It is of great significance in defining the legal status of companies as a subject of the market, standardizing the organization and behavior of companies, establishing a modern enterprise system, and promoting the healthy development of the socialist market economy. The laws for regulating the relationship among the subjects of the market and maintaining fair competition, such as the "Law Against Unfair Practices in Competition," the "Economic Contract Law," the "Securities Act," the "Checking Law," the "Arbitration Law," the "guaranteed Mortgage Law," the "Real Estate Law," and the "Law For the Protection of Consumer Rights and Interests, are all extremely important and necessary. Of these, the "Law Against Unfair Practices in Competition," the "Economic Contract Law," and the "Law for the Protection of Consumer Rights and Interests" have been drafted. Other laws have been listed in the legislation plan of the NPC standing committee and their formulation will be carried out with greater efforts. As to the laws for improving and strengthening macroregulation and control and promoting coordinated development of the economy, we plan to submit the budget act to the second session of the Eighth NPC to be held this year for deliberation; other laws such as the "Central Bank Law," "Commercial Bank Law," and "Foreign Trade Law" are listed in the legislation plan and will be drafted. We will also make laws for adjusting the industrial structure and promoting scientific and technological advance. As to the laws for establishing and improving the social security system, we pay close attention to such laws as the "Labor Law" and the "Insurance Law." In short, the legislation in the above areas is mandatory. Some laws have already been drafted, some are under deliberation, and some will be made efficiently and in a planned way. How To Improve the Legal System [Yao] So far, many laws have been promulgated in China but, in the course of implementation, cases of "failure to abide by the laws in force" have happened. How can this problem be solved? [Qiao] The Chinese society stayed in the feudal stage for thousands of years, so people's understanding of the legal system is still quite weak. Therefore, it takes long-term, unremitting efforts to establish a society ruled by law and gradually perfect it. We should, through legislation, make people realize what they should do and what they are not allowed to do; what is lawful and what is unlawful. Alongside lawmaking, we should also strengthen the propaganda on law, conduct extensive education to spread the knowledge of law, and help the people enhance their awareness of the law and understanding of the legal system. In the meantime, we should energetically strengthen inspection and supervision on the enforcement of laws after they are made; supervise the enforcement of the Constitution; and see to it that administrative, procuratorial, and judicial organs enforce the law to the letter. This is the power which the Constitution has vested in the NPC Standing Committee. We will, through our unremitting efforts, establish the authority of the Constitution and laws societywide and firmly redress any phenomenon of failing to abide by laws in force, failing to enforce the law to the letter, or failing to prosecute law breakers. Expectations and Requirements on CHING CHI TAO PAO [Yao] Do you have any expectations and requirements regarding CHING CHI TAO PAO? [Qiao] The 1990's is an important period for our country to achieve national reunification. China will resume sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao in 1997 and 1999 respectively. I hope that CHING CHI TAO PAO, as a rather influential economic journal in Hong Kong, while providing a window to China's economic construction, will make an effort to explain the work done by the people's congresses at all levels in China and what is going on with legislation in China, so that more Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, Taiwan compatriots, overseas Chinese, and foreign people can see that China will be built into a modern and democratic socialist country with a well developed legal system. I hope you will continue with your efforts and run the journal well, contributing to the cooperation and exchange between the mainland and various parties in Hong Kong and Macao.
