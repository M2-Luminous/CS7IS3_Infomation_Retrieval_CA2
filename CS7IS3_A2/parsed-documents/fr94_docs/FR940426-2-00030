FR940426-2-00030 FR940426-2-00017 (2) Should the fact that a tribe was previously funded by DOE mean it should receive greater consideration than a tribe that has never been funded, or the opposite? (3) Should a tribe receive greater funding consideration for past participation in DOE activities that were well performed by the tribe? (4) Where possible, should tribes that coordinate and prepare a joint proposal receive more favorable consideration than proposals by individual tribes? (5) To what extent should proximity be taken into account in funding one tribe that can argue a greater degree of affectedness over another tribe? ``Affected'' is defined in this instance to apply to a tribe that faces a substantial environmental or health impact.
