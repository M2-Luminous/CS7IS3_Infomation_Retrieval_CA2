Yes, we have now reached the point where we can give this title to the secretary of what was once the most associationist party, the DC [Christian Democratic Party]," AD [Democratic Alliance] founder Ferdinando Adornato said. Adornato was, in fact, among the first to accuse [Pact for Italy leader] Mario Segni and the League of transformism because of the agreement they reached the day before yesterday. Up to a few months ago, Adornato and Segni -- two of the new faces brought into the limelight by the Italian crisis and the rapid collapse of parties and traditions -- were in tune with each other. When they drew up the document uniting democratic allies and "pro-reform People's [Popular] Party members" on 15 July last, both stressed that AD must constitute an alternative to the League. But one of the two has now joined the enemy. "The usual old transformism," Adornato started by saying, "is today favored by objective factors. The first is the confusion of party acronyms resulting from the new electoral law. In order to win, approximately 35 percent is needed in each constituency. Therefore, disparate forces must be joined. On the other hand, whereas the majority system forces parties into alliances, the proportional quota encourages each party to act individually. It is not surprising that each alliance looks like a ragbag. However.... [Caprara] However, Mr. Adornato.... [Adornato] However, this agreement between Segni and the League makes me see red. I am not only angry; I am also worried: Those responsible for a transformist operation are precisely the protagonists of two different types of renewal. I have never liked [League Secretary] Bossi. Yet it cannot be denied that both he and Segni express the need for renewal in two different ways. This is why Martinazzoli may become the champion of antitransformism, despite being the secretary of a party from which theoretically we might expect the opposite." [Caprara] If it has happened, it means something is uniting Segni and the League. [Adornato] It is disheartening. I am tempted to move to Switzerland. They were blackmailed into reaching an agreement by a publisher, a sort of Texan tycoon who does not want to give up his TV networks [Berlusconi]. [Caprara] Communist Renewal decided to join the progressive coalition in a congress in which 70 percent of the delegates were in favor and 30 percent against. Do you regard this also as transformism? [Adornato] I am very much aware that the electoral system entails the risk of transformism for us too. I observed Communist Renewal held a very moderate congress. They were born criticizing the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] for their government platform, and then realized that they had messed up. But they never said they were sorry, for example, for having voted "no" in the electoral referendum. [Caprara] However, AD will be going into the elections with Communist Renewal. Is this not transformism too? [Adornato] Yes, there are risks involved for us too. However, this is precisely why we are striving to ensure that, within the electoral coalition, a more homogeneous group of forces puts forward a single government platform, a prime minister and a single parliamentary group. [Caprara] [Communist Renewal Chairman] Cossutta does not seem to agree. [Adornato] Communist Renewal and others are free to say on which points they agree and on which they do not. Openly. But I must add something. We do not have a center-right, but a somewhat uncouth right. Segni and Bossi will also reach an agreement with [Italian Social Movement, MSI, Secretary] Fini so as not to step on each other's toes. Since 1989, however, it is not the Cossacks who have been the problem. It is the right. Can you imagine the effects that an Italy governed by the right would have on Germany or Bosnia? [Caprara] Mr. Adornato, at one point you argued that the League and AD were the sole new forces in the country. Does it follow from this that you will stand as a candidate in Lombardy, and that you will do so in some constituency against a League candidate? [Adornato] Me? The logic of the majority system entails that if I stand as a candidate I should do so in my own town, Rome, where I have lived since I was one year old.
