The results of the surveys indicate that young people in these three regions put "social stability" in first place and a "perfect legal system" in second place. Young people are the most lively factor in society. They regard "social stability" as the first condition for their living environment. This fully suggests that social stability has become the main trend in the current mainland and Hong Kong societies. This general trend is what the young people wish to have. Economic Prosperity Cannot Be Separated From Social Stability A host of facts, ancient and modern, suggest that the prosperity and development of a country or region are closely related to its social stability. Without social stability, the economy will not prosper. Everyone has deep feelings about the positive and negative experiences in mainland reform and this is the same with Hong Kong's situation. Since the end of the war, Hong Kong has relied on its prolonged social stability in becoming an international financial, economic, trade, shipping, and tourist center, thus forming an effective operational mechanism. Social stability is an important factor. Deng Xiaoping repeatedly stressed that stability must override everything else. During a recent meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir, Jiang Zemin pointed out: "Over the last five years, our persistent efforts in maintaining stability and taking this as a matter of priority importance have resulted in China's economic development, social tranquility, and improvement in the people's lives. Facts have proved that this practice is absolutely correct." Being a country with 1.2 billion people, whether or not China remains stable has a global bearing. If an unbridled turmoil occurs, the country splits, war breaks out and spreads, and large numbers of refugees swarm out of the country seriously affect the tranquility of the countries and regions around China. In such cases, Hong Kong would be the first to suffer and the consequences would be disastrous. Therefore, China's stability is not for the sake of China's development alone but also benefits the stability and prosperity of Asia and the rest of the world. Facts prove that China's stability and development over the last 10 years have benefitted not only the Chinese people but also world peace and development. The Chinese Government takes into account much of the mainland's stability and accounts for Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. When China and Britain were holding talks on Hong Kong's future, the Chinese Government proposed safeguarding and preserving Hong Kong's social stability and economic prosperity and regarded this as an important objective. It was included in the Sino-British Joint Declaration. For this reason, the Chinese Government formulated the policy of one country, two systems, along with other basic principles, openly committing itself to maintain Hong Kong's social and economic system in such a way that it will remain unchanged for 50 years. All this has been confirmed in the Basic Law in accordance with the policy of one country, two systems. In the 10- year transitional period since China and Britain signed the Joint Declaration, the Chinese side has always abided by this principle stand in cooperating with the British side in handling all Hong Kong affairs. We believe this is known to all Hong Kong people and the international community. Although the British side has not kept its promises and has ruined Sino-British cooperation over the constitutional system, the Chinese side is still willing to cooperate with the British side on economic matters and the people's lives and materialize into a steady transition. This is the most convincing proof. Hong Kong's Survival and Prosperity Are Closely Connected With the Mainland's Stability In the past, some people described Hong Kong as the goose which laid the "golden eggs". Since the mainland introduced reform and opening up, Hong Kong has played a role in promoting the mainland's economic development. But, as former British Foreign Minister Howe said in the British Parliament in December 1984: "In the greater part of the previous months, Hong Kong's survival has relied on cooperation provided by the Chinese side". This is a fact. The Chinese Government has for long kept a positive attitude on affairs beneficial to Hong Kong's social stability, the people's lives and economic development. Therefore, the Chinese Government has always insisted that Hong Kong must not become a base for sabotaging or undermining China, nor does it allow the mainland to affect Hong Kong's stability. When a turmoil occurred on the mainland during the "Great Cultural Revolution", Premier Zhou Enlai personally prohibited the Red Guards from entering Hong Kong. The mainland has always provided close cooperation and support in curbing all crimes, stopping smugglers, reducing the effects of stock crashes, delivering consumer goods and nonstaple food, and resolving water shortages. Frequent economic exchanges between the mainland and Hong Kong constitutes a huge momentum for Hong Kong's sustained prosperity and the mainland's stable development since the introduction of reform and opening up serves as an important guarantee for Hong Kong's sustained prosperity. It is exactly because of this that economic prosperity has prevailed on the mainland and in Hong Kong at a time when economic depression is sweeping the entire Western world. Obviously, whether or not the mainland remains stable has become an important factor affecting Hong Kong's economy, social stability, and its people's lives. The mainland's stability promoting Hong Kong's prosperity has become the Hong Kong people's common understanding. The preservation of the mainland's stability and Hong Kong's prosperity and stability correspond with each other. We believe all people without prejudice understand that: Without stability on the mainland, Hong Kong could not have achieved its current prosperity and stability; any obstacle to the mainland's stability could be as bad as ruining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. The mainland's stability include the following two aspects: "One is stability in the political situation and the other is stability in policies". Deng Xiaoping pointed out: Apart from maintaining the stability of the reform and opening up policy, there must not be any change in adhering to the four cardinal principles, in adhering to the socialist system, and in adhering to the Communist Party leadership; these two "no changes" constitute the main factors for the mainland's stability. The mainland's socialist system is the main component of the policy of one country, two systems; only with the existence of this main component can other components exist. Without the skin, where can the hair grow? "Just imagine, if the socialist system changes in China, if the socialist system with Chinese characteristics under the leadership of the CPC changes, what will become of Hong Kong? Hong Kong's prosperity and stability could fall through." (Deng Xiaoping's remarks) Coincidentally, some foreign politicians hold similar views to Deng Xiaoping. Former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew has always thought that Hong Kong's role lies in its economic value and objects to Hong Kong's confrontation with the mainland. Hong Kong is small and the mainland is powerful; in politics, it absolutely cannot confront the mainland, he said adding, "Should the CPC crumble, China would crumble; then there could be 30 to 40 years of chaos in China". During a recent visit to Hong Kong, Howe openly said, "Hong Kong must not be turned into a bridgehead for changing China. To attempt this would be extremely unwise. Hong Kong cannot change China and must not think it can change China; any attempt could only result in Hong Kong's devastation." During a debate in the British House of Lords not long ago, two former Hong Kong governors also mentioned issues concerning Hong Kong. MacLehose said, "The prospects of Hong Kong and China's economies thriving serve as the pillar supporting people's confidence. They are actually going smoothly. I hope political factors will not become interference in sight of this prosperity". David Wilson pointed out, "At this moment, it is quite important to prevent a human-made split in Hong Kong society because, whatever it may be, it will finally involve the entire interests of Hong Kong and Hong Kong people". They both sincerely advised Hong Kong people not to confront the mainland or change the mainland's system because they had looked wisely at the facts and fully understood that any perverse move could have serious consequences. As a matter of fact, many Hong Kong people fully understand this principle and that it will not do to change the mainland's system. Several days ago, an editorial by Hong Kong's CHING CHI JIH PAO [Economic Times] pointed out: "Hong Kong should not and cannot become a bridgehead for changing the mainland's system because it is not equipped with the necessary conditions; this is beyond its ability, so to speak. Second, this attempt could distort the policy of one country, two systems, and Hong Kong would suffer a lot. Third, this would deviate from Hong Kong's political reality and go against popular will. In terms of its geographical location and economic background, Hong Kong is closely related to changes in China's situation; how the situation in China changes will affect Hong Kong, but Hong Kong can only affect China economically and is absolutely not in a position to change China's politics". The editorial made these comments out of profound knowledge about China's and Hong Kong's situations. In preserving the mainland's stability, there is a need to respect its socialist system and affairs. This is the meaning of adhering to the policy of "one country, two systems". The mainland's and Hong Kong's stability must be treasured, with mutual noninterference in each other's internal affairs but by maintaining good-neighborly relations, promoting each other, and making common development. Sabotage activities against the mainland must be opposed, the mainland's stability must be preserved, dialogue and cooperation with the mainland must be strengthened, mutual promotion must be upheld, and common development must be encouraged. This is Hong Kong's best choice for the present and future. The British Side Has Caused Unrest in Hong Kong Society The purpose of the Chinese Government in formulating the policy of "one country, two systems" in signing the Joint Declaration, and in carrying out cooperation with the British side is to ensure Hong Kong's steady transition and its prolonged stability and prosperity. But the signing of the Joint Declaration does not mean that we can relax our efforts in maintaining Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. Deng Xiaoping pointed out in 1982 that some people would create confusion during Hong Kong's transitional period and "these include not only foreigners but also Chinese, but mainly Englishmen". Later developments, particularly developments in the latter half of the transitional period, have proved that what Deng Xiaoping said was unfortunately, correct. In the first half of the transitional period, there was cooperation between China and Britain. In the latter half, the British side has not strengthened cooperation with the Chinese side, as required by the Joint Declaration; instead, it has substituted confrontation for cooperation, completely reneged on the Joint Declaration, in a brazen attempt to fish for what it could not get at the negotiating table and at the expense of Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. On the constitutional system, the British side has acted against the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Basic Law's convergence principle, and the understandings and agreements reached between the two countries; it has intentionally undermined the talks on the 1994 and 1995 electoral arrangements, and unilaterally proceeded with what it wishes to do, thus dismantling the rail of the "through train" for a steady constitutional transition. On the legal system, the British side has speeded up the amendments of regulations and legislation and constantly put obstacles in the way of implementing the Basic Law; it has dished out a "Bill of Rights", which even Britain itself does not have, to make the Basic Law impracticable; it has disregarded judicial convergence, violated both sides' agreements, repeatedly delayed the establishment of the court of final appeal, and amended the New Territories Land Exemption Bill under the pretext of fake "gender equality", all aimed at casting aside the Basic Law and the Joint Declaration. Recently it advocated the establishment of a so-called "human rights commission" in an attempt to form an adjudication institution which overrides the independent judicial system and destroys the future special administrative region's [SAR] independent judiciary. In the economic field, it has refused to carry out the overall financial arrangements which conform with the Memorandum of Understanding on the new airport's construction, real estate prices are soaring, and no one cares about coordinating transportation between Hong Kong and Shenzhen. All these are related to the British side's efforts in accumulating wealth by unfair means, in leaving a financial burden for the SAR, and in leaving unstable factors in Hong Kong's economy. On the question of government functionaries, the British side has refused to cooperate with the Chinese side and does not allow Hong Kong Government functionaries to contact the Preparatory Working Committee; in addition, it has ceaselessly talked about its readiness to consult with the Chinese side on the transition of Hong Kong senior public servants and its willingness to expedite the arrangements for the formation of public servants, in an attempt to deprive the future SAR chief executive and the central authorities of their powers. The British side has spared no expense in undermining Hong Kong's social stability and steady transition because, as a British Parliamentary report acknowledged, Britain has changed its policy toward China and Hong Kong. The basis of this change is, obviously, its wish for the downfall of the Chinese Government before 1997 and for Chinese local regimes' separation from the central government. In the final analysis, it wishes for disintegration and an unchangeable difficult situation in China. By then, China will be too busy to consider Hong Kong affairs and Britain will continue its administration of Hong Kong. At the very least, it wants its colonial influence to continue for a long time so that it can protect its colonialist interests. It is now the 1990's but these people's minds still remain in the previous century. So, it is correct to say that it is easy to change mountains and rivers but hard to change a person's character. Those Who Undermine Social Stability Must Not Be Tolerated Apart from provoking trouble, causing confusion, and undermining stability under the pretext of "democracy", "freedom","equality" and "human rights" the British Hong Kong Government has also encouraged some political forces to constantly make trouble. Leaders of some organizations in Hong Kong are trying to overthrow the Chinese Government and change the mainland's socialist system. They constitute a force undermining Hong Kong's stability. They have excluded themselves from the Chinese people and are following foreign anti-China forces, advocating sanctions against China, and obstructing China's progress and development. They are opposed to anything favorable to China and are creating farces under the pretext of freedom of speech. If anything happens on the mainland, they take advantage of this opportunity to lead the citizens astray, instigate their sentiments against the mainland, and sow dissension between Hong Kong and the mainland. As time goes by, the mainland has become increasingly stable and developed and the relations between Hong Kong and the mainland have become more extensive and close. Their attempt to undermine the mainland's stability and ruin Hong Kong's prosperity is clearly seen through by more and more Hong Kong people, their practice has enjoyed less popular support, and they have landed themselves in isolation from others. The Hong Kong people have gradually come to understand that if these people succeed in their attempt, not only will the mainland's stability and development be ruined, Hong Kong's stability and prosperity will also be destroyed. What these people have done does not enjoy popular support at all. They are trying by every possible means to carry out one activity today and another activity tomorrow but their efforts will come to naught. To preserve Hong Kong's stability, the harmonious relations between Hong Kong and the mainland and the mainland's stability, Hong Kong citizens have reason to ask the British Hong Kong Government to strictly fulfill its commitment to "not allow Hong Kong to be turned into a base for hostile activities". If Hong Kong's stability and the harmonious relations between Hong Kong and the mainland are ruined because of the British Hong Kong Government's tolerance and support for the abovementioned activities, the British Hong Kong Government must be held responsible for the consequences in history. Social stability is what the people wish. All people who love the country and Hong Kong and hope for the smooth implementation of the policy of "one country, two systems" should favor the mainland's stability and development and take preserving Hong Kong's stability and prosperity as their glorious duty. As long as all the descendants of Emperor Huangdi including the mainland and Hong Kong people strive for the invigoration of the Chinese nation while preserving the different social systems, the day is not far off when China will stand in the ranks of the strong nations of the world with its people working and living in peace and contentment and becoming healthier and better off.
