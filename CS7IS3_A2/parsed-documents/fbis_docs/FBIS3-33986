The protest on Tuesday came the same day as a gunman fired shots during a speech by President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani. And the mainly Shiite Muslim country's economic plight also cast a shadow over the anniversary when parliament cut the annual budget. An angry crowd gathered Tuesday outside the main mosque in Zahedan, one of the few Iranian cities with a Sunni Muslim majority, after rumours spread that a Sunni mosque had been destroyed in Mashhad in northeastern Iran. "Counter-revolutionary elements joined the crowd and started throwing stones at the police, breaking shop windows," HAMSHARI newspaper said. The interior ministry described the violence as a "counter- revolutionary plot" and said public buildings, houses and military vehicles had been attacked. The security forces arrested demonstrators who wanted to "sow disorder and trouble in Zahedan" at the start of the official ceremonies marking the anniversary of the 1979 revolution which toppled the shah, the ministry said. No figure was given for the number of demonstrators involved. "Counter-revolutionary elements gathered in Khayyam Avenue and began ripping down the Iranian flags and smashing the party lights decorating the street for the anniversary of the revolution," the ministry said. The newspaper KEYHAN reported Tuesday that the armed opposition group the People's Mojahedin [Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization, MKO] was preparing "terrorist activities" in Sistan va Baluchestan province, of which Zahedan is the main town, "with the backing of Saudi Arabia," which sees itself as the leader of the Sunni branch of Islam. Also Tuesday, a gunman fired shots as Rafsanjani delivered a speech at the mausoleum of the republic's founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeyni. Police arrested a 26-year-old man who said he had only wanted to frighten the crowd. Rafsanjani, standing 50 meters (yards) away and shielded by an aide, kept his composure and did not interrupt his speech at the shrine in southern Tehran. "There was nothing to worry about," he told Tehran Radio later. The noise panicked some in the crowd of several thousand who had gathered to celebrate the first of the 10 days which led to the revolution, known here as "Fajr" (dawn). After the incident the crowd started shouting "Rafsanjani, we support you" and "death to the hypocrites," in reference to the armed opposition. On the economic front, the Iranian parliament adopted an austerity budget for 1994-1995, trimming the government's proposed draft by 12 percent because of low oil revenues. Parliament lowered the forecast for overall revenues to 17 billion dollars, down from the government's target of 19.2 billion dollars. The budget was cut by 12 percent, from 45.5 billion dollars to 40 billion dollars. MPs also chopped 20 percent off the revenue forecast from oil exports for the next Iranian year -- running from March 21, 1994 to March 20, 1995 -- from 12.8 billion dollars to 10.15 billion dollars. The price of a barrel of crude was estimated at 13 dollars, while the government had forecast 14.5 dollars.
