He said: "We are cutting beyond the meat; we are already reaching the bone." Having said this, Ricupero harshly criticized the health sector, which is pressing for more funds and is increasing its expenditures. Ricupero warned that social security and health expenditures are endangering the budget balance. After stating that the government is firmly committed to balancing its public accounts, the pillar on which the success of the economic plan is based, Ricupero said: "These expenses are jeopardizing the government's projects. There are no funds left for other sectors." Planning Minister Beni Varas, who charged the health sector with poorly managing its resources, made a similar criticism two weeks ago. Despite acknowledging the hardships and difficulties that the health sector -- hospitals included -- is experiencing, Ricupero blamed previous governments for the worsening of the delay in transferring resources. Ricupero said hospital expenditures today exceed the overall spending of the government apparatus. Ricupero added: "In March, we transferred 589 billion cruzeiros for health expenses while overall state expenses totaled 530 billion cruzeiros. This fact was worrisome because health expenses are increasing geometrically." He noted that President Itamar Franco ordered the Applied Economic-Social Research Institute (IPEA), which is linked to the Planning Secretariat (Seplan), to verify health accounts to determine what problems are occurring there. Ricupero reported that thus far this year, the government has disbursed only 23 percent of the one-twelfth portion of the budgeted amount that can be used prior to congressional approval of the budget. "This represents less than one-fourth of what we could disburse," he said. "The public sector is making its contribution to economic stabilization," he added. In the draft budget submitted to Congress, the government reestimated its revenues, bringing them up to $98.725 billion this year. In the previous proposal, revenues had been estimated at $88.7 billion. Estimated expenditures were also changed from $88.6 billion to $98.723 billion. Thus, the government expects to close 1994 with an operational surplus (revenues less expenditures, including payments on interest on the foreign debt) of only $2 million. The economic team believes it will obtain a primary surplus (revenues less expenditures) of $7.7 billion, which would be equivalent to 1.7 percent of the gross domestic product. Government economists regard the budgetary balance as a basic condition for the success of the plan. The team believes that upon the elimination of the public deficit, one of the main causes of inflation -- the issuance of both currency and bonds for the financing of current accounts -- will disappear. Ricupero said: "We are proposing a budget that would prevent the public sector from affecting the country's economic performance."
