He made this statement at an extraordinary press conference for Russian and foreign correspondents. To all appearances, the patience of the Russian command has become exhausted in the wake of yet another killing, this time involving a senior officer of the Russian border troops staff, Lieutenant Colonel Sergey Leontikov. He was shot and killed, according to eyewitnesses, outside his garage by three unidentified persons. All in all eight Russians, including six servicemen, were killed between 31 May and 4 June. In A. Chechulin's words, those well-organized and directed terrorist acts are nothing else but the carrying out of threats by leaders of the Islamic Rebirth Movement of Tajikistan. A. Chechulin promised that the Russian military would no longer tolerate the bandit threat from whoever it comes, and that authorized weapons and equipment would be drawn upon to protect Russians. Mechislav Senkevich, who took part in the press conference, stated toughly that Russia would take all measures to protect both the Russian servicemen and the Russian-speaking population in Tajikistan.
