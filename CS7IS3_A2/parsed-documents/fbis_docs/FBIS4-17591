He told Interfax that he categorically opposed the idea of involving Washington in this dispute. "To begin with, this is Russia's problem. Historically, it is Russia that is conducting talks with Ukraine. So Russia will hardly put up with the idea of American participation," he said. Speaking about the talks on the Black Sea Fleet between the Russian and Ukrainian defense ministers, Baltin said that Kiev had interpreted the Moscow agreement between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents in its own way and violated one of its basic provisions on the separate location of the Russian and Ukrainian headquarters. The presence of the Ukrainian and Russian headquarters in Sevastopol would destabilize the situation in the city and complicate the work of the personnel, he said. Such a situation may entail unpredictable consequences, he added. To quote Baltin, behind the Ukrainian position is the lack of money for the construction of its own naval base. "It is much easier to live at someone else's expense," he said. Commenting on the allegations that Russia scuppered the talks, he said that "attack is the best form of defense." "Obviously, Kiev has taken this saying to heart," he said.
