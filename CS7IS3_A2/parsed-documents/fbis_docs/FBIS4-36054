The ministers also stressed, in the final communique they released after the end of their current session, that "it is absolutely impossible to impose this unity by military means." They noted that the union, which was set up by agreement between the two independent states -- the Yemen Arab Republic and the Democratic People's Republic of Yemen in May 1990 -- "cannot continue except by the consent of the two parties." The final press release said that "faced with the fait accompli of the fact that one of the parties announced its decision to revert back to the former status of two republics and the setting up of a the Democratic Republic of Yemen, the two parties can only deal with this situation through peaceful means." The press release added that "in consideration of the motives of the sincere sons of Yemen regarding unity, the two sides can deal with situation only within a framework of peaceful methods." Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal, chairman of the current GCC ministerial session, refused to comment on whether the final press release meant putting political pressure on the side that did not accept a cease- fire. He said: "I have no more details to give other than the ones mentioned in the final press release." The GCC's ministerial council urged Yemen's leaders to put the Yemen's interests and its people above all considerations and to respond immediately to UN Security Council Resolution 924 to stop military operations immediately and to resort to dialogue in order to stop bloodshed and protect lives and possessions. The council expressed "sorrow for the continuation of the fighting despite the issuing of the UN resolution." The council statement said that "the continuation between the two parties made leaders in southern Yemen declare the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Yemen." [sentence as received] The statement clarified that "although the council appreciates the sincere motives of Yemen's sons for unity, it confirms that it cannot impose this unity through military means."
