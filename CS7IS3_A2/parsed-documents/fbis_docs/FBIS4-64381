The cease-fire is disintegrating in Sarajevo, the Serbs are only partially respect their promises in Gorazde, and a group of UN soldiers sent there to monitor the truce are blocked 35 km east of the Bosnian capital. Talks between the powers and the warring factions are at a standstill, and the French foreign minister is not hiding his concern: [Begin Juppe recording] It is true, I am worried. We are constantly on the brink. UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] is increasingly less capable of controlling the situation simply because it was asked to fulfil tasks without the means to do so. We are not immune from a catastrophe, which could be sparked off here or there. I am particularly worried by the situation in Brcko, this very sensitive area between the Serbs and the Muslims. Besides, the contact group -- which I proposed -- has started work, but it appears to be limiting itself to consultations with the various parties. What I had in mind was the emergence of a common American, Russian, European position which would later enable us to bang the table -- if need be -- to say: We must now get a negotiated settlement. We are not doing that. This is why the chances are greater than ever that the arms embargo will be lifted. It must be known that -- if this decision is made -- it would naturally bring about the withdrawal of the UNPROFOR contingent, which could not remain there for obvious reasons. I want to remain confident. I believe that the only way to put pressure on the diplomatic process is to organize a meeting at the ministerial level as early as possible. [end recording]
