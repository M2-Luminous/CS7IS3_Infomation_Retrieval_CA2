FR940831-2-00147 FR940831-2-00106 In conformance with section 591.205(c), title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, Runzheimer followed a five-step process to derive the overall total indexes for each allowance area. First, Runzheimer used the CES data and the income ranges described in section 2.1.2.4 above to derive the amount of money consumers typically spend on each component at each income level. These amounts appear in the table below and in Appendix 14. Typical Consumer Expenditures by Income Level and Component 1Income level 1Goods & services 1Own/rent 1Transportation 1Misc. 1Total Lower $7,126 $4,383 $3,737 $2,754 $18,000 Middle 11,119 6,668 5,774 4,839 28,400 Upper 17,510 10,242 9,013 8,434 45,200 Note: Values may not total because of rounding. Second, for each allowance area, Runzheimer multiplied the values above by the component indexes for the allowance area. Because the Housing component consisted of two indexes (one for owners and another for renters), we produced two sets of total relative costs_one for owners and another for renters. Third, for each allowance area and income level, Runzheimer combined the total relative costs for owners and renters using the proportion of owners and renters as identified in the CES to weigh the costs. (See section 4.2.1.) This produced an overall, average, relative living cost at each income level in each allowance area. Fourth, for each allowance area, the overall, average relative costs by income level were combined using federal employment weights based on the employment at each income level in the allowance area. Applying the same allowance-area employment weights, Runzheimer computed an overall, average cost for the reference area. The last step was to divide the overall, average relative cost for the allowance area by the overall, average cost for the reference area to produce the final index. (See Appendix 14 for the calculations for each index.) 2.3‚ê£Data Collection Process As noted earlier, Runzheimer obtained price information on over 6,000 items from over 1,000 outlets. To accomplish this important research effort, we selected the most efficient and effective information-gathering approaches possible. This section describes the various approaches.
