Last night and all today the Mt. Majevica chetniks have been pounding Vukovije and Dubrave with heavy artillery. They are firing the shells from the area of Poljanice on Mt. Majevica, and they have destroyed or badly damaged some dozen houses in Vukovije and Dubrave. It is obvious that the criminals from Mt. Majevica are showing that they are ready to fire at [Tuzla's] Dubrave Airport, which the world wants to open. The general alarm has been sounded three times in Tuzla, and it is still in force. Everything that has been happening around Tuzla these days shows that the decisions of the international community that Tuzla become a protected area are for the chetniks only a dead letter.
