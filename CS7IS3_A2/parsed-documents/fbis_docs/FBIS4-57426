The bill states, among other things, that the U.S. Congress should support political reforms in Mexico in view of the upcoming 21 August elections. The two Democrats also proposed the presence of international observers. I repeat, this bill has sparked a number of reactions in Mexico by Mexican senators, Congress leader Maria de los Angeles Moreno, and Government Secretary Jorge Carpizo. Elvia Moreno has the story: [Begin recording] [Moreno] Government Secretary Carpizo today rejected the idea of foreign intervention in Mexico's internal affairs by saying only Mexicans will manage and supervise the 21 August federal elections. He was interviewed after he opened the Radio Broadcasting Commission Production Center of the Federal Electoral Institute [IFE]. The center was designed to support political parties in their mission to broadcast and spread the political culture. He stressed the following: [Carpizo] As a Mexican, I reject any foreign intervention in Mexico's internal affairs. As for the elections, it is very clear that only Mexicans will manage and supervise the electoral process. We will let no foreigner intervene for any reason whatsoever. I am sure we Mexicans are united on this, for we believe in sovereignty and nationalism. The only thing these U.S. congressmen will achieve is to unite us even further. The final outcome will be that all Mexicans, as one entity, will not accept any interventionist principle. [Moreno] This is how the government secretary replied to the interventionist attempt by two U.S. Democrats to observe the Mexican electoral process. As for the debate on electoral registers between Samuel Del Villar, representative of the Party of the Democratic Revolution at the IFE, and Carlos Almada, Federal Voters Registry director general, Secretary Carpizo pointed out that the interest shown by Mexicans on the electoral lists reveals the citizens' determination to be better acquainted with electoral issues. Carpizo also noted that the National Radio and Television Chamber is in charge of making the technical preparations to hold the electoral registry debate, whose date and place have yet to be determined.
