The morning daily `TEHRAN TIMES' commented in its editorial on the Geneva meeting between Syria's President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton. "Although the details of the negotiations have not yet been made available to the media, all evidences point to the conclusion that the American President could not get the Syrian leader to accept the American point of view as easily he could prevail upon (PLO Chairman Yasir) 'Arafat or his predecessor had been able to make (President) Anwar al-Sadat (of Egypt) yield to the American pressure." In a press conference held after the talks, President al-Asad held firmly to his rightful stance, demanding Israeli withdrawal from all territories occupied in 1967 six-day war or comprehensive peace settlement with all Arab countries at once. Turning to the strategem used by the Zionist regime during the past two decades on separate bilateral talks and settlements with individual Arab states, it said "the obvious objective and natural consequence of that strategem is of course to create discord among the Arab ranks." Turning to President al-Asad's display of awareness of the fact that the American President's promises could not be relied on, the paper said "the gap between what is promised by the American President and what is actually done by Tel Aviv leaders is extremely wide." "It would of course be quite unwise to pass a hasty judgement on the meeting between al-Asad and Clinton before details of their negotiations are known." The daily said with regards to the cordial ties between Iran and Syria, "it is quite natural that Tehran should be expecting President al-Asad's special envoy in the coming days with details of the negotiations between the heads of America and Syria."
