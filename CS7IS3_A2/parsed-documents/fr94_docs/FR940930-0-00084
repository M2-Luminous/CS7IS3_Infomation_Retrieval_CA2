FR940930-0-00084 FR940930-0-00016 Response: Section 1834(c)(1)(C) of the Act requires that the amount of payment for screening mammography services be equal to 80 percent of the least of the actual charge, the radiologist fee schedule, or the physicians' fee schedule established under section 1848 of the Act, as applicable, or the statutory limit for the service. Comment: One commenter, while conceding that we had no choice under the statute in imposing an overall $55 limit, stated that a single national rate without any recognition of geographic variations is inappropriate. The commenter believed that we should establish a price for screening mammograms within the context of other radiology services and ask the Congress to repeal the separate limit for these procedures. Response: If it becomes apparent that the statutory limit is inadequate, we may make the proposal. Comment: One commenter stated that radiologists would charge $32 for their interpretation, leaving only about $23 for the hospital, an amount which would cover only the cost of the film. Response: Under the statutory allocation methodology implemented in the interim final rule (55 FR 53512), the professional component of the procedure in 1991 was limited to $20.35 (37 percent of $55), while the technical component was limited to $34.63 (63 percent of $55). The 1991 limiting charges for nonparticipating physicians and suppliers were: $68.75 (global), $25.44 (professional component), and $43.31 (technical component). Therefore, payment to hospitals for the technical component of screening mammography services is not determined by subtracting the amount billed for the professional component charge from the overall limit, but rather on the basis of the allocation methodology described in the interim final rule (55 FR 53512). Comment: One commenter stated that the payment limit in section 1834(c)(4) of the Act is lower than the costs for screening mammography services furnished by a mobile unit in rural areas. The commenter believed that the operating costs of a mobile unit are higher than those of a stationary unit. Another commenter expressed concern that the processing of Medicare claims will increase the costs of mobile facilities and other screening centers that previously have not handled Medicare claims. Response: Section 1834(c)(4) of the Act does not provide for any exception to the overall limit. Nonparticipating physicians and suppliers may bill beneficiaries higher amounts for the procedure up to the limiting charge set forth in ยง405.535.
