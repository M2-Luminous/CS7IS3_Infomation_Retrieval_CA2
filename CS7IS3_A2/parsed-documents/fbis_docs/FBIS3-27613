The meeting called on cadres and masses in suburban areas and various trades of the municipality to further explore new ways for promoting reform, opening up, and economic development in the suburban areas of the extra large municipality from a higher plane with a more positive attitude, a broader vista, greater courage, and more solid measures in order to raise agricultural production, rural work, and the entire rural economy to a new level. Wu Bangguo, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee, gave an important speech at the meeting. Wu Bangguo first fully affirmed the achievements of the people in Shanghai's suburban areas, their basic experience, and the work of cadres. He said: Rural work in Shanghai's suburban areas registered good progress last year. The broad masses of cadres and people in the suburban areas have seriously studied Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, emancipated their minds, adhered to the ideology of seeking truth from facts, and promoted a sustained, fast, and healthy development of the economy in Shanghai's suburban areas. The rural economy in Shanghai's suburban areas has become an important component part of economic development in the entire municipality and has also become an important part of Shanghai's economic growth. The achievements of rural work are the results of the hard work of the broad masses of cadres and people in the suburban areas and of support by various trades in Shanghai. On behalf of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee, I wish to take this opportunity to extend my cordial regards and express my heartfelt gratitude to the broad masses of cadres and people in the suburban areas who have worked laboriously. Wu Bangguo pointed out: To maintain social stability, we must promote economic development and attach importance to the "Shopping Basket" Project. In light of new problems that emerged in the "Shopping Basket" Project, we must carry out reform, develop production bases, improve the marketing system, and enforce macro control to ensure the supply of supplementary food products for the municipality. We should enrich the market, promote statiblity in society, and improve the people's living conditions. Wu Bangguo emphatically pointed out: In the new year, we should seize the opportunity to deepen reform, further open up, promote development, ensure stability, raise agricultural production and rural work to a new level, and maintain a good trend of economic development in Shanghai's suburban areas. All trades and professions in society should show concern for and support agriculture and take the initiative to serve economic development in rural areas. We should firmly adhere to the policy of "grasping the two links and attaching equal importance to both." In line with the actual situation of rural work, we should strengthen the construction of party organizations at various levels in rural areas, pay attention to fostering an advanced culture and ideology, and build an honest government. We should show concern for the living conditions of the masses and unite with the broad masses of people in rural areas to jointly build a new socialist countryside. Mayor Huang Ju also gave an important speech at the meeting. After fully affirming the great achievements in various work made by cadres and people in rural areas during 1993, Huang Ju pointed out the general guiding principle for this year's rural work. He said: We should fully implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the Central Rural Conference, and the Second Plenary Meeting of the Sixth Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee; seize the opportunity to deepen reform, further open up, promote development, maintain stability; and strive to keep a good trend of sustained, fast, and healthy development of the rural economy. In promoting the development of the rural economy, we should give prominence to "one service and three coordinated actions." In other words, we should serve the "Shopping Basket" Project for Shanghai's urban residents and take coordinated actions with Shanghai's major industries, with Shanghai's large markets, and with Shanghai's foreign trade departments. Huang Ju emphatically pointed out: This year's rural work has four main tasks: First, we should effectively strengthen agricultural work and firmly grasp the construction of the "two greens," namely promoting the production of green vegetables and planting trees. Second, we should further deepen reform, open up, and strive to achieve a new breakthrough in our work. Third, we should seriously draw up a blueprint for developing suburban areas and promoting the urbanization of rural areas step by step. Fourth, we should strive to raise peasants' income on the basis of developing the economy and protect peasants' enthusiasm for production. Huang Ju said: We should stress promoting the production of green vegetables, achieve a breakthrough in developing vegetable gardens, and attach importance to greening projects to improve the ecology and environment in urban and rural areas. Those are major tasks to be firmly grasped in the next few years in Shanghai. We should spend three years to further raise the level of the "Shopping Basket" Project and establish a sound engineering system for it. We should explore new ways for developing the "Shopping Basket" Project to suit the needs of the internationalized metropolis [guo ji hua da du shi 0948 7139 0553 1129 6757 1579] in the 1990's and the next century. We should protect the production bases for vegetables and other supplementary food products according to the 10-15 year plan, form a new management system for production and marketing, and implement various measures for developing the "Shopping Basket" Project in a solid manner. This year, we should achieve the goal of greening an average of 1.4 square meters per person in the afforestation project and the total area of forest cover should reach 15 percent. We should plant trees on "four sides" [house side, village side, roadside and water side] in rural areas, strengthen the construction of forest belts along sea dikes, and develop flower gardens. In this way, we will be able to form a beautiful environment in all the suburban areas where "there are flowers in spring, shade from trees in summer, fruits in autumn, and green trees in winter." Huang Ju called for raising the standard of development in the suburban areas this year and accelerating the urbanization of the countryside. He said: In making plans for various districts and areas, we should not limit the development plan within each county, but should coordinate with the overall strategic plan for Shanghai's development. We should make great efforts to improve infrastructure construction with special emphasis on road construction. Various counties should concentrate their financial power on building one or two main highways first; construct water, electric power and gas and other facilities; and strive to complete a relatively sound road network within the next two to three years. Huang Hu also pointed out: Industry in the suburban areas has great vitality in Shanghai's economic development, and so we should concentrate our efforts and financial power on promoting industrial development in the suburban areas. Each county should start with the construction of a key industrial zone, and take on the new road of cooperation between counties, districts, and bureaus. We should give full play to our combined strength and strive to set up a number of enterprise groups with special characteristics. Meanwhile, we should seriously sum up experiences and actively promote the establishment of "Sino-foreign" joint ventures with funds from the agricultural and industrial sectors and foreign companies. In this way, we can raise the level, scale, and efficiency of village and town enterprises. In conclusion, Huang Ju emphatically pointed out: Stability in agricultural production and rural areas is the foundation for stability in the entire society. The development of agricultural production and rural areas is an important part of Shanghai's overall society. Governments at various levels and other units should all consider the work of developing the rural economy and increasing the peasants' income as a starting point and standpoint. We should mobilize the whole municipality, promote cooperation, and raise the economic and social development in rural areas to a new level. Yesterday's meeting was presided over by Wang Liping, deputy secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee, and Vice Mayor Meng Jianzhu, respectively. Vice Mayor Xie Lijuan attended the meeting. Head of Minhang District Huang Furong and head of Qingpu County Li Jinsheng introduced their experiences in developing the rural economy at the meeting. Vice Mayor Meng Jianzhu disseminated the guidelines of the national conference on "Shopping Basket" Project and the production of grain, cotton, and edible oil.
