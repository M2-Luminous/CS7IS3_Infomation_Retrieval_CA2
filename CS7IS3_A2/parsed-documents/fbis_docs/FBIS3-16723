Opposition newspapers, in particular MUKHALIFAT [name as transliterated], present what is happening as a sensation and maliciously hint that the president's political party is not destined to be long-lived. However, it is not a question of major political or ideological differences. It is just that party functionaries in the upper echelons have let themselves become embroiled in the fighting that usually flares up when people display irrepressible appetites. They are squabbling not in their offices but in two popular newspapers, NEW AZERBAIJAN and SES [name as transliterated]. The former has ambition, the latter has accusations to make. Deputy General Secretary Ali Nagiyev, who, informed sources report, is the president's agent, has come under fire. He is being charged with various crimes, which, observers believe, is not that important compared with the fact that the republic's largest political organization has unexpectedly started making a show of its "internal feuding." That will hardly affect the rating of the president-general secretary. It was, after all, Heydar Aliyev's prestige and his wealth of political experience that helped to boost the image of the party itself. Admittedly it has not so far held a constituent congress, although, according to some reports, it has put together a fairly ramified mobile network of primary organizations. It has none of the "dead souls" in its ranks that are so widespread in the republic's other political organizations. It is deemed a matter of prestige to be a member of the ruling New Azerbaijan Party -- its representatives are gradually replacing former People's Front functionaries in leadership posts. There is every indication that those who have ended up unwanted are rebelling, trying to remove or compromise the general secretary's most intractable associates. Amid this hubbub a trend inherent in virtually all Azerbaijan's political organizations is clearly appearing: Following the formation of a new party the fight for power is stepped up followed by a fight for prestigious posts. By and large a trite situation that has little to do with state organizational development or ideological support for the democratic transformations in society being carried out under the "president's program." In a word, what has happened had to happen: The new party has been organizationally constituted, without however being able, contrary to expectations, to take the lead in society. That is one of the reasons for the imminent split, not proximity to and influence on the party's leader. When assessing what is happening observers discern the following important factor: The feuding is coming from outside, with the intention of weakening the ranks of Geydar Aliyev's supporters and making the party he leads a laughing stock. That is just how the "newspaper barrage" appears, disappointing the long expectations and belief that the avowed ideals are of real interest to Azerbaijanis. The party elders are making the most sensible suggestions: They have asked the general secretary to put an end to the growing strife and denunciations. However, things are being aggravated by the fact that the political commission has not met for a long time and there is no glasnost and collegiality in the executive structure's decisionmaking. Moreover, leaders who come after the general secretary in the hierarchy are sometimes unable to control their own actions and emotions, causing mass discontent among rank-and-file party members.
