It is becoming increasingly clear that most of the decisions adopted and promises made on this issue by the Republic's leadership have not been implemented, the statement said. In the words of its authors, many Supreme Soviet deputies, who pledged some time ago to free Belarusians of the Chernobyl misery, and the government failed to protect people from the Chernobyl radiation and drove the people into an economic Chernobyl, bringing them to the brink of annihilation. The party council considers it inadmissible that the authorities attempt to revise legal acts and decisions formerly adopted regarding the protection of people from the Chernobyl catastrophe and the level of social benefits. The BPP Council calls on all progressive forces to rally their efforts aimed at the survival and health of the Belarusian people on 26 April, the day of commemoration of the Chernobyl tragedy.
