FBIS4-9854 "drlat065__a94005" FBIS-LAT-93-065-A Daily Report 14 Mar 1994 ANNEX Argentina Opposition Takes Offensive on PAMI Scandal Opposition Takes Offensive on PAMI Scandal Investigation Urged 94SM0304B Buenos Aires LA NACION in Spanish 14 Mar 94 p 6--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94SM0304B Buenos Aires LA NACION Spanish CSO [Editorial: "Bribes in the PAMI"] [Text] It was with more indignation than surprise that the community received the news of the arrests of National Institute of Social Services for Retirees and Pensioners contractors who provide services under the Comprehensive Medical Assistance Plan (PAMI). The arrests came as the contractors were handing over considerable sums of money, presumably intended--according to the accusation that led to criminal charges--as payment of bribes to administrative officials in the system for the privilege of being service providers and getting patients. It is public knowledge that Councilman Anibal Ibarra of the capital was able to witness the handoff and then made the accusation before the judge. Though the judge does not yet think he has solid grounds to order the prosecution of the suspects, he has in his hands a case that should be pursued until no stone is left unturned. More or less vague and sweeping insinuations and suspicions are commonplace when it comes to the funds managed by various public agencies, and the existence of widespread administrative corruption in government is, unfortunately, a fact of life in Argentine society that is as unprovable as it is irremediable. To be sure, there are few opportunities to record a concrete, verifiable incident in the presence of a judge, and this is probably what has made the PAMI case so special. But even if the fact were irrefutably proven and a trial were to be conducted, that would say nothing about the true nature of these payments, their ultimate destination, or the goods and services received or to be received in exchange for them. That, precisely, is what the courts must clear up and what public opinion must discover. The public has viewed this case as the key that will unlock the door to finally expose the corruption and punish the perpetrators of the crimes that have been committed. In this regard, the episode appears to have been unduly publicized because of the upcoming elections, even though it is of such singular importance that it should be protected from political grandstanding and be handled according to strict judicial guidelines. No matter what the investigation reveals, however, the leadership of the agency involved bears some responsibility, whether it is proven that they were directly involved in the incident or that there were administrative shortcomings or lax controls. Furthermore, some serious ethical questions come to mind, since what is at stake are the funds that the community has allocated for meeting the needs of its weakest members, those who generally are most in need of medical care. No matter who is lining his pockets and stealing some of the funds that the workers and their employers have contributed to the PAMI, no matter what mechanism is used, substantial harm is being done to the system, and of course, to those who turn to it when they need assistance. After the initial accusation was made, implicating providers of psychiatric services and prompting a judicial investigation, other allegations were made against various entities for overcharging, billing for services that were never rendered, paying bribes, etc. Now the charges involve geriatric and dental facilities and clinics and sanatoriums all over the country, and they must be investigated as well. The situation has gotten even more complicated with Ibarra's new claim that he has been subjected to threats and a bribery attempt. The PAMI budget is more than 2 billion pesos a year, which can give rise to a lot of temptations. It is imperative that the judicial investigation be carried out to the fullest extent, without political interference of any sort, to shed light on the medical and administrative management of cases, the use of resources, and the mechanisms for contracting services for retirees. And not just for the sake of efficiency and honesty, but also because we have a moral obligation to the elderly, to whom society is still indebted.
