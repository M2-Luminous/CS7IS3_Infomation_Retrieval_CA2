Our colleague Nambaje tells us more: [Nambaje] The decision was prompted by the low level of safety following the killing of Martin Bucyana, who came from Cyimbogo, when some people started looting and burning the homes of Tutsis. Over the past three days, a man and a woman were killed and more than 20 houses were burned down. Some people are homeless, and others have fled. Last night, 50 people, mainly children, slept at Cyangugu Parish. Currently there are 70 people at the teachers' college in Mururu who fled their homes in fear. Today, Cyangugu Prefect Emmanuel Bagambiki met the inhabitants of (Tete) and (Mutongo) to consider ways of restoring peace in the two sectors, and throughout the entire Cyimbogo commune. In other sectors, such as (Muruhongo) and (Karenzo), the atmosphere is tense. [passage omitted].
