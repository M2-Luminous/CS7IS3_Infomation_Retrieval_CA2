Radojcic, age 42, from Zagreb, who was once an official of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Croatia, continues the Labrador affair, which has dragged on for two-and-a-half years now, and whose exposure, along with the Opera case, is the greatest success of the Croatian MUP [Ministry of Internal Affairs] in the intelligence war being waged continuously with the Serbian secret services. But those two affairs were at the same time, at least until Radojcic's apprehension, only the tip of the iceberg, since networks of Serbian informers were largely undetected. All of this is clearly supported by the history of Labrador itself. At the height of the fiercest aggression of the former JNA [Yugoslav People's Army] in the fall of 1991, it became obvious that essential information was "leaking" from responsible positions in the Croatian Government and that there was for certain a group that was conducting in an organized way or preparing terrorist actions in order to compromise Croatian policy and its top people. One of the most serious confirmations of the existence of such groups were the actions of bombing Mirogoj, where the graves of Jews are located, and the placing of explosives on the building of the Jewish congregation in Zagreb, which was aimed at portraying the Croatian Government to the world public as neo-Nazi. Suspicions proved to be correct, since over the period from 15 to 17 October 1991 the MUP initiated an investigation against 12 persons for what was then alleged to be "association for the purpose of hostile activity, terrorism, commando operations, and sabotage, and in order to cause public panic and insecurity." Five at Large Five of those 12 were at large (among them Radojcic), while seven were arrested (Srecko Ozegovic, Branko Trazivuk, Mile Vasiljevski...), among them both Croats and Serbs, some of them cadres "inherited" from the former regime, while others came to their positions after the change of government. The group, which came to be called Labrador from its own plan of operations, consisted of three "security" officers, four officials in the MUP department for protection of the constitutional order, one authorized official of the MUP, two from the technical services of the Croatian parliament, a former policeman from the Zagreb Police Department, and another person not employed. The group was led and inspired from Belgrade, which was also the origin of the equipment in the form of the time bombs. It was only a short time after the processing of the arrestees that the Croatian police brought in another 50 persons suspected of the same crimes. Milan Brezak, assistant minister of internal affairs, himself declared in early November that some of these people were sitting in offices next to his, and they were planning to blow up important facilities, to assassinate leading figures.... The investigation has made progress, revealing an incredibly intertwined KOS [counterintelligence service] network, which was later confirmed in a newspaper interview by Ante Nobilo, former deputy district public prosecutor in Zagreb, who said that the investigation had penetrated an increasing number of political circles, revealing new members of KOS. The Belgrade Trial However, before the investigation was concluded and the suspects thoroughly questioned, the arrestees were released, that is, exchanged, on the basis of a political assessment. Thus, further investigatory proceedings were stopped before all the KOS connections and all the informers were discovered. This assessment was later confirmed by Lt. Col. Ivan Sabolovic, who was tried in Belgrade for the bombing of Jewish facilities in Zagreb. Sabolovic said that only a part of the network was blown, since their essential structures remained untouched. Just like Sabolovic, certain other essential organizers of the KOS networks in Croatia also remained out of the reach of Croatian authorities, and this especially applies to Col. Slobodan Rakocevic, former security chief in the "JNA Air Force," who incidentally had the closest connections with the Opera group (propaganda operations), another espionage organization with the same tasks against Croatia. Nor was Slavko Malobabic, who with five other persons was one of the principal organizers of Labrador, accessible to Croatian authorities. Since Malobabic was known in Zagreb as a "man with good connections and friends" (at one time he held the position of chief of staff of Stanko Stojcevic, chief of the Croatian communists, and then the post of spokesman of the Secretariat for Internal Affairs), one of the tasks that he and Radojcic had was to bring new members into the group and expand the network. It is still a secret how successful they were in that, and how far they went in this espionage effort. Until Radojcic's recent apprehension, when, we hope, the links of this dangerous chain were completely revealed.
