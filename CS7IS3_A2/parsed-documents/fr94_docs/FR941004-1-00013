FR941004-1-00013 FR941004-1-00001 3. A new §50.66 is added to read as follows: §50.66 Requirements for thermal annealing of the reactor pressure vessel. (a) For those light water nuclear power reactors where neutron radiation has reduced the fracture toughness of the reactor vessel materials, a thermal annealing treatment may be applied to the reactor vessel to restore the fracture toughness to acceptable levels. The use of a thermal annealing treatment is subject to the approval of the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, and to the requirements in this section. The application for the Director's approval must be submitted in accordance with §50.4, and at least three years prior to the proposed date of the annealing operation. (b) Thermal Annealing Application. The content of the application for approval by the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, for thermal annealing of the reactor vessel must include: a thermal annealing operating plan that includes an evaluation of the effects of mechanical and thermal stresses and temperatures, an inspection and test program to requalify the annealed reactor vessel, and a program for demonstrating that the recovery of fracture toughness and the re-embrittlement rate are adequate to permit subsequent safe operation of the reactor vessel for the period specified in the application. (1) Thermal Annealing Operating Plan. (i) The thermal annealing operating plan must include: (A) A detailed description of the pressure vessel and all structures and components that will be affected by the thermal annealing operation; (B) The methods, instrumentation and procedures proposed for performing the thermal annealing; (C) A description of the heat source to be used; and (D) The proposed thermal annealing operating parameters, including temperatures, times, and heatup and cooldown schedules. (ii) The annealing time and temperature parameters selected must be based on projecting sufficient recovery of fracture toughness, using the procedures of paragraph (d) of this section, to satisfy the requirements of §50.60 and §50.61 for the proposed period of operation addressed in the application. In addition, the operating plan must describe any special precautions necessary to minimize occupational exposure, in accordance with the As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) principle and the provisions of §20.1206. (iii) An evaluation of the effects of mechanical and thermal stresses and temperatures on the vessel, attached piping and appurtenances, and adjacent equipment and components must demonstrate that operability of the reactor will not be detrimentally affected. A detailed thermal and structural analysis must be performed to establish the time and temperature profile of the annealing operation. These analyses must include heatup and cooldown rates, and must demonstrate that localized temperatures, thermal stress gradients, and subsequent residual stresses will not result in unacceptable dimensional changes or distortions in the vessel, attached piping and appurtenances, and that the thermal annealing cycle will not result in unacceptable degradation of the fatigue life of these components. The effects of localized high temperatures must be evaluated for degradation of the concrete adjacent to the vessel and changes in thermal and mechanical properties of the reactor vessel insulation. If the design temperature limitations for the adjacent concrete structure are to be exceeded during the annealing operation, an acceptable maximum temperature for the concrete must be established for the annealing operation using appropriate test data. (iv) The time and temperature profile evaluated as part of the annealing operating plan, and supported by the evaluation results of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, represents the proposed annealing conditions that may not be exceeded during the annealing operation. If these conditions are exceeded, then the licensee cannot certify that the annealing operation was performed in accordance with the approved application, as required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and must comply with paragraph (c)(2) of this section. (v) The projected percent recovery of both RT NDT and Charpy upper-shelf energy must be determined by the procedures described in paragraph (d) of this section, using the proposed annealing time and temperature described in the operating plan. The projected post-anneal RT NDT and Charpy upper-shelf energy must be determined from the projected percent recovery. (vi) The projected rate of reembrittlement of RT NDT must be calculated using the procedures in §50.61(c), or must be the same rate as that used for the pre-anneal operating period. The projected rate of reembrittlement for Charpy upper-shelf energy must be the same rate as that used for the pre-anneal operating period. (2) Requalification Inspection and Test Program. The inspection and test program to requalify the annealed reactor vessel must include the detailed monitoring, inspections, and tests proposed to demonstrate that the limitations on temperatures, times and temperature profiles, and stresses evaluated for the proposed annealing conditions of paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section have not been exceeded, and to determine the annealing time and temperature to be used in quantifying the fracture toughness recovery. In addition, the program must demonstrate that the annealing operation has not degraded the reactor vessel, attached piping or appurtenances, or the adjacent concrete structures to a degree that could affect the safe operation of the reactor. (3) Fracture Toughness Recovery and Reembrittlement Rate Assurance Program. The percent recovery of RT NDT and Charpy upper-shelf energy obtained by the thermal annealing treatment must be determined from the time and temperature of the actual vessel annealing. The recovery of RT NDT and Charpy upper-shelf energy provide the basis for establishing the post-anneal RT NDT and Charpy upper-shelf energy for each vessel material. Changes in the RT NDT and Charpy upper-shelf energy with subsequent plant operation must be determined using the post-anneal values of these parameters in conjunction with the projected reembrittlement rate determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. (i) The recovery of RT NDT and Charpy upper-shelf energy must be established using the procedures in paragraph (d) of this section, using the time and temperature of the actual vessel annealing. (A) If the percent recovery is determined from testing surveillance specimens or from testing materials removed from the reactor vessel, then it shall be demonstrated that the proposed annealing parameters used in the test program are equal to or bounded by those used in the vessel annealing operation. (B) If generic computational methods are used, appropriate justification must be submitted as a part of the application.
