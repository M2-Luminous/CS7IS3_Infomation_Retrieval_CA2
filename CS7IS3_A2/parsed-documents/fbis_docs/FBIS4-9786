The Mexican radio station, Radio Rey, recently announced an accord between Cuba and Mexico to refine oil from various sources in Cienfuegos. Radio Rebelde interviewed Carlos Tello in Havana on this subject: [Begin recording] [Tello] A letter of intent between the Cuban Government and the Mexican enterprise Mexpetrol has been signed. The goal is to join forces in operating Cienfuegos' fuel refinery through a joint enterprise. Work has begun to this effect. I believe that soon, very soon, we will see this enterprise in full operation. The idea is to refine oil, not always from Mexico. The refinery can handle approximately 60,000 barrels a day, refine it, and sell the product to the Cuban market with the surplus, of course, being marketed to markets abroad. [Cabada] Will its profits be divided between Mexico and Cuba? [Tello] What is divided? [Cabada] That which is accrued from the refining process. [Tello] No. The product of the refinery will be for Cuba and the surplus will be for the market abroad. [end recording]
