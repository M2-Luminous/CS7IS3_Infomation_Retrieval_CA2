"This is the result of local governments' efforts to protect the water resources," said Wang Yongrong, chairman of the Songhua and Liaohe River Valley Water Conservancy Committee under the Ministry of Water Resources. "Progress has been made in protecting the water resources of the Songhua and Liaohe Rivers, one of China's seven key water systems, alongside the rapid economic development," the chairman noted. China's water resource volume ranks sixth in the world. However, average consumption per capita in China is only one-fourth the world's average, falling in 88th place. Northeast China, where the Songhua and Liaohe Rivers flow, suffers severe shortages of water resources. The average per capita consumption of the surface water is only one-half the country's average. Northeast China consists of Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning Provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. To clean up the pollution and protect the water resources, the central government set up a leading group in charge of the protection of the Songhua River in 1978. In 1987, the group was expanded from members from Heilongjiang and Jilin Provinces and six ministries to include representatives from northeast China's provinces and one autonomous region and 12 ministries and commissions under the central government, and its jurisdiction was enlarged to cover both the Songhua and the Liaohe Rivers. Years of practice have proven such a trans-regional leading organization is effective in cleaning up and controlling pollution and protecting the water resources. A survey shows that the group has ordered 173 enterprises in the Songhua and Liaohe River valley to clean up and control pollution, involving a sum of 560 million yuan. By the end of last year, these enterprises had completed 200 projects. These projects are able to treat 309 million tons of waste water and reduce the discharge of 650,000 tons of pollutants a year into river. They earn 130 million yuan a year through recycling and re- using treated water. While helping enterprises in the Songhua and Liaoning [as received] River valley to upgrade their technology to cut the discharge of mercury into the rivers, the central government and Heilongjiang and Jilin Provincial governments have allocated special funds to make an epidemiological investigation before working out related regulations and measures to protect the rivers. According to the regulations, any organization or enterprise that violates the set limit for discharging waste water into the rivers will be fined. In addition, cities are encouraged to improve their environment and make recycled use of treated waste water. Liaoning, China's key industrial province, has launched a "water cleaning project" to protect the water resources, improve the water environment and save industrial-use water. Governments of Heilongjiang, Liaoning and Jilin Provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are taking joint efforts to monitor the water quality of the Songhua and Liaohe Rivers in winter, when water quality tends to deteriorate. They also are carrying out international cooperation and exchange in this field. Officials and experts in environmental protection of northeast China have paid a visit to Japan to learn from the latest achievement and technology in the study and treatment of mercury, and extended cooperation with the United States in treating organic pollution. They are also striving to gain international cooperation and donations for environmental protection. Yan Keqiang, deputy minister of water resources, has encouraged people in northeast China to continue their efforts to protect the water resources by saying, "we are determined to harness and protect the Songhua and Liaohe River system and all other major river systems in China."
