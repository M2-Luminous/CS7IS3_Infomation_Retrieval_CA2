The North Korean nuclear issue is a problem which we are directly concerned with, and it is a difficult problem to solve for the world as a whole. Fortunately, the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection team has entered Pyongyang to conduct official inspections. In Panmunjom, a working contact is being held for the exchange of special envoys. How do you think this problem will be solved? If it is not solved, what measure do you think will be necessary? [President Kim Yong-sam] The North Korean nuclear program should be stopped by all means. This is necessary not only for the survival of the 70 million fellow countrymen but for peace in Northeast Asia and the world. This is a problem directly connected with our survival and for peace on the Korean peninsula. Therefore, I think we should mobilize all means possible to solve this problem. Fortunately, the IAEA inspection has started. The working contact for the exchange of special envoys is being held. We cannot be too optimistic at this stage, for we have undergone numerous critical stages in our relations with North Korea. We cannot expect that everything will be settled smoothly. We will have to overcome some more critical points. However, now that North Korea is permitting the nuclear inspection, the so-called nuclear card has left the North Korean hand. I think the inter-Korean dialogue, therefore, has to make considerable progress. The United States has promised us that it will not hold the third round of high-level talks with North Korea unless there is significant progress in the exchange of special envoys. North Korea has also officially announced it will do so. What is most important at the present stage is that we are handling every matter in close cooperation with the United States. The United States has always consulted us on their contacts with North Korea. At times, the United States even halted the talks with North Korea to have time to discuss matters with us. I think what is most important to the ROK is maintaining such a close cooperative system with the United States. If the exchange of special envoys and inter-Korean dialogues proceed as we intend and North Korea's nuclear development program is hindered, we could promote relations with North Korea in various areas, including the economic sector. I think North Korea should acknowledge the fact that the ROK is in a position to actively help it improve relations with the United States. It would be foolish of North Korea to think that it can discuss this issue without the ROK. [Yi] In a recent news conference, you said that the precondition for the exchange of special envoys is holding a summit. You even said that you would meet with the North Korean president when you believed it conducive to keeping North Korea from developing nuclear weapons. When do you think it will take place? [Kim] It is hard to predict now. I will have to judge the timing by watching the development for the exchange of special envoys. [passage omitted]
