FR940922-2-00081 FR940922-2-00053 [Investigations Nos. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;720 and 721 (Preliminary)] Wheel Inserts From the People's Republic of China and Taiwan AGENCY: International Trade Commission. ACTION: Institution and scheduling of preliminary antidumping investigations. SUMMARY: The Commission hereby gives notice of the institution of preliminary antidumping investigations Nos. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;720 and 721 (Preliminary) under section 733(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1673b(a)) to determine whether there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is materially injured, or is threatened with material injury, or the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded, by reason of imports from China and Taiwan of wheel inserts, 1 provided for in subheading 8708.70.60 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, that are alleged to be sold in the United States at less than fair value. The Commission must complete preliminary antidumping investigations in 45 days, or in this case by October 31, 1994. 1 Also known as lug hole inserts or insert bushings, wheel inserts are steel, aluminum, brass, or zinc devices, usually circular in form with a round hole through the center, that are inserted through the stud holes of aluminum and alloy wheels used on automobiles, trucks, vans, buses, or trailers. The term ``wheel inserts'' does not include washers or wheel spacers, which are not inserted through a studhole. The subject wheel inserts may or may not have a surface coating and may or may not be heat-treated. The surface coating could include chrome plating, nickel plating, zinc plating (with or without wax coating), oxide coating, and powder coating. Wheel inserts are produced in a variety of sizes depending on the type of wheel and the size of the stud hole into which they are inserted; the shape of the insert interface may be spherical (called a ball seat) or conical to fit the lug nut or wheel lock which is attached to the stud.
