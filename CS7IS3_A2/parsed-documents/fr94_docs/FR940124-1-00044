FR940124-1-00044 FR940124-1-00008 In providing comments with regard to this section, the Secretary advises commenters that only the type of accrediting agency described in §602.3(b)(4) may seek a waiver of the separate and independent requirement under the law. Thus, the Secretary is precluded by statute from waiving this requirement for any other type of accrediting agency. Finally, the Secretary wishes to note that the language in §602.3(c)(2) specifying that no less than one-seventh of an agency's decision-making body must consist of representatives of the public is derived from language in the Conference Report stating that the House agrees to the requirement in the Senate bill that ``at least one out of every seven members of an accreditation association's board be members of the general public.'' Section 602.4␣Submission of Information to the Secretary by Recognized Accrediting Agencies Section 496 does not specifically address the type of information that a recognized accrediting agency must submit to the Secretary to enable the Secretary to evaluate whether the agency continues to comply with the requirements for recognition throughout its recognition period. In §602.4 (a),(b), (c), (d), and (f) of the proposed regulations, the Secretary proposes various types of information that recognized agencies must routinely submit to the Secretary during their recognition period. All of the items on the list were agreed to by the negotiators, who did not perceive them to be particularly burdensome to agencies to provide. Of particular note is the requirement in §602.4(e) that accrediting agencies must submit to the Secretary, upon request, information to assist the Secretary in resolving problems with any institution or program accredited by the agency, provided the Secretary's request does not conflict with the agency's policies on confidentiality with respect to its records on its institutions or programs. This provision reflects the agreement of negotiators. However, the Secretary has reconsidered the ``confidentiality'' aspect of this provision because of a concern that certain information that the Secretary may need to resolve a problem with a particular institution or program may not be obtainable from an agency because of its confidentiality policies. The Secretary believes this situation is untenable because it allows agencies to withhold information that the Secretary may need to carry out the Secretary's responsibilities under the Act, such as determining whether an institution or program accredited by the agency should remain eligible to participate in SFA programs. The Secretary seeks suggestions for resolving this dilemma in a manner that respects both the agency's need for confidentiality and the Secretary's need for information. The Secretary also is considering adding to this section a requirement that an accrediting agency must refer to the Department's Office of Inspector General any fraudulent activities it discovers on the part of an institution or program that it accredits, if the institution or program participates in Department programs. The Secretary invites comments on this possible additional requirement and alternative approaches to sharing information among members of the triad concerning suspected fraudulent activity by an institution or program. Subpart B_Recognition and Termination Procedures Section 496(o) of the HEA requires the Secretary to provide, by regulation, the procedures the Secretary uses for recognizing accrediting agencies. In the proposed regulations, the Secretary proposes to specify procedures for recognizing accrediting agencies in far greater detail than in current or previous regulations. The Secretary believes this greater detail is necessary to ensure that all agencies applying for recognition, as well as other interested parties, have a clear understanding of the entire process. The Secretary acknowledges that the application for recognition constitutes a significant burden on agencies seeking recognition by the Secretary. For this reason, the Secretary is considering ways to minimize the burden. One approach under consideration is to allow an agency to provide a simple statement of assurance, along with supporting documentation, that it meets certain requirements for recognition. The Secretary estimates that at least two-thirds of the requirements in the proposed regulations are amenable to this type of approach, and the resultant savings in time, effort, and cost to prepare an application for recognition would be significant. The Secretary invites comments on this approach and alternative methods for minimizing the burden on agencies of the application process without adversely affecting the Secretary's ability to conduct a thorough evaluation of the agency.
