An analysis of economic developments gave hope for that, Chernomyrdin told a reporter for Interfax before boarding a flight for Milan, on Sunday. The key economic indices showed no recession in June, he said, so that next month Russia could establish itself on a bridgehead for economic stabilization. Chernomyrdin saw financial stabilization as one of his main achievements. He felt that in conformity with government plans monthly inflation rate would not top 7 to 9 percent at the end of 1994. Action could, but would not, be taken to reduce inflation rate to zero, he said. The Chernomyrdin Cabinet assigned priority to work on the second stage of its privatization scheme, the endorsement of a final draft of the country's budget for 1994, the solution of the problem of delayed payments and an analysis of the economic developments of the first six months of 1994. It was also essential, he said, that the government move to lure more investment, including domestic, in the economy. Foreign investment was equally important, he said. On June 27 he would call a sitting of the investment policies council. The world's leading business executives had been invited to attend, he said.
