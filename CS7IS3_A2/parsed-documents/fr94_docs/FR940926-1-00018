FR940926-1-00018 FR940926-1-00008 The Quino checkerspot, is a small member of the brush-footed butterfly family (Nymphalidae). It is about 3 cm (1 inch) in length and checkered with dark brown, reddish, and yellowish spots. The Quino checkerspot is restricted to sunny openings on clay soils formed from gabbro parent materials within shrubland habitats of the interior foothills of southwestern California and northwestern Baja California, Mexico. The Quino checkerspot may have been one of the most abundant butterflies in San Diego, Orange, and western Riverside Counties during the early part of the twentieth century. Currently five to six populations remain in San Diego and southern Riverside Counties. The San Diego fairy shrimp, is a member of the Branchinectidae, a freshwater crustacean, family in the Order Anostraca (fairy shrimp). It is a small and delicate animal with large stalked compound eyes, no carapace, and 11 pairs of swimming legs. The San Diego fairy shrimp is restricted to vernal pools in San Diego County from San Marcos and Ramona south to Otay Mesa and at Valle de Palmas in northwestern Baja California, Mexico. Downingia concolor var. brevior , is a low, blue-flowered annual that is restricted to grassy meadows that are vernally wet (wet during the rainy season) with saturated soil conditions. It is restricted to the Cuyamaca Valley in the vicinity of Cuyamaca Lake, San Diego County. Limnanthes gracilis var. parishii, is a low, widely-branching annual with white flowers. There are fewer than 20 population of L. gracilis ssp. parishii in the Palomar, Cuyamaca, and Laguna Mountains and on Santa Rosa Plateau. The largest population, which includes most of the individuals, is found in the Cuyamaca Valley. These species are threatened by one or more of the following factors: grazing, habitat destruction and fragmentation from agricultural and urban development, alteration of wetlands, recreational activities, collection by lepidopterists and other human disturbances, stochastic events, exotic plants, and the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. On August 4, 1994, the Service published three rules in the Federal Register that proposed the Laguna Mountains skipper and Quino checkerspot as endangered (59 FR 39868), the San Diego fairy shrimp as endangered (59 FR 39874), and Downingia concolor var. brevior as endangered and Limnanthes gracilis ssp. parishii as threatened (59 FR 39879). In response to a formal request from William Hazeltine, environmental consultant, Oroville, California, the Service has scheduled a public hearing on Wednesday, October 19, 1994 at the Radisson Hotel, 11520 West Bernardo Court, Rancho Bernardo (North County San Diego), California. Those parties wishing to make a statement for the record should bring a copy of their statement to present to the Service at the start of the hearing. Oral statements may be limited in length, if the number of parties present at the hearing necessitates such a limitation. There are, however, no limits to the length of written comments or materials presented at the hearing or mailed to the Service. Written comments will be given the same weight as oral comments. Written comments may be submitted at the hearing or mailed to the address given in the ADDRESSES section of this notice. The comment period closes on October 31, 1994.
