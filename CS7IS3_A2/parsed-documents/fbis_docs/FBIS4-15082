The results have shaken the major election blocs. Their leaders -- Aleksandr Belyayev, former chairman of the St. Petersburg City Council and Federation Council deputy (Democratic Unity of St. Petersburg); and Viktor Kharchenko, former chief of the Baltic Shipping Company (Working St. Petersburg) -- failed to get into the City Assembly. Mr. Belyayev was unexpectedly defeated in his own constituency by Aleksandr Shchelkanov, the former first democratically elected mayor of Leningrad who ran as an independent candidate, and Mr. Kharchenko was left far behind by Sergey Andreyev, leader of the For Justice movement, known for his participation in all election campaigns in the city. As of now, Vice Mayor Vyacheslav Shcherbakov and the mayor's chief adviser Vatanyar Yagya, who are in opposition to City Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak, will sit in the new City Assembly. The representative power body of Russia's second largest city will also include the "doctors'" candidate Leonid Petrov, who swore to introduce stable bread prices; and Valeriy Selivanov, who, in addition to that, promised regulated prices for major foodstuffs. None of the blocs obtained not only a majority in the future City Assembly, but even a sufficient number of seats to produce any influence on its activity. It can be concluded that the St. Petersburg electors have in their majority voted "against moneybags," which manifested itself especially graphically in the defeat of Mr. Kharchenko and Ilya Baskin, a well-known entrepreneur from the Democratic Unity of St. Petersburg bloc. Observers are worried most by the victory of obviously fringe individuals like Mr. Andreyev (who won notoriety for forging signatures and stealing seals in all organizations where he worked initially and then registering the International Institute for Baltic Studies as a public organization in which he eventually turned out to be the sole member -- its "director"). Commentators note that the democratic forces, after the first round of the elections, hastened to take comfort in the defeat of the "Zhirinovskiy-ites", communists and nationalists, and, a result, victory went to candidates like Mr. Andreyev. It is not known how the election blocs will behave after their devastating surprise defeat. Possibly, by joining their efforts, the blocs will be able to have the election results annulled, especially given that the Mayor's Office, having ended up with only half the City Assembly, partially reminiscent of a chamber of curiosities, may not uphold the legitimacy of its decisions with its previous fervor. In any event, the City Assembly cannot start working before fall owing to a lack of a quorum, and it is not ruled out that the election blocs leaders, drawing a lesson from the mistakes of the first election round, will be able to avenge themselves at least partially in the fall race for mandates.
