FBIS4-34425 "drlat118_u_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-118 Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 French Guiana Ariane 64 Rocket Puts 3 Satellites in Orbit Ariane 64 Rocket Puts 3 Satellites in Orbit PA1706151294 Paris AFP in Spanish 1123 GMT 17 Jun 94 PA1706151294 Paris AFP Spanish BFN [Text] Kourou, French Guiana, 17 Jun (AFP) -- The European Ariane 64 rocket was successfully launched from the Kourou Space Center in French Guiana at 0407 local (0707 GMT) this morning. The rocket put into orbit three satellites, the large Intelsat-702 of the International Satellite Telecommunications Organization, Intelsat, and two British military experimental satellites, 20 and 25 minutes after launch time. This success erases the failure of Ariane 63's launch attempt on 24 January, which grounded the Arianespace Corporation's rockets for nearly five months. A former attempt at launching Ariane 64 aborted on 4 June because of a technical problem at the liftoff tower. One of the holding arms failed to separate from the launcher's third stage, and the computers prevented the rocket engines from firing up. Placed in a geostationary transfer orbit, Intelsat-702, which weighs 3,695 kg and is the second satellite in Intelsat's seventh generation, will fire up its engine in a few days, which will put it in the apogee of its orbit and directly above the Gulf of Guinea at longitude 1 degree west. The satellite will thus be incorporated into the network of approximately 20 Intelsat satellites that handle most international communications. For Arianespace, this successful launch marks the resumption of the flights suspended four months ago. The leaders of the enterprise that markets the Ariane rockets throughout the world hope to carry out 10 annual launches to win a bet that they can make 30 such launchings before 1996. The next launch is scheduled to be made on 8 July and involves a U.S. satellite, Panamsat-2, and a Japanese satellite, BS-3N. These launches are to be followed by those of the Turksat-1B and Brazilsat-B1 satellites on 30 July. After launching Ariane 64, Arianespace still has 39 satellites, worth $3.1 billion, to be put in orbit. Intelsat, headquartered in Washington, D.C., is the only satellite telecommunications operator that covers the entire planet. The corporation uses approximately 20 satellites in orbit above the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. SRTV-1A and SRTV-1B are two mini-satellites built by the United Kingdom's Defence Research Agency (DRA) for the British Defense Ministry. Those small 45-cm-wide, 45-cm-deep, and 47-cm-high cubes, which weigh 50 and 53 kg, are designed to conduct several experiments over a 12-month span involving the static charge on the satellite's outer surface, wear on new materials, new solar cells, and cosmic radiation.
