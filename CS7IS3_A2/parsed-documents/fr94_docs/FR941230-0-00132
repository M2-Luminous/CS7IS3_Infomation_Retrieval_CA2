FR941230-0-00132 FR941230-0-00021 (b) Within the framework of the regulations in this part, all decisions with respect to the appointment of Fellows will be made by the institution. However, institutions are urged to take maximum advantage of opportunities for awarding fellowships to members of underrepresented groups at the graduate level in the food and agricultural sciences, particularly minorities and women. Throughout a Fellow's tenure, the institution should satisfy itself that the Fellow is making satisfactory academic progress, and carrying out, or planning to carry out, national needs related research. If an institution finds it necessary to terminate support of a Fellow for insufficient academic progress or by decision on the part of the Fellow, the Fellow becomes ineligible for future assistance under the program. If a Fellow finds it necessary to interrupt his or her program of study because of health, personal reasons, outside employment, or acceptance of an assistantship, the institution must reserve the funds for the purpose of allowing the Fellow to resume funded study any time within a 9-month period. However, a Fellow who finds it necessary to interrupt his or her program of study more than one time cannot exceed a total of 9 months' cumulative leave status without forfeiting eligibility. For fellowships terminated because of insufficient academic progress, a decision on the part of the Fellow, or reserved due to an interrupted program of study but not resumed within the required time period, unexpended monies must be refunded. Institutions may not use unexpended monies associated with a terminated fellowship to recruit and support a ``replacement'' Fellow. (c) Only Fellows enrolled in Master's programs of study may be supported under a Master's fellowship grant. Only Fellows enrolled in doctoral programs of study may be supported under a doctoral fellowship grant. ยง3402.7 Fellowship activities. A Fellow must be enrolled as a full-time graduate student, as defined by the institution, at all times during the tenure of the fellowship in the national need area and at the degree level supported by the grant. This includes the time used for special international study or thesis/dissertation research if the international travel is funded through a special international study or thesis/dissertation research travel allowance under this grant program. However, the normal requirement of formal registration during part of this tenure may be waived if permitted by the policy of the fellowship institution, provided that the fellow is making satisfactory progress toward degree completion and remains engaged in appropriate full-time fellowship activities such as thesis/dissertation research. Fellows in academic institutions are not entitled to vacations as such. They are entitled to the short normal student holidays observed by the institution. The time between academic semesters or quarters is to be utilized as an active part of the grant period. During the period of support, a Fellow may not accept employment by the institution or any other agency. However, a grant supporting research costs of the Fellow is acceptable, exclusive of salary or wages and fringe benefits for the Fellow. ยง3402.8 Financial provisions. The basis fellowship stipend, cost-of-education institutional allowance, and special international study or thesis/dissertation research travel allowance that may be paid from grant funds will be determined by HEP contingent upon appropriations. The amount of the stipend, cost-of-education institution allowance, and special international study or thesis/dissertation research travel allowance will be cited in the program announcement in the Federal Register . An institution may elect to apply the cost-of-education institutional allowance to a Fellow's tuition and fees; however, such is not required. The allowance also may be used by an institution to defray other program expenses (e.g., recruitment, travel, publications, or salaries of project personnel). Tuition and fees are the responsibility of the Fellow unless an institution elects to use its cost-of-education institutional allowance for this purpose or elects to pay such costs out of other non-USDA monies. No dependency allowances are provided for Fellows. Stipend payments and special international study or thesis/dissertation research travel allowances will be made to Fellows by the institution, according to standard institutional procedures for fellowships and assistantships.
