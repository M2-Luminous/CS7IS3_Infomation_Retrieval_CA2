FR940407-2-00008 FR940407-2-00007 Foreign-Trade Zones Board [Order No. 689] Extension of Subzone Status; FTZ Subzone 2G Equitable Shipyards Trinity Marine Group, Inc. (Shipbuilding), New Orleans, LA Pursuant to its authority under the Foreign-Trade Zones Act of June 18, 1934, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a&hyph;81u), the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) adopts the following Order. Whereas, in 1992, the Board of Harbor Commissioners of the Port of New Orleans, grantee of Foreign-Trade Zone 2, was authorized temporary subzone status by the Foreign-Trade Zones Board for the Equitable Shipyards facility in New Orleans, Louisiana (Subzone 2G) (for a period ending April 1, 1994) (Board Order 573, 57 FR 13695, 4&hyph;17&hyph;92; Board Order 635, 58 FR 25606, 4&hyph;27&hyph;93); Whereas, in 1993, further application was made by the Board of Commissioners for an indefinite extension of said subzone status (FTZ Docket 2&hyph;93, 1&hyph;21&hyph;93; Federal Register notice invited public comment, 58 FR 7528, 2&hyph;8&hyph;93); and, Whereas, upon review, the Board has found that the requirements of the FTZ Act and Board's regulations would be satisfied, and that approval of the application for the indefinite extension of subzone status would be in the public interest if approval were given subject to the standard shipyard restriction on foreign steel mill products now in effect for the facility; Now, therefore, the Board hereby approves the application for extension of subzone status, subject to the FTZ Act and the Board's regulations, including ยง400.28, and subject to the following special conditions: 1. Any foreign steel mill products admitted to the subzone, including plate, angles, shapes, channels, rolled steel stock, bars, pipes and tubes, not incorporated into merchandise otherwise classified, and which is used in manufacturing, shall be subject to Customs duties in accordance with applicable law, if the same item is then being produced by a domestic steel mill; and, 2. In addition to the annual report, Trinity Marine Group shall advise the Board's Executive Secretary (ยง400.28(a)(3)) as to significant new contracts with appropriate information concerning foreign purchases otherwise dutiable, so that the Board may consider whether any foreign dutiable items are being imported for manufacturing in the subzone primarily because of subzone status and whether the Board should consider requiring Customs duties to be paid on such items. Signed at Washington, DC, this 29th day of March 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Import Administration, Chairman, Committee of Alternates, Foreign-Trade Zones Board.
