The source commented: We are disgusted to hear in these statements what does not fatten or satisfy hunger [Koranic verse]. We inform the public that the war being fought in our country today enters its second month, and that the forces of the DRY are steadfast, delivering successive blows against the forces of 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih on all fronts. The source said battles are currently being fought in Shabwah Governorate, hundreds of kilometres away from the Governorate of Hadramawt, which 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih only dreams of reaching. This he can do only if his forces can burrow underground until they get to Hadramawt. The source stressed that the masses of the Shabwah Governorate and our Armed Forces are supported by the masses of the Ma'rib Governorate, and that between them they are delivering successive blows against the forces of 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and are forcing them into retreat and surrender.
