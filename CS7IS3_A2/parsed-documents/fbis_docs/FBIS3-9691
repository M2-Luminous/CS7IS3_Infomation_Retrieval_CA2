The manner in which the prime minister got rid of our president, the defense minister [Janez Jansa], is such that even discussion is no longer possible. What next? Regarding certain issues, we have been in opposition so far. Now we will, of course, pursue these things even more consistently. The opposition parties do not have much scope and the same applies to us. We will shift the focus of our activity outside the parliament, in strengthening the organization, attracting new members, and forming new local organizations, and thus, preparing ourselves for the local elections that will take place at the end of this year.
