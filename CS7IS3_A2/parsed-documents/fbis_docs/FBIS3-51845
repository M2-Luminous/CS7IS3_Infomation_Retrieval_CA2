The obstacles were placed in the streets by demonstrating public transportation workers, who are staging a strike to demand a reduction in fuel prices. Trucks loaded with troops were deployed following orders from police headquarters, which received instructions from Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta, according to reliable sources. The transportation workers are surrounding those vehicles that form roadblocks along several roads. The demonstration could become violent after negotiations between government and transportation representatives have hit a stalemate. [Paris AFP in Spanish at 0243 GMT on 26 January transmits a related 155-word, Managua-datelined report that says union leader Gustavo Aguiluz has announced that "two taxi drivers were wounded by gunfire and another was beaten." After noting that 10 demonstrators have been arrested, the AFP report adds that Aguiluz "reported police excesses and asked for the Human Rights Commission to intervene." The report also says a local radio station "reported a shootout between members of different cooperative unions, but the station mentioned nothing about casualties or the reason for the clash."]
