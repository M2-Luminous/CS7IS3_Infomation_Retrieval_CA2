FR940412-0-00008 FR940412-0-00002 The petition also asked that the rule exclude from the ban the use of candidate names in titles by those committees ``that are authorized to use the candidate's name, which are engaged in activities which will not actively mislead the public or injure the candidate, or which otherwise clearly indicate that they are unauthorized.'' However, if a candidate authorizes the use of his or her name in a fundraising project, the committee becomes an authorized committee, and this rule would not apply. The phrase ``engaged in activities which will not actively mislead the public or injure the candidate'' is vague and would result in the need to determine on a case-by-case basis whether covered communications met this test. The Commission has already determined that a stronger disclaimer requirement would not be sufficient in and of itself to meet this concern. Given the wide range of options that committees continue to have regarding use of candidate names, imposing further requirements could well prove more burdensome than the present approach. The NPRM proposed that exempted titles would have to ``clearly and unambiguously [show] opposition to the named candidate by using words such as `defeat' or `oppose.''' The requirement that such specific ``triggering words'' be included in the title has been deleted from the final rule, since the Commission recognizes that certain titles, such as ``Citizens Fed Up with Doe,'' may clearly and unambiguously indicate opposition to a candidate even though no individual word in the title has that import. One commenter argued that legislative action is necessary to effectuate this change, noting that the Commission has in the past included this issue in the legislative recommendations it submits to Congress each year. However, it is well established that courts will not rely on an agency's legislative recommendation to undermine the agency's construction of a statute as authorizing it to act. The Supreme Court has stated that holding an agency's legislative recommendation against it is disfavored, because ``[p]ublic policy requires that agencies feel free to ask [Congress for] legislation,'' and this freedom to act would be chilled if such requests could later be held against them.

The Commission notes that David Duke is not currently a candidate for federal office, so the use of his name in a project title is not prohibited by these rules. Should he again become a federal candidate, such use of his name would be governed by these revised rules. Certification of No Effect Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(B) [Regulatory Flexibility Act] This final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The basis for this certification is that any small entities affected are already required to comply with the Act's requirements in this area. Also, the rule broadens the Commission's interpretation of these requirements.
