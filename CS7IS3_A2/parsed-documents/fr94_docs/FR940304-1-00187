FR940304-1-00187 FR940304-1-00015 Benefits The dollar value of direct and societal benefits derived from the proposed rule are not quantifiable, but may be substantial. According to a 1987 report published by the National Institute of Drug Abuse, drug-free individuals_ (a) Suffer fewer accidents; (b) File fewer workers' compensation claims; (c) Use less sick leave; and (d) Experience lower medical cost than drug users. Historical data is insufficient to quantify benefits. However, should this program manage to save even one life per year at $2.5 million per statistical life saved (which recent research shows is a reasonable estimate of people's willingness-to-pay for safety), its benefits would exceed its costs. If maritime accidents were reduced even by a small percentage, savings would accrue to the maritime industry through lower repair and medical costs and to the public through environmental protection. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal, if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). The costs to small entities will probably not be significant because the costs of the additional chemical testing for dangerous drugs will be borne primarily by individual applicants, and is less than $100 per occasion. Because it expects the impact of this proposal on small entities to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 15 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information Under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reviews each proposed rule that contains a collection of information requirement to determine whether the practical value of the information is worth the burden imposed by its collection. Collection of information requirements include reporting, recordkeeping, notification, and other, similar requirements. This proposal contains collection of information requirements in §§10.201, 10.202, 10.205, 10.207, 10.209, 10.805, 12.02&hyph;4, 12.02&hyph;9, 12.05&hyph;3, 12.10&hyph;2, 12.15&hyph;3, 12.20&hyph;1, 12.25&hyph;10, 16.105, and 16.220. The following particulars apply: DOT No: 2115.
