[passage omitted] If the great Islamic ummah throughout the world accepts that they have been negligent of Islam, if the world Muslims admit that they have taken the wrong road in following anti-Islamic powers, that they have erred in accepting the corrupt and beguiling culture of the west. If they own up to that, their path will be clear and they will be able to reform themselves. Global propaganda seeks to mislead nations so that they will be unable to understand what is right and what is wrong. You can see this propaganda, these scintillating global advertisements, and hear these radio broadcasts, how they try to publicize political matters, economic ideas, consumer goods, and other similar things. The Iranian nation, which succeeded in creating a resurrection in this world, which succeeded in reawakening a world, and managed to create a great transformation, this nation's main secret for achieving this success lies in its decision to alter its wrong and false route. This nation realized that pursuing the line of the oppressors and tyrants and the satanic kings is wrong and it is also wrong to remain silent before them. This nation changed course from this wrong path and as a result reached prosperity and salvation. The Iranian nation has opened a path for other world nations to follow. This path of yours is today desired, sought and pursued by all the Muslim intellectuals, and by those who have an alert conscience in the Islamic world. This is the path to salvation. The path of salvation means liberating ourselves from imposition and domination of arrogant powers. Unfortunately some Islamic countries have not found this path. Some Muslim nations have not been lucky enough to achieve this success yet. The traitorous and corrupt leaders have not allowed the nations to find their way. About the problems facing the pilgrims in the hajj rituals this year, what I can say at the moment is: I am very sorry to see that some individuals are preventing the rise of monotheism cry in the center of monotheism and next to the house of monotheism. At the moment I do not wish to say anything about the behavior of the Hijaz rulers and authorities. We are waiting to see how they are going to treat our pilgrims. Thousands of our people are there today and we are following every minute detail of their problems. We hope that they will complete their rituals, with the Almighty's help, in full comfort and health before returning home. The authorities of that place are dutybound to provide all means of comfort and health, as well as the means to allow them to perform their rights and rituals. This is their duty. We are waiting to see whether they will perform their duty toward the Iranian pilgrims fully and properly or not. May Almighty God bless this auspicious occasion in the month of Dhi al-Hajjah to all Muslims and particularly to our dear people, our great and faithful nation. [passage omitted]
