China's every action and movement is increasingly becoming the focus of worldwide attention. So to "help China understand the world, and the world to better comprehend China," a new department emerged in China three years ago, that is, the State Council Information Office--an agency to assist all major State Council departments in speaking for the State Council. Zeng Jianhui: China's External Propaganda Official Hong Kong and foreign reporters conducting interviews in mainland China have to maintain frequent contacts with this office. In media fields such as press, publication, film, TV, and broadcasting, increasing numbers of figures from outside of China's borders wish to cooperate with the relevant parties in China. They of course know that the State Council has an Information Office that is in charge of China's external propaganda. The Information Office's director is Zeng Jianhui, who is also a deputy director of the CPC Central Committee Propaganda Department and director of the Central External Propaganda Office, so is in charge of China's external propaganda policy. Early on the morning of 8 November 1993, the city of Beijing seemed particularly warm and bright. At 0830, I arrived by car at the State Council Information Office in the Asian Games Village to interview Director Zeng Jianhui. The radiant but simply attired Zeng Jianhui was somewhat alike in features and build to the well-known Hong Kong scholar and Hong Kong affairs advisor Liu Chao-chia [0491 0340 0163], with his presentation of views and style of conversation also similarly well-considered and methodical. He had had very little previous exposure, and for a figure as important as he, it was understood that this was also the first time that his life experiences were being disclosed in such detail to the outside world. Information Office Is Set Up After the "4 June Disturbance" The Information Office was established as the State Council news department after the 1989 "4 June disturbance." The State Council Information Office was founded in early 1990, with its first director being Zhu Muzhi [2612 4476 0037], who retired in March 1993, to be succeeded as Information Office director by Zeng Jianhui. China's reform, opening up, and national conditions were in great need of understanding by the outside world. To speed up China's development, it was necessary to help "China understand the world, and the world to better comprehend China." In light of the comparative backwardness and slowness of China's external media means, the control by the West of the contemporary world's crucial mass media, and the experience of the "4 June" incident, China had become even more aware of the urgency of providing accurate and rapid news to help the world understand China. While it had taken certain previous actions in this area, it had no department in special charge, and no single agency to coordinate all government departments. So it set up the State Council Information Office in early 1990 as a comprehensive administrative body and news department to objectively brief the outside world on China's key policy decisions. Zeng Jianhui disclosed that the State Council Information Office in Beijing had less than 100 employees, for a well-streamlined staff. Zeng Jianhui's two assistants, deputy directors Yang Zhengquan [2799 2973 3123] and Li Yuanchao [2621 3293 3390], were both very competent and qualified. Information Office Put in Charge of State Council Press Statements in 1993 What key tasks is the Information Office charged with? Zeng Jianhui said that they are: 1. To coordinate and expedite government-sector briefings of China's conditions to the public and the world, particularly China's advances in reform and opening up focused on the economy. As overseas and foreign figures are coming to China to gather news in increasing numbers, it is necessary to have an agency like the Information Office take charge of all aspects of coordination. All State Council departments have now installed press spokesmen, who are working in very active coordination to further overseas understanding of China and pave the media way for reform and opening up. Zeng Jianhui disclosed that beginning in 1993, the Information Office has been responsible for State Council press statements. Information Office Holds Two Press Conferences a Month, Inviting Departmental Officials To Respond to Reporters' Questions The work of the many State Council departments is varied and complex, making it hard to fully understand and promptly report on the conditions of all departments. Zeng Jianhui said that the State Council Information Office holds two press conferences a month, inviting one State Council department director each time to respond to questions of public concern. We have held 17 such press conferences, which have been attended by figures such as Li Lanqing (former MOFERT Minister and now State Council Vice Premier), Peng Peiyun (currently State Councilor and Minister in Charge of the State Family Planning Commission), Wang Zhongyu (director of the State Economics and Trade Commission), Tao Siju (Minister of Public Security), and Xiao Yang (Minister of Justice), who have responded at these press conferences to questions put by reporters from various countries. This enables all departments to serve as their own spokesmen to give all a deeper understanding of each department. Information Office Sets Up a Journalist Liaison Room 2. To take questions from reporters, the Information Office has a Journalist Liaison Room, with Information Office Deputy Director Zhao Shaohua (f) [6392 1421 5478] in charge, to serve foreign, Hong Kong Macaoan, and Taiwanese reporters. Reporters can present any questions to this Liaison Room, which will help to answer them. In helping reporters to get interviews, what is the difference between the Information Office and the All-China Journalists Association? Zeng Jianhui said that: The All-China Journalists Association is a mass organization, which can help reporters by furnishing information and solving certain practical problems; but for authoritative news within China, it is necessary to go through the Information Office; for interviews in other parts of the country, the Information Office can provide reporters better interview conditions. In the last few years, under State Council leadership, the Information Office has published "white papers" on matters such as human rights, Tibet, and Taiwan to help foreigners understand the truth. All of these "white papers" have been followed with interest by all countries. "News Coverage in China Not Increasingly Difficult, But Rather Ever Easier" Since the "Hsi Yang incident" of Hong Kong's MING PAO, it has been asked: Will news coverage in China be increasingly difficult, with ever more blockages? Zeng Jianhui stated clearly that news coverage in China will be not increasingly difficult, but rather ever easier. As long as news coverage is normal and within legal limits, China's enormous changes and all news and events will be sources that overseas reporters can cover to their heart's content. The Information Office is going to show more initiative in providing the outside world with information on China's crucial matters, by reinforcing contacts with overseas press circles. As Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 nears, exchanges between Hong Kong and the interior should become closer. Zeng Jianhui said that Hong Kong reporters are welcome to make more contacts with the Information Office. In 1994, the Information Office is likely to organize a news coverage of Bohai Wan (bay) and the great northwest, which will last about one week, and in which Hong Kong reporters are invited to take part. A Well-Supported News Specialist Zeng Jianhui is a well-supported cadre. A senior correspondent told me: "Zeng Jianhui is a genial person who does painstaking work. Despite his important position, he has no air of a high official, both keeping contact with the public, while having rich practical experience, so that he is truly a lifelong news specialist." Zeng Jiahui Is Born in Changsha, Hunan in December 1928 While Zeng Jianhui was born on 1 December 1928 in Changsha, Hunan, his ancestral home was in Pingjiang County, Hunan. Pingjiang is located in eastern Hunan, being a mountainous area where CPC guerrilla forces were active at the time. Five months after his birth, on 22 July 1928, it was there that Peng Dehuai led the famous "Pingjiang uprising," and at the end of the year led his troops into the Jinggang Mountains. The War of Resistance Against Japan (1937-1945) broke out on a full scale in 1937, with the flames of war spreading before long to the banks of the Xiangjiang River in Hunan. Zeng Jianhui was studying at the time in Hunan at the Mingde High School, which was moved in 1944 to Xiaolan'gang in rural Hengshan County. When the Japanese army invaded and occupied Hengshan in May 1944, 16-year-old Zeng Jianhui, who had just finished 10th grade, fled to Chenxi County in western Hunan. As Hunan University's temporary campus was there at the time, Zeng Jianhui attended there for a year with his older classmates, studying independently to complete his high school courses. Zeng Jianhui Takes Part in "1 December" Student Movement in Kunming, Passes Entrance Exam to Qinghua University's Department of Electrical Engineering In July 1945, Zeng Jianhui arrived in Kunming, Yunnan, by which time the examination period for Southwest Joint University (formed during the war of Beijing University, Qinghua University, and Nankai University) was over. After the War of Resistance Against Japan ended in victory on 15 August 1945, Zeng Jianhui passed the entrance exam to the last college preparatory class at Southwest Joint University. After he had completed this course, Southwest Joint University closed down, with the 1946 demobilization in Kunming bringing the restoration of Beijing, Qinghua, and Nankai universities. At that time, Zeng Jianhui was promoted to the Department of Electrical Engineering at Qinghua University. Due to his dissatisfaction with the KMT's corrupt rule and zeal for civil war, Zeng Jianhui, like many of his classmates of the time, threw himself into the Kunming student movement, taking part in the "1 December" student movement that began on 1 December 1945 in Kunming. As he was not yet a member of the CPC at the age of 17, he threw himself into the student movement only out of a sense of youthful justice. He opposed the KMT military and police siege of the campus, and its massacre and beating of striking anti-civil war professors and students. He attended with his classmates an anti-civil war public lecture on the Southwest Joint University campus in the western Kunming suburbs, where the KMT military police actually fired warning shots. Who would have guessed that the following day's KMT press would say that "last night's gunfire came from bandits in the western suburbs," turning all professors and students into a gang of bandits. This further aroused the students' righteous indignation, to the point where they announced a boycott of classes. When the KMT sent spies to break this student strike, sending armed police who beat students and actually threw hand grenades that killed four of them, Southwest Joint University students took the lead in launching the mammoth and famous "1 December" student movement among all Kunming schools, in which Zeng Jianhui was an active participant. When the war ended in victory, Zeng Jianhui moved with the Kunming demobilization to Qinghua University in Peking, studying in its Department of Electrical Engineering, where his classmates included people such as now PRC Minister of Radio, Cinema, and Television Ai Zhisheng. The KMT at the time was zealously fighting a civil war, bringing civilians extreme misery and unspeakable suffering. Peking students were against starvation and civil war, staging marches and demonstrations like a raging fire, in each of which Zeng Jianhui took an active part. This gave him more opportunities to ponder the status quo of the society, from which considerations he searched out a new path and took action in response. In 1948, Zeng Jianhui finally joined the CPC underground party, at which time he was the editor of the Peking semimonthly ZHONGJIAN sponsored by progressive professors at Beijing and Qinghua universities. Zeng Jianhui Begins General Information Office Work, in Charge of External Propaganda Peking was peacefully liberated at the end of 1948. As broadcasting personnel were treated very well at the time, and the newly established New China Broadcast Station (the predecessor of the Central People's Broadcast Station) needed someone who knew English, it chose Zeng Jianhui, who was fluent in English, as an assistant editor of its English broadcast section, which responsible department was also the predecessor of the New China News Agency's Foreign Affairs Department. In the more than four decades since, Zeng Jianhui has always been in charge of external propaganda, taking part in foreign affairs work. After the founding of the PRC in October 1949, PRC officials paid great attention to press work, setting up the General Information Office. The General Information Office was under the charge of Hu Qiaomu [5170 0829 2606], under which was the International Press Bureau, whose director was Qiao Guanhua [0829 0385 5478], with the New China Broadcast Station's English broadcast department being subordinate to this bureau, to become the International Press Bureau's news agency, which was specially charged with the New China News Agency's external news releases. Zeng Jianhui was an assistant editor at the news agency of the General Information Office's International Press bureau. In 1951, the General Information Office was dismantled, with Zeng Jianhui being reassigned to the New China News Agency's Foreign Affairs Department, starting as a secretary and moving up to editor and correspondent, with his work being to write the English texts of external broadcasts. In 1952, during the Korean War ceasefire negotiations, Zeng Jianhui was ordered to lead a group of correspondents to North Korea to report on prisoner repatriation, where he wrote his famous news dispatch entitled "POWs Did Not die on the March." From the mid-1950s to the 1966 Cultural Revolution, he was one of the few New China News Agency's political foreign affairs correspondents allowed to cover the news within Zhongnanhai. He was already very well known in press circles, having been promoted to director of the New China News Agency's Foreign Affairs Correspondents Group. During the Cultural Revolution, he was put out of the way for a time, allowed to do only in-office translation work, while also spending a few months at a cadre school in Fangshan County. As English writing and news coverage talent was needed at the time, and he had outstanding competence in this field, he was reassigned during the latter part of the Cultural Revolution to the New China News Agency's General Editorial Room as an assistant editor-in-chief, taking part many times in covering the news of meetings by Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai with foreign heads of state and important guests. Zeng Jianhui Twice Leads Delegations To Cover Major International Sports Competitions Zeng Jianhui has also led delegations twice to cover major international sporting events. In 1978, when he was assistant editor-in-chief at the New China News Agency, Zeng Jianhui led a large delegation of Chinese correspondents to Thailand to cover the Bangkok Asian Games. In 1984, when the Olympic Games were held in Los Angeles, Zeng Jianhui also led a delegation of Chinese correspondents to cover them, by which time he was a deputy director of the New China News Agency. Zeng Jianhi Promoted to Deputy Director of Central Propaganda Department in 1988 In May 1982, Zeng Jianhui was promoted to deputy director of the New China News Agency, in charge of external propaganda and particular editorial room work. Then in 1988 he was promoted to deputy director of the CPC Central Committee Propaganda Department, while still serving concurrently as deputy director of the New China News Agency. By 1992, as he had too many affairs to manage, he finally left his post at the New China News Agency. Zeng Jianhui Takes Over as Information Office Director in March 1993 Zeng Jianhui's current key post is director of the State Council Information Office, which is not only a key post at the ministerial level, but also can be called the PRC State Council's mouthpiece.
