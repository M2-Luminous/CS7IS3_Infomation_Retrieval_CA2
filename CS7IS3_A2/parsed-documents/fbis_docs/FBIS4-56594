He says that, although he had noted in an interview he had given in March that a split was possible, the risk disappeared when the party united behind its opposition to the IMF agreement and the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility. Arce affirms that Sandinist factions also agree that the Sandinist Assembly is the party's highest authority between congresses and that candidates for the new National Directorate will come from the Assembly, which will be elected at the congress. The congress will also elect the secretary general and deputy secretary general, who will be chosen from the National Directorate. Arce believes out that fear of "caudillismo" will be laid to rest by "a clear definition of functions and collegial handling of responsibilities."
