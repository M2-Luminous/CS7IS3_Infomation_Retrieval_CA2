FR940418-1-00021 FR940418-1-00005 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [UT4&hyph;1&hyph;5628 and UT2&hyph;1&hyph;5441; FRL&hyph;4875&hyph;1] Approval and Promulgation of State Implementation Plans; Utah Stack Height Analyses and Regulations AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Governor of Utah submitted two revisions to the Utah State Implementation Plan (SIP): Section 16, Stack Height Demonstration, and Section 9, Part B, Sulfur Dioxide. Sections 16 and 9 were submitted in letters dated December 23, 1991, and May 15, 1992, respectively. The revisions to Section 16 were to address the stack-height demonstration requirements for the Kennecott Minerals Company Smelter near Magna, Utah. Minor corrections to the other stacks in the State were also made. Section 9, Part B was revised to be consistent with Section 16. Prior to the revision, the SO 2 attainment demonstration for Salt Lake County and portions of Tooele County was based on multipoint rollback emission rates at the Kennecott smelter. The PM 10 SIP adopted for Salt Lake County in 1991 established significantly lower emission rates (which would meet the 24-hour National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for the smelter based on reasonable available control technology (RACT). Section 16 and Section 9, Part B needed to be consistent with the PM 10 SIP (the PM 10 SIP is located in Section 9, Part A). In addition, Section 9 Part B was revised to include an analysis and the emission limitation that would demonstrate attainment of the 3-hour secondary NAAQS. DATES: Comments must be received on or before May 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be addressed to: Douglas Skie (ART_AP) Air Programs Branch, EPA Region VIII, 999 18th St., suite 500, Denver, Colorado 80202&hyph;2466. Copies of the documents relevant to this proposed action are available for public inspection between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, at the following office: Environmental Protection Agency, Region VIII, Air Programs Branch, 999&hyph;18th Street, suite 500, Denver, Colorado 80202&hyph;2466. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lee Hanley, Air Programs Branch, Environmental Protection Agency, Region VIII, 999&hyph;18th Street, suite 500, Denver, Colorado 80202&hyph;2466, (303) 293&hyph;1760. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background A. Regulatory History On February 8, 1982 (47 FR 5864), EPA promulgated final regulations limiting stack height credits and other dispersion techniques as required by section 123 of the Clean Air Act (CAA). These regulations were challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit by the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, Inc., the Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in Sierra Club v. EPA, 719 F.2d 436 (DC Cir. 1983). On October 11, 1983, the court issued its decision ordering EPA to reconsider portions of the stack height regulations, while upholding other portions. As a result, EPA promulgated revisions to the stack height regulations on July 8, 1985 (50 FR 27892). The revisions redefined a number of specific terms including ``excessive concentrations,'' ``dispersion techniques,'' ``nearby,'' and other important concepts, and modified some of the bases for determining good engineering practice (GEP) stack height credit. Pursuant to Section 406(d)(2) as amended in the 1977 CAA, each state was required to: (1) Review and revise its SIP, as necessary, to include provisions that limit stack height credit and other dispersion techniques in accordance with the revised regulations; and (2) review all existing emission limitations to determine whether any of these limitations have been affected by stack height credits greater than GEP, or any other dispersion techniques. For any limitations so affected, each state was to prepare revised limitations consistent with the revised stack height regulation. Subsequently, EPA issued detailed guidance on carrying out the necessary reviews. For the review of emission limitations, each state was to prepare an inventory of stacks greater than 65 meters in height and sources with emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) in excess of 5,000 tons per year (tpy). These limits correspond with the de minimis stack height and the de minimis SO 2 emission level provisions in the regulations. These sources were then subjected to detailed review for conformance with the revised federal regulations. State submissions were to contain an evaluation of each stack and source in the inventory.
