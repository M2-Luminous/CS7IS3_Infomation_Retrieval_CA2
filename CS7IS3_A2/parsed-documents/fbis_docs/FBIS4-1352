No casualty figures for these clashes, which were confirmed by the progovernment newspaper L'ESSOR, were available. The fighting is between elements of the Popular Movement of the Azaouad [MPA] and the Revolutionary Army for the Liberation of Azaouad, both signatories to the 11 April 1992 national peace pact between the Mali Government and the Tuareg movements, the same sources added. An initial clash between these two factions on 25 February cost the life of Colonel Bilal Saloum, one of the artisans of Tuareg integration into the Army and an MPA leader. A meeting between the Malian Government and Tuareg representatives held in Tamanrasset, Algeria, from 16 to 20 April, failed over the issue of integrating former fighters into the Army.
