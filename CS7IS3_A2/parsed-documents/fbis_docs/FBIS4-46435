On Saturday a group of fishermen discovered the bodies of pro-Kurdish businessman Savas Buldan and two of his colleagues, Haci Koray and Adnan Yildirim near the Melen river in the Yigilca township of Bolu province. The three had been shot in the back of the head. Police sources said the three had also been tortured and were without identification papers when found. Relatives identified the bodies which were brought to Istanbul on Sunday. Buldan was a wealthy Istanbul businessman who is in the hotel and restaurant business. He comes from the township of Yuksekova in the southeastern province of Hakkari. His colleagues Koray was also from Yuksekova while Yildirim came from the township of Lice in Diyarbakir province. Buldan's brother Necdet Buldan is the former mayor of Yuksekova and belongs to the pro-Kurdish Democracy Party (DEP). The killings follow the killing of Muhsin Melik and his driver in the southeastern provincial center of Urfa by four or five unidentified persons. Melik is the founder of the People's Democrat Party (HADEP), a new pro-Kurdish party set up to eventually replace DEP. Melik was the former provincial chairman of DEP. Before his death Melik reportedly told his brother that he had been shot by plainclothes policemen just outside his office. Melik allegedly shot and wounded one of his assailants. The governor of Urfa said two persons were in custody related to the murder. Buldan and his two companions were allegedly taken into custody by a group of policemen outside Istanbul's Cinar Hotel. The persons who apprehended them reportedly showed their police identification cards and then took them away in unmarked cars, according to the personnel of the Cinar Hotel who witnessed the incident. The death of Buldan was the latest in a chain of murders committed against persons who allegedly have links with Kurdish separatist militants. The first case concerned pro-Kurdish underground figure Behcet Canturk and his driver Recep Kuzucu who were found murdered near the Sapanca section of the Istanbul-Ankara highway. Canturk was also from the Lice township. Later the body of Canturk's lawyer Yusuf Ziya Ekinci was found near Ankara's Golbasi district in February. He had been killed by seven bullets. In March another prominent figure from Lice, contractor Fevzi Arslan, and his brother Sahin were kidnapped at gun point in their Aksaray office in Istanbul and their bodies were later found on the Istanbul-Ankara highway. Buldan was previously taken into custody in 1992 when police raided his house in Istanbul and discovered he was hosting DEP Diyarbakir Deputy Leyla Zana, her husband Megdi Zana and seven other people who were allegedly linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). There were claims that Buldan had provided PKK with guns and financial aid. He was later released. Conservative Turkish papers claimed Buldan may have been killed by the mafia because of drug trafficking. Pro-Kurdish daily Ozgur Ulke, however, pointed the finger at Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and said the prime minister had warned on November 4, 1993 that the government has information about businessmen and other personalities who give extortion money to the PKK and had threatened to "make them pay." The paper claimed Ciller was now making the businessmen "pay." Ozgur Ulke quoted former National Intelligence Organization (MIT) member Professor Mahir Kaynak as saying "the murders were planned by those who had provided the list of pro-Kurdish businessmen to the prime minister." Kaynak also said the murders were being planned and carried out by those in the State cadres who do not want a political solution to the Kurdish problem. The Turkish Daily News learnt that at first police had confirmed Bulan and his friends had been taken into custody but later denied this. The Bulan family members reportedly had some sources inside the police and they alleged that they were told "do not follow up your complaints." Buldan's brother contacted Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin who allegedly told him "this matter is way above my head." Meanwhile, in Ankara DEP officials charged also that Muhsin Melik was killed by police in Urfa. DEP Acting Chairman Remzi Kartal said the police were at the scene of the incident only two minutes after Melik was shot. Melik was then wounded and refused to get into the police car saying "you are the people who shot me." Kartal said eye witnesses identified the license plate of the car used in the murder of Melik as 06 ED 246. It was a white Renault Broadway. He claimed a similar car was seen being driven into the Urfa police headquarters the same day carrying a wounded person. Kartal claimed "those who oppose state policies are either silenced or eliminated."
