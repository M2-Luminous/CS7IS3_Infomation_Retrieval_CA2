Director of Prisons Dora Bracho de Briceno has confirmed this when asked about the current situation of the country's (?32) jails, which house approximately 25,000 inmates. In that regard, she said that her office has instructed the National Guard to adopt the necessary emergency measures in all of the country's jails to prevent a repetition of the recent incidents in Maracaibo. She added that the situation in Ciudad Bolivar Jail--where inmates began a hunger strike, demanding better conditions--is under control; finally, she said that what occurred in Sabaneta should be a lesson for the government and society. [Begin Bracho de Briceno recording] There are five types of inmates, all under one roof. This is what has caused the current situation; in addition, there is only one jail for the entire state, which is inadmissible due to the large distances between one place to the other. In certain cases inmates must travel eight, nine, or 10 hours to appear before a court; an example of this is Santa Barbara de Zulia, where there are 115 prisoners. [end recording] Bracho de Briceno will travel to Maracaibo today to assess the situation at the Sabaneta Jail. It was also learned that the National Guard has been instructed to adopt emergency measures in all of the country's jails to prevent a similar tragedy.
