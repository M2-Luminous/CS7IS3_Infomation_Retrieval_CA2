Jordan, al-Masri said, stands for the unity of the Yemeni people and their country. In a letter replying to one from Mr. Anis Hasan Yahya, a member of the Yemeni House of Representatives, al-Masri noted that, toward that end, Jordan's political leadership has done all it could. Jordan, al-Masri's letter went on, will pursue urgent efforts and consultations with our country's political leadership, as well as with brother Arabs, and explore avenues to bring the fighting to an end. Jordan's moves will be based on its conviction in the cause of the unity of the Yemeni people and territory, the letter said. The house speaker had received a message from Mr. Yahya seeking the Jordanian House of Representatives' good offices to bring the hostilities to a halt and end the dispute in brotherly Yemen.
