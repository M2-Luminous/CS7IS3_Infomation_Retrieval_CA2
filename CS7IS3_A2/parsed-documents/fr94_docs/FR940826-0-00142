FR940826-0-00142 FR940826-0-00020 139. Petitions. NTCA and USIN request that we amend the small business definition so that it can be flexibly modified in the context of a particular service. NTCA and USIN advocate that such flexibility is appropriate because the existing $6 million net worth/$2 million net income test is too low to reflect the capital-intensive nature of the broadband PCS business. NTCA asserts that most telephone companies are unable to meet this test even though they have few subscribers and few employees. USIN states that the current definition discriminates against small rural telephone companies, and that the proper measure for small businesses in capital-intensive service is those with annual revenues of less than $100 million. 140. Discussion. We agree with NTCA. In the Second Report and Order we relied on the Small Business Administration's (SBA) standard definition. The SBA definition permits an applicant to qualify for financial assistance based on a net worth not in excess of $6 million with average net income after Federal income taxes for the two preceding years not in excess of $2 million. 182 The record in this proceeding reflected broad disagreement about the appropriate definition of small businesses. Many commenters, including the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the SBA, argued that the SBA net worth/revenue definition was too restrictive and would exclude businesses of sufficient size to survive, much less succeed, in the competitive wireless communications marketplace. The SBA's Chief Counsel for Advocacy and Suite 12 Group advocated adoption of a revenue test, arguing that a net worth test could be misleading as some very large companies have low net worth. The SBA's Chief Counsel recommended that the revenue standard be raised to include firms that (together with affiliates) have less than $40 million in revenue. The SBA Chief Counsel suggested that the Commission consider a higher revenue ceiling or adopt different size standards for different telecommunications markets. 183 182 13 CFR 121.802. 183 Some parties recommend using the SBA's 1500 employee standard. See, e.g., comments of SBA Associate Administrator for Procurement Assistance at 2, CFW Communications at 2, and Iowa Network at 17. A number of other commenters argue, however, that adoption of this alternative SBA definition would open up a huge loophole in the designated entity eligibility criteria. Specifically, they contend that telecommunications is a capital, rather than labor, intensive industry, and that an entity with 1,500 employees is likely to be extremely well capitalized and have no need for the special treatment outlined by Congress in the Budget Act. See, e.g., comments of LuxCel Group, Inc. at 4, Suite 12 Group at 10&hyph;11. 141. Other parties indicated that the definition used by the Commission might impede the ability of small businesses to raise capital in anticipation of auctions. They noted that many small firms are soliciting investors to enable these firms to compete better in auctions, and argued that their designated entity status should not be jeopardized as a result. Thus, these commenters suggested, if the FCC adopts the SBA's net worth standard, the net worth valuation should relate back to the date of the PCS Final Report and Order (September 23, 1993). 142. In contrast, several commenters argue that the small business definition must be made more restrictive in order to prevent large firms from spinning off companies to compete as designated entities. In this regard, some parties recommend limiting provisions to those small businesses that were in existence for the previous two years. 143. In the Second Report and Order, we adopted the existing SBA net worth/net income size standard as the generic threshold for small businesses to qualify as designated entities because at that time we were unable to conclude that the other proposals suggested by commenters were superior to this established standard. However we acknowledged that for certain telecommunications industry sectors this standard may not be high enough to encompass those entities that require the benefits, but also have the financial wherewithal to construct and operate the systems. Accordingly, we indicated that this ``threshold could be adjusted upward on a service-by-service basis to accommodate such situations.'' We also noted that we may modify the small business definition if the SBA changed its definition or the Commission determined that an alternative definition was more appropriate for capital intensive services. 144. In this regard, in the Fifth Report and Order we revised the definition of a small business set forth in the Second Report and Order to include entities with up to $40 million in gross revenues, and we provided that these small businesses would permit to pool their resources and form consortia to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks or to receive other small business benefits. We also adopted rules that allow small businesses and businesses owned by women and/or minorities to raise capital by selling passive ownership interests in their companies. Thus, for example, under certain conditions, businesses owned by women and minorities have the option of taking on one large passive partner (holding up to 49.9 percent of the enterprise) or selling a greater portion of their companies' equity (up to 75 percent of the equity) to passive investors in smaller increments. Either of these structures should enhance the ability of these entities to obtain the necessary funding to meet long-term construction, operation and expansion goals. 184 184 See Fifth Report and Order at ¶185. 145. Given the diversity of services that may be subject to competitive bidding and the varied spectrum costs and build-out requirements associated with each, we conclude that it is more appropriate to define the eligibility requirements for small businesses on a service-specific basis, taking into account the capital requirements of each particular service in establishing the appropriate threshold. Therefore we will amend our generic auction rules to replace the small business definition with a provision enabling the Commission to establish a small businesses definition in the context of each particular service. V. Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 146. Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. §604, the Commission's final analysis is as follows: A. Need for, and Purpose of, this Action 147. As a result of new statutory authority, the Commission may utilize competitive bidding mechanisms in the granting of certain initial licenses. The Commission published an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, see generally 5 U.S.C. §603, within the Notice of Proposed Rule Making in this proceeding, and published a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis within the Second Report and Order (at ¶¶299&hyph;302). As noted in these previous final analyses, this proceeding will establish a system of competitive bidding for choosing among certain applications for initial licenses, and will carry out statutory mandates that certain designated entities, including small entities, be afforded an opportunity to participate in the competitive bidding process and in the provision of spectrum-based services.
