FR940630-0-00031 FR940630-0-00010 ␣ 1Paragraph 1Description (b)(1)(ii) Training in cardio-pulmonary resuscitation for employees at fixed work locations. (d), except for (d)(2)(i) and (d) (2) (iii) Control of hazardous energy sources (generation installations). (e)(2) Enclosed space training. (j)(2)(iii) Cleaning, repair, and testing of live-line tools. (m) Deenergizing transmission and distribution installations for the protection of employees. (o), except for (o)(2)(i) High-voltage and high-power testing and test facilities. The remaining requirements for which EEI requested delay are those that it claims will need additional consultation with OSHA so that employers will know exactly what is required by the standard. Because the standard is written in terms of performance, rather than in terms specifying the means of compliance, employers are given flexibility in meeting the standard. However, sometimes it may not be clear whether or not a given method will comply with an individual provision. For example, employers will likely need more time to identify the types of clothing that will be acceptable under §1910.269(l)(6)(iii). Therefore, OSHA is staying the enforcement of the following paragraphs of §1910.269 until November 1, 1994: ␣ 1Paragraph 1Description (1)(6)(iii) Clothing worn by employees working on or near exposed energized parts. (n)(3) Equipotential zone for protective grounding. (n)(4)(ii) Impedance of protective grounding devices. (n)(6)1 Order of connection of grounds. (n)(7)1 Order of removal of grounds. (n)(8) Additional precautions for protective grounding. (r)(1)(vi) Line-clearance tree trimming during and after storms and other emergencies. 1Only with respect to lines and equipment operating at 600 volts or less.
