FR940616-0-00038 FR940616-0-00009 7. In particular, Fireweed Communications Corp. 6 (Fireweed) argues that the regulatory fees impose an unfair and confiscatory financial burden on broadcast stations in small markets, and impinge on the constitutional right of freedom of speech of Fireweed and its listeners. Fireweed contends that the financial burden imposed by the regulatory fee would cause it to reduce its programming or even to cease its operations. The Joint Commenters, consisting of several cable television interests, 7 argue that we have authority to modify the Fee Schedule for FY 1994, to add classes of services that Congress did not include in section 9(g)'s fee schedule. In addition, the Joint Commenters assert that the Commission is authorized to modify the fee schedule for FY 1994 because section 9(b)(3), which governs permissive adjustments to the fee schedule, including addition of services to the schedule, does not restrict our authority for making changes to fiscal years after 1994. In particular, the Joint Commenters contend that Direct Broadcast Satellite, if available later this fiscal year, Instructional Television Fixed Service, if used for commercial purposes, and Multi-channel Multipoint Distribution Services, because it is not expressly enumerated as a service subject to the fee requirement, should be added to the fee schedule and assessed a fee for FY 1994. The Joint Commenters also assert that adopting a fee requirement for these services in this proceeding will avoid the necessity for immediately initiating a new rulemaking to include these services in the fee schedule for FY 1995 and thereafter. 6 Fireweed filed its comments late. It argues that the Commission failed to provide proper notice to interested parties and asserts that we failed to publish the NPRM ``in publications likely to be obtained by small entities'' or to ``conduct open conferences and public meetings'' concerning our proposals as provided in 5 U.S.C. ยง609 (2) and (4). However, section 609 requires only that we ``assure that small entities have been given an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking'' through means ``such as'' those enumerated in section 609. 5 U.S.C. ยง609. We have met that requirement. The NPRM was published and distributed pursuant to section 1.412 of our rules and was distributed to over 100 members of the trade press, newspapers, wire services, broadcasters, and magazines, including those dealing with consumer, minority and small business issues. In addition, the Commission's Daily Digest, which included notice of the NPRM, was published on Internet. We will also accept and give full consideration to the arguments in Fireweed's comments even though they were untimely filed. Further, we will accept the late filed comments of MCI Telecommunications Corporation. 7 The Joint Commenters are Blade Communications, Inc., Cablevision Industries Corp., Crown Media, Inc., Multivision Cable TV Corp., Parcable, Inc., Providence Journal Company, Sammons Communications, Inc., and Star Cable Associates. 8. Other parties including Sprint, the Cellular Telephone Industry Association (CTIA), Comsat, and the Utilities Telecommunications Counsel (UTC), support our conclusion in the NPRM that Congress intended that the Schedule set forth in section 9(g) would govern the assessment and collection of fees for FY 1994. UTC states that Congress' inclusion in section 9(g) of the fee schedule, as well as other language in the Act, clearly demonstrates that Congress did not intend that the Commission revise the fee schedule so soon after its enactment. 9. We are not persuaded by the arguments urging a reduction in the statutory fees or amendment of the service categories subject to the regulatory fees. In the NPRM, we concluded that Congress did not intend that we change the amounts or the services established by the statutory fee schedule for 1994. Our conclusion is supported by the Conference Report, which states that we have authority to review and adjust the fees after one year. 8 Congress also enacted the fee schedule after reviewing information that we provided concerning the services subject to the fees. We do not believe that Congress would have enacted section 9(g) intending that we immediately amend the service classifications or fee amounts in its schedule. 8 H.R. Rep. No. 213, 103 Cong., 1st Sess. 499 (1993) (Conference Report). 10. In addition, other provisions of section 9 support our interpretation. Section 9(i) requires that, before making adjustments to the services included in the fee schedule, we must develop accounting systems and provide an opportunity for public comments on proposed cost allocations. NPRM para. 9. Section 9(b)(4)(B) requires that any amendment to the services contained in the statutory fee schedule not be effective until 90 days after Congress is notified of those revisions. See 47 U.S.C. 159. As a practical matter, the Commission could not possibly meet these requirements in time to permit section 9 fee collections in FY 1994. Given these statutory requirements, we conclude that Congress did not intend that we make any changes to the services subjected to the regulatory fee requirement or the amounts contained in the schedule for FY94. 9 9 In view of our conclusion that Congress did not intend us to make any changes to its Schedule of Fees for FY 1994, we will not at this time assess fees on lifetime restricted radiotelephone and radio operator applicants and permittees.
