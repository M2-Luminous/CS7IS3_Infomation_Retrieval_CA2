High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Ron Redmond, said on Tuesday that the situation in the regions of Banja Luka and Prijedor (northern Bosnia-Herzegovina) has stabilized since last week but that UNHCR was concerned about the fierceness of fighting around Gorazde (eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina). The tragic events in Prijedor (northwest Bosnian Serb Republic) which killed 16 civilians, mostly Moslems, between March 29 and April 1, broke out after the Moslem army delivered six massacred Serb bodies to the Prijedor authorities. The representatives of the local authorities and the ruling Serb Democratic Party (SDS) strongly condemned these murders on Tuesday. The enquiry conducted so far showed that many persons had participated in the killings and that they were committed for gain, while the Prijedor police underscored that they would persist with solving of each particular case. Redmond set out that UNHCR was concerned about the development of the situation in Gorazde where heavy fighting was going on, and said that according to the latest U.N. report from Gorazde no UNHCR convoy had been allowed to enter the town since March 22. U.N. Security Council President Colin Keating said on Monday that UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] statements showed that the Moslems had provoked the latest fighting with Serbs in Gorazde. The heavy Moslem offensive on Serb positions and villages was launched from Gorazde in late March, although the town should have been demilitarized as a U.N. protected area last spring. Over 10,000 Moslem troops are engaged in the operations. After signing the Washington Agreement to form a Moslem-Croat Federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina in March, the Moslems launched an all-out offensive on the Bosnian Serb Republic in an attempt to gain as much territory as possible before the resumption of the peace talks.
