[Vranitzky] The more difficult a political issue is, the more levelheaded the statesmen have to be. I have heard that [Czech Prime Minister] Mr. Klaus said today that the decision in favor of Temelin is a decision by the sovereign Czech state, and Prague is not willing to accept any interference in its sovereignty. The point, however, is that this is not a question of sovereignty. The sovereignty of the Czech Republic is as undisputed as is Austria's. The real point is that if an accident were to occur, a nuclear power plant, particularly one that is so close to the Austrian state border, is not only a risk for the sovereign Czech Republic, but also a risk for the people who live in the neighboring countries. This is why I have been trying hard for years to make people carefully reconsider the completion or the construction of any new nuclear power plants and to look for alternatives in terms of energy policy. Moreover, Mr. Klaus said that we Austrians always henpeck the Czech Republic and not, for example, Germany or Switzerland. This is not true. We are not happy about any nuclear power plant in our neighborhood. Yet, the half-completed or completed nuclear power plants in the Czech and Slovak Republics all use Russian technology. Besides, one must not forget the terrible accident at Chernobyl, that is to say a nuclear power plant built with Russian technology, where the radiation did not respect sovereign borders, but affected large parts of East and Central Europe. [Hochner] Chancellor, Prague's "no" will certainly hamper Austrian efforts. In the debate in the Austrian Parliament today, deputies complained to you that the Austrian Federal Government was not fighting hard enough against the construction of Temelin, and that, for example, you were not ready to address the U.S. Congress in connection with that credit guarantee, that is to say, to go to the United States. [Vranitzky] Based on what you have just asked me, one must say that the decision was taken in Prague, or at least people say that it was taken in Prague. It means that our problem with the Czech Republic is one issue. Since the Czechs will not finance this power plant alone, but rely on a major credit from the American Eximbank, the United States constitutes another factor. I do, however, take the accusations that were brought up in today's debate in Parliament only relatively serious. After all, had my efforts and the efforts of the Austrian Federal Government so far not had any effect, then Mr. Klaus would not have come up with this rather strong statement today. By way of summing up, I would say that the whole matter can, of course, be decided by the Czechs as a sovereign people. At the same time, it is a subject where, in my capacity as Austrian chancellor, it is my duty not only to respect sovereignty, but also to take into account the fears and interests of the Austrian population, and to take them seriously. Therefore, we will certainly initiate a new round of efforts, and we will voice our reservations -- our reservations in terms of economic, ecological, and energy policy -- in the United States, where this major credit might be granted in the near future; yet, we will certainly also -- even though, Mr. Klaus has described that as pure dreams or daydreams -- renew Austria's offers, Austria's many offers in terms of energy and industrial policy. I am fully aware that success cannot be achieved overnight in this major and most important issue. Yet what is at stake are vital interests of the Austrian and also the Czech population, and I will certainly not accept today's declaration as the last word and lie back and say that nothing can be done. [Hochner] Chancellor, the Temelin power plant is to be refitted with U.S. technology, which explains the U.S. credit. Some power plants in Austria's neighborhood are much more dangerous, such as the old Russian reactors in Bohunice, or the old Russian reactors in Paks, near Budapest, not to mention the 15 Chernobyl-type reactors that are still operating. Would the money for Austria's security and the political impetus not be better invested if one could shut down these old and notoriously dangerous power plants with Austrian help? [Vranitzky] We must not make the mistake now to forget all the others issues and problems only because we are discussing Temelin today. Of course, everybody knows that we are engaged in a very serious debate with the Slovak Government regarding the Bohunice power plant. And everybody who takes an interest in such issues also knows that were are negotiating with the Slovene Government about shutting down the Krsko nuclear power plant, which is located in an earthquake zone, and that we have presented our ideas and reservations to all those states, even though it was not just reservations, but also offers for developing alternatives and cooperating with us to build state-of-the-art power plants that are not based on nuclear fission. We are always told that, for example, in northern Czechia there are so many hazardous coal-fired plants, which have led to chronic lung and eye diseases among children and adults, that the nuclear power plants are needed to shut down the old coal-fired power plants. Moreover, only because the matter was raised today, nobody must think that this is a new discussion or that we are just reacting to a single case. No, we are the only government in all of Europe -- and I am the only government head -- that has dealt with these dangers. Our efforts are not supported by the others, as we can see in the countries that operate those power plants or those who want to build them. However, this does not stop me from tackling the issue again and again. Even if somebody describes our efforts as daydreaming or utopian, it was always through utopian ideas that mankind achieved progress. [Hochner] Thank you very much, chancellor, and good night. [Vranitzky] Thank you, good night.
