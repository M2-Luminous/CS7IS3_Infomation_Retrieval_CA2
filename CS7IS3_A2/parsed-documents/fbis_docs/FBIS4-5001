He stated: "A jet belonging to the U.S. Kadena Air Base crashed during exercises into the Miyamori Elementary School in Ishikawa City 35 years ago. The accident killed 17 people, including 11 school children, and injured 121. Having experienced a tragic accident in the past, we cannot look on the latest crash nonchalantly. We will file a strong protest against the U.S. forces and the Japanese Government, and will strongly demand they take carefully thought-out measures to prevent similar accidents." The Ishikawa City Government intends to send letters of protest about the accident to ten officials, including the prime minister, the ambassador to the United States, the airbase commander, and the prefectural governor.
