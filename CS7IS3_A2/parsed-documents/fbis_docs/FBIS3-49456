It seemed that Visegrad would change all this. Visegrad was also a chance for stability in the center of Europe. It could have become a real partner for the powerful countries. It enjoyed excellent reviews. But it did not last long. The disintegration of Czechoslovakia was the first blow to Visegrad. Then Slovak-Hungarian conflicts broke out. And then politicians, not just in the Czech Republic, decided that they would reach Europe sooner if they went alone. It looks like the greatest political chance of the Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, and Hungarians in the 20th century may be wasted.
