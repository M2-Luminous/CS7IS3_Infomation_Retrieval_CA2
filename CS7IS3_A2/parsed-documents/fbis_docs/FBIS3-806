"Two great obstacles have been removed from the path to democracy. First, citizens of the territory will be able to vote in the election, as is their right." Second, the "white rightwing now has an electoral vehicle," in the form of the Freedom Front, and "the continuing coherence of the Freedom Alliance is in question." The "authority of the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] was enhanced, and the SADF [South African Defense Force] was shown to be willing to obey constitutional authority. The country stared once more at the spectre of civil war, and shrank back. It was an awful way to achieve progress, but that is the outcome." BUSINESS DAY TEC Responsible for Ensuring Free Political Activity in kwaZulu -- "The blame for what happened in Bop [Bophuthatswana] lies squarely at the door of ousted President Lucas Mangope; the ANC [African National Congress] exploited his autocratic obstinacy and South Africa's lack of resolve, and is now claiming a splendid political victory," notes Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 14 March in a page-18 editorial. "The confrontation over democracy in Bophuthatswana should have happened long ago. A political ultimatum, backed by the threat of financial sanctions and military intervention, would have saved the lives and property lost in the past few days. Instead the TEC and the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC], charged with ensuring free political activity, shied away from conflict." As for the people in kwaZulu, they "have the same right to vote as people in Bophuthatswana. If they are denied it, there will be the same confrontation and for the same reasons. Whether or not Inkatha participates in the election, the TEC and the IEC need to make it clear now that they will act, forcibly if needs be, to ensure free political activity." SOWETAN Government, TEC Action Needed Against Election Spoilers -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 14 March in a page-10 editorial says Bophuthatswana's Lucas Mangope "contributed largely to his own downfall" by announcing, "in the face of a paralysing strike by the homeland's civil servants, that there would be no elections in Bophuthatswana and, by implication, no re-incorporation into South Africa." "The key lesson of Bophuthatswana is that nobody should be allowed to mess with the lives of ordinary people and hold to ransom the democratic process. The Government and the TEC will have to act with much greater speed and ruthlessness against others who, for instance, are going to attempt to sabotage the April elections. If they don't act, they can be sure the people will." SUNDAY NATION Don't Postpone Elections -- Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in English on 13 March in a page-6 editorial notes that the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and General Constand Viljoen's Freedom Front "are now asking for the postponement of the election date." "Clearly, since the ANC has agreed that there should be mediation, we can only assume that it also understands that, should such mediation not deliver by April 27, there will be no election on that date. On the other hand, should mediation bear fruit in a month the ANC must understand that it will not be able to convince the IFP to take part in the polls, because Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi will -- as he has already done -- argue that he has not had enough time to campaign." Therefore, "whether we grant a volkstaat [homeland], give Natal to Chief Buthelezi, follow the transitional constitution or stay as we are -- conflict is inevitable, because neither of the above will ever satisfy spoilers."
