In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday, Aleksey Koshmarov, chairman of the Russian movement "Future Leaders of the New Millennium," said that about 200 young parliamentarians and members of various parties from Russia, the United States, France, Germany and other countries will try to shape up a new image of the political leader for the 21st century. "A new type of politics must be distinctive in its unpredictability, ability to conduct a dialogue and seek a compromise, rather than conflicts," Koshmarov said. He stressed that the members of the movement have been trying to avoid extremism, both right and left, since it was set up two years ago.
