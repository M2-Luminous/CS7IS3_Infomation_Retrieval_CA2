So the health office had been working to destroy these breeding places throughout Bangkok. The statistics for dengue fever for the past ten years indicated that the highest incidence had been in 1987 when there were a total of 12,190 cases in Bangkok and 18 deaths. The pattern of the disease was to spread every other year or every two years. When Bangkok battled the disease, the number of cases was reduced. He said that this year the number of cases of dengue fever had been higher from January until August. There had been a total of 1,096 cases but no loss of life. If one compared the statistics for the number of cases in various areas based on the population, one found that Nong Chok had the highest incidence. Next came Yannawa, Sathon, Bangrak and Thonburi in that order. If one considered the total number of cases in the top ten areas, Thonburi was first with 75 cases, Huai Khwang was next with 61 cases, Yannawa with 59, Sathon with 58, Phasi Charoen with 56, Chomthong with 45, Ratsadon Burana with 42, Phrakhonong with 40, Bangkapi with 39, and Dusit with 36. He also said that although the situation with dengue fever in Bangkok had not reached the stage of epidemic, we should be careful after the rains not to throw away anything which might hold water as these could provide breeding places for mosquitos. There was a mistaken belief that breeding places for mosquitos could only be in waste water. In fact mosquitos could breed in clean water.
