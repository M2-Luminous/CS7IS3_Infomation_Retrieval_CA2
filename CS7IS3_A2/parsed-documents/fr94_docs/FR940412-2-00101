In accordance with 40 CFR 2.306(j), EPA has determined that under EPA contract number 68&hyph;D4&hyph;0007, GCI will require access to CBI submitted to EPA under sections 4, 5, 6, 7, and 12 of TSCA to perform successfully the duties specified under the contract. Access is required for sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 of TSCA in addition to section 12 because certain regulatory actions under those sections trigger section 12 export notices. GCI personnel will be given access to information submitted to EPA under section 12 of TSCA. Some of the information may be claimed or determined to be CBI. EPA is issuing this notice to inform all submitters of information under section 12 of TSCA that EPA may provide GCI access to these CBI materials on a need-to-know basis only. All access to TSCA CBI under this contract will take place at EPA Headquarters and at GCI's Technical Assistance Information Service (TAIS) office, Waterside Mall, Garage Level, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Before access to TSCA CBI is authorized at GCI's TAIS office site, EPA will approve GCI's security certification statement, perform the required inspection of its facility, and ensure that the facility is in compliance with the manual. Upon completing review of the CBI materials, GCI will return all transferred materials to EPA. Clearance for access to TSCA CBI under this contract may continue until September 30, 1998. GCI personnel will be required to sign nondisclosure agreements and will be briefed on appropriate security procedures before they are permitted access to TSCA CBI.
