This is the message conveyed by Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis during his contacts with the permanent members of the UN Security Council. Mikhailidhis, who has been in New York since yesterday, is expected to conclude his contacts with all members of the UN Security Council tonight. In a statement to CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation], Mikhailidhis stressed that he feels there is serious thought that the UN Security Council is showing strong signs of fatigue on the Cyprus issue. Mikhailidhis added that in order to overcome Turkish intransigence, specific directives should be issued to engage the Security Council and an agenda should be drawn up on the basis of which Security Council members will move on the direction of the Turkish side. This evening, Mikhailidhis will attend a working dinner with UN official Marrack Goulding. Tomorrow, the foreign minister will go to Washington where he will meet with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.
