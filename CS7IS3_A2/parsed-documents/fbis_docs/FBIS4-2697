FBIS4-2697 "drchi071_k_94003" FBIS-CHI-94-071 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 NATIONAL AFFAIRS Political & Social Paper on Xu `House Arrest' Paper on Xu `House Arrest' HK1304055994 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST in English 13 Apr 94 p 9 HK1304055994 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST English BFN [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing] [Text] One of China's most prominent dissidents, Xu Wenli, has been released from police custody after being held for questioning for five days, relatives said yesterday. Mr Xu's sister said the former Democracy Wall activist was released from a police station yesterday morning and had returned to his nearby home. Another relative said he appeared in quite good health and did not seem to have been adversely affected by his ordeal. However, Mr Xu still appears to be under some form of house arrest. A contingent of police officers were still stationed at the entrance to his apartment complex yesterday, preventing foreign journalists from entering. And the caretaker at Mr Xu's building was refusing to put telephone calls through to his apartment. The Ministry of Public Security said Mr Xu, 50, had been summoned by police on Thursday after "violating the conditions of his parole" but refused to say what offences he had allegedly committed. It is generally assumed, however, that Mr Xu was taken in connection with the investigation into Wei Jingsheng's political activities. Wei was detained on April 2 as he tried to return to Beijing from nearby Tianjin. The Public Security Ministry later confirmed that Wei was being investigated for "suspected new crimes" committed while on parole and while being deprived of his political rights. Mr Xu had met Wei on several occasions since the latter's release from more than 14 years in jail last September. But Mr Xu had kept a relatively low profile since being released from 12 years in jail last May, not talking to foreign journalists or openly criticising the Government. In Los Angeles, the U.S. Commerce Undersecretary said the Clinton administration was "deeply troubled" by Beijing's recent crackdown on dissidents and warned China that it must do more if it wants to maintain U.S. trade privileges. Jeffrey Garten said both nations want to see a renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status, with the clock ticking ever closer to a June deadline for action. "I know that the Government of China understands the stakes, as do we," Mr Garten said. "I strongly hope that enough progress will be made on the human-rights front to allow both countries to move to a more normal trading framework and then beyond." Mr Garten, the department's top man for international trade matters, spoke as a high-level Chinese delegation began a U.S. tour aimed at pressing upon the Clinton administration the value of continued U.S.-Sino trade. Mr Garten praised the delegation head, China's Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation Wu Yi, and stressed the value of continued U.S. relations with the world's fastest growing economy. Ms Wu, however, warned that the U.S. would lose the huge China market if it revoked MFN. Products, technology and funding from other countries would flow into the mainland, she said. She said China would suffer as a result of the termination of the MFN status, but added it would hurt the U.S. even more.
