More than 20 similar town centre surveillance systems have already been installed around the country. Shoppers in Airdrie, Bedford, Canterbury, Coventry, Dover, Gloucester, King's Lynn, Liverpool, Newcastle upon Tyne and Northampton are familiar with them. Soon those in Ipswich, Glasgow and the London borough of Merton will be too. Inhabitants of Newbury, Berks, will have to wait a little longer. Businesses there are proving slow to agree to share the cost of the proposed 13-camera scheme with the district council. The installation cost is estimated at £200,000 and annual running costs at £100,000. The council has agreed to pay half but of 200 town centre businesses approached, only 60 have agreed to provide funds. Expansion of the surveillance systems in Glasgow and Northampton are also faced with reluctant support from the business community. The City Watch Association, which is pioneering the 32-camera Glasgow project, raised only £250,000, half of what it hoped for. Northampton borough council has spent about £500,000 on one of the largest surveillance schemes in the country, but has raised only £20,000 from businesses. It has 105 cameras in use -- in the town centre, car parks, bus stations, the train station and community centre. The Home Office is meeting half of the total cost for Warrington. Elsewhere, local authorities have to find the funds themselves. A 20-camera system costs in the region of £300,000. But the technology is improving and prices are coming down -- one of the reasons behind the phenomenal expansion in town centre surveillance schemes over the last 12 months.
