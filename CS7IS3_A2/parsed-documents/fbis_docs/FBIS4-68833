Many are not up to the task. Of course, objective reasons are being felt to a significant degree: First and foremost, the reduction in the state order for products of the military-industrial complex. There are subjective reasons also. The managers of many enterprises continue to set their hopes on assistance from the Ministry of Finance, branch ministries, and various authoritative structures, instead of working in an earnest way on actual conversion themselves, while attracting nonstate investments. It is understandable that in attracting outside investors (including foreign investors), the management of an enterprise ends up under their additional control. Not everyone likes this. Others simply do not want to part with any benefits that generally do not depend on the results of work. Up to the present, substantial nonproduction expenditures exist at a majority of enterprises, and there is an unjustifiably big gap between the wages of managers and those of the rest of the personnel at a number of enterprises. The results of unskilled management are well known--concealed unemployment, insolvency of enterprises, a breakdown in communications, etc. As a result, there is an increase in the dissatisfaction of the population threatening a social explosion. The conduct of a state policy directed at preventing the bankruptcy of state enterprises and reducing state expenditures to support insolvent enterprises has been entrusted to the Federal Administration on Insolvency Matters (Bankruptcy) and its territorial agencies. Supporting enterprises, in the event that the Court of Arbitration considers them insolvent, will be implemented either by means of reorganization (the conduct of external administration of the debtor-enterprise, or financial restoration of the enterprise), or by means of opening competitive production. Also possible is the conclusion of an amicable settlement between debtor and creditors in accordance with the Law of the Russian Federation "On Insolvency (Bankruptcy) of Enterprises." The law provides a procedure for the assignment of an arbitration supervisor with wide powers to a debtor-enterprise. At the same time, a moratorium is introduced as a form of support for the period of outside administration to satisfy the demands of the creditors on the debtor. But if a capable supervisor himself is unable to pull an enterprise out of debt, the enterprise can be declared bankrupt and is subject to sale in a competition. In this case, benefits for the labor collective can be envisioned as conditions of the competition. The Ministry of Economics of the Russian Federation has developed criteria for the adoption of decisions on rendering state support and financial restoration. Coming under state support are enterprises that: produce products, or are able to produce products after receiving state support; presently have or will have market demand in the next year or two; are capable of improving their production, economic, and social indices; produce products at prices that satisfy the market; do not excessively raise wages for their workers; do not needlessly increase profits and prices for products; and employ, or will be able to employ, advanced technology after receiving support, including ecologically safe technology. A very important condition for rendering state support is the presence at the enterprise of a technically and economically justified plan of measures for improving the health of the enterprise (financial restoration project). Considering that check privatization is coming to an end, many insolvent enterprises are given a chance to acquire additional financial means through the mechanism of conversion. Inasmuch as some of the money obtained from the sale of state property will remain at the enterprise that has been reorganized into a joint-stock company. Of course, the shares of a debtor-enterprise will be bought up only in the event a well-studied development program is available. In this case, the territorial agency is called on to perform the role of an expert, because the interests of the state as the owner are involved here. It should be emphasized once more that the task of the territorial agency, as well as of the entire Federal Administration on Matters of Insolvency (Bankruptcy), is not to supplement the budget by liquidating enterprises, but to assist insolvent enterprises in acquiring financial independence. The resources of the federal budget and branch and interbranch off-budget funds will be directed to this end.
