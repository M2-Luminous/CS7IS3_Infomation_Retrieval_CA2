What are your aims? [Fur] I started a large-scale tour around the country from October and November, and during this tour I will visit all counties and have discussions with the leaders and members of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] and hold lectures, since a great, a very great test [the election], is coming. I think that if the population, the citizens of the country, realize how much the MDF and the coalition government have done, and that within the range of possibilities they have done the best way that could be done, the Hungarian Democratic Forum will win the elections, perhaps not with such a high percentage of votes as it obtained in 1990, but I am sure that the respective proportion of votes will be above 20 percent. [Reporter] Would you accept the post of party chairman? [Fur] I usually do not evade challenges of my fate, particularly when they are sensible challenges. If I have to face such a challenge, I will try to meet it.
