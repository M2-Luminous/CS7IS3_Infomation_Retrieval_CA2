But he stressed at Commons question time: "Ultimately peace is only going to come at the negotiating table." Challenged by Labour leader John Smith about the possible use of air strikes, Mr Major stressed that air power must only be used for clear objectives. Continued mortar and artillery attacks on Sarajevo could not await an overall setlement. "UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Force], with support from NATO, must apply immediate and strong pressure to halt those attacks." Mr Major also clashed with Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown over Britain's response to the carnage in former Yugoslavia. He angrily told him to stop pretending "there is some easy, magic and painless solution to a problem that is intensely difficult." The question of how to respond to the weekend market place massacre in Sarajevo dominated the exchanges. Mr Smith asked: "If no action is taken to protect the people of Sarajevo from the pitiless shelling, aren't the Serbs bound to conclude that no action will be taken against them, whatever they do?" Mr Major said UN troops were in Bosnia to help the civilian population. "The UN cannot end the civil war by force. That has never been a feasible option," he insisted. "Ultimately peace is only going to come at the negotiating table." "But I think the UN may need to use force for specific purposes, to carry out its mandate and protect its own people in Bosnia. "It may need tactical air support from NATO. We have always been prepared to see air power used for these purposes, provided the commanders judge it appropriate." Mr Major said: "I don't believe that we can wait for action to follow an overall settlement. "I don't believe it is right to tolerate the continued mortar and artillery attacks against the civilian population. "UNPROFOR, with support from Nato, must apply immediate and strong pressure to halt these attacks." Mr Smith agreed that the civil war could not be ended by military intervention but added: "Ought there not to be some minimal objectives that we should set for ourselves?" He said: "Surely it ought to be a political objective to remove all the weapons within striking distance of Sarajevo, under threat that if that is not done, air attacks will be pursued." Mr Major said NATO would meet tomorrow to consider "what pressure can most effectively be applied and how." He said: "It is certainly the case that if we use air power we must be very clear about the objectives of that action. "And the aim must be to reinforce pressure to end the bombardment of Sarajevo." Mr Major said the UN command must be able to set "clear and specific conditions, knowing that tactical air support is available if necessary in order to back them up." Any use of force must be "forward looking," he said. "It must seek to improve the situation in Sarajevo and contribute to the pressure on the parties to end the war." Mr Major admitted: "These are not easy options in any way." Decision-making must also take account of the importance of the humanitarian effort, the safety of civilians and the safety of soldiers carrying out the aid operation. "These are the objectives NATO must consider tomorrow in determining how to proceed." Mr Smith asked if the Government would support an ultimatum calling on the Serbs to withdraw "weapons of attack" from striking distance of Sarejevo. Mr Major pointed to the EU [European Union]'s foreign affairs council recommendation yesterday that the aim should be to bring about the immediate lifting of the siege of Sarajevo "using all the means necessary." But he said foreign ministers had gone on to look to NATO to carry forward the process -- a decision in line with views expressed by Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. Mr Ashdown, quoting Mr Major, welcomed the Prime Minister's "new more muscular mood" on Bosnia. But he said it was now four weeks "since you told us of your determination to reopen Tuzla airport as soon as possible and probably five weeks until the launching of the Serb spring offensive aimed at obliterating what remains of Bosnia." Mr Ashdown demanded: "Are you able to tell us yet of any progress on opening Tuzla airport to which you have set your hand?" Mr Major said it was a matter under consideration by the UN and NATO. "It is not a unilateral matter for the British Government." He said the UN and NATO were taking a very firm line on Tuzla airport, removing obstacles to humanitarian relief convoys and lifting the siege of Sarajevo. "These are important and difficult matters that are being considered by commanders on the ground on a day to day basis." But he told the Liberal Democrat leader: "I do wish you would cease, as you do so often, to pretend there is some easy, magic and painless solution to a problem that is intensely difficult for commanders on the ground and everybody concerned with the operation. "You have been consistent in one respect only. You have been consistently wrong in every single course you have advocated since this dreadful conflict began!" Earlier Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind told the House British troops would remain in Bosnia throughout the winter to support the UN mandate. Mr Rifkind, who returned today from a visit to former Yugoslavia added: "No decisions have yet been taken about their deployment thereafter." He said: "All countries have to take account of the need to ensure the safety of UN forces currently in Bosnia. "We have to take into account the advice of military commanders in Bosnia because they have an awesome responsibility, which must be a very important factor in the considerations that are under way." He said every initiative had to be consistent with the need to show political leadership and political will and sound military judgment. "If it is not so rooted, it will be a cruel deception on the people it is designed to help." Shadow defence secretary Dr David Clark called for Sarajevo to be demilitarised. "The British Government should join in an ultimatum to the Serbs ... that if they do not acceed to this request, they face the consequences of air strikes." Mr Rifkind said: "What we now have to consider is whether action that might be taken will meet the various objectives we have: continuation of aid, the need to try to influence the behaviour of the Serbs and other factions and our obligation as a national government to the protection of our own forces. "It would be unwise to follow any initiative which put at jeopardy these requirements."
