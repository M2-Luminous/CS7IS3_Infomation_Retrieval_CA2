FR940613-0-00090 FR940613-0-00015 ACCESS: A vehicle shall not be operated off the designated portions of the Interstate System except to access food, fuel, repairs, and rest or to access a facility. Access to a facility shall be subject to the following conditions: (1) The facility must: (a) Be either a manufacturing or a distribution center, a warehouse, or truck terminal located in an area where industrial uses are permitted; (b) Be a construction site; and (c) Meet the following criteria: 1 vehicles are formed for transport or broken down for delivery on the premises; 2 adequate off-roadway space exists on the premises to safely maneuver the vehicles; and 3 adequate equipment is available on the premises to handle, load, and unload the vehicle, its trailers, and cargo. (2) The facility must be located within a maximum distance of 10 miles from the point where the vehicle enters or exits the designated portions of the Interstate System. Such 10-mile distance shall be measured by the actual route(s) to be traveled to the facility, rather than by a straight line radius from the designated Interstate System to the facility; (3) The access route(s) between the designated Interstate System and the facility must be approved in advance by the public entity (Colorado DOT, municipality, or county) having jurisdiction for the roadway(s) that make up the route(s). Where the State of Colorado has jurisdiction over the access route(s), it will consider the following safety, engineering, and other criteria in determining whether to approve the route(s): (a) Safety of the motoring public; (b) Geometrics of the street and roadway; (c) Traffic volumes and patterns; (d) Protection of State highways, roadways, and structures; (e) Zoning and general characteristics of the route(s) to be encountered; and (f) Other relevant criteria warranted by special circumstances of the proposed route(s). Local entities, counties, and municipalities having jurisdiction over route(s), should consider similar criteria in determining whether to approve the proposed ingress and egress route(s); and (4) A permit holder shall access only the facility or location authorized by the permit. If the permit authorizes more than one facility or location, then on any single trip by an LVC from the designated Interstate System the permit holder may access only one facility or location before returning to the designated Interstate System.
