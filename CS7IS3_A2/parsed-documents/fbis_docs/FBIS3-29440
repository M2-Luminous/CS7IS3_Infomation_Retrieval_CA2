This was a proud event in which the chuche idea was declared a great guiding idea of the socialist cause in the present time, the author of a NODONG SINMUN article says. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is quoted as saying: "...The idea, theory and method of chuche founded by the great leader are the most correct ones for the guidance of the building of socialism and communism in our time." The article continues: The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il developed and enriched the chuche idea with his energetic ideological and theoretical activities, comprehensively reviewed the history of the preceding revolutionary thought of the working class and scientifically analysed the rich experience of the Korean revolution and the historical lessons of the socialist movement. On this basis, he formulated the chuche idea in an integral system so that it could shine as the guiding idea of our time. He proclaimed the programme of modelling the whole society on the chuche idea and made the chuche idea the flawless guiding idea of the age of independence. This was a great event which brought about a new turn in the development of socialist thought and its cause. This was also a historic milestone in heralding a new epoch in the history of human thought and a historic turning point in placing our socialism on a firmer ideological and theoretical basis. The proclamation of programme by Comrade Kim Chong-il is a great exploit which makes it possible to successfully build socialism on the basis of the chuche idea. It is a programme of advancing the revolution with the revolutionary idea of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, the chuche idea, as the guiding principle and build and perfect communist society on the basis of this idea. With this programme declared, it was clarified for the first time in history that the course of building socialism and communism is a course of implementing the leader's revolutionary idea and modelling the whole society on it. In the history of the communist movement spanning one hundred and dozens of years, no party had ever raised the modelling of the whole society on the leader's revolutionary idea as the programme of building communism. This great revolutionary programme could be propounded only by Comrade Kim Chong-il who has a chuche outlook on the revolutionary cause of the working class and unfailing loyalty to the leader's cause. Definite priority should be given to the remoulding of people in order to raise their consciousness of independence and creative ingenuity and, on this basis, nature and society be transformed. This is the true path of building communism indicated by the chuche idea and that is what the modelling of the whole society on the chuche idea means. The programme of modelling the whole society on the chuche idea is a most scientific programme clarifying the way of fully realising the independence of the popular masses, the makers of history, and an immortal revolutionary banner under which to resolutely defend the socialist cause and bring it to accomplishment under any circumstance. The unity of our society in ideology and purpose on the basis of the chuche idea has been immensely strengthened, a true model of socialism based on singlehearted unity been built, the ages-old idea of the popular masses been put into reality and their independent life been ensured through the transformation of all spheres of social life as required by chuche. These are great achievements made in the course of modelling the whole society on the chuche idea. The programme of modelling the whole society on the chuche idea is a historical cause which can be successfully accomplished only by Comrade Kim Chong-il who has intense loyalty to the chuche cause, iron will and faith to carry out the revolution with chuche-based ideas and theories and clairvoyant wisdom and outstanding leadership ability. He was the first in history to propound the perfect revolutionary programme embodying the guiding idea of the time and wisely guide the efforts to implement it, setting a brilliant example of socialist construction. This is a great and imperishable exploit of his for the people's cause of independence.
