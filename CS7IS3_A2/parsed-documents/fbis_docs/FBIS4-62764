The Black Sea Fleet was an integral fighting unit of the Russian Navy, Kasatonov said. According to Kasatonov, the most difficult stage in the efforts to decide the Fleet's fate was over. Negotiations were underway, he said, and moves were being made to find political solutions to the remaining problems. Before the breakup of the Soviet Union, Kasatonov said, the Black Sea Fleet enjoyed, with support from the Rumanian [Romanian] and Bulgarian Navies, superiority in both the Black and Mediterranean Seas. It was also supported by submarines of the Northern Fleet, he said. According to Kasatonov, three quarters of the Black Sea coast had been working to protect the southern borders of the Soviet Union, Rumania [Romania] and Bulgaria. At that time there was not a single Turkish ship or submarine in the southern part of the Black Sea, Kasatonov said. If a plane took off in Turkey or a naval target appeared, Kasatonov said, the Black Sea Fleet came to know about it in no time. Kasatonov wished the Ukrainian armed forces had not moved its attention away from NATO and switched it to the Black Sea Fleet. As of date, Kasatonov said, up to 60,000 Ukrainian special and other troops were stationed in Crimea. The Black Sea Fleet had 3,000 Marines and Coast Guards in the same area. Kasatonov said "the destructive Ukrainian forces and the British" were planning to celebrate something to be known as the Day of the British Soldier in Sebastopol [Sevastopol], to pay tribute to the memory of the British troops killed in the Crimean War of 1856. Kasatonov said the Russians had four months to prepare to honor the memory of the Russian soldiers killed in the same war.
