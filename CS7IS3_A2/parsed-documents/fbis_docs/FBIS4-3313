In an interview Monday [18 April], Mubarak said that as a developing country that adopted centralized economic planning, Egypt has borne a lot of burdens as a result of several armed conflicts in the Middle East. It has met with difficulties in creating the infrastructure necessary for economic development, and has suffered from a steady population growth rate not in proportion to that of the economic growth. In the face of these problems, said the president, Egypt began in the early eighties to comprehensively review its economic programs and plans in line with the requirements of modern economy, carrying out its economic reform programs in a way compatible with its own social conditions and the needs of Egyptian citizens. He said that having executed two five-year economic plans and started a third one in 1992 and gradually adopted policies for economic liberalization and privatization in accordance with conditions of Egyptian society, Egypt has managed to restore the vitality of the egyptian economy, and its ability to produce, export and provide labor opportunities for thousands of young people. The problem is not over yet, but it was carefully diagnosed, he said. The Egyptian economy, including industry, agriculture, reconstruction and public services, began to appear healthy and strong. The president said that there is no little likeness between Egypt's experiment and that of China, despite their peculiarities. Shifting from centralized planning to the market mechanism and individual enterprises is a characteristic of both experiments. But the fact the two experiments have taken into consideration the social peculiarities of the Egyptian and Chinese peoples, or "what we call the 'social dimension of economic development'," is perhaps the most prominent characteristic that they have in common, the president stressed. Invigorating the public sector, establishing free economic zones, encouraging foreign investments and developing medium and small- sized industrial enterprises are characteristic of the reforms in China, which can be found, though on a small scale, in Egypt's economic reform experiment, Mubarak said. Both the Egyptian and Chinese experiments reflect the conditions of economic development in the two countries, they are not a mechanical response to some plans or pieces of advice that were not necessarily compatible with the characteristics of the two experiments, said the Egyptian president.
