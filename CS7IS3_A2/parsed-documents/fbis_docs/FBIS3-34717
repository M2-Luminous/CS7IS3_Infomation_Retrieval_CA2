[Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 10 February adds the following: "In their meeting today, the settlers decided to present the three no's they will not allow to be broken: no Palestinian self-rule in the Jordan Rift Valley; no armed Palestinian police; and no territorial corridors for the Palestinians in the valley."] David Levi, chairman of the regional council, claims that since the Document of Principles has been signed in Washington, Arabs have been illegally building in several locations in the region. He called these deliberate Arab settlements.
