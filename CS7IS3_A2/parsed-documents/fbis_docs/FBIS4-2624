Along with other participants, it will sign the Final Act of the Uruguay Round negotiations and the Agreement on the Establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO). This means that China, which has taken part in the Uruguay Round world trade negotiations, undertakes to fulfill all the obligations stipulated in the Uruguay Round package and further open its markets to its trade partners. These steps will help to strengthen the world's multilateral trading system as represented by the WTO, coming into being next year. China has long sought to resume its status as a contracting party of GATT. Moreover, the relevant talks must be concluded successfully before WTO is formally established so that China can be a founding member of the international trade body. China's application to re-enter the organization has received the backing of most of GATT's members. But the talks have continued for eight years and regrettably with no conclusive result so far. In order to speed up the talks, China has displayed great sincerity and complied with the agreements of the Uruguay Round negotiations. Meanwhile, China has taken steps to integrate its trade and economy with those of the rest of the world. One example is the market-based pricing system being instituted in China, one of the principal demands of GATT. And China has promised to further perform its duties in boosting an open market even after it re- enters GATT. However, China is a developing country. Our government is quite right to reject the demand made by certain nations, that China undertake the same commitments in Gatt as a developed country. For that is far above the actual level of China's economic development. From an all-round perspective, now China is basically qualified to resume its status in GATT and become a founder member of WTO. Pursuing a policy of opening to the rest of the world, China has witnessed the rapid growth of its trade and economy in recent years. It deserves a due place in the world multilateral trading system. Without the participation of China, a nation with one fifth of world's population and a dynamic growth rate, the WTO cannot claim universal membership. GATT members should remember that delaying China's re-entry into GATT will be in no one's interest. If this happens, China will provide market access on a reciprocal basis. It is our hope that under the principle of an exchange based on equality and mutual benefit, most of GATT's signatories will take measures to enable China to re-enter GATT at an early date and to become a founder member of the WTO.
