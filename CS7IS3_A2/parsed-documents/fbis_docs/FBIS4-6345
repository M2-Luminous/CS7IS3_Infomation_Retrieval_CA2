"Communism remains a latent danger in Indonesia now and in the future," Brigadier General Agum Gumelar, the chief of the Army's elite force Kopassus [Special Forces Command], told reporters yesterday. "Communism will return if the condition of society becomes chaotic," Agum said during a rare press conference given by him at the command's headquarters in Cijantung, East Jakarta, in connection with Kopassus' upcoming 42nd anniversary. The Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) has been outlawed since 1966. Kopassus spearheaded the Army's move to quash the communist forces immediately after the failed coup attempt by PKI in 1965. The highly disciplined force has also been prominent in most major military operations in Indonesia, including putting down separatist rebellions in Aceh, East Timor and Irian Jaya. Agum said leftist and rightist elements are constantly trying to replace the political system in Indonesia which has been painstakingly built since 1966, by criticizing and attacking the system at every opportune moment. He felt that they immediately blame the system for any mishaps, adding that the right elements would also exploit religious issues to further their cause. He also warned against other elements, particularly from Western- educated liberal-minded intellectuals, who constantly demand political and economic reforms. "They focus on labor and land conflicts to attack the government. Such movements, if not controlled, will worsen the social, political and economic conditions," he said. He accused non-governmental organizations [NGOs] of using such issues as democratization, political openness, environmental protection and human rights to discredit the government and the Armed Forces (ABRI). "We know many NGOs have become vocal, both at home and overseas, on human rights and environmental issues in their efforts to discredit the government and ABRI. They are also against the constitution and Pancasila [The ideological basis of the Indonesian state]," he said. "What do Princen and Adnan Buyung Nasution really hope to achieve by advocating the human rights of criminals?" he asked, referring two of Indonesia's most outspoken human rights campaigners. "Tell me which is more important. Protecting the human rights of criminals or those of the good guys?" He said ABRI and the government were open to criticism, provided they were aired with the intention to help the government improve the people welfare and not to replace the system. "What would become of this nation if there was a revolution to overturn the Pancasila democracy?," he asked. "We will go back to square one after people have been waiting for a long time to enjoy a good standard of living. " Despite many shortcomings and weaknesses, people should give credit to the present government for improving their welfare, he said.
