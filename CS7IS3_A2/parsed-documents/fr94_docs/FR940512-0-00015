FR940512-0-00015 FR940512-0-00006 Requests for records shall be in writing, in an envelope clearly marked ``FOIA Request,'' and addressed to the Freedom of Information Officer, Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation, McLean, Virginia 22102&hyph;0826. A request improperly addressed will be deemed not to have been received for purposes of the 10-day time period set forth in ยง1402.14(a) until it is received, or would have been received with the exercise of due diligence by the Freedom of Information Officer. Records requested in conformance with this subpart and which are not exempt records may be received in person or by mail as specified in the request. Records to be received in person will be available for inspection or copying during business hours on a regular business day in the offices of the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation, McLean, Virginia 22102&hyph;0826. ยง1402.14 Response to requests for records. (a) Within 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays), or any extension thereof as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, of the receipt of a request, the Freedom of Information Officer shall determine whether to comply with or to deny such request and place a notice thereof in writing in the mail addressed to the requester. (b) Within 30 days of the receipt of a notice denying, in whole or in part, a request for records, the requester may appeal the denial. The appeal shall be in writing addressed to the Chief Financial Officer, Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation, and both the letter and envelope shall be clearly marked ``FOIA Appeal.'' An appeal improperly addressed shall be deemed not to have been received for purposes of the 20-day time period set forth in paragraph (c) of this section until it is received, or would have been received with the exercise of due diligence by Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation personnel. (c) Within 20 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays), or any extension thereof as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, of the receipt of an appeal, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall act upon the appeal and place a notice of the determination thereof in writing in the mail addressed to the requester. If the determination on the appeal upholds in whole or in part the denial of the request for records, or, if a determination on the appeal has not been mailed at the end of the 20-day period or the last extension thereof, the requester is deemed to have exhausted that person's administrative remedies, giving rise to a right of review in a district court of the United States as specified in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4). When a determination cannot be mailed within the applicable time limit, the appeal will nevertheless be processed. In such case, upon the expiration of the time limit, the requester will be informed of the reason for the delay, of the date on which a determination may be expected to be mailed, and of that person's right to seek judicial review. The requester may be asked to forego judicial review until determination of the appeal. (d) In unusual circumstances as specified in this paragraph the 10-day time limit prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section or the 20-day time limit prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section, or both, may be extended provided that the total of all extensions shall not exceed 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). Extensions shall be made by written notice to the requester setting forth the reasons for the extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be mailed. As used in this paragraph, unusual circumstances means, but only to the extent necessary to the proper processing of the request: (1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request; (2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or (3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation having substantial subject-matter interest therein.
