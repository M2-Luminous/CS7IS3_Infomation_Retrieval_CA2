The head of Khasan district, Anatoly Melnichenko, and the director-general of Khasansky Sea commercial port visited the Maritime and Port Administration (MAPA) Thursday to discuss opening a sea route between Sokcho, a northeastern port here, and Zarubino. The Russians said they wanted to improve the port facilities independently from the central government in Moscow and are therefore negotiating with neighboring countries such as South Korea and Japan to attract foreign investment. They proposed creating joint-venture companies to major business groups here such as Hyundai, Samsung, Daewoo and Hanbo and received a positive response, the Russians said. Zarubino was developed as a fishing port and administered by the central government before the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, but administrative power has since been handed over to the private sector. Zarubino is located 70 km from the Chinese city of Hunchun, which was selected as a key area under the Tumen River development plan sponsored by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in 1991. If its facilities are modernized, Zarubino Port will thus be in a good position to link North Korea, China and Russia in a day's time, the Russians said. Zarubino port can currently handle four 20,000-ton-class ships at a time, but it plans to build a 1.9-km quay for six ships. The port also aims to construct loading facilities and to improve rail links with the Trans-Siberian railroad.
