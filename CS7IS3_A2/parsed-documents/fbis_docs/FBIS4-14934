Their gist may be reduced to Utel's loss of its exclusive right to operate transnational telephone links in Ukraine, which the joint venture enjoyed since 1992. The Minister is also said have specified that licenses to other operators may be issued on condition they promise to invest a portion of their incomes in development of Ukraine's telecommunications. Formally, the Utel case was initiated by the Ukrainian Anti-Monopoly Committee. The latter is said to be currently drafting its judgement on the problem, which has thus arisen. The Justice Ministry is scrutinizing Utel's statute documents with a view of making the necessary amendments. A Cabinet decision on the Utel jv [joint venture] is believed to follow within a week. The Utel jv was set up in 1992. The Ukrainian party, which is represented by 13 out of Ukraine's 25 regional communication agencies and the Ukrtekh and Kievelektrosvyaz associations, owns 51 per cent of its capital. The remainder is divided among the US AT&T, Germany's Deutsche Telecome (19.5 per cent each party) and the Netherlands' PTT Telecom (10 per cent of the jv's authorized capital). As experts believe, Utel-2, which is supposed to unite the other 12 regional communication agencies, which are not among Utel's co-founder's can materialize if only some major Western company takes part in the project. France's Alcatel and Canada's Teleglobe are currently mentioned as having displayed a certain degree of interest to Ukraine's telecommunication market. Since Utel's strategy relies primarily on land-based lines, rather than satellite communication links, UKRINFORM asked Andrey Zhalko-Titarenko, deputy director-general of the Ukrainian National Space Agency, to comment on changes in Ukraine's telecommunication market. Says Mr. Zhalko-Titarenko: "Elimination of the US AT&T's monopoly on Ukraine's communication market by way of the Netherlands' AT&T's participation in Utel is a major step toward a market economy in Ukraine". The gist of arguments, which Utel's opponents resort to, is AT&T's allegedly unreasonably high proceeds due to the so-called disbalanced traffic on account of the number of incoming calls exceeding that of made from Ukraine, since world telephone tariffs cannot be paid by the bulk of Ukraine's citizens. As satellite communication proponents have to admit, though, satellite communication tariffs can hardly be expected any lower, at least in the initial project implementation stage.
