The Council considered some questions with regard to international and internal relations, and a report on the visit of Franjo Tudjman to Bosnia-Herzegovina. In this connection the Council assessed that, through this visit, the Republic of Croatia has provided a significant impetus to the revitalization of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation and a confederation with Croatia, while international groups have been able to see for themselves that the Croatians are implementing the Washington agreement consistently. The prime minister, who led a Croatian delegation at an international gathering in Crans-Montana, told the Council about the numerous meetings he had at this gathering. The Croatian Government delegation won recognition during the many contacts made at the gathering for the successful maintenance of stability of the Croatian national currency, the kuna, and for the successful implementation of economic policy. Great interest was shown in the many meetings aimed at creating investments in the Republic of Croatia. The Croatian delegation also had talks on the complicated problems of transforming socially owned property into privately owned property, something facing all postcommunist countries. The Council also considered the package of measures which the Croatian Government should implement in order to breathe life into the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation and a confederation with Croatia. In this connection the need was expressed for constant coordination -- and analysis of trends and the achievement of results in different spheres -- between the Republic of Croatia and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation. The Council considered some problems of transformation and privatization in Croatia, and at the proposal of the Government concluded that, because of the enhanced interest of large international companies and Croatians abroad in investing in Croatia, the Council would devote one of its coming sessions to this problem alone, the statement from the president's office concludes.
