Again yesterday the citizens of this Republic -- European electors for a day -- set off in a long procession, lock, stock, and ballot papers. Their destination: Silvio Berlusconi's government. A march under the banners of the center-right. A race to strengthen the victors of two months ago. A massive display of confidence and a huge, urgent need to become part of the growing triumphant army. Within the space of a few weeks, millions of votes have shifted and have transformed what was a relative majority into the country's absolute majority. Even before his promised new economic miracle, Silvio Berlusconi has achieved the miracle of consensus. Only two months ago the forces of the center-right had 43 percent of the Italian people's votes. A first-past-the-post system granted them the unquestionable right to govern. But almost 60 percent of Italians displayed in various ways their mistrust, if not their hostility, toward them. Yesterday, however, Silvio Berlusconi achieved something like the landslide victory for which he called. The combination of the votes of Forza Italia, the National Alliance [AN], the League, and Pannella's reform group -- that is, the government majority -- is well over 50 percent. In Italy now, the opposition to the Berlusconi government is in the minority, even from the proportional viewpoint. This is the first, spectacular, effect of the latest "migration" which enabled Forza Italia to gain an additional 10 percent of votes over the result of the March elections. Not only is the majority growing quickly, but its characteristics are also changing. Forza Italia and the AN now claim some 44 percent of the votes. In the future, they could be tempted to go it alone, if necessary, without the League. Indeed, in a first-past-the-post system it is possible to win and to govern with near 40 percent. So the way is clear for the center-right single party, that of Berlusconi and [AN leader] Fini together. If he wants, [League Secretary] Bossi can follow the path set out by the other two. If that does not suit him, he could of course prompt a government crisis, but as of today we know that the other two can do without him. Like it or not, the League is cornered, stands watching the procession of voters toward Berlusconi, and cannot stop it, but can only join it or remain alone. Like it or not, Panella is also a mere accessory, a useful adjunct, but an adjunct nevertheless. The center-right bulldozer runs on a kind of gas that nobody else has: The Italian people believe in Silvio Berlusconi and his promises -- at least for the present. This is the key to yesterday's election result, and it is this that enabled Forza Italia to reach a level of support that only the DC [Christian Democratic Party] before it enjoyed. The Italian people believe in, and want to believe in, a new season of prosperity. They do not want to let go of the possibility that prosperity will arrive tomorrow, or even today, and moreover, basically without much effort. Indeed, they have used their votes to punish those who doubt it. No reasoning can prevail against it; the "procession" demolishes every obstacle. It wins new coverts, thrives on genuine confidence, enlists old forms of opportunism, and feeds on conformism and hope. And Silvio Berlusconi is in the driver's seat. He can, if he wants, dump the defeated League. He can, if he wants, create the great center-right party with Fini. He can calmly await the arrival of the last penitents from the drained center. Indeed, the center that was identified with the DC and the referendums is not holding together and is inevitably disintegrating. The Popular Party and Segni's Pact have lost about one-fourth of the votes they had two months ago. The idea that nothing can be done either with Forza Italia or with the progressive forces has not been taken up by the voters. The center opposition is about to become a mere token stance. So it is easy to predict that the Popular Party will be subjected to tensions that could cut it into slices and that one of these slices will decide to join the "procession." So while the center is working on a political hypothesis that seems insubstantial to the voters, things are certainly not much better for the progressive forces. Their percentage of the votes has fallen by a few points but, what is worse, the first symptoms of political asphyxia are starting to appear. The PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] suffered losses, which shows the high cost of every week spent contemplating its defeat in March. If the progressive forces do not change their language, habits, and political strategy right away, it is likely a long season of decline will begin for them. It is not just a matter of a secretary or a leadership group, though one cannot pretend there is no leadership problem. Now one can hope, for the sake of the progressive forces, that the PDS will alter its cautious internal timetable. Now one can hope, for the sake of the progressive forces, that no one will make any excuses. The PDS has less than 20 percent, Rete is virtually nonexistent, and the Democratic Alliance and the Socialists are decimated. On its own, the Left will die, whichever party symbol it uses as its banner. And it would be hardly any consolation for the progressive forces to cite the stability of Communist Renewal and the modest success of the Greens. There is no magic spell for the progressive forces and there is presently no alternative to Berlusconi ready in Italian society. But at least one thing is clear: The Left, on its own, commands the support of one Italian in three. If it ever wants to govern this country it must start changing its representatives and its language; then it can try to change the country's political geography and try to halt the "procession." But it is pointless to stand watching it, knocking on wood. The vote was for Europe, but the Italian people gladly forgot the fact. Instead, en masse, they took the opportunity to shout that they want to be governed by Silvio Berlusconi and no other. They did not care too much for subtleties: On the stock exchange of politics, of social interests and values, more jobs and less taxes are now worth more than anything else. Berlusconi does not frighten them; indeed, he attracts them. And Fini does not frighten them very much either, judging from the fact that the MSI [Italian Social Movement] paid only a tiny price for the polemics over government neofascism. Indeed, it is more likely that the few votes that the National Alliance lost went to Forza Italia, as though attracted by some kind of gravitational force. A great number of League supporters have also become converts to Forza Italia, even though, or perhaps precisely because, Bossi is threatening to end the idyll. Center supporters who do not want to miss the promised chance to party have converted to Forza Italia. However, the procession still excludes the Left, which has been deprived of all hope and whose outlook has become uncertain. If there is a leadership out there, please speak up. It is already very late -- never mind about tomorrow. Italy now is placing its trust in and consigning itself to Silvio Berlusconi. So let him govern, as best he can. As of today, power is certainly not something he lacks. The country is following him in a procession, and he and he alone will take the credit for a new miracle or an old disaster.
