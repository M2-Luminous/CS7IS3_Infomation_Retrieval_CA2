In the letter, President Taylor informed the ECOWAS chairman that the Liberian peace process has lost its momentum, the outcome of which could be disastrous. He said unless the elements of government dealing with the Cotonou Accord are put into play by 22 May this year, the leadership of the NPFL will be constrained to consider other alternatives. President Taylor stressed that if the NPFL agreed-upon rights are ignored, it will have to be considered nonpartisan and (?imagine) itself otherwise in the peace process. The commander in chief of the NPFL, President Taylor, has repeated his call for the immediate establishment of a Transitional National Army of Liberia. The NPFL leader stressed the need for the three parties to the Cotonou Accord to begin providing soldiers for the formation of the transitional army. The former NPRAG [National Patriotic Reconstruction Assembly Government] president said it is in the national security interest of this nation to form a national army. He asked, and we quote him, if this country is totally disarmed, can we leave the security of this nation solely in the hands of an alien army? President Taylor said Liberians need to cautiously reflect on this question and move towards the immediate establishment of a Transitional National Army. Presently, the Liberian National Transitional Government has no army of its own, leaving ECOMOG as the only troops to provide national security.
