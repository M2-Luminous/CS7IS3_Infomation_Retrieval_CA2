FR940223-1-00042 FR940223-1-00006 The ATA also states that the change is justified by problems with the technical requirements of DFDR installation. The ATA notes that retrofit instructions and parts do not yet exist for all aircraft currently in the fleet. These engineering specifications and retrofit kits can cost up to $250,000 per aircraft type to develop, require a 40-week lead time, and must undergo FAA approval. The petition does not give any detail as to the number or type of airplanes affected by these circumstances. The ATA also restated the justifications presented in its original petition for exemption, including the variable fleet plans of carriers and the fact that the presence of an 11-parameter DFDR on an airplane does not make the operation of that airplane any safer. In January 1994, to further support its petition, the ATA presented updated information indicating that conditions in the industry have changed further, and that meeting the May 26, 1994, compliance date would be impossible for a significant number of Stage 2 airplanes because of changes in fleet plans, and equipment availability and certification difficulties. A copy of the updated data presented by the ATA has been placed in the docket. The FAA has reviewed the ATA proposal in detail and is unable to support it for several reasons. The FAA acknowledges that an economic burden results from the inconsistent timing of the Stage 3 transition rule and DFDR rule requirements, that thee burdens affect part 121 operators to varying extent, and that relief is needed that is beyond the scope of the current exemption. However, the ATA petition seeks to include all aircraft currently in the fleet, whether Stage 2 or Stage 3. The noise transition rule does not affect Stage 3 airplanes currently in the fleet; their status has not changed since the time the DFDR rule was adopted in 1988, and the ATA has presented no justification why these aircraft should be included in any relief. Further, the ATA has repeatedly argued that its member carriers revise their fleet plans on a weekly basis. However, in its petition, the ATA proposes that aircraft that would leave an operator's fleet by December 31, 1999, would not have to be DFDR retrofitted, and that those that will remain will be phased into DFDR compliance. The FAA finds it difficult to reconcile these two positions. The ATA proposal would require every affected operator to engage in considerable fleet planning if it is to know in advance which aircraft need not be retrofitted because they will not be in the operator's fleet after 1999. The same would be true of any attempt to retrofit any percentage of a fleet by specific dates. Given the admitted constant shifts in fleet plans, the FAA has determined that to make full use of a rule such as that proposed by the ATA would require complete flexibility for the operator and thus would make compliance almost impossible to monitor or establish at any given time. Further, the ATA petition is unclear in its starting point for individual operator's fleets. Given the changing fleet plans of operators, the FAA was unable to determine when there would be a ``count'' of airplanes from which to measure percentage compliance, or how that percentage would be affected by aircraft movements in and out of an individual fleet. However, as stated previously, the FAA acknowledges that some relief is needed from the combined impact of the Stage 3 transition and DFDR retrofit rules and the current equipment availability problems, at least as far as Stage 2 airplanes are concerned. Accordingly, the FAA is proposing to amend ยง121.343(c) to provide some relief to part 121 operators. This proposal seeks to limit the financial burden for DFDR installation while recognizing that there is a safety benefit from the installation of 11-parameter DFDR's. The substance of the exemption granted to the ATA and other petitioning part 121 carriers would not be affected by this proposed extension of the compliance date; a carrier may choose to maintain exemption coverage for that portion of its Stage 2 fleet listed on the Aircraft Retirement Schedule required by the exemption. Based on the outcome of this rulemaking action, however, the FAA will reexamine the exemption to ensure its continued legal applicability and compatibility with any changes made to ยง121.343 and determine whether the date for submission on an Aircraft Retirement Schedule should be amended. The Proposed Rule The FAA proposes to extend the compliance date in ยง121.343(c) for all Stage 2 airplanes subject to the Stage 3 transition rule (ยง91.801(c)). The proposed rule would require that the DFDR installation be accomplished at the next heavy maintenance check, but in no case later than May 26, 1995. The proposed extension would allow more flexibility in retrofit planning for those carriers that have experienced difficulty in obtaining engineering approval for DFDR retrofit designs, or an inability to obtain parts and installation services before the May 26, 1994, compliance date. This change may also function to bring carriers past the first interim compliance date of the Stage 3 transition rule, possibly eliminating the necessity for any airplanes to be DFDR retrofitted before they are removed from the fleet for noise compliance purposes, depending on the individual circumstances of the carrier. The proposed rule would also require that by May 26, 1994, each carrier submit to the FAA a list of its Stage 2 airplanes that will be covered under by this proposed rule change, and evidence (i.e., a binding contract) that the carrier has ordered sufficient flight data recorder equipment to meet the May 26, 1995 compliance date, either by aircraft retirement or planned retrofit. This provision is designed to ensure that carriers take full advantage of the time provided by the proposal extension.
