FR940429-0-00022 FR940429-0-00009 HUD and FmHA shall enter into grants with States, units of general local government, Indian tribes, PHAs, IHAs, and local nonprofit housing sponsors, to provide congregate services. An IHA, PHA, and local non-profit housing sponsor can enter into grants only on behalf of its project. States, units of general local government and Indian tribes may enter into grants on behalf of for profit or not for profit owners of eligible housing. Each grant agreement shall be made for a term of five years and shall be renewable (subject to the availability of funds) at the expiration of the term by the Secretary concerned. The CHSP funds will provide for not more than 40 percent of the cost of providing the congregate services program; at least 50 percent of the total cost will come from the grantee or third party organization, and at least 10 percent from the program participant (up to a maximum of 20% of the participant's adjusted income). Program participant fees may be waived by the Secretary concerned for eligible residents without income. In instances where a waiver is granted, the grantee and the Secretary concerned will share the deficit on a 50/50 basis. The grantee will develop a supportive services plan and a case management process as part of the application. Supportive services include meals, transportation, personal care (which may include dressing, bathing, and toileting), housekeeping, chore assistance, non-medical counseling, group and socialization activities, non-medical supervision, wellness programs, preventive health screening, monitoring of medication consistent with State law, personal emergency response systems, and other requested supportive services if approved by the Secretary concerned. Under NAHA, eligible housing projects that were receiving assistance under the Congregate Housing Services Act of 1978 on November 28, 1990 shall continue to receive priority for assistance funded under that Act. These grantees will receive priority for assistance under this section after the expiration of the term of the grant. Each grantee shall maintain, for the six-year transition period, the same dollar amount of its annual contributions in support of the activities eligible for assistance under this section equal to the amount contributed for such activities in the year ending on November 28, 1990. The grantee's contribution shall be equal to no less than the amount of the eligible owner's annual contribution plus any inflationary increases allowed by the Secretary concerned. At the end of six years, each grantee must meet the requirements of the new Congregate program. On October 28, 1992, the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (HCDA of 1992) was enacted (Public Law 102&hyph;550). Sections 604 and 672 of the HCDA of 1992 amended section 802 of NAHA. Section 604 amended section 802(i)(1)(B)(i) of NAHA by increasing from three to six years the period of time that grantees funded under the Congregate Housing Services Act of 1978 would be exempt from the requirement to provide 50% matching funds upon expiration of the term of the grant. It also increased the three-year requirement for maintenance of funds contributed by the grantee to six years. Section 672 of the HCDA of 1992, amended section 802(d)(4) of NAHA by requiring that service coordinators be trained in the aging process, elder services, disability services, eligibility for and procedures of Federal and applicable State entitlement programs, legal liability issues relating to providing service coordination, drug and alcohol use and abuse by the elderly, and mental health issues. On December 8, 1992, HUD and FmHA published a joint interim rule and invited the public to comment on it for consideration in drafting the final joint common rule. The public was also invited to comment and provide suggestions concerning the implementation of the retrofitting and renovation components of the Congregate Housing Services Program. The joint final rule responds to public comments on the joint interim rule. The FmHA and HUD are promulgating identical regulations applicable to the Congregate Housing Services Program. Since the regulations are identical, the text of the regulations is set out only once at the end of the common preamble. The part heading, table of contents, and authority citation for the regulations as they will appear in each CFR title follow the text of the final common rule. The entire text of the regulations as they will appear in each CFR title follows the text of the final common rule. The entire text of the regulation will appear in the respective parts of the Code of Federal Regulations of both FmHA and HUD. II. Public Comments HUD received 9 comments on the December 8, 1992, joint interim rule. The comments were from governmental entities, public housing agencies (PHAs), nonprofit organizations, HUD field offices and advocacy groups for the aging. General Comment: One comment was directed to the overall program with the commenter stating that the language in the rule was too complex and that the number of repetitions was ``dumbfounding''. The commenter stated that he would like to see a ``simple and common English explanation of how employment will impact an elderly individual's Section 8 or 236 rent subsidy, medicare premiums and 551 payments. The commenter also indicated that he would like to see a concise list of the duties of a service coordinator.
