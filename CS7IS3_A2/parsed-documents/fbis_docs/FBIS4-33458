De Leon said his country will again put forth a proposal backing the ROC's membership bid during the UN's 49th General Assembly this year, even though a similar move was aborted last year. He made the remarks in a news conference held with ROC Premier Lien Chan at the Presidential Office. Guatemala, along with six other Latin American countries, submitted a letter to UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, asking the UN to put the ROC's UN bid on the agenda for the 48th General Assembly in September 1993. Lien, leading a 21-member entourage, arrived here Thursday evening from El Salvador for a four-day official visit. Lien paid his respects to the memory of Guatemala's national martyrs Friday morning. He was later given a key to Guatemala City before he called on the Guatemalan Parliament and Guatemalan Vice President Arturo Herbruger Asturias. The Guatemalan Government also conferred a medal upon Lien for his promotion of friendly ties between the two countries. De Leon held a luncheon to honor Lien and his entourage, which includes Economic Affairs Minister P. K. Chiang, Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Fang Chin-yen, Vice Central Bank of China Governor Yu Cheng, and Government Information Office Director-General Jason Hu. Guatemala is the second leg of Lien's Central American visit. Before he flew into Guatemala, Lien spent four days in El Salvador where he attended the inauguration of Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol. Meanwhile, Economic Affairs Minister P. K. Chiang told the press here that the two countries will sign an investment guarantee agreement when De Leon visits Taipei in July. Chiang's remarks came after the two countries held wide ranging talks on economic issues, including agriculture, animal husbandry, and trade and industry technological training. According to Sun Ming-hsien, chairman of the Council of Agriculture, a bilateral agricultural cooperative agreement will be extended for five more years after it expires in November 1995.
