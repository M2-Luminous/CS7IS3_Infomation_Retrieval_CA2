Everybody knew that Jacques Chirac was calmly filling dozens of pages in a country house close to Paris. But the RPR [Rally for the Republic] president caused editorial and political surprise by publishing his initial thoughts on changing France. Thus the mayor of Paris is resuming the initiative with a view to the 1995 presidential election in the sphere of ideas, by cautiously refusing to officially reveal his intentions. "Is this a declaration of candidacy?" he was asked. "Certainly not. A declaration of candidacy is the opening of the campaign. That would be absolutely premature at this stage." Basing himself on a tough "media schedule" (30 minutes live from the City Hall at 2000 on TF1 yesterday evening; interviews with AFP, LE FIGARO, and Luxembourg Radio and Television), the RPR leader is displaying modest ambitions. He simply says that this little work of 141 pages is aimed at "fueling the big exchange of ideas" with one year to go before a crucial election for the country. "I have neither the ambition nor the desire to review all the subjects with which we are dealing or which concern us. Still less to draw up a plan for society. I have tried to provide some possible answers," the Paris mayor warns in the introduction to this book entitled A New France. Reflections 1. Dedicating his book "to post-1968 young people," the RPR president wants to win them over to his conviction that "in a changing environment, there is no greater risk than standing still." His diagnosis? At the end of the seven-year [presidential] term, France "shows the signs of a dangerously divided society, one which is dependent and, to some extent, demotivated." Is Edouard Balladur to blame? Without naming the prime minister, Jacques Chirac does him the credit of saying that "our country has been wisely governed for the past year." He even thinks that a "degree of recovery is perceptible," but reaffirmed that "the problem is still a deep one." This problem relates to the unsuitability of the existing "tools," "forged at a time of full employment, growth, and inflation" and which require "great efforts for paltry results." The RPR president, the advocate of "real changes," is convinced that the French are ready to accept the "constraints" provided these reforms are "simple, that they seem effective, that the burden is fairly distributed, and that the weakest countries are protected." Two key words define Jacques Chirac's ambition: "solidarity and social cohesion." And the solutions? The RPR leader merely defined the main axes of his social and European policy, the role of the institutions, taking up proposals made during his tour of the regions. The objective was not to submit "ready-made solutions," one of his close aides explained, but to give a few initial ideas for consideration (a second volume is planned). "I hope that the coming presidential election will make it possible to open up a real broad debate on ideas, eliminating, once and for all, the eternal personal rivalries," Jacques Chirac writes in conclusion out of an obvious concern to "rise above" these.
