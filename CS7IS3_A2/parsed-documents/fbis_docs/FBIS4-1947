Liaoning Province reaped a bumper grain harvest in 1993, having a large stock of paddy rice. However, affected by the rise of grain prices in south China, and plus our province's failure in adopting a timely macroeconomic regulation and control measure, the prices of grain and oil, particularly the prices of rice and soybean, began to fluctuate. The masses of people showed strong reaction to this. In order to stabilize the market prices, the provincial government executive meeting put forward important measures for stabilizing grain and oil prices and for guaranteeing market supply. 1. Regard the efforts in grasping grain and nonstaple foods production as an important measure for guaranteeing supply and stabilizing fluctuations and attend to this work realistically and successfully. Prior to the end of this month, we must keep the prices of grain and oil stable. The price of rice should be reduced to below 1.7 yuan per kg; the cost of rice which is lower than this price must not be raised. The price of soybean must be controlled at below 7 yuan per kg, and the price of first-grade white flour must be controlled at below 1.7 yuan per kg. 2. Strengthen management over the grain market, realistically attend to the processing and delivery of rice, and guarantee that the market will not run short of rice. Continued efforts should be made to grasp the grain and oil purchasing work and the purchase of grain for delivering to other localities so as to have a sufficient source of grain. Grain Departments should go deeply to grain depots and peasant households to conduct investigation and study and try to find out the province's grain reserve and the amount of grain in the hands of peasants as quickly as possible in an effort to provide an accurate basis for the overall regulation and control of grain. Financial and banking departments should guarantee funds for grain purchase; state grain shops should play a role as the main channel, sell grain according to the price tag, and must not raise the grain price. 3. Strengthen management over grain purchase to other provinces. Grain departments should coordinate with relevant departments to organize the export of rice in a unified manner. 4. Industrial, commercial, price, and grain departments should maintain close coordination, strengthen supervision and management over the grain market, prevent people from forcing up the grain prices or engaging in hoarding and speculation, and deal strict blows to manipulation of markets and other illegal business activities. The provincial government executive meeting stressed: All localities, while strengthening management over the grain markets and organizing supply, should conscientiously attend to the nonstaple foods project, and guarantee an ample supply of nonstaple foods. Regarding the problems emerged during market supply, we must rapidly adopt measures and solve them, and report the situation to the departments concerned as quickly as possible.
