FBIS4-52658 "dreas092_c_94012" FBIS-EAS-94-092 Daily Report 12 May 1994 North Korea Japan Criticized for Remarks, Nuclear Armament Japan Criticized for Remarks, Nuclear Armament SK1205052694 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0440 GMT 12 May 94 SK1205052694 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Who Is the Real Challenger" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- The Japanese Government authorities recently let out a string of ill-boding remarks, grossly getting on our nerves. Prime Minister Hata, referring to the "suspected nuclear development" of the DPRK in his "policy speech" at the Diet on Tuesday, said "it is a challenge" and it goes against the "ideal" of Japan heading for "the final elimination of nuclear weapons." Earlier, on Monday, Director General of the Defence Agency Kanda said in his inaugural "address" that "suspected nuclear development and missile development of North Korea are a challenge to the international community as a whole." The very one who flung down the gauntlet against the entire international community is none other than the Japanese reactionaries who are gravely threatening peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world by speeding up nuclear arming and conversion of Japan into a military power. It is Japan that has come into possession of nuclear bomb manufacturing elements including electronic destructive devices, and their technologies and started even the operation of "Monju", a fast breeder reactor, some time ago. It is also Japan that caused deep apprehensions in the international community when it was learned recently that she had stockpiled 70 kgs of plutonium in the plutonium fuel plant beside the 26 tons stockpiled earlier. Nevertheless, the Japanese Government authorities are raising a hue and cry over the "nuclear problem" of the DPRK, describing it as a "challenge". This is, in the final analysis, nothing but a crafty ruse to justify their own nuclear armament and moves to turn Japan into a military power.
