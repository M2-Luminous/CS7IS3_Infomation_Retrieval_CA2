An official of the municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce said that over the past few years, the city government has taken all possible measures to restore Tianjin's status as a commodity distribution center for the whole of northern China and turn Tianjin into an international commercial city. To date, Tianjin has formed 64 wholesale markets and 28 national and regional markets for capital goods (iron, steel, copper and other raw materials), financial trading, technology transfers and labor services, he said. According to the official, the Tianjin iron and steel market run jointly by central and local authorities, the Beiyang Rolled-Steel Wholesale Market, the Tianjin Petrochemical Trading Center and the Tianjin Textile Raw Materials Trading Center are now rated among the largest of their kinds in China. These markets have introduced a modern trading system including a membership sub-system and involving the trading of both spot goods and futures. They are now shifting to futures markets, the official said. Moreover, local commodity markets are mushrooming throughout Tianjin. On average, every 20,000 local residents are served by such a market, he said. In recent years, Tianjin's retail sales have risen at an annual rate of 20 percent, totaling 22.7 billion yuan in 1993. Furthermore, lending and borrowing in the local money market amounted to 36.6 billion yuan last year, second only to Shanghai, the official said. The figure represented a 223 percent increase over the previous year. A securities exchange and a foreign exchange swap center are growing rapidly in Tianjin. Last year foreign banks opened six subsidiaries in Tianjin, bringing the number of such subsidiaries to eight, the official said. The establishment of a comprehensive market system has made it possible for Tianjin to form four pillar industries -- automobiles and machine-building, electronics, chemicals and metallurgy, he said. These industries now account for at least 70 percent of Tianjin's industrial output value, profits and taxes. The formation of a market system has also made Tianjin more attractive to foreign investors, he said. In 1993, Tianjin approved 3,528 foreign-funded businesses, involving a total overseas investment of 2.26 billion U.S. dollars. According to delegates attending a recent economic conference, Tianjin plans to build a number of new markets this year, including a financial market, an enterprise property rights trading market, a technology trading center and a real estate market.
