How did you manage to control the security situation during war times better than during peace when many Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leaders were targets for assassinations, which was one of the reasons for the current crisis in Yemen? [Al-Mutawakkil] We thank God that the security situation fares well in spite of the existence of a conspiracy to undermine and sabotage institutions. We have unraveled many chapters of this conspiracy. In spite of this conspiracy, one can note that the security situation is satisfactory, and I hope this will remain so for a long time. [passage omitted] [Al-Jawhari] Can you give us examples of the sabotage operations that citizens have been tasked to carry out and which they have revealed to you, as well as who tasked them to do so? [Al-Mutawakkil] We have discovered many sabotage operations, including plans to blow up the television station building, and many bridges on public routes, power plants, and oil pumps. Some of the operations were carried out. However, thanks to God, they were unsuccessful. A device was detonated on the oil pipeline from Ma'rib to al-Sarif [name as transliterated] Port near al-Hudaydah. But, the citizens quickly repaired the damage. The perpetrators were identified and we arrested some of their relatives. We now are looking for the perpetrators with the help of their relatives. [Al-Jawhari] To which side do those involved in the sabotage operations that were discovered before they were implemented belong? [Al-Mutawakkil] Most of them are mercenaries who are ready to work for the party that pays them. Some confessed that the YSP paid them money, while others said they were YSP members. Their arrest has also revealed to us that some of them collaborated with leading figures within the YSP in carrying out the assassination attempts against the party's leaders. We will try these elements at the appropriate time. [passage omitted] [Al-Jawhari] House of Representatives Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar said that Tariq al-Fadli was set free. How can he and others be released without trial? [Al-Mutawakkil] I would like to clarify here that those who were detained in Aden and Lahij were released in view of the present battle because the prison doors were open. They came out and some of them are fighting. [Al-Jawhari] Fighting with whom? [Al-Mutawakkil] Some are fighting with the forces of legitimacy and others against it. Tariq al-Fadli is the only one to be released on bail because the public prosecutor, as yet, has not indicted him. Therefore, and in view of the extraordinary circumstances, he was released on bail on condition that he appear before the court as soon as conditions enabling the court to convene are made available. [Al-Jawhari] Who put up the bail for him? [Al-Mutawakkil] One of the shaykhs of the al-Fadli clan. [Al-Jawhari] And who ordered his release? [Al-Mutawakkil] The public prosecutor. No one objected to this decision. We did not object because we are passing through extraordinary circumstances. While he was under arrest, he used to ask that he be tried. Aden used to ask that he be tried in Aden, while we believe he should be tried in Sanaa. He insisted on being tried because he said he was innocent. He gave himself up because he was certain of his innocence. When the war broke out, several shaykhs pledged that he would present himself to court when asked to do so. The public prosecution agreed to this and we did not object. [passage omitted] [Al-Jawhari] Has his interrogation disclosed that he is a member of the Jihad group? [Al-Mutawakkil] I am not sure of this but the information we have indicates that he is. [Al-Jawhari] And did he fight in Afghanistan? [Al-Mutawakkil] I am not sure of this, as he was arrested before I took office. [Al-Jawhari] According to the information you have as interior minister, is there any relationship between the Jihad group and any other group in the country? [Al-Mutawakkil] The prevalence of democracy following unity has enabled political parties to work in a healthy atmosphere. The Islamic parties were among the parties that exercised their political role with complete freedom, and emerged in the Yemeni arena as an influential, positive, and constructive force that rejects terrorism. From this premise, any Islamic grouping, whatever the name it assumes, if it does not apply for a license, will be considered illegal if it carries out any activity. This is because it will be viewed as an unlicensed party. [Al-Jawhari] Has the Jihad organization applied for a license? [Al-Mutawakkil] No, and I think it is not qualified to be a party. [Al-Jawhari] Why? [Al-Mutawakkil] Because it consists of very small groups. There are two major Islamic parties, the Yemeni Reform Grouping and the al-Maqarr Party [name as published]. These two parties represent all the politically active members of the religious community. The elements of the Jihad are very few and cannot form a party or attract anybody. Their work is mostly guided. [Al-Jawhari] You have said that the Jihad organization is not qualified to be a party. Do you mean that it is not qualified because of reasons that have to do with it or because of objective reasons related to the Parties Law? [Al-Mutawakkil] Reasons related to the party itself because any party should have a minimum of 1,500 members, as I recall, before it can operate. [Al-Jawhari] What if the Jihad organization presents a list including the required number of members, will you give them a license as a party? [Al-Mutawakkil] If they abide by the rules of the political game and the laws and regulations and have enough members then why not? [Al-Jawhari] Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar says some members of the Jihad are now fighting alongside the Socialist Party. Does your information confirm this? [Al-Mutawakkil] As far as I know, some of the people who were imprisoned by the party because they were members of the Jihad are now out. Some of them are now fighting alongside the party. I think those people were employed by elements within the party to play a certain role. [Al-Jawhari] Perhaps they are fighting because they are biased toward the south? [Al-Mutawakkil] Some of the armed forces fighting with the legitimacy are one hundred percent composed of southern elements, including commanders and troops, and also the al-Wahdah brigades in al-'Anad. [Al-Jawhari] If the Jihad organization is illegal and some of its elements have carried out terrorist operations and assassinations, are all its members wanted by the security men or is this confined to those who are involved in disrupting security? [Al-Mutawakkil] From a legal point of view, we can only demand the elements that have carried out acts of sabotage. [Al-Jawhari] But the law does not permit the existence of illegal parties. [Al-Mutawakkil] So far we have been dealing with the name "Jihad" as an assumption because this name has not been announced yet. The name was mentioned only in the confessions of some defendants who said they belong to this organization. We do not have sufficient evidence and documents that prove such an organization exists. [Al-Jawhari] President Mubarak said last November that some elements in Yemen are involved in the terrorist incidents in Egypt. President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih told me then that you have explained your point of view to Egypt. I assume there have been contacts since then and that Egypt was not convinced of your view, considering its current attitude. What took place in these contacts? Have they given you documented information? [Al-Mutawakkil] We have received Egyptian security men. We have spoken to them and made it possible for them to see for themselves that these charges are baseless. When the president visited Egypt, I was with him. I met with the Egyptian interior minister and we agreed to conclude an agreement for security cooperation between the two countries to prevent terrorism in Yemen and Egypt. Regrettably, however, the agreement was not concluded because we were waiting for a representative of the Egyptian interior minister to come to Sanaa before we sign the agreement so that we can cooperate in explaining the situation. They will either tell us what we don't know about plots, camps, and elements, or we will explain the opposite to them. The representative did not show up and things developed the way they are today. The time is not appropriate now to go to Egypt and talk about signing the agreement. Whether this has any reflection on Egypt's attitude toward unity, we still hope that Egypt will preserve its historic role in Yemen and sacrifices by siding with the people who adhere to their unity. I would like to say that despite all the biased statements, we have heard from President Mubarak -- during the visits of Planning Minister al-Iryani, the foreign minister, and 'Abd-al-Ghani, member of the Presidential Council -- reassurances that Egypt will side with unity despite the lack of understanding of our stand toward the claims that we want to impose unity by force. Unity was the result of popular referendum and was bolstered through democratic elections. What is happening now is an attempt to impose secession by force. So far, they have not understood this, but attempts are still under way. We hope Egypt will continue to play a constructive role to end the bloodshed and reach a common solution and resolve differences with our neighbors who are concerned with the current problem one way or another. [Al-Jawhari] What did the Egyptian security officers who came to Sanaa achieve? [Al-Mutawakkil] The information, which they had obtained from persons here regarding the existence of terrorist training camps, is untrue and unfounded. We sent these officers to the places that they said contained these camps, but they found nothing. They also made sure that the phone numbers they had were not used in the country. [Al-Jawhari] Jordanian newspapers said that some of those who were arrested for involvement in bombing operations in Jordan early this year admitted that they had come to Yemen for training and that Shaykh 'Abd-al-Mahjid al-Zindani, representative of the Yemeni Reform Grouping in the Presidential Council, received them, sent them to training camps, and gave them money before they returned to Jordan. Did Jordan inform you of this? [Al-Mutawakkil] Never. It has not informed us of such a matter at all. Our relations and ties with Jordan are so close that Jordan would have informed us of that, if it had taken place and we would have taken measures to clarify matters, but we were not informed of anything. [Al-Jawhari] To my knowledge, Jordan informed you of the ambush to which a Jordan patrol was exposed in the township of al-Karamah late last year--an ambush during which two Yemenis were killed along with a third Jordanian citizen. [Al-Mutawakkil] This is true. Yemenis exist everywhere. We also do not deny there were Yemenis in Afghanistan and that Bin-Ladin recruited them to carry out terrorist operations in many places, including the recent bombings in Jordan. We are with the Jordanian Government and with any other government cooperating to confront terrorism, whether the terrorists are Yemenis or not. [Al-Jawhari] Did Bin-Ladin try to restore his Yemeni nationality after his Saudi citizenship was withdrawn? [Al-Mutawakkil] He did not try. Maybe he is in the Democratic Republic of Yemen, to which some sultans, like Bin-Salimah and others, have returned. Why shouldn't he too return to it? [Al-Jawhari] How many members of the YSP and the opposition parties have you arrested on the sidelines of the current war? [Al-Mutawakkil] I prefer that you pose this question to the YSP and other parties. [Al-Jawhari] In fact, I telephoned all my friends in these parties and found them free, but I do not know the members of all these parties. [Al-Mutawakkil] I assure you that we have not arrested anyone because of his political affiliation, especially the YSP members who declared their support for unity and who have helped us confront the secession and reply to the forces of apostasy and rebellion. But we have discovered warehoused weapons and espionage equipment inside Sanaa, including communications equipment, in the possession of elements of the YSP security, which was called the revolution's security. These weapons and equipment were found in public warehouses and places. They were confiscated and the perpetrators were arrested for questioning. Those who were not tasked with any duties except warehousing were released. [Al-Jawhari] What were the duties of the others? [Al-Mutawakkil] Some elements from the north and the south were tasked with carrying out terrorist operations in all the northern governorates, particularly in Sanaa, as soon as the dispute erupted. We stormed these weapons warehouses to arrest the perpetrators, many of whom managed to escape. Some of them, however, returned and said that they were ordered by the YSP leadership to carry out such operations and that they were ready to cooperate with the security forces. They are actually cooperating with us to obtain new information. [Al-Jawhari] How many YSP members are now in prison? [Al-Mutawakkil] I assure you there are no YSP members in prison. However, there are elements who do not belong to the YSP but were ordered to carry out bombing operations. When we questioned them, we discovered they were just mercenaries. There are other people who possessed weapons belonging to the YSP. These were arrested and questioned for one week and were freed. I assure you that every detained YSP member was released. Undoubtedly, some people were kept after weapons were found in their houses and after they were accused of acts of hostility, but we released them after one or two weeks. [Al-Jawhari] Have other people from other parties been arrested? [Al-Mutawakkil] No one from other parties was arrested. [passage omitted]
