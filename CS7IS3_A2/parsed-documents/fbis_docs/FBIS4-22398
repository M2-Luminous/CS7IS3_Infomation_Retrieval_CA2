Under consideration now is the possibility of acquiring power generation equipment for small GES's [hydroelectric power stations] (NOYAN-TAPAN comment: Small GES's have generating capacity between 100 kw and 10 MW.) The PRC is the world leader in terms of the number of micro- and mini-GES's and has considerable experience in making equipment for them. Liu Xueli, first secretary of the PRC Embassy in the Republic of Armenia in charge of economic issues, said in an interview to a NOYAN-TAPAN correspondent that Chinese equipment for small GES's is of good quality and inexpensive. The PRC has exported it to many countries of the world: Italy, the United States, Brazil, Turkey, Thailand, India, and so on. In the initial development of its power generation industry, China built in parallel large thermal power generation stations and small GES's. In the 1960's, when China also experienced a shortfall of electric power, the state provided incentives for construction of small GES's and small thermal power stations. The Chinese government exempted those who built small power stations from taxes. Only then did the state concentrate its efforts on building high-capacity GES's. In addition to money invested by the state itself, international credits are used in construction of these objects. Keeping in mind the geographic peculiarities of some regions in China--first and foremost in the west and south, where there are high mountains and many rivers--construction of small GES's is very profitable. "I have to point out that analogous geographic conditions exist in Armenia. And Armenia's current situation (the blockade and other difficulties) draw one's attention to hydroelectric power generation. I believe that construction of GES's is necessary in order to develop Armenia's energy sector," said Liu Xueli. As it turned out, the Chinese side has already submitted to the Republic of Armenia Ministry of Energy and Fuel concrete proposals on deliveries of equipment for our small GES's. These proposals will be studied by the Armenian side. Will the Armenian side respond to the Chinese initiative?
