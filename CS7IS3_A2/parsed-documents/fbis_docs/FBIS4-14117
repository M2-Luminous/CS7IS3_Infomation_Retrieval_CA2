FBIS4-14117 "drnes082bb_94006" FBIS-NES-94-082 Daily Report 27 Apr 1994 Inter-Arab Affairs Arab League Issues Statement on Israeli Measures Arab League Issues Statement on Israeli Measures NC2704171294 Cairo MENA in Arabic 1140 GMT 27 Apr 94 NC2704171294 Cairo MENA Arabic BFN [Text] Cairo, 27 Apr (MENA)--The Arab League General Secretariat has expressed its deep concern over the continuing Israeli measures against Palestinian citizens in the occupied Arab territories while the Palestinian-Israeli talks pass through a very delicate stage that requires Arabs to rally around the Arab negotiator. In a statement today, the General Secretariat said the Arab negotiator is fighting an important political battle to achieve the desired goal of establishing a just, durable, and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. This, the statement added, requires Israel to show its credibility toward this noble goal by halting the policy of evacuation it is still carrying out in the occupied Arab territories. The statement said that the last such incident was on the night of 18 April, when the Israeli occupation forces evacuated about 110 Palestinian families from the Yatta area in Hebron and proclaimed this 20-square km area a confiscated land. The statement noted that the Israeli authorities' campaign of arrests and wide-scale deportation measures have covered most of the West Bank and Gaza Strip cities and villages. This is Israel's largest campaign since the arrests that preceded the deportation of over 400 Palestinians in December 1992 to south Lebanon and the subsequent deportation of 2,500 Palestinian laborers who work in Israel by force and under strict military guard. The statement emphasized that these continuous Israeli measures create a tense atmosphere that does not contribute to the peace process that the Arab countries have agreed to and all countries have supported. The General Secretariat called on the international community, especially cosponsor countries of the peace conference the United States and Russia, to force Israel to adhere to international legitimacy resolutions, provide international protection for the Palestinian citizens, implement the Fourth Geneva Convention that stresses the protection of civilians who are under occupation, and halt its arbitrary measures against the Palestinians in the occupied territories so that an appropriate climate will prevail to continue the peace process. This process, the statement added, aims to end the bloody conflict in the region and to work toward achieving security, stability, and development for all the region's nations.
