After a meeting between Dr. Frank Mdlalose of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and Jacob Zuma of the ANC, the two leaders announced at a media conference in Pietermaritzburg today that a satisfactory solution had been found. The only outstanding issue is the question of control of the police. Vusi Sithole is on the line with details of the agreement. [Begin recording] [Sithole] We asked them about the police portfolio, which had been the bone of contention, and they said, unfortunately, there were certain issues in the constitution which did not allow them to proceed with some of the matters that they would have loved to finalize today, but that [passage indistinct] [Daniels] Is it more favorable to the ANC? [Sithole] What we got from Mr. Jacob Zuma was that they were happy with the agreement that they had reached. [Daniels] So what is the new allocation with the crucial portfolios? [Sithole] OK, the portfolios stand like this: Mr. Jacob Zuma is going to take on the portfolio of economic affairs and tourism, and then the portfolio of public transport and control is Mr. S'bu Ndebele, and Dr. Zweli Mkhize will head the health services portfolio here. [Daniels] Now some of the Inkatha people that have lost their portfolios now -- what's going to happen to them? [Sithole] We, unfortunately, could not get anything out of Dr. Mdlalose about that, save to say that agreement has been reached and that everybody was happy with the latest arrangement. Dr. Mdlalose said that now Natal -- KwaZulu/Natal -- had a chance to pick up where it had ended and was looking forward to a very bright future for the province, and that they were going to do their best to make this work.
