The usual methods are being employed to see who can inflict the worst bite. An official spokesman for the Moldovan president has issued a statement on the election campaign, in the course of which M. Snegur's is being bandied about in a variety of contexts and for a variety of reasons. Opposition political forces are accusing him, in particular, of not failing to give international publicity to the conflict in the Dniester region and of bringing about economic disaster in the republic. The president rejected all these charges as absurd and unsubstantiated. Snegur promised to issue a statement in the very near future "in response to irresponsible accusations by those who have turned patriotism into a trade" and to name those who are really to blame for the bloody conflict on the Dniester. Snegur once again peremptorily brushed aside suspicion of being involved in affairs connected with a branch of the Seabeco firm, which is headed by his son-in-law. Finally, he expressed confidence that the people will make their choice and thereby dot all the "i's."
