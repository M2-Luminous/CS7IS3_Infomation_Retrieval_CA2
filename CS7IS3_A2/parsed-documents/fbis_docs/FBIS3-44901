Washington has refused to extend immediately the 16-nation Transatlantic alliance's security umbrella to Central and Eastern European nations, but offered verbal solace instead. "The security of the states that lie between Western Europe and Russia affects the security of America," said Vice President Al Gore in a speech today at the Institute of World Affairs in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. But words are far from formal and quick membership in NATO that countries such as Poland, Hungary, the Czech and Slovak Republics are desperately seeking. Washington's "partnership for peace" proposal, which Clinton will formally present to the NATO summit next week in Brussels, Belgium, only gives the applicants a "junior membership." Under the U.S. plan, any Central and Eastern European nation, including republics of the former Soviet Union, can become a "partner for peace" in NATO and participate in military training and political cooperation. Polish President Lech Walesa described the Washington proposal as "short-sighted and irresponsible." The criticism was echoed by other Eastern European leaders. It is unclear whether John Shalikashvili, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Madeleine Albright, Washington's ambassador to the U.N., will be able to convince the leaders when they visit the area, starting today. Shalikashvili and Albright will join Clinton in Prague next week in meetings with leaders of the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and the Slovak Republic. Clinton had planned to deliver the Milwaukee speech himself, but his 70-year-old mother's death earlier today prompted the change. However, he will depart for Europe Saturday [8 January] night as scheduled. This will be one of his three planned trips to Europe this year. The other two occasions are the celebration of the 50th anniversary of D-Day in the Second World War in France and the Group of Seven's annual economic summit in Italy.
