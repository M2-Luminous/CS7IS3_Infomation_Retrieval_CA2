The approximately 40 students were taken in for questioning after demonstrating for a quick handling of an alleged banking scam said to involve collusion between high officials and businessmen, Antara said. The students were rounded up by a company of soldiers from the garrison in the Indonesian capital. Antara said that the students, from two separate groups -- the Youth and Student Committee against Corruption and Collusion and the Representative Group of Universities Throughout Indonesia -- were whisked to the Central Jakarta Police station. The agency said a duty officer at the police post, contacted by telephone, declined to give any information on the students. The students were demanding that authorities quickly resolve the so-called Bapindo affair, named for the state-owned Bank Pembangunan Indonesia (Bapindo), which lost 613 million dollars after issuing business credits to an ethnic Chinese businessman. They also demanded that several senior Bapindo officials be investigated. Press reports since the disclosure of the scam in February have said several top officials of the bank are believed to be implicated in or have knowledge of the alleged scam. Bapindo issued a letter of credit to Eddy Tansil's Golden Key group for the import of 430 million dollars in goods for five projects, but the document was later converted into a "red clause" letter of credit, under which the beneficiary can draw on the money though the goods have not yet been shipped, the attorney general's office said. The credits have not been repaid, and interest and other charges have brought the total loss to 613 million dollars. The attorney general has detained Tansil and three former high- ranking Bapindo executives for questioning and has scheduled a trial for Tansil next month. The attorney general has also frozen the accounts of one of the bank's executives but none of the officials have so far been questioned in the case.
