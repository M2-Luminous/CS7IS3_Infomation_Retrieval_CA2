Speaking briefly with reporters in the city of San Pedro Sula in northern Honduras, Reina pointed out that the conspirators initially intended to set a factory on fire but later thought it "a better deal to assassinate the president." "A white book is going to be opened to outline in detail everything that has happened in this case and the people will be informed," the Honduran president said. Reina reiterated that this is a case of "gangsters or drug traffickers who came to Honduras to burn down a paint factory and then perpetrate a kidnapping, but it occurred to them that it might be a better deal to kill the Honduran president." Reina's statements corroborated local media reports to the effect that Hernandez Sosa, who yesterday surrendered to the authorities accompanied by human rights leaders, is involved in drug trafficking. Hernandez Sosa, 30, was turned over to the police in Tegucigalpa, who were unaware of his whereabouts, after appearing in court escorted by members of the (government) National Human Rights Ombudsmanship. The alleged conspirator, who is being held in a special cell at the National Penitentiary and under strict surveillance by Army troops, pointed out: "It is stupid to think that I wanted to murder the president." In a brief message he sent to the media today, Hernandez Sosa requested that his family be informed that he is well, has faith in God, and will emerge unblemished from this case. The newspaper LA PRENSA reported today that Hernandez Sosa allegedly hatched the plot against the president to "slip away" from a group of alleged drug traffickers to whom he owed money. According to this report, Hernandez put the plan together with an unspecified quantity of money given to him by cocaine addicts, who were now demanding their money. A government source today told ACAN-EFE that there is proof of Hernandez Sosa's drug trafficking activities, which will help resolve the alleged plot against President Reina, about which the Honduran authorities were notified on 13 March by the Nicaraguan Government. Meanwhile, two of the three Nicaraguans implicated in the plot have been arrested by the Nicaraguan police, who have not made any disclosures regarding the depth of their involvement in the plot. The detainees are Luis Rene Quintero, who alerted the Nicaraguan authorities to the plot and helped thwart it, and Santiago Rivas who has denied any involvement. Meanwhile, Roger Arguello's whereabouts are unknown. Honduran Armed Forces Chief General Luis Alonso Discua said last Wednesday that the investigation of the plot has been "dashed" because of the information that has been leaked by the press. Certain opposition politicians have not dismissed the possibility that the alleged plot against Reina is a "smoke screen" to distract the people's attention from the country's economic problems.
