FR940407-0-00007 FR940407-0-00002 The size standard for the Chicken Egg industry, SIC code 0252, was primarily based on industry data contained in the SBA's 1986 Small Business Data Base (56 FR 55617) and became effective on November 29, 1991. Accordingly, the inflation adjustment for this industry is calculated in this final rule based on the inflation between calendar year 1986 (the base period) and the fourth quarter of 1993. Using the same methodology discussed above, the Implicit Price Deflator for GDP increased 28.9 percent during this period based on deflators of 96.9 for calendar year 1986 and 124.9 for the fourth quarter of 1993. The $7.0 million size standard for this industry will, therefore, increase to $9.0 million. The 1987 Census of Service Industries and 1987 Census of Retail Trade Industries, published by the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of the Census, were primarily used to establish the size standards for Computer Services, SIC codes 7371 through 7379 (57 FR 27907), and for Motor Vehicle Dealers (New and Used), SIC code 5511 (57 FR 4837). Their size standards became effective on July 23, 1992 and March 11, 1992, respectively. Accordingly, the inflation adjustment for these two industries will be calculated based on inflation between calendar year 1987 (the base period) and the end of 1993 in this final rule. Using the same methodology discussed above, the Implicit Price Deflator for GDP increased 24.9 percent during this period based on deflators for calendar year 1987 (the base period) of 100.0 and for the fourth quarter of 1993 of 124.9. Based on these calculations, the $14.5 million size standard for Computer Services will increase to $18 million and the $17 million size standard for Motor Vehicle Dealers (New and Used) will increase to $21 million. Two other industries had their size standards further changed after the general 1984 inflation adjustment, but these changes were based on industry specific data for 1982 and 1984. These are the industries of Travel Agencies, SIC code 4724 (53 FR 18820) (1982 data), and Real Estate and Managers, SIC code 6531 (50 FR 27418) (1984 data). The SBA believes no adjustment is needed to the real estate industry size standard to correct for the double-counting of inflation since the increment of change in inflation between 1982 and 1984 is insufficient to cause a different size standard than the one established in this rule. An additional issue which is addressed in this final rule is the resolution of an employee or revenue-based size standard for industries in the computer services industries (SIC codes 7371&hyph;7379). On June 23, 1992, the SBA published an interim final rule in the Federal Register , 53 FR 27907, establishing a $14.5 million size standard for all nine industries in the computer service industries. However, in that rule the SBA continued to seek information on the adoption of an employee-based size standard for some or all of the computer service industries. After consideration of the comments received on that issue, the Agency believes that it lacks sufficient information regarding procurement patterns among this group of industries to justify such a significant change as shifting to an employee-based measure of size. As discussed above, the SBA is now establishing these industries' size standards at $18.0 million in this final rule. In effect, the much larger issue of adjusting SBA's size standards for inflation has at least partially superseded the issue of whether to use a revenue or employee-based size standard for this group of industries. Thus, the Agency has decided to first implement an inflation adjusted revenue-based size standard for these industries and then review its program results with these higher size standards in place. At that time, SBA may propose an appropriate rule change. SBA believes that the higher revenue-based size standards for the computer services industries established in this final rule may substantially meet many of the concerns of those seeking a employee-based size standard. As indicated in the proposed rule, four footnotes (footnotes 8, 12, 15 and 16) are adjusted to be consistent with the inflationary adjustments. Size standards for Offshore Marine Services (part of SIC Major Groups 44 and 45), Retail Sale of Aircraft (part of SIC code 5599), Leasing of Building Space to the Federal Government by Owners (part of SIC Major Group 65) and industries without a specific size standard listed in SIC Division I-Services, are being established at $20.5 million, $7.5 million, $15.0 million, and $5.0 million, respectively.
