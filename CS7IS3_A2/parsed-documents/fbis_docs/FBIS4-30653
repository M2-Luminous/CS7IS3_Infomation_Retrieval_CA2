Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad, after a meeting with President Suharto, said that the deregulation is not merely aimed at boosting investment, efficiency and productivity, but also at raising business and employment opportunities and expediting development. "The objectives are to increase the economic and national strength and endurance," the minister said, adding that the deregulation includes import duties, tariff surcharges and check prices. President Suharto on Monday received nine senior ministers in connection with the newly announced deregulatory package. Under the new deregulation, import duties on textile machinery and components as well as textile dyes are reduced from 10 to 25 percent, while duties on agricultural machinery has been reduced by five to 20 percent. Import duties on tools and machinery for small scale industries such as sewing machines, lathes, drills, carpentry tools, dressing machines and other tools have been reduced to five percent or totally eliminated. He said that the import duty on the completely built-up (CBU) passenger car and station wagon has been reduced by 25 percent, while for spare parts for the semi-trailer, it has been reduced to 10 percent and duties on spare parts for the work-truck have been eliminated. "Import duties on components and sub-components for the assembling of heavy duty equipment are completely lifted beginning on January 1 next year," he added. In the agricultural sector, the minister said that import duties on some products such as wheat and rice flour, yellow soybeans and cane sugar, that have so far been imported by the National Logistic Board (Bulog), have been eliminated. Import duties on corn, soybean meal, potatoes, coffee, tea, sunflower seeds, margarine, fish meal, shrimp meal, processed fish, processed food and livestock, barley, peanut meal and sorghum have been reduced by five percent. "The import duty on coconut and palm oil have been reduced to zero percent," he added. He said that any price distortion caused by "dumping" activities will be prevented by "anti-dumping policies". The government also decided to increase the import duty on 38 tariff codes for products containing a certain alcohol content. Of the 38 tariff codes, import duties on 33 tariff codes have increased by 170 percent, four tariff codes by 80 percent and one by 70 percent. Trade Minister S.B. Judono said that the aim of increasing the import duty on goods with alcoholic content was to minimise the domestic consumption of alcohol which has had a negative impact on society. On the occasion, the finance minister also announced some regulation changes giving small scale entrepreneurs and cooperative agencies easier access to funds provided by state-run companies (BUMN). The stipulation on what funds raised from BUMN can be used for has been expanded, the maximum limit on the share of BUMN surplus allocated to small scale businesses (which currently stands at 500 rupiah million per BUMN) has been eliminated, and efforts are being made to ensure that one percent of the BUMN's surplus is allocated to the scheme.
