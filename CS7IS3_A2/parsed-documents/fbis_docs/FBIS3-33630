The imbalance that has occurred due to the balance in hand situation, taking into consideration the 1994 budget compared to what is really available. 2. The direct dependence between the investment budget and foreign credits resources. 3. The structural problem of the government budget where current resources do not cover the costs of operations. 4.

The need to take measures to control public expenses as of right now, so we will spend only what we can afford. Panamanians are confronting several challenges and problems which we must extensively analyze to try and find the best solutions. We have decided to send you this note, and we apologize for not sending a copy to each person individually, but we wanted you to know to whom we sent a copy so as to guide public opinion in a responsible manner. At first, we thought of inviting you to a meeting at the Comptroller General's Office to give you more details and explanations, but we think it would be difficult at this time because of your many duties. We are at your service for any additional explanations you may need. Yours truly, [signed] J. Chen Barria, Comptroller General Report to the president Your Excellency: Early in January 1994, you asked me to present our preliminary impressions of the 1994 national budget and the country's fiscal situation before the Cabinet Council. When some changes took place in the Cabinet Council in early 1994, you once again expressed concern for the difficult 1994 fiscal situation of the government, and you asked us, on Thursday, 3 February, to present before the new cabinet during its first formal session a report on the 1993 budget implementation and our comments for 1994, which we are doing in writing in this note. 1. The constitutional framework: Budget Equilibrium. Article 267 of the Constitution of the Republic establishes that expenditures will balance with revenues in the budget prepared by the Executive Branch. Therefore, the Constitution requires that the budget is balanced. 2. Law 32 of 31 December 1993. This is the law by which the national state budget was approved. Article 135 says: "The general state budget consists of estimating revenues and the maximum authorized expenditures that central government institutions, decentralized entities, public enterprises, and intermediator financial organizations can commit to for the corresponding term. [no closing quote marks as published] The Comptroller General's Office is not responsible for preparing the General Budget of the nation. This law establishes the state general budget in the amount of 3.9044 billion balboas, of which 1.9286 billion balboas correspond to the central government budget (Annex No. 1). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |The Revenue and Expenditures Budget of the Central Government is as follows (| |in billions of balboas): | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total Revenue |1.9286 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Current Revenue |1.4158 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Capital Revenue |.5128 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [Text]The estimated capital revenues include: -- Resources from foreign credit in the amount of 324.3 million balboas (loans from international financing institutions, credits, and donations from governments and other institutions.) -- Balance in hand and in the bank for 96.2 million balboas. (Annex No. 2) Details of the expense budget are as follows: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Operation costs |$ 1.5479 billion | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(Public debt) |(493.0) million | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(Operation transfers) |(269.5) million | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Investment costs |380.67 million | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The $1.5479 billion in operation costs includes $493.0 million in public debt service expenses and $296.9 million in transfers to other agencies. 3. Why does 1994 start with a projected fiscal deficit of $79.6 million? It is necessary to indicate that the budget process begins several months before the end of the fiscal year so cash balance estimates are subject to variations and adjustments, especially during the last two months of the year when public agencies expedite their bids and requests for the submission of prices, as well as the issuance of contracts and payments. The 1994 budget included an estimated cash and bank balance of $96.2 million, but this did not happen. The fiscal year which ended on 31 December 1993 showed a cash and bank balance of $16.6 million, which immediately results in a budget shortage as follows: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Law No. 31, 12/31/94 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cash and bank balance |$ 96.2 million | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Comptrollership General of the Republic, 31/12/93 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Budget shortage |16.6 million | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Budget deficit or shortage |$ 79.6 million | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4. How is the 12/31/93 cash balance determined? We have implemented strict expense controls since we assumed the post of comptroller, without affecting government operations. By 10 December, we had a projected deficit of $28.4 million for 31 December 1993. The measures we adopted include the following: 4.1 We canceled 1990, 1991, and 1992 purchase orders which had not been formally made. This represented $10.2 million in our books. 4.2 We also proceeded to annul the 1990, 1991, and 1992 budget reserves. This represented $23.2 million in our books. 4.3 Additional contributions to the 1993 budget came from IPAT [Panamanian Tourism Institute], the National Beneficent Lottery, and the National Mortgage Bank. 4.4 Savings from November and December public expenses. 4.5 We continued to finance the 1993 cash and bank balance, $83.6 million, including government agencies' debts, which have yet to reimburse the central government for the amounts paid to the IFI's [International Financial Organizations] on their behalf. (Annex No. 3) 5. Why were all financial allotment requests not registered in 1993? The comptrollership general received financial allotment requests, which were to be included in the 1993 fiscal year, from ministries and agencies and legislative projects for $72.9 million. (Annex No. 4) These reserve requests are listed as follows: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Operation reserves |$ 13.2 million | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Investment reserves |59.7 million | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Logically, the $72.9 million could not be reserved. Therefore, the comptrollership general reserved the following: -- Formally signed contracts. -- Formally signed purchase orders. -- Projects subject to public bids. -- Subsidies to decentralized entities. A total of $16.8 million were reserved for formally signed documents. 6. Why were all the legislators' projects not registered? Legislators had submitted requests, through notes, to reserve $22.7 million for their "parliamentary initiatives." (Annex No. 5, listed by legislator) The reserves were not created because of the following reasons: 6.1 There were no documents on public bids. 6.2 There were no written requests for reserves. 6.3 If the reserves had been created, this would have resulted in a fiscal deficit which would have reduced the cash balance and increased the budget deficit for the 1994 fiscal year. 6.4 Legislators have the opportunity to request that their "parliamentary initiatives" be registered for the 1994 fiscal year. 7. What is the financial situation of the 1994 budget? By not having the estimated cash balance of 96.2 million balboas and with a budget imbalance of 79.6 million balboas, the Comptroller General's Office has established the 1994 budget situation 11 months ahead of time, and is asking all ministers, deputy ministers, and all public institution directors and assistant directors to curb public spending, especially in the following areas: Personnel (appointments and promotions). Public services (Institute of Hydraulic Resources and Electrification, National Institute of Telecommunications, and National Water and Sanitation Institute). Per diems and trips abroad. Fuel. 8. What does execution of the investment budget depend on? There is a structural problem in the Panamanian state's public finances. Panamanians do not save; the government does not [two previous words in upper case] save or collect sufficient income through taxes and its institutions are not profitable. Consequently, public investments must be financed by putting ourselves in debt and thereby increasing the debt service. The central government's 1994 investment budget is 380.7 million balboas, of which 318.9 balboas are from direct investments. How will these investments be financed? By putting ourselves more in debt. According to estimates, the country will receive 324.3 million balboas in foreign credit. It will be broken down as follows: 8.1 Conditional loans from IFI's, 183.9 million balboas. 8.2 Financing without conditions, 76.7 million balboas. 8.3 Agreements with foreign governments, 63.7 million balboas. Mr. President, the question is: What will happen if this financing is not obtained as expected? Will we meet the IFI's requirements to obtain its disbursements? 9. What is the great responsibility of the Ministry of Treasury and Financing? The central government's budget estimates current revenue collections will total 1.4158 billion balboas, which will be allocated to cover, along with other income, the central government's operating expenses, estimated at 1.5479 billion balboas. What will happen if the Ministry of Finance and Treasury is unable to collected the budgeted amount? From now, this Ministry must take appropriate measures to avoid tax evasion, contraband, etc. so as to obtain the estimated current revenues. Otherwise, the 1994 deficit will increase. 10. The Public Debt Service Whoever governs Panama in the future will face one of the most serious problems in public finances, the government, the economy, and the country in general. The public debt service. The 1994 budget contemplates 493 million balboas for servicing the internal and external public debt. This figure, which is already high, does not include debt servicing of the San Jose Pact, Japanese and European bonds, or commercial banks. When agreements for restructuring the previously mentioned debts are achieved in the future, servicing the Panamanian public debt will be one of the most serious economic, financial, and fiscal problems for future leaders and the Panamanian people. The debt corresponds to the country and its inhabitants and not the administration that may be in office. 11. The important role of the MIPPE [Ministry of Planning and Economic Policy], Ministry of Finance and Treasury, and the Comptroller General's Office. Article 147 of Law No. 32 establishes the following: If at any given time during the fiscal year, MIPPE, together with the Ministry of Finance and Treasury and the Comptroller General's Office, considers that revenues may be lower than the total expenses authorized in the government's budget, it will present a spending reduction plan before the Cabinet Council to avoid incurring a deficit. This presentation will be followed by appropriate legal actions, including the corresponding approval of the Legislative Assembly Budget Commission. This action, after approval has been duly granted, will be considered a modification to the state general budget, as set forth in Article 205. In light of this situation, we present, we think, Mr. President, that those of us who have the legal responsibility to take appropriate action must begin our task. 12. Can funds not used in 1993 be reallocated? We suggest the remaining 1993 budget reserves, which were not used due to the aforementioned reasons, be considered for inclusion in the 1994 budget. This will allow them to be used so as to take advantage of the institutions' 1993 efforts. 13. Special 1994 credits against current revenues. Given the 1994 financial situation, it is necessary to point out the limitations we are facing for addi?ional credits, whose financing will come from current revenues in 1994. Consequently, the Comptroller General's Office will not approve said credits if the current situation does not improve. On this lengthy but necessary note, we wished to state, in detail, the fiscal situation, with the desire of observing the wise popular saying, which goes: "We must use only what we have at hand." Respectfully and truly yours, J. Chen Barria, Comptroller General
