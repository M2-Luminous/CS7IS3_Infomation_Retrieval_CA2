FR940622-2-00044 FR940622-2-00033 [OPP&hyph;180943; FRL 4872&hyph;8] Receipt of Application for Emergency Exemption To Use Imidacloprid; Solicitation of Public Comment AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: EPA has received specific exemption requests from the California Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Pesticide Regulation (hereafter referred to as the ``Applicant'') to use the pesticide imidacloprid (CAS 105827&hyph;78&hyph;9) to treat up to 22,000 acres of broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, and rapini, and up to 40,000 acres of head and leaf lettuce, to control the silverleaf, or sweet potato whitefly ( Bemesia tabaci ). The Applicant proposes the first food use of an active ingredient; therefore, in accordance with 40 CFR 166.24, EPA is soliciting public comment before making the decision whether or not to grant the exemption. DATES: Comments must be received on or before July 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: Three copies of written comments, bearing the identification notation ``OPP&hyph;180943,'' should be submitted by mail to: Public Response and Program Resource Branch Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, D.C. 20460. In person, bring comments to: Rm. 1132, Crystal Mall #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA. Information submitted in any comment concerning this notice may be claimed confidential by marking any part or all of that information as ``Confidential Business Information.'' Information so marked will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. A copy of the comment that does not contain Confidential Business Information must be provided by the submitter for inclusion in the public record. Information not marked confidential may be disclosed publicly by EPA without prior notice. All written comments filed pursuant to this notice will be available for public inspection in Rm. 1132, Crystal Mall No. 2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Andrea Beard, Registration Division (7505W), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW, Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Floor 6, Crystal Station #1, 2800 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA, (703) 308&hyph;8791. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to Section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator may, at her discretion, exempt a state agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue specific exemptions for the use of imidacloprid on broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, and head and leaf lettuce to control the silverleaf whitefly (SLW). Information in accordance with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part of these requests. Whiteflies have been a problem in the ``desert-cropping systems'' in California and Arizona for some time, but in 1990, a new strain (possibly a new species) was discovered, which appears to be much more prolific than the standard strain, and resistant to many insecticides. Whiteflies are common on many wild and cultivated crops such as tomatoes, cotton, cucurbits and solanaceae. The Applicant states that this new strain caused devastation to many crops in 1991 in California's Imperial Valley, with crop losses over $120 million. Whiteflies cause direct damage through feeding activities and indirectly through the production of honeydew which enhances sooty mold development. The Applicant claims that adequate control of this pest is not being achieved with the currently registered compounds. The Applicant claims that without control of this pest, growers could expect up to 50 percent yield losses, causing significant economic losses. The Applicant proposes to apply imidacloprid at a maximum rate of 0.3016 lb. active ingredient (20 fluid oz. of product) per acre with a maximum of one application, at or near planting, per crop season on a total of 62,000 acres of the above-listed crops. For each of the crops named, it is possible to produce two crops per calendar year on a given acre, and therefore, the acreage could potentially receive two applications of imidacloprid per calendar year. However, the Applicant proposed to limit the maximum amount which could be applied per calendar year to 0.5 lb. a.i. (32 fl. oz. product) per acre. Therefore, use under this exemption could potentially amount to a maximum total of 31,000 lbs. of active ingredient, or 15,500 gal. of product. This is the second time that the Applicant has applied for the use of imidacloprid on the named crops, and exemptions were issued for this use in California last year. This notice does not constitute a decision by EPA on the application itself. The regulations governing section 18 require publication of a notice of receipt in the Federal Register and solicit public comment on an application for a specific exemption proposing the first food use of an active ingredient. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written views on this subject to the Field Operations Division at the address above. The Agency, accordingly, will review and consider all comments received during the comment period in determining whether to issue the emergency exemption requested by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation.
