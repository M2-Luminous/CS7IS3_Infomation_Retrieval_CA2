FR940314-0-00022 FR940314-0-00004 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;132&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8854; AD 94&hyph;06&hyph;06] Airworthiness Directives; Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes, that requires certain maximum brake wear limits to be incorporated into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program. This amendment also requires that the Airplane Flight Manual be revised to include certain procedures concerning operations in the event of a rejected takeoff (RTO). This amendment is prompted by an accident in which a transport category airplane executed an RTO and was unable to stop on the runway due to worn brakes; and the subsequent review of allowable brake wear limits for all transport category airplanes. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent the loss of brake effectiveness during a high energy RTO. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 13, 1994. ADDRESSES: Information concerning this amendment may be obtained from or examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mark Quam, Aerospace Engineer, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2145; fax (206) 227&hyph;1320. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes was published in the Federal Register on November 1, 1993 (58 FR 58307). That action proposed to require that certain maximum brake wear limits be incorporated into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program; and that the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) be revised to include certain procedures concerning operations in the event of a rejected takeoff (RTO). Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. One commenter supports the proposal. Another commenter, the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, questions the need for the proposed AD. This commenter is aware of the FAA's efforts to review and determine allowable aircraft brake wear limits, since those efforts prompted the issuance of a series of AD's, applicable to U.S.-manufactured airplanes, to mandate maximum brake wear limits. While those U.S.-manufactured airplanes were certified to new brake criteria, the commenter points out that airplanes such as the Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100, which were certified under the Joint Airworthiness Regulations (JAR) criteria, are certified to worn brake standards. In light of this, the commenter questions why the FAA indicated that the proposed AD was prompted by the 1988 accident involving worn brakes on a McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10 airplane. This commenter states that U.S. operators of Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes, at the time of airplane delivery, implemented within their maintenance programs the same worn brake criteria as proposed in the notice; additionally, these operators' FAA-approved AFM's already reflect this criteria. Therefore, this commenter argues that there is no basis for adopting the proposed rule unless it can be shown that U.S. operators cannot safely administer to certified brake wear criteria within their approved maintenance programs.
