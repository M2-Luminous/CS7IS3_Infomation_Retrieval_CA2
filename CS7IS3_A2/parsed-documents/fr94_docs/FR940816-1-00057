FR940816-1-00057 FR940816-1-00009 No public comment has been provided to the Service for the Notice of Intent published on April 7, 1994, to promulgate a rulemaking with regard to regulations for migratory bird hunting by American Indian tribal members. Comment Procedure Special circumstances in the establishment of these regulations limit the amount of time that the Service can allow for public comment. Two considerations compress the time in which this rulemaking process must operate: the need, on the one hand, for tribes and the Service to establish final regulations before September 1, 1994, and on the other hand, the unavailability until late July of specific reliable data for each year's status of waterfowl. Therefore, the Service believes that to allow a comment period past August 31, 1994 is impracticable in terms of publishing timely rulemakings and contrary to the public interest. It is the policy of the Department of the Interior, whenever practicable, to afford the public an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, interested persons may participate by submitting written comments to the Director, (FWS/MBMO), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, 634 ARLSQ, 1849 C St., NW, Washington, D.C. 20240. Comments received will be available for public inspection during normal business hours at the Service's Office of Migratory Bird Management in Room 634, Arlington Square Building, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203. All relevant comments on the proposals received no later than August 31, 1994 will be considered. NEPA Consideration Pursuant to the requirements of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(C)), the ``Final Environmental Statement for the Issuance of Annual Regulations Permitting the Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds (FES&hyph;75&hyph;74)'' was filed with the Council on Environmental Quality on June 6, 1975, and notice of availability was published in the Federal Register on June 13, 1975, (40 FR 25241). A supplement to the final environmental statement, the ``Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement: Issuance of Annual Regulations Permitting the Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds (SEIS 88&hyph;14)'' was filed on June 9, 1988, and notice of availability was published in the Federal Register on June 16, 1988 (53 FR 22582), and June 17, 1988 (53 FR 22727). In addition, an August 1985 environmental assessment titled ``Guidelines for Migratory Bird Hunting Regulations on Federal Indian Reservations and Ceded Lands'' is available from the Service. Endangered Species Act Considerations Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531&hyph;1543; 87 Stat. 884), provides that, ``The Secretary shall review other programs administered by him and utilize such programs in furtherance of the purposes of this Act'' (and) shall ``insure that any action authorized, funded or carried out *␣*␣* is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of [critical] habitat *␣*␣*'' Consequently, the Service has initiated Section 7 consultation under the Endangered Species Act for the proposed migratory bird hunting seasons including those which occur on Federally recognized Indian reservations and ceded lands. When completed, the Service's biological opinion resulting from its consultation under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act may be inspected by the public in, and/or are available to the public from, the Division of Endangered Species and Habitat Conservation and the Office of Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C. 20240. Copies of these documents are available from the Service at the address indicated under the caption ADDRESSES . Regulatory Flexibility Act, Executive Order 12866, and the Paperwork Reduction Act In the April 7 Federal Register , the Service reported measures it had undertaken to comply with requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ) and Executive Order 12866. These included preparing an Analysis of Regulatory Effects, preparing a Small Entity Flexibility Analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and publishing a summary of the latter. This information is included in the present document by reference. This action was not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. This rule does not contain any information collection requiring approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3504. Authorship The primary author of this proposed rulemaking is Dr. Keith A. Morehouse, Office of Migratory Bird Management. List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 20 Exports, Hunting, Imports, Transportation, Wildlife. Based on the results of soon to be completed migratory game bird studies, and having due consideration for any data or views submitted by interested parties, this proposed rulemaking may result in the adoption of special hunting regulations for migratory birds beginning as early as September 1, 1994, on certain Federal Indian reservations, off-reservation trust lands, and ceded lands. Taking into account both reserved hunting rights and the degree to which tribes have full wildlife management authority, the regulations only for tribal or for both tribal and nontribal members may differ from those established by States in which the reservations, off-reservation trust lands, and ceded lands are located. The regulations will specify open seasons, shooting hours, and bag and possession limits for rails, coot, gallinules (including moorhen), woodcock, common snipe, band-tailed pigeons, mourning doves, white-winged doves, ducks (including mergansers) and geese. The rules that eventually will be promulgated for the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season are authorized under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) of July 3, 1918 (40 Stat. 755; 16 U.S.C. 703 et seq.), as amended. The MBTA authorizes and directs the Secretary of the Interior, having due regard for the zones of temperature and for the distribution, abundance, economic value, breeding habits, and times and lines of flight of migratory game birds, to determine when, to what extent, and by what means such birds or any part, nest or egg thereof may be taken, hunted, captured, killed, possessed, sold, purchased, shipped, carried, exported or transported. Dated: August 1, 1994. George T. Frampton, Jr., Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;20038 Filed 8&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;55&hyph;P
