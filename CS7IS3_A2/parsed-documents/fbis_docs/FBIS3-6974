The Health-Social Affairs's stern action, however is feared to trigger trade friction with the United States which sent a senior official of the U.S. Trade Representative's Office to file a protest. Peter Collins, assistant deputy U.S. Trade Representative, arrived here March 11 to lodge a formal protest with the ministry over its reluctance to allow the American products to go through customs in Pusan. At the same time, the incident has all the appearance of turning into the discovery of major irregularities committed by government officials who are under investigation for possibly taking bribes from the importers. At least 20 former and incumbent officials of the Pusan customs and quarantine office, and the National Institute of Health are facing a special audit by the ministry. According to ministry officials, 24 importers of American sausage, mostly chicken and turkey franks, have been taking in shipments of frozen products since 1990 even though they should have been refrigerated instead. Among the 24 companies are Kotco Co., Yongmi Trading Co., Sejung Industrial Co., Oksan International, Ambrose Deli House, E.A.C. Korea, Jinyong Food Co., Yonbang International and Myongjin I.C.I. Under the Food Sanitation Law, frozen sausage has an expiration date of 90 days from the day of production whereas refrigerated products must be sold within 30 days, an official of the ministry's sanitation Safety Section said. Realizing that it would be impossible to market the products here since the time required for shipment and customs clearance runs up to almost 30 days, the importers apparently resorted to freezing the products to buy more time. "However, freezing the products for shipment then defrosting them in the process of distributing and getting them to consumers through department stores and supermarkets, can only result in the breeding of microorganisms, thus making them obviously hazardous to health," he explained. The official admitted that the legal period for distribution varies from state to state with some providing longer periods, at least more than 30 days, it is a rule of thumb that the importing country's standards must be observed. "We understand that while there are some frozen sausages in the United States, most of them are refrigerated since heat is applied on the products during processing," he noted. Under related regulations, the heat-treated sausages are recommended to be refrigerated at between 0-10 degree centigrade depending on the ingredient and the processing methods. The import of heat-treated sausages began in 1990 and an estimated 4,800 tons, estimated to be worth 19 billion won (approximately 25 million U.S. dollars), were shipped here, almost exclusively from the United States.
