Production is folding fastest at enterprises in the light and woodworking sectors. Dissatisfaction with the volume of output has reached a record level of 83 percent in December. For 81 percent of enterprises the demand in December was inadequate.

The balance differential (the indicator of the speed of change in the process) fell over one month from -37 percent to -41 percent. The general acceleration of the decline was fueled mainly by enterprises in the woodworking and light industries, where the balances registered at -56 percent and -50 percent. At the same time, the pace of decline remains stable at machine-building enterprises--about -40 percent. The continuing production decline resulted in increased dissatisfaction over the state of affairs at enterprises. The share of "below norm" answers reached a record level of 83 percent in December. In December 1992 this indicator stood at 66 percent. The traditionally high dissatisfaction with the December volume of output in machine building (80-91 percent) was "fortified" by an increase in the share of "below norm" replies at enterprises in the woodworking (from 61 percent to 89 percent) and light (from 68 percent to 83 percent) industries. The situation has improved somewhat in the construction industry--the result of our construction workers' habit for shock labor in the end of the year. Another positive (although unclear for how long) factor was an increased hope for production growth among enterprises that consider their level of production "below normal." While in November the share of such hopes registered at 7 percent, in December it was 12 percent. However, this category of respondents also displayed a certain degree of pessimism--further decline in production has been forecast at 46 percent of such enterprises (38 percent in October and 40 percent in November). A decline in satisfaction with the demand for the output produced continued in December. The share of "below normal" replies set a new record (81 percent). A decline in demand has been noted by enterprises in all industry groups, with the exception of the construction materials industry and printing. The maximum number of "below normal" replies was received in the light (89 percent vs. 73 percent in November), machine-building (87 percent vs. 85 percent in November), and woodworking (67 percent vs. 62 percent in November) industries. Demand limitations are beginning to exert a corresponding influence on the behavior of an increasingly greater number of goods producers--already 49 percent of the enterprises that consider the demand for their output unsatisfactory foresee cutbacks in production (the analogous indicator for November was 40 percent). The neutral reaction to insufficient demand also declined--in December only 40 percent of the enterprises with insufficient demand intended to sustain the current level of production. Previously, this indicator stood at 54-57 percent. A sharp decline in demand, noted by enterprises in October-November 1993, immediately resulted in the increase of excess inventories of finished products. However, cutbacks in production, which did indeed follow the decline in demand, permitted enterprises in general to halt the growth of excess inventories. Nevertheless, the share of "above normal" replies reached 78 percent in the light industry (63 percent in November), 56 percent in woodworking (38 percent in November), and 50 percent in the construction industry (40 percent in November). At machine-building plants excess inventories declined from 56 percent to 49 percent, and in the food processing industry the "below normal" replies are more frequent than "above normal." Still, only about one-half (48 percent) of the enterprises with excess inventories plan to cut back production in the next few months. Expected Changes in Production and Prices In December increasingly more enterprises expected a production decline. The share of "will decline" answers reached 42 percent--a record level for the past 15 months. The hope of maintaining the existing level of production declined to 46 percent (54 percent in November). The highest expectations of cutbacks have been registered in the petrochemical industry (63 percent of enterprises), machine building (50 percent), and the light industry (39 percent). At enterprises in the metallurgical, food processing, and printing industry the prevalent answer was "no change." Production growth is possible only in the woodworking industry, where the share of "will increase" answers (44 percent) is higher than that of "will decline" answers (23 percent). The expected changes in the volume of production affect the producers' pricing policy. Enterprises that foresee an increase in production are less likely to plan to raise prices on their products than enterprises that expect a decline in production--74 percent as compared to 84 percent. Since the beginning of the fall, surveys register a decline in inflationary expectation in industry--the forecast of price increases for the output produced has dropped from 96 percent in September to 81 percent in December. A lower level of inflationary expectations was last registered in October 1992 (79 percent). The smallest expectation of prices rising within the next few months are in the food processing industry (where the balance of "will increase"-"will decline" measured at 56 percent), the construction industry (67 percent), and machine building (78 percent).
