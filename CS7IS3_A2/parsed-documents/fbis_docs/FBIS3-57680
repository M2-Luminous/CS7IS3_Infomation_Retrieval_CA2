The communique states that Lebed has called the Dniester leaders "alcoholics and mafiosi who sold and lost in booze-ups the Moldovan Dniester Republic." He said that "the direct presidential governing is now introduced in Dniester and the Soviets will be dissolved; as a consequence the Moldovan Dniester republic disappears until February 28th. Russia has its problems and no one will be concerned about Dniester as long as the present leadership is at power." According to the communique, Lebed also stated that Dniester did not need its own army and that the Dniester Ministry of Defence required too much armament from the 14th Army.
