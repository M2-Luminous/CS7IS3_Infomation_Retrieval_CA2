He made the remark this morning shortly before leaving for Washington where he will attend the signing at the White House tomorrow of an agreement on the Muslim-Croatian federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Papoulias is going to Washington as president of the European Union's [EU] General Affairs Council. Answering correspondents' questions, the foreign minister said that the reply to Vance will be sent through diplomatic channels and described the Vance ideas as a good start. To another question, Papoulias said he would meet in Washington with Hans Van Den Broek, EU commissioner in charge of foreign affairs, who, as the Greek foreign minister noted, submitted a document to the EU to which the Greek side has replied. Asked by correspondents what the Greek position would be if the Turks sent troops to Bosnia, Papoulias stressed that the Greek position was outlined in a communique issued by the President's Office. Asked if Turkey is sending blue helmet troops to Bosnia, the foreign minister said: A decision was made on the party leaders' level. According to the communique from the President's Office, Greece insists on its basic position that no Balkan force should become involved. We persist in attempting to avert such a thing and in persuading those who want to send the Turks that this would complicate the Balkan situation.
