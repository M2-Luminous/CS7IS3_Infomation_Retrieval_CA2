FR940621-0-00041 FR940621-0-00017 Benefits_Automatic ELT's Based on the findings of the FAA/NASA report (cited earlier), significant improvements in ELT effectiveness will reduce the time required to locate downed airplanes and, concomitantly, improve the chances of saving seriously injured crash survivors. Additional benefits will be realized from reducing false alarms. The report's most significant conclusions are that: 23 to 58 lives are lost per year due to ELT's failure-to-operate; 12 to 18 percent of these are attributed to poor or no maintenance; and, with 100 percent TSO&hyph;C91a installations, a 64 percent failure rate reduction can be expected. In addition, a 75 percent reduction in false alarms is likely with all new units in place (although not directly specified in the report, this evaluation estimates that 25 percent of false alarms, in contrast to the 12 to 18 percent of ELT failures-to-operate, are attributable to poor or no maintenance). Consequently, using the midpoints of the range of lives lost (41) and the range attributed to maintenance failures (15 percent), 22 or more lives could be saved annually if all TSO&hyph;C91 ELT's were replaced with TSO&hyph;C91a ELT's (41 x (1^.15) x .64), decreasing to approximately 18 annually as general aviation activity decreases during the 20-year evaluation period. Since ELT replacements will take place gradually over time, avoided fatalities will not reach their full potential for several years after the period. Nevertheless, 81 fatalities are expected to be avoided during the 20-year period following promulgation of the rule, valued at $209 million ($86.4 million discounted). The additional benefits expected from reduced false alarms are calculated as follows. False alarms are estimated to cost approximately $4.3 million annually (based on a $3.5 million estimate for 1987 by the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center, adjusted to 1993 dollars). Excluding the 25 percent of false alarms attributable to maintenance-related problems, the expected reduction in false alarm costs totals $2.4 million annually ($4.3 million x .75 x (1^.25)). Taking into account the gradual, increasing percentage of the fleet equipped with new ELT's over the 1995&hyph;2014 evaluation period, these benefits are projected to total $8.9 million ($3.7 million discounted). Benefits_Survival ELT's There is no direct evidence of lives lost as a result of delays in reaching survivors because of defective survival ELT's; however, such occurrences are possible. Historical data indicate that an average of 61 preventable drownings occur per 10-year period in parts 121 and 135 operations. Over the course of the 1996&hyph;2015 evaluation period, only one life needs to be saved in order for the benefits of new survival ELT's to exceed the $0.8 million in discounted costs. Comparison of Cost and Benefits Costs and benefits summarized below are for the evaluation period 1995&hyph;2015 in terms of 1993 dollars at 1994 discounted present value. Automatic ELT's are estimated to have incremental costs totalling $10.2 million and benefits of $90.1 million, yielding a benefit-to-cost ratio of 8.8 to 1. Incremental costs of survival ELT's are estimated to total $0.8 million, requiring the avoidance of only one fatality in order to be cost-beneficial.
