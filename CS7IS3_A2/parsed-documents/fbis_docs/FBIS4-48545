Mr. Aidid narrated the long struggle of the Somali people since 1943 in which the Somali people strived for justice and self-determination. However, this has always been spoiled by foreigners and their surrogates who had their own interests. Talking about the struggle against foreigners and recent meetings held in some Horn of Africa countries where ways of finding a solution to the Somali crisis were discussed, he said that from now on, as agreed, all meetings on self-determination for the Somali people will be held in the country. This will allow the Somali people to participate and to know who is serving their interests and who is obstructing the achievements of unity and progress.
