FR940912-1-00079 FR940912-1-00018 Monday September 12, 1994 Part III Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration 49 CFR Chapter III Zero Base Review of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations; Proposed Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 175␣/␣Monday, September 12, 1994␣/␣Proposed Rules DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Highway Administration 49 CFR Chapter III [FHWA Docket MC&hyph;92&hyph;33] Zero Base Review of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs); Critical Regulatory Issues Being Researched AGENCY: Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of critical regulatory issues; reopening of public docket; request for information. SUMMARY: The FHWA is providing a listing of critical regulatory issues to be researched under the second phase of its zero base regulatory review. These regulatory issues, framed as questions, resulted from a series of public hearings held throughout the country during late 1992 and early 1993. The hearings were held to obtain information, views, opinions, and recommendations on the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) from representatives of the motor carrier industry, the insurance industry, enforcement personnel, universities, and other interested parties. The FHWA will be conducting a comprehensive literature search to identify completed or existing research studies that will provide insight on these critical issues. The FHWA is seeking information from individuals and organizations who may have conducted research that addresses the issues provided in this notice, who know about research that has been conducted, or who can identify others who have completed or are in the process of completing research. DATES: Information on the identification of relevant research studies will be collected until further notification in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Please submit the name of the research organization(s), the title and date of the relevant study or studies, the name of the principal researcher(s), etc., to FHWA Docket MC&hyph;92&hyph;33, Room 4232, HCC&hyph;10, Office of the Chief Counsel, FHWA, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. All information received will be available for examination at the above address from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., e.t., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. Those desiring notification of receipt of information must include a self-addressed, stamped postcard. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. David J. Osiecki, Office of Motor Carrier Standards, (202) 366&hyph;4340, or Mr. Charles E. Medalen, Office of Chief Counsel, (202) 366&hyph;1354, Federal Highway Administration, Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. Office hours are from 7:45 a.m. to 4:15 p.m., e.t., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The concept of the zero base review is to take a completely fresh look at the safety regulations governing the interstate motor carrier industry. The objective of this project is to improve the regulations so they: (1) Have a more dramatic positive effect on safety and the reduction of accidents, (2) are more easily understood by the industry, (3) have a greater performance orientation, and (4) are easier to interpret and enforce. The first phase of this project was initiated in 1992 when FHWA opened a public docket and notified all interested parties through the Federal Register on August 18, 1992 (57 FR 37392) that it would be holding a series of public hearings to obtain comments and recommendations for improvement of the FMCSRs. Pursuant to the August, 1992, notice, and two subsequent notices in the Federal Register (57 FR 53089 and 57 FR 60784), 11 public hearings and 14 focus-group sessions were held throughout the country. In addition, the public docket which opened on August 18, 1992, was subsequently closed effective April 1, 1993, pursuant to 57 FR 60784. This initial phase of the zero base project was completed in September 1993, with the development of a final report, completed in three volumes, summarizing the recommendations received at the public hearings, the focus-group sessions, and through letters to the public docket. Many of the critical issues provided later in this notice are a direct result of information and recommendations received during Phase I. The final report, Zerobase Review of the FMCSRs, for Phase I is available to the industry and the general public through the National Technical Information Service in Springfield, Virginia (1&hyph;800&hyph;553&hyph;6847 or local 703&hyph;487&hyph;4650), for a nominal fee. The access and report numbers are as follows for each volume: Volume I, Executive Summary PB94&hyph;100294, Report No. FHWA&hyph;MC&hyph;94&hyph;002; Volume II, Data Analysis PB94&hyph;100302, Report No. FHWA&hyph;MC&hyph;94&hyph;003; Volume III, Data Summary PB94&hyph;100310, Report No. FHWA&hyph;MC&hyph;94&hyph;004. The second phase of this project is currently underway and involves a literature search for existing research studies that may shed light on the critical regulatory issues provided later in this notice. The FHWA will also develop a new format and structure for the rulebook of the future during this phase. The second phase is scheduled for completion in calendar year 1996. The third phase of zero base, which will begin in calender year 1996, will involve the actual writing of the new regulations. As the new regulations for the rulebook of the future are finalized, the FHWA will initiate the fourth and final phase of the project, which will involve drafting and disseminating non-regulatory, user-friendly guides for specific industries or segments of the regulated population. The FHWA is seeking information from the public on these critical regulatory issues to supplement its planned literature search effort to locate research data. Following are the critical regulatory issues on which the FHWA is seeking information: Applicability, Administrative, and Other Requirements 1. Applicability a. In the definition of a commercial motor vehicle (CMV) established by the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984, should FHWA ask Congress to substitute for the term ``gross vehicle weight rating,'' which now defines the agency's jurisdiction, the term ``gross vehicle weight rating or gross vehicle weight''? [see §390.5] b. At what GVW or gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) should the commercial driver's license (CDL) regulations, alcohol and drug testing regulations, and the FMCSRs apply? [see §§382.103, 383.3, 383.5, 390.3 and 390.5] 2. Exemptions and Waivers a. Should there be exemptions? b. What are the minimum documented grounds to justify exemptions or waivers for unique operating circumstances (e.g., logging, farming, utilities, etc.) or localized circumstances (e.g., emergencies, etc.)? [see §390.3] 3. Reading Level and English Requirement a. At what comprehension level are the current FMCSRs written? b. At what comprehension level should the new regulations be written for better customer understanding? c. Is there justification to require drivers to be able to read and speak the English language? [see §391.11(b)(2)] 4. Aid and Abet a. Should FHWA ask Congress for jurisdiction over non-hazardous materials (HM) shippers? b. Should FHWA ask Congress for jurisdiction over entities such as non-HM shippers, insurance companies, health care professionals, etc. who may aid and abet violations of the FMCSRs? [see §390.13] 5. Financial Responsibility a. Are the current levels of financial responsibility sufficient? [see §§387.9 and 387.33] b. Should additional types of motor carriage (i.e., private motor carriers of passengers) be required to meet the minimum levels? 6. Part 397 Could part 397 be included in part 177? What would be the result of such a change?
