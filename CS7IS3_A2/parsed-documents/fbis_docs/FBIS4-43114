The joint statement which was supposed to be issued at 1800 [1500 GMT] has not been issued yet, because of arguments among the member countries concerning the agreement on the reduction of the conventional forces in Europe [CFE] and on the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict. The news conference to be held by NATO's acting secretary general at 1800 has been postponed for the same reason. In fact, Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin was to have held a news conference at 1915. His news conference has been postponed for the same reason. However, the foreign minister is now here with us. Mr. Minister, welcome. What is the reason for the delay? [Cetin] Of course the delay should be received with understanding. Some 38 countries have come together. Furthermore, countries that used to be enemies in the past. The NATO and former Warsaw Pact countries used to be enemies for a long time. Now, a new organization and a new working system is being set up envisaging their cooperation. Consequently, you need the 38 countries to agree on the joint statement. There were long arguments about two issues, like you said. One of them concerns the CFE; Russia wanted to include in the statement that this issue will be discussed by the countries involved. Long arguments and negotiations were held. In the end, an agreement was reached not to include that in the statement. The second issue is also understandable. Azerbaijan and Armenia, which are members of the NACC, are in conflict with each other, in fact Armenia has occupied Azeri land. These two countries are expected to reach an agreement. Naturally, it took some time for them to agree. In the end, an agreement was reached, and the problem of the statement was resolved. Of course, the negotiations are still going on. The ministers are continuing to express their views on general issues. I will go back to the meeting soon. [Aygun] There are certain misunderstandings between NATO and Russia concerning the signing of the Partnership for Peace [PFP] agreement. How do you view the relations between Russia and NATO? It seems that the process of signing the PFP will take some time. [Cetin] Everything is being done to ensure that it will not take long. Russia wants to establish with NATO different kinds of relations than the relations of the Central and East European countries. It wants to change the PFP agreement into special relations. The Russian defense minister made certain proposals in connection with this matter a while ago. The answer of the NATO ministerial council, of the 16 member countries, was clear: Special relations will not be established with any country. Only the PFP framework agreement can be signed. However, given Russia's position and the contributions it can make to Europe, and to peace and stability, certain special cooperation fields can be developed with it after it signs the PFP agreement. Mostly, in line with the contributions Russia will make in the implementation of the agreement, more cooperation possibilities can be developed. Another framework agreement will not be signed. A second demand by Russia that was not accepted -- the Russians had several requests which were mostly accepted -- was to turn the NACC into an independent organization from NATO, in fact, into a superior organization to NATO. This will not be accepted. NATO has to continue with its former power and former identity. The ministers agreed on that absolutely. In other words, NATO cannot be turned into an organization where certain countries and Russia will have the right to veto. NATO cannot be turned into a secondary organization in Europe. NATO is determined to maintain its former identity. Within this framework, all the countries want Russia to sign the PFP framework agreement as soon as possible. As I said, Russia can be expected to make higher contributions to peace and stability. New cooperation possibilities can be developed in line with its contributions. A proposal was made to sign an additional protocol together with the PFP agreement. This was rejected as well. [Aygun] You are saying that NATO is not making any concessions. [Cetin] Yes, NATO is remaining loyal to its principles. It does not want to differentiate first class countries and second countries among the countries with which it is establishing relations under the PFP agreement. They must all sign the same framework agreement. [Aygun] Thank you, Mr. Minister.
