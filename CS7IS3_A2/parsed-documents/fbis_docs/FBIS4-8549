As is known, an Albanian officer and one soldier were killed. In a letter to the president of the UN Security Council, Mr. Colin Keating, on Tuesday, the Albanian foreign minister, Alfred Serreqi pointed out that the incident is "a grave terroristic act," "A massacre of the people while they were sleeping," and "a serious violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Albania with clear and premeditated aims." This act aims not only at deteriorating the present relations between the two countries but also to the aggravation of the situation in the Balkans, the letter says. It is part of a coordinate strategy, in order to create premises for the expansion of the conflict in the south of the Balkans." The Government of the Republic of Albania asks the Security Council to denounce powerfully the Greek Government and to rank Greece among the countries that exercise state terror, and to make pressure on the Government of Greece, demanding it to throw light on this grave incident, to find out and punish the authors of the crime. On wednesday, the Albanian Foreign Ministry declared "persona non grata" the Greek general consul in Gjirokaster "because of his activity not in accordance with his status." In revenge for this act, the Greek Government adopted the same measure against the first secretary ofthe Albanian Embassy in Athens, Kastriot Robo.
