Admitting the difficulty in handling a variety of issues with only minority support, Hata said at a plenary session of the House of Councilors that he will seek cooperation from the opposition parties. Hata's response to the questions by Takushi Hirai, a member of the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), however, were for the most part repetitions of his remarks on Thursday in the House of Representatives. Hirai pointed to the shaky standing of Hata's minority government and made a renewed call for the prime minister to step down. Hata said he will respect an agreement among the coalition partners on key issues in April, before the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the second largest opposition, stormed out of the coalition. The premier said he will seek cooperation from the SDP in line with the platform and will also "consult frankly with the LDP" in coping with the pending tasks. The SDP walked out of the ruling coalition immediately after it helped put Hata in office over moves among some coalition components to form a new Diet bloc, excluding the SDP. Hata also reiterated that the government will make efforts to pass the proposed tax reform through the Diet by the end of the year after compiling the draft bills in June. On the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear arms program, Hata said the government will cope with any emergency, if one should occur, with solid unity, while stressing the importance of solving the issue through diplomatic efforts. Hata, commenting on Japan's bid for permanent membership of the UN Security Council, suggested that Japan is seeking the permanent membership with veto power, like the current five permanent members -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States. Germany also has said it is interested in joining the council as a permanent member with veto power.
