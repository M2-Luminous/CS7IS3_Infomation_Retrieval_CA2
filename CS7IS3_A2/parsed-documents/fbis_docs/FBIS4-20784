The Government today assured the Rajya Sabha that foreigners will not be allowed to control the private banks that are proposed to be set up in the country. Replying to the brief debate on the Banking Regulation (amendment) Bill, 1994, which the House approved after a division, the Minister of State for Finance, Dr. Abrar Ahmed, said that under the guidelines of the Reserve Bank of India the proposed private banks could not hold more than 20 per cent of the capital. Non-Resident Indians could have 40 per cent of the total capital, he said. The Minister said the provision of appointing part time chairmen for the proposed banks would be confined to the private banks and the nationalised banks did not come under its purview. He said the loss-making bank branches operating in the rural areas would not be closed down. "The Reserve Bank had so far permitted nine banks to be established in the private sector and one of them had been issued a licence. Adequate measures had been taken to ensure safety of the deposits in such banks," he said. BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] Abstains The Rajya Sabha passed the Bill 1994 by 61 to 26 votes in an Opposition-pressed division in which, however, the Bharatiya Janata Party did not participate. The BJP members, during the discussion on the Bill, opposed several provisions in it and also the ordinance promulgated in this connection before the budget session of Parliament began. Earlier, the House rejected by voice vote the statutory resolution moved by Mr. Viren Saha (BJP) and others for the disapproval of the January 31 ordinance. The Bill also replaces the ordinance. `Provisions Will Not Be Misused' Dr. Abrar Ahmed assured the House that the provision for appointment of a part-time chairman in the private banks would not be misused. He said the Government in no way would be involved in the process as these appointments would be made by the private banks themselves. However, he said, these appointments would be ratified by the Reserve Bank of India. Referring to steps being taken to improve the banking system, the Minister said the Government had taken measures to strengthen the capital adequacy norms of the banks. Computerisation Referring to the need for improving the quality of services rendered by the nationalised banks, the Minister said the Government was committed to computerisation of the banking operation, which would help in improving the efficiency of the banks. In this context, he said the Government was in constant touch with the union representatives for implementing the computerisation programmes. Regarding the closure of loss-making branches of nationalised banks, Dr. Ahmed said that as many as 102 branches had been identified by the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) for closure. However, he assured the members that none of these identified branches in rural areas would be closed and no bank employee would be retrenched. Opposition Charge Earlier, participating in the discussion, the Opposition members charged the Government with bringing the privatisation in the banking sector under the "alibi" of inefficiency in the public sector banks and at the behest of the International Monetary Fund. Members from Left parties, the Janata Dal and the BJP expressed apprehension that the reforms in the banking sector would only benefit the rich and would entirely ignore the poor population in both rural and urban areas. The members also severely criticised the Government for its frequent resort to issuing ordinance, bypassing Parliament. Mr. Viren Shah of the BJP questioned the hurry for the ordinance when Parliament was to meet in three weeks' time. He moved the statutory resolution disapproving of the ordinance. Ordinance Questioned Dr. Ashok Mitra (CPI-M) (Communist Party of India-Marxist), said the Narasimham committee report was out in December 1991 and the Government waited for two years to take action on the report. He said he was unable to fathom the `sudden rush' to issue the ordinance as if without it the whole banking operations would have come to a standstill. Were any of the provisions in the ordinance implemented till now? he asked and said that according to him nothing had been done till today. Describing the Narasimham committee as the "local surrogate of the IMF," Dr. Mitra said the amendment of the Bill was being done at the behest of the international financial institutions.
