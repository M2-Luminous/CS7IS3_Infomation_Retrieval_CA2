FBIS4-35114 "drlat125_r_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-125 Daily Report 20 Jun 1994 Peru Congressman Views U.S. Radar Station Closings Congressman Views U.S. Radar Station Closings PY2806215094 Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 20 Jun 94 p A4 PY2806215094 Lima EL COMERCIO Spanish BFN [Text] About 30 light planes were reportedly detected or intercepted during the time U.S. radar installations to help drug enforcement were operating, but clandestine drug flights allegedly total over 10,000 per year. This was announced by Congressman Julio Castro Gomez (MDI) [Democratic Left Movement], who presides over the subcommittee that investigates this crime. The U.S. radars were installed in Yurimaguas and Andoas about two years ago. Castro Gomez said the military chief of the Upper Huallaga emergency zone had stated that 10,000 trafficking planes enter the country every year. He added that the capture of trafficker Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, aka "Vaticano," has not decreased the flow of drugs despite the belief that Chavez controlled the trafficking industry. Castro Gomez said: "The quantity of cocaine base and cocaine hydrochloride leaving the country has not changed." He announced the arrival of U.S. State Department officials who will meet with local officials and explain the suspension of the U.S. cooperation provided by the radar installations. He recalled that this support ended on 1 May when the Yurimaguas and Andoas radar installations stopped sending information to the Peruvian Air Force on planes entering Peruvian airspace. [EL COMERCIO] Have trafficking flights increased since the radar stopped operating? [Castro Gomez] Obviously, the lack of a means to detect flights makes it easier for trafficking gangs to operate, taking drugs out and bringing weapons and dollars in. The U.S. State Department officials should have come here first before making the decision to ended the cooperation. I believe the time has come to evaluate that mechanism for drug enforcement in the country. [EL COMERCIO] How many tonnes of drugs are transported? [Castro Gomez] We believe between 1,500 and 2,000 tonnes leave the country every year. [EL COMERCIO] How much does that represent in money? [Castro Gomez] A very large amount. About $1.3 to $1.5 billion enters the country for the sale of cocaine base and byproducts. [EL COMERCIO] Does that enter our free exchange market? [Castro Gomez] Yes. It enters the free exchange market where the Central Bank and the commercial banks also operate. We have a narco dollar-ridden economy which depletes the competitivity of our exports and keeps the dollar rate low. Castro Gomez recognizes that the radar installations forced traffickers to change their behavior. [EL COMERCIO] How did they change? [Castro Gomez] They stopped flying during the day and began flying at night even though night flights are also detected by radar. Now the actions of our Air Force are restricted because it does not have the night flying equipment for its Tucano planes. [EL COMERCIO] Has an investigation been carried out about the alleged support given to traffickers by some officials? [Castro Gomez] Some Air Force personnel in charge of airports in the emergency zone provided support. They have been charged with trafficking. They allowed light planes to land and take off after receiving their "share" from the traffickers. [EL COMERCIO] Are we facing an endless problem? [Castro Gomez] It is a problem. Traffickers corrupt because of their large profits and huge recourses. Overall formulas to deal with it and defeat it must be sought.
