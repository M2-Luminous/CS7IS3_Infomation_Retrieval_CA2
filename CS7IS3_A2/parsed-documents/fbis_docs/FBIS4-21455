In this case the time factor is particularly important, because at issue are pesticides, for which the season of massive use is fast approaching. When using the word ``massive'' one should not only bear in mind the tonnage involved but also the array of this type of agricultural chemical that exists -- the list of permitted pesticides contains over 500 names, but in reality, counting all the possible combinations, the number is in the tens of thousands. This wide choice, like its legalized status, definitely does not please either ecologists or farmers. Evidence of this were the heated discussions that occurred at two board meetings of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, even though the professionals gathered there are usually pretty much unfazed by (as the ``green'' press likes to phrase it) the latest evidence of ecocide. One thing remains quite clear: a negative situation with regard to this super-toxin can be found in a majority of Russia's regions. However, it is difficult to say anything specific about each oblast -- of the 206 functioning analysis offices only 24 are capable of monitoring pesticides in the soil, and only 30 can monitor pesticides in water. A Russian State Committee for Hydrometeorology soil study done in 17 krays and oblasts found that soils were most polluted in forests (37-52 percent of area) and in cropland used to grow vegetables (18 percent) and grains (11 percent). The most pesticides are applied in Krasnodar and Stavropol krays and in Voronezh, Kursk, Ryazan, Moscow and Nizhegorod oblasts. In terms of environmental effects the situation is worst in the Northern Caucasus, Rostov Oblast, the upper and middle Volga regions, Maritime Kray, the area around Moscow and Chelyabinsk and Kurgan oblasts. It is not only soils that are polluted: according to data from regional environmental protection agencies, in 1992 alone there were 994 cases in which bodies of water were poisoned. As a result, the Russian Federation Committee on Fishing recorded massive fish kills in the watersheds of the Volga River and the Sea of Azov. Pesticide runoff from adjacent fields into the Mechetka River (Rostov Oblast) killed as many as two million pike, carp, knottyhead and perch. A total of 84,000 fish died in the Anna River, which flows into Cheboksary Reservoir, as a result of hops cultivation along the river's banks. Insects are of course harmed by pesticides, but not just the harmful ones. For example, in Bryansk and Ryazan oblasts there have been instances of large number of bees being killed, resulting in a sharp drop in the yield of crops pollinated by them. The reason for the deadly effects of agricultural chemicals is not only their excessive use, but also a lack of modern equipment and insufficient knowledge about equipment servicing and chemical storage. According to available statistics, 52 percent of storage facilities do not meet environmental protection requirements. In a majority of cases that classification means that chemicals are stored virtually out in the open. As for equipment service, as a rule little time is wasted on that --equipment is sent directly out to the fields, loaded there and washed out there without ever being properly decontaminated. In addition to all this, the Ministry of Agriculture finds itself the owner of 100,000 tonnes of unusable pesticides. No one knows how to destroy them safely, and the problem is a heavy burden on the Waste Program. The whole grim list of Russia's pesticide users should immediately suggest some obvious conclusions: firstly, creation of an adequate map of pesticide usage distribution, particularly since the most likely sites can already be predicted. Secondly, establishment of an effective system for monitoring the storage and efficient use of pesticides. Thirdly, provision of an effective legislative foundation that will require violators to take responsibility for eliminating damages caused by them, if only by paying for recovery efforts. And, finally, a fundamental answer to the question of why we need such a vast array of pesticides, a number out of proportion even to the rich palette of our immense country's natural conditions. But accomplishing all this will be a truly monumental task.
