Shusei Tanaka said, "Hosokawa's proposal was scrapped in a jiffy because the government skipped an important process for a reformist cabinet and only followed the pace of administrative needs." In an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE, Tanaka said "the government cannot get support from people on (the tax system) unless it makes achievements in the ongoing administrative reform and rectifies the inequitable tax system." "The premier had stressed that radical administrative reform and rectification of the inequitable tax system are prerequisites before implementing (full-scale) tax reform and he still hopes to do that," Tanaka said. But Hosokawa's intention was not manifested and instead he pushed forward with the idea to implement income tax cuts as well as a "national welfare" tax, he said. "The role of a reform-oriented administration is to change the outmoded social systems, that is to say, to change political, administrative and economic systems and to establish a new 'stage setting' for a new era," he said. Tanaka stepped down as special adviser to Hosokawa on January 31 shortly after the Diet enacted a set of four political reform bills, saying his job of helping to enact political reform was done. He is currently acting leader of Sakigake (Harbinger), a small coalition component headed by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. In an early morning news conference on February 3, Hosokawa unveiled a "national welfare tax," a 7 percent levy on almost all goods and services, that was to take effect in April 1997, replacing the current 3 percent consumption tax. The new revenues were partly aimed at financing a 6 trillion yen income tax reduction. The proposal, however, provoked fierce opposition from the leading coalition bloc, the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDSPJ], which threatened to leave the alliance unless the new tax proposal was dropped. Hosokawa's decision to implement the tax measures was done without the consent of the SDPJ, the largest of the seven-party coalition. The coalition parties revoked Hosokawa's proposal the following day and struck a deal to implement the 6 trillion yen tax cut in advance of formulating other measures to secure the lost revenue.
