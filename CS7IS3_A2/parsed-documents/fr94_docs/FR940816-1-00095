FR940816-1-00095 FR940816-1-00012 In calculating the passing score on approved tests, the Secretary has proposed to base that passing score on one standard deviation below the mean for students with high school diplomas who have taken the test within three years before the date on which the test is submitted to the Secretary for approval. In this way, the Secretary has proposed that recipients of Title IV, HEA program funds without high school diplomas have a rough comparability with recipients with high school diplomas. To maintain that comparability under the State process method, the Secretary proposes to approve state processes if the success rates of students it admits under the State process are within 95 percent of the success rates of high school graduates who are enrolled in the same educational programs at the institutions that participate in the State process. A ``success rate'' is a simple measure of the rate at which students complete their programs or are making progress toward that completion. For this purpose, the Secretary considers that students are making progress toward the completion of their programs if they are still enrolled in an institution at the end of an award year. Executive Order 12866 These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently. Burdens specifically associated with information collection requirements, if any, are identified and explained elsewhere in this preamble under the heading Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations, the Secretary has determined that the benefits of the proposed regulations justify the costs. The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal governments in the exercise of their governmental functions. To assist the Department in complying with the specific requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any potential costs or increase potential benefits resulting from these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and efficient administration of the program. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The small entities that would be affected by these proposed regulations are small institutions of postsecondary education and test publishers. These regulations would safeguard Federal funds and reduce potential abuse in the Title IV, HEA programs. These changes will not significantly increase institutions' workloads or costs associated with administering the Title IV, HEA programs. In the case of test publishers, these businesses are compensated for any services they provide. Therefore, these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 Sections 668.143, 668.144, 668.145, 668.147, 668.148, 668.149, 668.151, 668.152, 668.153, and 668.155 contain information collection requirements. As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Department of Education will submit a copy of these sections to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)). This NPRM contains records that would affect test publishers, postsecondary institutions, and students that do not have high school diplomas or recognized equivalents and that wish to apply for Title IV, HEA programs. The information used by test publishers for annual reporting and recordkeeping is readily available in publishers records. An estimate of the total annual reporting and recordkeeping burden that will result from the collection of the information is 98,375 hours for 196,750 responses. The collection activity associated with the State process is incorporated in various sections through the regulations. All other burden associated with the maintenance of records of the student's ability-to-benefit is already cleared under the individual programs of Federal financial assistance for which these students may be applying under regulations governing institutions administering these programs. Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection requirements should direct them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, Room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington, D.C. 20503; Attention: Daniel J. Chenok. Invitation To Comment Interested persons are invited to submit comments and recommendations regarding these proposed regulations. All comments submitted in response to these proposed regulations will be available for public inspection, during and after the comment period, in Room 4318, Regional Office Building 3, 7th and D Streets, S.W., Washington, D.C., between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday of each week except Federal holidays. Assessment of Educational Impact The Secretary particularly requests comments on whether the proposed regulations in this document would require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of the United States.
