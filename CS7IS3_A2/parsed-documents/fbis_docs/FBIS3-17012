Despite the press service explanations that the president's health does not cause concern, disinformation has been insistently repeated, a statement issued by presidential spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov on Monday said. It becomes increasingly obvious that obtrusive attempts to impose a thought upon the population that Boris Yeltsin is ill, the desire to torpedo the president's attempts to strengthen civic peace and accord, attempts to press for the revision of the constitution in the part concerning the election of the president, the increased aggressiveness of the irreconcilable opposition and the amnesty itself -- these are the links of one campaign. Its aim is to destabilise the situation in the country and return to the tasks which the participants in the October revolt failed to solve at the first attempt. It seems like someone wants to make another one. The impression is that the lessons of the October 1993 did not last long. Abuses of the results of amnesty take place. The president rejects the practice of psychological warfare in the Russian home. He states that together with the healthy forces of the Federation Council and the State Duma, supported by the democratic public and somber-thinking leaders, including leaders of the parliamentary opposition, he will continue efforts to expand the social basis of civil peace and strengthen Russian statehood, the statement said.
