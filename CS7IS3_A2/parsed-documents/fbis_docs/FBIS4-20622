It contains a measure designed to curb the excessive outflow of Japanese scientific talent so that the present lopsided international scientific exchange situation can be corrected. Pointing out numerous barriers to participation foreign researchers face in the areas of language and housing, the report proposes construction of additional housing facilities and other measures designed to remove these obstacles. This is the first time that the Science Council has put together a report dealing with international exchange. The number of researchers sent abroad by Japan's national universities for the purpose of conducting research or to present their research findings is now reaching 36,000 a year, while the number of foreign researchers coming to Japan is no more than 12,800 a year (according to the 1992 record in both cases). In other words, the number of Japanese researchers going abroad far exceeds that of foreign researchers coming to Japan. In order to alter this situation, the council's interim report requests the reorganization and strengthening of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), an organization which serves as an intermediary in the matter of international scientific exchange. According to the Ministry of Education, in terms of budget and member lineup, the JSPS, in charge of scientific fields, compares unfavorably with other organizations similarly involved in the promotion of international scientific exchange, and the Ministry of Education believes that this is what impedes participation of foreign researchers in exchange programs. In receiving foreign researchers, moreover, the council is requesting the JSPS to be flexible and ready to accommodate in deciding the duration of their stay and processing of formalities for determining their eligibility. Under the existing Japanese system, it was not possible to give an extension to foreign researchers if their stay in Japan does not straddle two fiscal years since, under the present system, the account for foreign researchers must be closed at the end of each fiscal year. Since such a barrier does not exist either in the United States or Europe, the report describes this system as "one of the features of the exchange program of which Japan should be ashamed." (Akito Arima, Director of The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN)). Whether the enforcement of such a policy would resolve the problem of "an excessive outflow of Japanese researchers" is an extremely fine point. According to some sources, within the Science Council, there are those who contend that "if Japan's research level is high, then no matter how high a rent may be in Japan, foreign researchers would not hesitate even a minute to come to Japan."
