Speaking at a meeting held today in Moscow "Izmailovo" sports complex, the leader of last year hard-line revolt in Moscow, said addressing leaders of different opposition parties and patriotic movements: "It is high time to stop arguing who is right and who is wrong. We have one objective, we have one motherland... Everyone must realise that unity is power now". Rutskoy reiterated his declaration of May 9 that the main task of the opposition is to spare no efforts ensuring that "the next Victory Day (May 9, 1995) would be marked without the regime which rules now". The meeting was attended by the most influential opposition leaders, such as Viktor Anpilov (Labour Russia), Sergey Baburin (Russian All-National Union), Ilya Konstantinov (Front of National Salvation), Generals Makashov and Achalov. Meanwhile, Russian television aired an interview with Rutskoy in which ex-vice-president practically denied the proclaimed intention to come to power before next spring. In the televised interview Rutskoy declared a contradicting plan according to which a would-be social-patriotic party, apparently headed by Rutskoy himself, shall win up to 90 per cent of seats in the parliamentary elections in 1995, and then enter presidential election race scheduled for 1996.
