FR941202-0-00043 FR941202-0-00003 Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 94&hyph;23&hyph;03 Pratt & Whitney: Amendment 39&hyph;9065. Docket 91&hyph;ANE&hyph;39. Applicability: Pratt & Whitney (PW) JT8D&hyph;209, &hyph;217, &hyph;217A, &hyph;217C, and &hyph;219 turbofan engines that have not installed high pressure turbine (HPT) containment hardware in accordance with AD 93&hyph;23&hyph;10. These engines are installed on but not limited to McDonnell Douglas MD&hyph;80 series and Boeing 727 series aircraft. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent fracture of the HPT shaft, which can result in uncontained release of engine fragments, engine fire, inflight engine shutdown, or possible aircraft damage, accomplish the following: (a) Install and inspect one or two temperature indicators, part number (P/N) 810486, or a single or double set of P/N 809129 and P/N 809130 temperature indicators, on the No. 4 and 5 bearing compartment scavenge oil tube, as follows: (1) Install temperature indicators on the No. 4 and 5 bearing compartment scavenge oil tube in accordance with Section 2.A.(1) of the Accomplishment Instructions of PW Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. 5944, Revision 2, dated June 8, 1992, within 90 days after the effective date of this airworthiness directive (AD). (2) Visually inspect temperature indicators within 65 hours TIS of installation. Thereafter, inspect at intervals not to exceed 65 hours TIS since last inspection. (3) If upon inspection, the color of any temperature indicator window(s) has turned completely black, perform troubleshooting and diagnostic testing and corrective action as required, in accordance with Section 2.A.(2)(c) and (d) or (f) and (g), as applicable, of the Accomplishment Instructions of PW ASB No. 5944, Revision 2, dated June 8, 1992. Prior to returning the engine to service, replace any temperature indicator that has turned black and inspect in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this AD. (b) For aircraft installations utilizing one P/N 810486 indicator or one set of P/N 809129 and 809130 indicators, and inspection reveals a missing indicator, inspect the remaining temperature indicator, if applicable, to determine if the indicator window has turned completely black. If the indicator window has turned completely black, perform troubleshooting and diagnostic testing, and corrective action as required, in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this AD. If the indicator window has not turned completely black or if there are no additional indicators installed, then install a new indicator in accordance with Section 2.A.(1) of the Accomplishment Instruction of PW ASB No. 5944, Revision No. 2, dated June 8, 1992, prior to return to service, and visually inspect the temperature indicator within 65 hours TIS since installation. Thereafter, inspect at intervals not to exceed 65 hours TIS since last inspection in accordance with paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this AD. (c) For aircraft installations utilizing two P/N 810486 indicators or two sets of P/N 809129 and 809130 indicators, and inspection reveals a missing indicator(s), inspect the remaining temperature indicator(s), if applicable, to determine if the indicator window has turned completely black. If the indicator window has turned completely black, perform troubleshooting and diagnostic testing, and corrective action as required, in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this AD. If the indicator window has not turned completely black, install a new indicator(s) in accordance with Section 2.A.(1) of the Accomplishment Instructions of PW ASB No. 5944, Revision 2, dated June 8, 1992, prior to return to service, and visually inspect the temperature indicator within 65 hours TIS since installation. Thereafter, inspect at intervals not to exceed 65 hours TIS since last inspection in accordance with paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this AD. (d) Report the data elements identified in Appendix E of the Accomplishment Instructions of PW ASB No. 5944, Revision 2, dated June 8, 1992, whenever an overtemperature condition is observed on any color temperature indicator which is the result of an internal engine problem only and not resulting from an external cause corrected by the published troubleshooting procedures. Data elements should be reported within 30 days of determining that the overtemperature condition is the result of an internal engine problem, to the Manager, Engine Certification Office, Engine and Propeller Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service, FAA, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;05299; fax (617) 238&hyph;7199. The reporting requirements of this AD terminate six months from the effective date of the AD. (e) Information collection requirements contained in this regulation have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511) and have been assigned OMB control number 2120&hyph;0056.
