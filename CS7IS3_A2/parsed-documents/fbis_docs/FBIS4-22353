Aircraft have been falling out of the sky and are sure to continue doing so. This is taken for granted. What is most important is that crashes do not become a habit, a terrible tragedy or a natural everyday occurrence. But this is precisely what is happening now to our civil aviation, which has been intimidated by everyone. Russia has become one of the world leaders in the number of air disasters taking place in the shortest period of time: 78 days--this is the number of days from the Tu-154 disaster over Irkutsk to the latest catastrophe involving the A-310 Airbus over Novokuznetsk. At first glance this period of time is unreal, absurd. But a fact remains a fact: 78 days and another 75 bodies. The figures are almost the same--like ordinary accounting... In many respects this is a strange catastrophe. It is unusual, if such an expression is applicable in a tragic context. Everything was the wrong way around in it: 99 percent of all air crashes take place either during an aircraft's takeoff or landing. Something happened here when the aircraft was flying at its assigned altitude on autopilot. It had already flown over 3,000 kilometers and all systems were operating normally, without any deviations, which is confirmed by the recorded transmissions between the crew and the ground. The airplane fell very rapidly. At the steepest possible angle, which seldom or almost never happens during an air accident. It crashed into the side of a mountain, but it completely cleared the tops of the trees for some reason. According to the first rescuers to arrive at the crash site, it appeared as if the Airbus had simply "flopped down" on the mountain. All the plane's fragments were found in a relatively small area. They were not strewn over a radius of several hundred meters as they were in the Irkutsk tragedy in January, for example, but gathered together in a very small space. The fact that the pilots did not have time to transmit anything to the ground is also strange. Absolutely nothing! The crash took place in complete radio silence. We cannot even make a rough guess now about what happened on board the Airbus. A sudden explosion? A fire? According to the driver of a log truck not far away, an engine was on fire and a dense black plume of smoke trailed after it. However, specialists investigating the crash were skeptical about the driver's story: the witness was slightly inebriated at that time. Residents of the settlement of Mayzas, 8 kilometers from the crash site, heard a powerful explosion. But to all appearances, this was the explosion when the aircraft hit the ground. There was a large amount of fuel in the plane's tanks: I would remind you that the aircraft was flying to Hong Kong, and there was sufficient fuel on board. It has now been established that there were 75 persons--63 passengers and 12 crew members (three pilots, 8 female flight attendants, and one male flight attendant) on the aircraft. There were many foreigners--Chinese, Indian, British and French passengers--on board. Judging by the effects found by the rescuers at the crash site, the passengers were very well-to-do. It is sufficient to say that more than $1 million and a large number of precious stones and gold ornaments were found on the first day of work. To prevent looting, the crash site was immediately cordoned off by the OMON [Special Purpose Militia Detachment] and soldiers (though for some reason, the soldiers were withdrawn but the OMON remained, with full gear and weapons, and were put on watches of 12 hours per day). There is a rather impressive group of people working at the site now: over 100 members of the rescue party, from Mezhdurechensk, Krasnoyarsk, Barnaul, and Moscow, and roughly the same number of inducted soldiers. The militia and those under their jurisdiction--zeki [prisoners] from the local colony--were put to work clearing away the crash remains. Representatives of security organs are also working there (judging from a conversation with them, a terakt [terrorist act] has not been ruled out, but in any case, certain details of the accident point to such a turn of events). The crew of an MI-8 helicopter urgently dispatched from Novokuznetsk were the first to discover the burning airplane. A rescue party from Mezhdurechensk set out for the crash site in vehicles equipped for snow travel. According to their accounts, it was immediately clear how sad it was that there was no one to rescue. The crash site was shrouded in acrid smoke from burning plastic, seat materials, and cable. In the specialists' opinion, all the passengers died instantaneously. There simply could not have been any who survived for a short time after impact in this situation. Because of the turn of events, I came to the crash site as an undertaker. With S. Tarasov, director of the Mezhdurechensk "Ritual," we transported all the coffins in the town at that time (at first, journalists were very strictly prohibited from being at the crash site, though members of the state commission took pity on us and authorized us to perform our professional duties for a brief period). Incidentally, with regard to respect for the remains of the casualties, the catastrophe showed that we are still civilized people. We carefully and neatly packed the body parts in polyethylene bags, then placed them in the coffins to take to the mortuaries in Novokuznetsk. "You do not give bodies to the relatives in the bags--there should be at least some respect," one of the commission members explained. There was none of the unpleasant haste, even cynicism, which existed at the Irkutsk disaster site, when the arms and legs of the dead were thrown into polyethylene packages in an effort to get the remains to the city a little faster (although there were some excesses now, too. It was decided at first to send the human remains to a mortuary in nearby Mezhdurechensk and mortuary employees were ordered categorically to remove all the "extra" bodies from the institution. It reached the point of absurdity. As an example, the driver of our hearse-truck was compelled to take his dead friend out of the mortuary, wrapped in a blanket. There was nothing he could do but lay the body in the "KamAZ" [truck] and drive around every bump and rut when taking it to his relatives). The first days after the crash the soldiers and rescue crews prepared a route to take out the remains of the dead and parts of the aircraft, as well as a pad for the helicopters. The aircraft had crashed 1.5 kilometers from a road which is traveled day and night by lumber trucks. Otherwise it would have been much harder to get to the crash site. The sparsely populated area is surrounded by volcanic peaks and taiga. As terrible as it sounds, little was left of those killed in the Novokuznetsk disaster. The bodies were burned and charred to the point that they were unrecognizable. Many of the passengers were still strapped in their seats. The rescue party found two girls--the only children on this flight. Their father, one of the crew members, had decided to take them with him on vacation, to show them Hong Kong. The rescue crews had to extract--and still have to extract--most of the bodies from a deep layer of snow--winter has brought a lot of snow here this year. About 60 bodies were found in the first 2 days. Some of them were taken in two "KamAZ" trucks to the Novokuznetsk mortuaries (the Airbus pilots were taken separately, in a special helicopter). Identification of the dead was begun yesterday. Although this will be a very, very difficult job. By the end of the second day, two of the three "black boxes" on board the aircraft were found and sent right away to Moscow for analysis. A special representative of the American General Electric firm, which provided the engines for the A-310 Airbus, has arrived in Novokuznetsk. However, he responded to all my journalist colleagues in the same way: "No comment." And in his own way, he was probably right.
