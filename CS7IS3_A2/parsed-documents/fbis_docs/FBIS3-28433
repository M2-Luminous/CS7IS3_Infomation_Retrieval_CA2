FBIS3-28433 "dreas025_c_94011" FBIS-EAS-94-025 Document Type:Daily Report 7 Feb 1994 North Korea ROK Unification Minister's Remarks Denounced SK0502052094 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0445 GMT 5 Feb 94 SK0502052094 Pyongyang KCNA Language: English Article Type:BFN ["Who Threatens Whom?"--KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, February 5 (KCNA) -- What the South Korean puppet minister of the unification board said in regard to the January 31 statement of a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea concerning the U.S. perfidious act is nothing but a balderdash of a stooge aimed at embellishing the U.S. military threat to the DPRK and its deliberate moves to increase tension, says NODONG SINMUN today. Feeling uneasy about the statement, he dared to charge the DPRK with its "threat to the United States" and "menace to South Korea," the analyst says, and continues: This is a preposterous sophism reminding us of a thief crying "stop thief!" Who really resorts to threat and menace and who is subjected to them on the Korean peninsula? It is the United States that has thrown off the promise it had made at DPRK-U.S. contacts like a pair of old shoes and urged the DPRK to accept the demand for an overall inspection raised by the secretariat of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is tantamount to its return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, while pressing ultimatum-style demand to the DPRK, threatening it with "sanctions" after setting a deadline. No matter how loudly those who are trying to threaten and overpower the DPRK with strength may charge it with "threat" and "menace," nobody will be deceived by them. The "minister of the unification board" might have been bribed by the United States, the master of the South Korean puppets. But his sophistry has sparked off the anger of the Korean nation. The South Korean people hit the nail on the head when they labeled the South Korean "unification board" as a "board of division and confrontation." If the puppets persistently seek a nuclear war against the fellow countrymen in the North in league with outside forces, letting loose belligerent outbursts and playing with fire, while tailing behind the United States, it would be none other than the provocateurs and warmaniacs who would be burnt in the flame. The puppets must clearly see the situation and stop running riot.
