Belinda Trump reports that the latest consumer price index data shows the cost of living rose just 1.9 percent in the year to December. [Begin Trump recording] During the December quarter, the cost of living rose 0.2 of 1 percent. This brings the annual rate down from 2.2 to 1.9 percent -- well below the federal government's 3 percent forecast for the financial year and below many market predictions. Contributing to today's figures were falling mortgage interests and consumer credit charges. These were offset by rises in cigarettes, petrol, fruit and vegetable prices, local government charges, and the cost of overseas travel and accommodation. Of the capital cities, Hobart has the highest cost of living increase with a yearly inflation rate of 3.3 percent. Sydney has the lowest with an annual rate of 1.3 percent. The federal treasurer, Ralph Willis, says today's encouraging inflation figures have put to rest, at least for the time being, any increase in interest rates. Mr. Willis says economists predicting interest rate increases later in the year will have to rethink their forecasts. The treasurer says the annual inflation result of 1.9 percent for the year to December will also result in an upward revision of economic growth forecasts. Mr. Willis says he will soon announce how far the growth prediction will rise beyond the 3 percent rate set out in the budget. [end recording]
