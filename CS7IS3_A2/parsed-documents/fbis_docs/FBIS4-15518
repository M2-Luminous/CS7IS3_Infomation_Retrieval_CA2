He suggested in an interview with INTERFAX that this would help renew the talks between Kishinev [Chisinau] and Tiraspol at a completely new level. The Gagauz leaders shared this opinion. They approved of the ratification of the agreement by the Moldovan parliament at the session of the Gagauz parliament in Kamrat today. President of the self-proclaimed Gagauz Republic, Stepan Topal, said in an interview with INTERFAX on the telephone that the Gagauz leaders had been seeking ratification of these documents for the last two years. He suggested that the Agrarian Democratic Party and the Socialist party currently in power in Moldova and their moves, including the agreement's ratification, had laid a good foundation for the renewal of the Moldovan-Gagauz talks at a new level. The Gagauz parliament approved the activities by the commission for renewal of the talks with Kishinev on the status of the regions with a largely Gagauz population and recommended that the commission work even more energetically.
