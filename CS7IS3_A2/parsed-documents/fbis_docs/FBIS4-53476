The scale of direct and indirect trade between North and South Korea in 1993 was $186,591,000 (on the customs clearance basis), as much as a 7.6 percent increase over the 1992 level. In the recently released "Trends in North-South Exchanges and Cooperation," the National Unification Board says: "This scale of North-South trade is not small at all considering the fact that South Korea ranks fourth after China, Japan, and Russia in North Korea's volume of foreign trade, which is estimated at approximately $2.6 billion in total." With the trend toward increasing North-South trade, South Korea's trade deficit with North Korea continues to grow. In 1993 the volume of North Korean goods purchased by South Korean firms totaled $178,166,000 whereas the volume of South Korean goods purchased by North Korea totaled $8,425,000. As a result, South Korea recorded a trade deficit of $169,741,000 with North Korea. South Korea's accumulated trade deficit with North Korea since North-South trade began in 1989 has reached $451,893,000, indicating that South Korean firms continue to "buy goods from North Korea." Despite the accumulating trade deficit, the volume of goods shipped to North Korea continues to decrease whereas the volume of goods brought in from North Korea continues to grow rapidly. Compared with 1992, the volume of goods shipped to North Korea decreased by 20.2 percent whereas that of goods brought in from the North increased by 9.4 percent. (Our government regards trade between North and South as domestic transactions and uses the terms "goods brought in" and "goods shipped out" for "imports" and "exports.") Steel and metals lead the list of purchases from North Korea last year, accounting for 80.3 percent of the total. The reason is that North Korea abounds in gold nuggets, zinc, and other minerals, and South Korean firms view them as "profitable items." Walnuts, medicinal herbs, and other agricultural and forestry products rank second in the list of items preferred, accounting for 8.5 percent of the total amount of goods purchased from North Korea. Textiles ranked third, accounting for 5.9 percent. Except cotton towels, most of the textile goods shipped from North Korea, such as trousers and shirts, were processed in North Korea for South Korean firms on a commission basis. Fibers leads the list of goods shipped to North Korea in 1993 accounting for 70.4 percent of the total volume, indicating that the import of textiles manufactured by commissioning sharply increased last year. South Korean firms supply Tetron fibers, cotton fibers, and other raw materials to North Korea, and North Korea manufactures textiles by using these materials and ships the finished products to South Korea or third countries. The volume of trade in goods processed in this manner, with textiles on the top, has increased more than seven times over the 1992 level, indicating that South Koran firms are very much attracted to North Korean light industry goods manufactured by using low wages. With our technicians not allowed to visit or stay in North Korea, it is impossible to provide the on-site technical guidance necessary for processing by commissioning. Our firms think that as long as this problem remains unsolved, it will be difficult to maintain the rapid pace of increase in the volume of trade in goods processed by commissioning. Included in the goods shipped to North Korea that were reported to the National Unification Board are: color television sets, 508 tons of soap, and 270 sewing machines. Despite aggravating tension on the Korean peninsula, the number of South Korean firms desiring to trade with North Korea has been steadily increasing. Last year South Korean firms engaging in trade with North Korea numbered 132, or an increase of nine over the 1992 figure. The major firms leading in trade with North Korea are mostly general trading firms of conglomerates, such as Samsung Co., Lucky-Goldstar International Corp., Daewoo Corp., and Sorin Metals. These four companies accounts for 73.2 percent of the total volume of goods brought in from North Korea last year. The Samsung Co. led in terms of the approved amount of goods shipped to North Korea with $2,961,000 as it did in terms of the volume of goods brought in from North Korea, with Sunkyung, ltd. and the Daewoo Corp trailing behind. Ten companies recorded over $1 million each in the accumulated total of exports to North Korea since 1988. Last year as in the preceding years, indirect trade through overseas intermediaries was the main form of trade between North and South Korea. Indirect transactions account for 98.3 percent of all trade between North and South. North Korea does not yet officially approve North-South direct trade. Despite North Korea's official stand that it "will not trade with South Korea," the number of cases of direct trade increased from 11 in 1992 to 14 in 1993. According to concerned sources, the number of North Korean offers of direct trade has noticeably increased since early this year. These sources take the increasing offers of direct trade as a reflection of the worsening economic situation in North Korea. In trade with North Korea, large South Korean firms offer the most favorable conditions such as the payment of cash because their business strategy toward North Korea is aimed at expanding business ties with it even at the risk of losses. Business sources say that the actual scale of North-South trade is larger than the government statistics indicate. Only those transactions that are reported to the government for the purpose of obtaining exemptions from customs are included in the government statistics. Companies report their transactions to the government on a selective basis for various reasons. In the case of indirect trade, it is practically impossible for the government to determine which are the ultimate receivers of goods and which are the ultimate shippers. Our government has time and again enunciated its position of linking North-South economic cooperation to the nuclear issue, namely, the position that it will not agree to North-South economic cooperation as long as North Korea refuses to settle the nuclear issue. However, the abstract term "North-South economic cooperation" as used by our government should be interpreted as meaning "investment" only, not including "trade." The reason is that what the government is actually prohibiting is nothing but investment in North Korea, and despite tension aggravated by the North Korean statement about "turning South Korea into a sea of fire," direct and indirect trade between North and South Korea has been growing steadily.
