A source at the Army's Scientific Department said the military always used this depleted uranium for the purpose of making armour-piercing bullets because of its high penetration power. He said Thai army officers had occasionally received similar items in the form of sticks from its intelligence unit but it had never come in a tin box. The source said the department so far had not sent any officer to fetch the box to determine the type of substance it contains, but he believes it might be Uranium 238, as it was widely used by the U.S. Army. If not, it might be parts smuggled from a small research nuclear reactor unit in Dalat, Vietnam. A Vietnam war expert said the unit was given to the Vietnamese government during the Vietnam war for research purposes but the U.S. government took back all its equipment in 1975. He said that the USSR donated the equipment needed to resume the operation of the small research reactor in Dalat in 1976. He dismissed the report that the box might contain uranium since he had never seen it when he was in Vietnam during the war. He believed that it might be a joke or the work of a gang of swindlers. Meanwhile, the Office of Atomic Energy for Peace said depleted uranium has low radioactivity and would not be a danger to anything and cannot be used to produce nuclear weapons.
