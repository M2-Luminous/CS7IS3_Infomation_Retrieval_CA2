This means that the political forces that support the government -- the PSDB and the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] members who do not follow Orestes Quercia -- are again considering the candidacy of Deputy Antonio Britto (PMDB-RS [Rio Grande do Sul]), who is campaigning to run for governor of Rio Grande do Sul State. Following the PMDB executive board meeting that decided to call the party political council to discuss the impasse created by Quercia's candidacy, PMDB President Deputy Luiz Henrique admitted he is receiving strong pressure from the presidents of regional PMDB offices to endorse Britto's candidacy for president of the Republic. Jereissati confirmed a report published by O GLOBO stating that the two parties' leaders recently have established contacts to support Britto. Such efforts, however, were defeated by the launching of Quercia's candidacy, Jereissati said. "There was a tacit agreement that the PMDB would support Fernando Henrique and that the PSDB would support Britto. There still exists the possibility to resume contacts and that the PSDB will support Britto," Jereissati said. The PSDB president -- whose party stems from a split over Quercia's leadership of the PMDB -- does not even consider discussing Quercia's estrangement from the alliance because it will be a natural consequence of the official launching of Britto's candidacy. "Britto will become a candidate only if the PMDB solves the problem of Quercia's candidacy. That seems to be the only obstacle. Once it is solved, we will be able to hold concrete talks about an alliance," Jereissati said. Just like the PSDB president, most PSDB congressmen in Brasilia began to have doubts about Fernando Henrique's candidacy. Such doubts were expressed during Cardoso's 48-hour trip to the United States, during which he put in second place the subject of the scope of an alliance that could support him. First place, for him, was the political appropriateness of leaving his post at such an essential moment for the economic stabilization program. The PMDB has internally resumed the discussion about Britto's candidacy independently of eventual PSDB support. Quercia followers who consider his candidacy suicidal are considering alternatives like Goias Governor Iris Rezende or former President Jose Sarney.
