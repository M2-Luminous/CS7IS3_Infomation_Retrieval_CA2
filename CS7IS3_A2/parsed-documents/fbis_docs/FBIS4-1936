Governor Shao said: At present, the international situation and the situation of neighboring countries are very advantageous to our province. Border trade has rapidly expanded; the number of open ports have increased to 21; and the transaction volume made at the four successive Harbin trade fairs has increased every year. We have established friendly relations with 29 cities of nine countries, such as Japan and the United States, and economic contacts and friendly exchange relations with more than 120 countries and regions in the world. This has provided an important opportunity and laid an important foundation for further creating a new situation in foreign affairs work. In China, many fake and inferior products have flowed to the markets in Russia and other CIS countries through various illegal channels. Problems on some evildoers and unlawful elements who sneaked to other countries through various relations to form criminal cliques to engage in fighting, killing, and robbery must be resolutely checked. Governor Shao stressed: It is not realistic to rely only on the efforts of foreign affairs departments in strengthening management over foreign affairs work and rectifying the chaotic phenomenon. Party committees and governments at all levels must give unified instruction, coordinate with various sectors, and concentrate time and energy on comprehensively improving this situation. The discipline inspection and supervision departments should strictly investigate and handle cases on discipline and law breaches in examination and approval of procedures for leaving the country and in management. Public security and armed police departments should strengthen management over the border areas and deal strict blows to criminal activities outside the territory. Governor Shao pointed out: Governments at all levels should attach prime importance to foreign affairs work; leaders at all levels should take the lead in observing the state's relevant stipulations on foreign affairs work, and must not disturb foreign affairs departments to implement policies through human relationship. They should also do a good job in maintaining coordination and cooperation among departments. As the foreign affairs functional departments of local governments, foreign affairs offices should conscientiously supervise, inspect, and coordinate this work. No phenomena of shifting responsibility onto other people and disputing over trifles should emerge. The three-day provincial foreign affairs work conference relayed the guidelines of foreign affairs office meetings of directors of various provinces, prefectures, and cities across the province. Responsible comrades in charge of foreign affairs work from various prefectures, cities, and counties across the province studied and discussed this work.
