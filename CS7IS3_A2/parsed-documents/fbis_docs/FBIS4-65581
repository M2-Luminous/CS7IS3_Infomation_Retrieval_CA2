Khasapopoulos: "Unified Defense Gains Ground"] [Text] Immediately after the Easter holiday the formulation of the Unified Defense Area of Greece and Cyprus will enter its final stage with the (second within two months) visit of K. Iliadis, the Cyprus minister of defense, even though the strategic obligations of the two countries have yet to be defined fully. Although the timetable for the implementation of the joint Greek-Cypriot decisions is being followed faithfully (this was achieved following specific instructions by Prime Minister A. Papandreou to Minister of Defense Yer. Arsenis) several issues remain undecided on both sides and need to be settled as soon as possible. Arsenis appears optimistic on the implementation of the second defense doctrine in Greek history (the first is that of advanced border outposts) not so much because of the faithful implementation of the timetable as because of the fact that the objections of our allies, especially the British, have been toned down. According to a statement of the minister of defense to "TO VIMA," in his recent discussions with foreign military attaches, the unified defense doctrine of Greece and Cyprus has been relegated by the allies to a secondary issue. Even within NATO -- as he said -- the interest of the allies, including the Turks, to learn more about the content of this unique defense system has stopped. A certain embarrassment felt especially by the Greek military after the TV presentation of certain aspects of the doctrine by Cypriot officials has now been overcome since both sides agreed on the necessity to keep the strategic plans secret. New Democracy Chairman Milt. Evert told at some point Cyprus President Gl. Kliridis (who in Salonica had made certain statements regarding the defense doctrine) that "the Turks would be willing to pay even $10 million to find out about details we make public on television." As a result, the official statements are now curtailed and the initiative is in the hands of the military staff officers (Greek and Cypriots) who feverishly work on the strategic plans. A second problem relates to the best possible coordination between the Ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs in handling this issue. The military side found out that in the view of the diplomats the new defense doctrine had one objective, namely to serve as a strong bargaining card in the hands of the Greek Cypriots and that the withdrawal of the doctrine will coincide with the announcement that Cyprus is demilitarized. The coordination of the diplomats with the military was achieved after a recent meeting between [Foreign Minister] K. Papoulias and [Defense Minister] Ger. Arsenis. Both the diplomats and the military agree on one important point: the implementation of the new defense doctrine is now a one-way street for Greece, in the sense that Greece has no more room for vacillation since the political, diplomatic and possibly military cost will be several times heavier than the potential benefits. Nicosia which welcomed enthusiastically the enunciation of the new military doctrine, is now concerned with mainly two issues: The first relates to the very philosophy of the doctrine itself since it implies the unified dealing with any threats on the entire national area. The appearance of a threat, however, will mean automatically a joint defense, something which the Cypriot leadership views with skepticism at this delicate phase of the Cypriot issue. The second concern of the Cypriots is related to the economy since the implementation of the doctrine automatically will involve added expenditures for the heavily burdened Cypriot economy, especially with the construction of defense infrastructure projects such as a naval yard, an airport and air defense equipment, as well as fortification projects, etc. This was the reason why certain Cypriot political parties had expressed some objections to the full implementation of the doctrine three months after its enunciation. With the work done on the military plans all these problems appeared to be resolved since all now understand that (at this final stage of the issue) the doctrine is the way for a comprehensive reorganization of Cyprus' defense infrastructure, the quantitative and qualitative upgrading of the Cypriot National Guard, the reestablishment of secure communication channels, the development of training programs for the National Defense officers and for joint military exercises which are so useful for a coordinated defense. All these, of course, take place on paper at this moment and no one knows --as reported by the military -- how they will be implemented in action and most importantly how it will be possible to rapidly deploy Greek forces on the island (in the event of a crisis) without at the same time weakening the Greek defense. The Greek military staff officers believe that a serious crisis with Turkey in the future will not be limited to Cyprus.
