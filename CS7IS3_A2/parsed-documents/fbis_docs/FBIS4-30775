As Slovak Defense Minister Pavol Kanis said in today's edition of the television discussion program "Kroky," we have thus become one of 16 countries to have signed the Partnership for Peace initiative. In connection with bringing Slovakia into the security structures of Western Europe, Pavol Kanis stressed the inevitability of a reorganization of our Armed Forces. Josef Prokes, the honorary chairman of the Slovak National Party, who is foreign minister in Meciar's shadow cabinet, pointed out that the European stability pact in itself was not dangerous but could be abused. Western Europe, according to him, has not solved the problem of minorities and yet expected East European countries to do so. Foreign Minister Edvard Kukan observed that minority problems could be solved on an international level by means of the CSCE and on the Council of Europe level.
