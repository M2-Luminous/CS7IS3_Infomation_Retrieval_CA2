Addressing a media conference in Johannesburg, former Congress of SA [South African] Trade Unions Secretary General and ANC election candidate Jay Naidoo said the Reconstruction and Development Programme [RDP] would be the basis of a legislative programme for a new government at all levels. The programme puts forward various mechanisms for the implementation of its proposals and retains nationalisation and the creation of a reconstruction levy as two of those policy options. The RDP document was a concrete programme for addressing the expectations of large sectors of the population who had suffered as a result of inequality and imbalances in housing, education, health and employment, he said. The RDP would seek to harness the resources of all sectors of society to tackle socio-economic disadvantages although the state would play a leading role. "A government that invests heavily in infrastructure," he said, "will meet the needs of our people and stimulate economic growth." The RDP document focusses on five key areas: meeting basic needs, developing human resources, building the economy, democratising the state and society, and implementing the RDP. The programme seeks to redistribute over the next five years a substantial amount of land to landless people, build over one million houses, provide clean water and sanitation to all, electrify 2.5-million new homes and provide access to everybody for affordable health care and telecommunications. On the economy, the RDP proposes considerable trade and industrial reform to achieve international competitiveness s?ed employment creation. It points to t he imperative of developing a large domestic?uring sector that makes greater use of the country's raw materials and minerals. Although the cost of the programme would be large, the ANC said it could largely be met within the existing government budget, as well as by accessing new and innovative forms of financing. ANC economics head Trevor Manuel said the emphasis would be to promote more efficient governmental spending through better social expenditure delivery systems and state capital investment. He said the financial sector would have to be encouraged to mobilise and direct more resources from housing to the promotion of small and medium sized enterprises. The RDP considers increasing the public sector in "strategic areas" through nationalisation, purchasing of shareholding in companies, setting up new public corporations or joint ventures with private sector. On the other hand, it also proposes reducing the public sector to enhance efficiency, advance affirmative action and create employment. "Such a mixed economy will foster a new and constructive relationship between the people, the democratic government, the trade union movement, the private sector and the market," the RDP documents states. The final draft of the RDP document will be discussed by a special ANC conference next weekend before being adopted as its election platform.
