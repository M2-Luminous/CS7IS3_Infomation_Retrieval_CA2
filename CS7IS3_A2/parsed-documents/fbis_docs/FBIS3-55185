The government needs to know what stand independent deputies will take in the State Duma, he added. Chernomyrdin stressed that the government would support any faction willing to work for the good of the country and called on deputies to establish firm cooperation between government and parliament based on a centrist position. He, in his turn, guaranteed to support constructive dialogue between the two branches of power. If necessary, I will come and meet you and bring the whole government with me, he said. Chernomyrdin said the government would not be pursuing "popular" economic policies and that everything should be done to avoid a situation where the executive proposes "unpopular" and the legislative "popular" measures.
