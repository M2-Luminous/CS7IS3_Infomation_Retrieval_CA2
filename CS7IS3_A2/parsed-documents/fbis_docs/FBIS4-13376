FBIS4-13376 "drnes076_r_94002" FBIS-NES-94-076 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 India Opposition Makes `Scathing Attack' on GATT, Government Opposition Makes `Scathing Attack' on GATT, Government BK1904162494 Delhi All India Radio Network in English 1530 GMT 19 Apr 94 BK1904162494 Delhi All India Radio Network English BFN [Text] The opposition in the Rajya Sabha [upper house] made a scathing attack on the government for signing the GATT agreement. Putting up a strong defense, the treasury benches asserted that the country's interests will not be undermined in any manner. They also accused the opposition of launching a misinformation campaign for political purposes. The GATT issue dominated the day's proceedings and the house witnessed noisy exchanges and procedural wrangles. The deputy chairperson, Dr. Najma Heptulla, allowed a discussion on the suo moto statement made by the commerce minister. Mr. Pranab Mukherjee told the house that India has only authenticated the final act of the Uruguay Round, the outcome of the seven-year-long multilateral trade negotiations. Mr. Mukherjee said India and a number of developing countries have decided to work out a joint response to any attempt to link social policy issues with trade. He also stated that the preparatory committee of the World Trade Organization will discuss the future agenda, but the decisions will be taken by consensus. Initiating the discussion, Dr. Murli Manohar Joshi, BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party], argued it is against the spirit of several constitutional provisions and undermines the rights of the state governments. Dr. Joshi contended that the country stands to lose even in respect of trade-related patents and investment measures. Rebutting the allegations, Mr. Jagdish Desai, Congress-I, said subsidies for farmers will continue unhindered. Asserting that the GATT agreement will help the country push up exports in five years, the Congress-I member said the fears about the unrestricted entry of multinational corporations are unfounded. The discussion remained inconclusive. The Lok Sabha [lower house] was adjourned for the day today without transacting any business following noisy protests by the opposition over the signing of the new GATT accord. Trouble began as soon as the house met this morning and continued even after its adjournment for one hour. The entire opposition was on its seats shouting slogans. The National Front, the Left Front, and AIADMK [All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam] members trooped into the well of the house. Some of them were seen waiving copies of a Hindi daily. The opposition leaders, including Mr. L.K. Advani and Mr. Somnath Chatterjee, were trying to speak but nothing could be heard in the din. The deputy speaker, who was in the chair, adjourned the house for the day. The house will meet on Thursday morning after the Ram Navami holiday tomorrow. The Janata Dal leader, Mr. V.P. Singh, says the government should try to get concessions in the new GATT agreement in the interests of the nation. Addressing a news conference in Parliament House, he said New Delhi should rally the developing countries and mobilize public opinion at home for changes in the GATT accord. The Janata Dal leader expressed the view that parliament should be empowered to ratify such far-reaching agreement and it should not be left to the discussion of the executive.
