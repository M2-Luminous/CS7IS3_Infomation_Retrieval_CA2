Nonetheless, Israeli officials have not thus far given up their hopes in this regard. TISHRIN adds: It is clear that the Israelis want to deal with the Arab sides one at a time, just as they have done with the Palestinians, who have allowed themselves to negotiate with their Israeli interlocutors from a position of weakness. The end result is that the Palestinians were dragged to an agreement that has only consecrated occupation and settlement activities in the occupied territories. TISHRIN asserts that these Israeli calls are falling on deaf ears in Syria, which has had a taste of Israeli games and deceptive tactics. TISHRIN goes on to say: The Israelis did not engage in the peace process to achieve peace, but rather to extract an Arab recognition of their entity. Their engagement in this process has failed to elicit an Israeli commitment to the principles and resolutions of international legitimacy. The Israelis were encouraged in this by the United States, which has showered them with financial and military aid under the pretext of pacifying the Israelis and prompting them to walk the path of peace. However, the result was that Israel has not made a single move in the direction of peace. As a matter of fact, its security concerns, or to be more exact, its attempts to obtain funds and weaponry from Washington, have been on the increase. Even the U.S. loan guarantees, which Israel pledged will not be used to promote settlement activities, have been used to beef up existing settlements and build new ones. Meanwhile, the United State has failed to lift a finger. TISHRIN concludes by saying: Given all this, the Arabs cannot work miracles. For, they have done their utmost to advance the peace process and sincerely dealt with the peace efforts. However, their sincere intentions in this regard have run into the Israeli intransigence. As for the U.S. role, it has failed to measure up to the level required by the cause of peace. It has failed to distinguish between the aggressor and the victim. Indeed, it has most often shown a bias in favor of the aggressor. For its part, the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: After two years of engagement in the peace process, the Israeli prime minister has reiterated his rejection of complete withdrawal from the occupied Golan, and again demanded either the creation of channels for secret negotiations with Syria, or that the level of the bilateral talks negotiators be upgraded. By making such statements against the background of the talks currently under way with the PLO and the international efforts being made to advance the peace process, Rabin is setting impossible conditions to beleaguer the peace process in order to promote Israel's control of the region's resources. AL-BA'TH adds: Israel's claims regarding the so-called Syrian conditions are groundless. This is because the peace initiative was grounded in the implementation of international legitimacy resolutions in the first place. It goes without saying that these resolutions provide for a complete Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories, including the Golan. Similarly, the Madrid conference and the Washington peace talks were held on the basis of this peace initiative. The Washington peace talks have identified the party that is evading to obstruct peace efforts. Concluding its commentary, AL-BA'TH says: By reiterating his impossible conditions and emphasizing his rejection of complete withdrawal from the Golan, Rabin has shown that he could not care less about the terms of reference of the peace initiative, chief among which is the principle of trading land for peace. As for Rabin's determination to conclude separate deals with the Arab sides, it will not help achieve peace. For the results of the Oslo and Cairo agreements speak for themselves. Worse still, the potential harm of these agreements is too serious to be underrated, contrary to the views of some people. This is because the region will not see stability except when there is a comprehensive peace based on the withdrawal of occupation troops from all occupied territories. The newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: In the course of its efforts to promote human rights and ensure compliance with the relevant international resolutions and conventions, the civilized world community must heed Israel's oppression, injustice, and repression against the Palestinian people. Israel must be held responsible for the consequences of its conduct in the occupied territories. AL-THAWRAH believes that recent developments, which have shown Israel's escalation, maneuvering, and circumvention of the peace process to render it void of any meaningful content, cannot evoke optimism. In such a climate, one cannot envisage a peaceful settlement of the regional conflict. The Tel Aviv rulers' deliberate escalation of the situation in the occupied territories and southern Lebanon, coupled with Rabin's statements on a partial withdrawal from the Golan, are all signals and indications showing that peace has never been, and will never be Israel's option unless it is imposed by international legitimacy; that is, by the implementation of international legitimacy resolutions on all fronts. AL-THAWRAH adds: Conquering nations and forcing dictates on them cannot produce peace. Peace becomes achievable when Israel recognizes the rights of others and accepts the restoration of their legitimate rights, which are enshrined in the relevant UN resolutions. AL-THAWRAH concludes by saying: The path to just and comprehensive peace is not paved with roses. Likewise, peace is not achievable when separate deals and partial solutions are reached, particularly since such deals have demonstrated their futility, and failed thus far to bring security and stability even to their authors, let alone the entire region. It is no longer acceptable to acquiesce to Israel's aggressiveness and noncompliance with the relevant international legitimacy resolutions. It follows from this that nobody, including the U.S. cosponsor of the peace talks, should be allowed to continue to support Israel.
