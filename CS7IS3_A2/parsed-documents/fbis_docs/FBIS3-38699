Has the moment now come when admitting defeat is topical? [Rehn] No doubt the time has come. As I have said, I want to see at least 70 percent, looking at past experience. Now that number has been counted and the trend is not leveling, but on the contrary, the difference seems to be growing, so I concede very willingly that Martti is the winner. I have been repeatedly asked that defeat must be conceded and if everybody is happy for me to make that admission, I will give it gladly. But believe it or not, I am immensely proud that I have achieved this result because it is against all expectations. All possible barriers have been broken here and I think this is splendid as far as I am concerned. [Turunen] The dramatic moment of these elections has thus been experienced. Elisabeth Rehn has conceded defeat to Martti Ahtisaari. In brief, why did you lose this campaign, what decided this? [Rehn] I would leave that option to various analysts; I am no election expert. I myself know that I had a good campaign with small resources. I had no party machinery behind me, but jolly amateurs, enthusiasts, eager people were behind me, and we worked hard and happily. What makes me most happy is that we never took the dirty road. I can look at myself in the mirror and so can my election staff, so I am really satisfied. [Turunen] What will Elisabeth Rehn do after this? [Rehn] I will go to the election party. [Turunen] In politics? [Rehn] I hold the post of defense minister and will stick to that as long as the government is in power. I am a parliament deputy, we have parliament elections in just over a year. Let us see then what I will do. [passage omitted]
