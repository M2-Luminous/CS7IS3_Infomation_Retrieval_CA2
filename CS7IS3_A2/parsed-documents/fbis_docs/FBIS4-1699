According to Wang Dezhou, who is in charge of the city's labor affairs, Shenyang now has 303 intermediary organizations bridging labor supply and demand. Wang said that in recent years job agencies in the city have received a total of 2.27 million job applicants. He said the agencies have so far helped find jobs for 260,000 jobless people, redeployed 170,000 redundant workers, transferred 280,000 technicians and found re-employment for 690,000 retired workers. This largest industrial center in northeast China has granted enterprises autonomy in hiring and firing workers. The implementation of the contract system has helped nurture a more rationalized employment mechanism that reflects labor market supply and demand. Meanwhile, the minimum wage system has also been introduced in the city, the official said. He said the mobility of technical workers has eased a conflict between the structure of industries and the make-up of the work force, as well as unleashed a freer flow of technology.
