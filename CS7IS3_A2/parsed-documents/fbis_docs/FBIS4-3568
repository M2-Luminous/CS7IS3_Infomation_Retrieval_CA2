The Ministry of Civil Affairs, the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television and the Ministry of Culture will jointly hold a large show and a charity auction in a bid to raise more funds for orphans. A group of well-known cultural and artistic workers, and business people have volunteered to join "Songs for Orphans", a fund-raising program launched by the Beijing Music Radio Station. More and more people are taking part in the publicity campaign, which has also won great support from many overseas Chinese. Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Qiao Shi have recently each sent personal messages of support to the campaign. China is believed to have about 100,000 orphans. But living standards of orphans are below the national per capita average. Orphans now living in various welfare organizations across the country only have an average monthly living expense of 50 yuan. The helping-the-orphan program was initiated by the China Society for the Promotion of Social Services, under the guidance of the Ministry of Civil Affairs. The program is aimed at pooling more funds and other resources to help orphans live a better life, resume study, to help upgrade endangered buildings in welfare centers and to buy more medical equipment for welfare facilities.
