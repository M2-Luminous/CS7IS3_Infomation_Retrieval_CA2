The FBR forms plutonium and generates electric power at the same time, so it produces a greater amount of fresh fuel than it consumes. The present Long-Range Plan for Development and Use of Atomic Energy (established in 1990) targets construction for the FBR demonstration reactor to begin in the latter half of the 1990s. The demonstration reactor, which will have an output of 670,000 kW, is the successor to the FBR prototype Monju (Tsuruga City, Fukui Prefecture; output 280,00 kW) built by PNC that is due to reach criticality next year. It has already been determined that the demonstration reactor will have a top entry format, which will give it shorter piping and a simpler structure than Monju. The site, however, is still undecided. The Federation of Electric Power Companies FBR Policy Council, consisting of the Executive Vice Presidents in Charge of Atomic Energy of the Nine Power Companies, has been reviewing the question of when to start construction of the FBR demonstration reactor. The Council concluded in its interim report that construction should be postponed. Mr. Abe said, ``I believe there will be a report (on delaying the start of construction) at the next Nine Power Companies Presidential Meeting (scheduled for 15 December).'' For the same amount of output, construction costs FBRs will not only run 1.5 times those of the mainstream LWR commercial power plants currently in use, but it appears that delays in the startup of Monju have affected the decision to postpone construction of the demonstration reactor. The U.S. and countries in Europe, which led the way in FBR research, are abandoning or suspending FBR projects one after the other.
