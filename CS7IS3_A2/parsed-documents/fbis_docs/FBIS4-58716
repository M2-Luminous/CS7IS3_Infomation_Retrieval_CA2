A: The economic situation is very difficult and embarrassing. The circumstances in which we are now, with the closure of the occupied territories, the curfews, the inability of people to commute or reach Jerusalem, and the prohibition of laborers to reach their places of work in Israel, have paralyzed the whole situation in a way never seen before in our area. Shops have closed and factories are empty, becoming a burden to their owners. The people have become a consumer society using their savings if they have any. The loss to our economy is between $6-7 million daily, not to mention the mental stress through which the people are going. Q: What about the economic loss in Hebron? A: The situation in Hebron is a little different, and the losses there are worse than in all other parts of the occupied territories combined. The daily losses in Hebron alone, during the closure, have been $2 million, and the overall effect is very visible. Q: What are the necessary requirements to develop the Palestinian economy in the next stage? A: The requirements could be summarized in the following points: 1. Political and social stability. Giving the people the freedom to make their own choices politically and economically. This is one of the most important elements for the development of the Palestinian economic situation. When they are given the freedom to choose, then more doors are open to them, and they have the opportunity to develop economically. 2. Organizing the infrastructure of the Palestinian authority and its public and primary institutions so that it will be ready to operate. 3. Determining the legal framework and required legislation for the economic and social activities that will give Palestinians the opportunity to lay down social and economic laws that are required for economic development. 4. Continuing the development of human and natural resources to provide an effective basis for economic activities, which includes raising the standards of the Palestinian individuals in all domains, knowing that the availability of human resources is very important. 5. Concentrating on the financial infrastructure for the Palestinian economy, as well as the social infrastructure, and limiting priorities, such as correction of the health situation, water networks, sewage systems, roads, modes of transportation and power networks. Setting up a strong industrial base in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which includes support for the already existing industries, and at the same time, develop new industries. Expanding housing developments to absorb the growing population and those returning from the diaspora. Encouraging the export sector and finding the necessary support services for that sector. Expanding and developing the agriculture sector including the livestock sector. Developing the Palestinian countryside, which in turn will create jobs for the unemployed as well as providing educational, health and entertainment services, so that the countryside will start attracting people. Organizing the financial sector to serve those investing in the economy through different institutions. 6. Strengthening Palestinian economic ties with the other Arab countries and the world, and opening new markets in order to promote and sell various Palestinian goods. 7. Using natural resources to the maximum. It is also important to let all Palestinians, inside and outside the occupied territories, invest in the infrastructure and facilitate the opportunities for those abroad, in terms of tax reductions and so on. Q: How do we achieve Palestinian economic independence in the transitional period? A: There is a Palestinian plan for development until the year 2000. If implemented according to all economic principles, it will be a good start for an independent Palestinian economy. I think that in the absence of occupation and with the presence of a Palestinian authority, economic independence from the Israelis will follow. It will give the Palestinians the opportunity to develop and take charge of themselves. Q: Do you see any dangers facing the Palestinian economy in terms of the funding which has been pledged by various institutions and countries? A: There are studies which deal with the needs of the Palestinian economy, the most important of which are the ones done by the World Bank and the Palestinian plan for development until the year 2000. This plan will take an estimated $12 billion. There are promises from the World Bank and some countries to support the latter plan depending on its priorities. Several agreements were signed in regards to it. Some EC countries have also shown their willingness to support certain projects. Some of the support will be in the form of grants and some in the form of loans without any strings attached. If used correctly, this money will aid in building the economy.
