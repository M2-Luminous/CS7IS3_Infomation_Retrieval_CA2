L'OPINION, citing official sources, claims that acts of intimidation are being perpetrated against tax authorities in the wilaya of Algiers, according to the official press agency APS. The intimidation campaign is being waged by means of threats against tax collectors, demanding that they quit collecting taxes beginning 17 February. It goes without saying that the terrorists hope with these threats--which some are too frightened to withstand--to bring an already reeling state to its knees. Especially since, according to unconfirmed reports, some municipal tax authorities take the threats dead seriously. This is the case, for example, with a certain fiscal entity in uptown Algiers where several resignations reportedly have been submitted following receipt of such threats. All this attests to the urgent need for the state to throw all its weight against the latest in this seemingly endless series of terrorist challenges. In that regard, official sources quoted by APS have vowed that: "the destabilization efforts will not succeed in interfering with the operations of the tax authorities, and the authors of these threats will soon be identified and brought to justice." The same sources add that tax authorities, "with the steadfast support of their conscientious and devoted employees," intend to continue their "valiant struggle against tax fraud and evasion and their efforts to improve collections of imposts and taxes that belong to the nation." Meanwhile, it is interesting to note that these threats have come just as the tax collectors were launching an ambitious campaign against tax fraud and evasion, which has cost the Treasury some 5 trillion (yes, five trillion!) centimes. One can imagine the importance of such a sum at a time when the country is facing unprecedented financial needs. According to APS, the lost collections would be enough to build 75,000 housing units. In other words, such a vast sum could provide shelter to more than 600,000 Algerians who lack any decent sort of housing. Given all these facts, one cannot fail to ask why the terrorists (and their hidden backers) have chosen this particular time to attack the tax sector? The answer is obvious to many observers: In addition to undermining the authority of the state, the terrorists are trying to protect their own channels of funding. In fact, the 5 trillion in lost revenue must be sought within the parasitic informal sector, the terrorists' principal domestic source of financing. The linkage between smugglers, speculators, and terrorists has been proved many times over in raids on various terrorist cells and in trials of individual terrorists. At the same time, by acting in this fashion the terrorists are trying to apply on a grand scale the racket they are already practicing in small localities on the south side of Algiers. Their other objective over the medium and longer term is to prevent implementation of serious economic reforms, since they realize a market economy cannot be built without a modern, proactive, and above all effective tax service. In light of all these facts, it seems necessary to emphasize the importance and gravity of this new challenge. Shortly after now-deceased president Mohamed Boudiaf returned to Algeria, one of his confidants said the state's authority could be gauged by its ability to enforce the highway laws. Today, it must also defend its power to tax.
