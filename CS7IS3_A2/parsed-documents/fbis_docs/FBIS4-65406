It was apparently unavoidable and overdue. Delors vehemently rejected Waigel's proposal to form an independent team of experts that would review all legislation of the EU "as to whether unnecessary regulations can be eliminated and whether reliefs for the enterprises are possible." At the finance ministers' meeting in Brussels on Monday [16 May], Delors made no secret that he understood this proposal as a vote of no-confidence against himself because the Commission has been examining the tangle of EU rules for quite some time. Bonn's financial leader does not deny that. His proposal has a completely different background. The Commission's efforts are taking place under the motto "subsidiarity." It is discussing the distribution of the competence between the community and the member states. Waigel's suggestion, however, is partly an attempt to translate the findings of the so-called "White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness, and Employment" into practical economic policy in the community of the Twelve. The leader of the Christian Social Union has recently criticized that this White Paper, which was drafted by Delors and his aides behind closed doors, threatens "to fall apart because of the lack of a cohesive concept." In fact, the White Paper contains some ideas that the Federal Government supports: More Europewide norms and standards to ensure a more efficient use of the single market, EU-wide tax and financial reliefs for small and medium-sized enterprises, open external borders and flexibility of the labor markets, as well as deregulation and consistent privatization. Yet the main emphasis of the White Paper is on "trans-European energy, transportation, information, and communications networks," whose rudimentary establishment alone, however, would involve over 300 billion German marks. It is true that Delors' arguments that the national states are primarily responsible for deregulation, privatization, and the general reform of the political preconditions for competitiveness and job-creating investments, but that Brussels should be entrusted with planning trans-European networks are logical. However, one cannot ignore the fact that the Commission is increasingly fascinated by the prospect of launching large projects involving huge sums that would make it possible to indulge in the redistribution ideology to an even greater extent. Even the Brussels news service AGENCE EUROPE, which is completely loyal to the Commission, announced recently that the EU working group, "Networks," is making good progress, whereas the group, "Employment," which is considered more important in Bonn, is lagging behind. Delors' policy is totally in keeping with the thought pattern of his home country. The two governing conservative parties, the Gaullist Rally for the Republic and Giscard d'Estaing's liberal-conservative Union for French Democracy, are basing their current campaign for the European elections on the "large building programs" that are currently being drafted in Brussels. The EU heads of state and government want to examine what has become of the White Paper in about four months. They will probably have to make enormous efforts to cover up the fact that the economic concepts of the northern and the southern member states are hardly compatible. The dividing line runs between France and Germany. As early as the most recent summit in Brussels in December, when the White Paper was presented, dissonance arose spontaneously. The Commission pointed out the significance of a solid budget policy to the member states, always trying to use the "networks" as a vehicle for obtaining permission to take up capital at its own initiative.
