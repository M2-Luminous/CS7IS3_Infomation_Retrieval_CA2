The decision was adopted in compliance with resolutions the UN Security Council has taken against the military officers who overthrew Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and against Libyan leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, who is accused of promoting terrorism. The Foreign Ministry decrees enable Attorney General Jorge Valdes to "immediately" order the freezing of Libyan and Haitian military funds. The Foreign Ministry measure regarding Haiti also prohibits the Haitian military from entering Panama and bars exports and imports to and from that country. President Guillermo Endara's government has also banned Panamanian airplanes from flying to Haiti. These UN measures were adopted in order to restore democracy in Haiti and reinstate deposed President Aristide. Concerning Libya, in addition to ordering the freeze on funds and properties of that Arab government or companies, Panama has prohibited the sale of equipment the al-Qadhdhafi regime could use for oil exploration.
