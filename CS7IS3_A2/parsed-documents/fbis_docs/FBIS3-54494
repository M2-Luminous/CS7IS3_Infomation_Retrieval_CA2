Reached by telephone in Washington, Dr. al-Tarawinah told AL-RA'Y: We began to discuss topics on the Jordanian-Israeli agenda, delving into some details. The aim is to make sure that the Israeli position on them has not changed since 14 September 1993, the date the agenda was signed. Dr. al-Tarawinah added: We also reviewed the points at which we stopped in the previous round. The purpose is to prepare for the next round of bilateral talks and for the work of the two sides' working teams and experts. This, of course, will take place only after all the Arab delegations decide to collectively participate in the next round. It is natural that the heads of delegations are not experts or technicians in all specializations. Therefore, we began in this second coordination and consultation meeting at the State Department to prepare for sub-agendas for the three working groups-- environment, water, and energy; refugees and economy; and security and borders. He added that these agendas are still under discussion and no final agreement regarding them has yet been reached. [passage omitted]
