Develops High-Grade Fluorine Waste Water Treatment System 94FE0232E Tokyo DEMPA SHIMBUN in Japanese 25 Nov 93 p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94FE0232E Tokyo DEMPA SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:CSO [Text] On 24 November, NEC Corporation announced that it had succeeded in developing new, advanced technology for processing waste water that contains fluorine, in which the amount of sludge generated during the processing will be reduced to 1/30th that of existing coagulation methods. NEC will build a pilot plant soon, and will try to achieve practical application in 1 to 2 years at semiconductor plants, etc. This is expected to contribute greatly to reducing the rapidly increasing cost of sludge processing. The recently developed technology entails repeated use of aluminum hydroxide in gel form as an adsorbent to process fluorine waste water. This makes it possible to drastically reduce the concentration of the fluorine waste water without generating coagulating sedimentation sludge. The technology uses the solubility of aluminum hydroxide in gel form, which causes transformation, and fluorine adsorptivity PH (an index that shows concentration of hydrogen ions in an aqueous solution; PH7 is neutral, with smaller values indicating stronger acidity and higher values indicating stronger alkalinity). The fluorine waste water processing method generally used at this time is a coagulation method in which calcium chloride is added to the fluorine waste water to fix most of the fluorine into refractory fluoro-calcium, then as advanced processing, a large quantity of sulfate band or other coagulant is added to form a coagulating sediment, with which the remaining fluorine is incorporated and coprecipitated. NEC, observed that although aluminum hydroxide in gel form had high fluorine adsorptivity when close to neutral, this dropped abruptly when it became alkaline. Thus it proceeded with research based on the assumption that low-cost, advanced processing of fluorine waste water without creating coagulating sedimentation sludge was possible if adsorbed fluorine could be desorbed and recovered efficiently. As a result, NEC succeeded in developing technology to desorb adsorbed fluorine through PH manipulation, as follows: ``Aluminum hydroxide in gel form at the stable level of PH7 caused fluorine adsorption. At PH9, calcium chloride was added to desorb the adsorbed fluorine into fluoro-calcium. Then at PH11, when the aluminum hydroxide was dissolved completely, the fluoro-calcium was filtered out and the filtrate was returned to PH7 to regenerate aluminum hydroxide in gel form.'' The conclusions from the above are as follows: (1) Aluminum hydroxide in gel form used as a fluorine adsorbent is not discharged outside the element, so the amount of sludge is about 1/30th the amount created by the coagulation method; (2) the processing efficiency of aluminum hydroxide is over 10 times that of other fluorine adsorbents because its adsorbing area is large; (3) aluminum hydroxide in gel form can be formed by neutralizing inexpensive aluminum chloride, so the cost is low, under 1/10; (4) no special adsorption preprocessing is required, so equipment cost is low because about 20% addition to existing equipment will be sufficient.
