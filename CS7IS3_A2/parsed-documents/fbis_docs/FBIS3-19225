"No one else is named," Borrelli added, as he confirmed the reports that Giuseppe Turani of LA REPUBBLICA, Osvaldo de Paolini IL SOLE-24 ORE, and Ugo Bertone of LA STAMPA were named by Sama. Sama presented himself to magistrates last week to discuss payments made to journalists in order to ensure favourable press coverage for the Ferruzzi empire, after financier Sergio Cusani, on trial in Milan, confirmed that large sums had been put aside by Ferruzzi for this purpose, but refused to name the journalists involved. The chief prosecutor said he will now be consulting his assistants to gauge whether the journalists' case is a criminal or disciplinary one. If it is disciplinary, "we would simply pass on the documentation...and the three journalists would not even be called in for questioning." At that point, the order of journalists, which oversees the profession, would step in and could strike the three off its list of members. In statements issued this morning, the three journalists named by Sama strongly denied the press reports, which at the time had not received confirmation from Borrelli. Claiming always to have worked "in complete honesty, and correctly," Turani said "I categorically exclude ever having received sums of money from Carlo Sama." Turani, an economic journalist who said he would be stepping down as editorialist of the Rome daily LA REPUBBLICA until his name is cleared, said that his journalism is proof "of total independence and intransigence with regard to all industrial groups, including Ferruzzi." Ugo Bertone, head of the Milan bureau of the Turin daily LA STAMPA stated "I have never taken, either directly or indirectly, a lire from him (Sama), from the Ferruzzi group or from Montedison." In a comment to the press, Bertone added "I think I have written one article about Sama in the last two years. According to him I receive 100 million lire (60,000 dollars) for this. That's the kind of money a Pulitzer prize winner gets, and I am not one of those." De Paolini also denied having received money "from Carlo Sama or anyone acting for him, either in relation to the family project nor to any other project linked to the image of the Ferruzzis or Montedison." Sama alleged that sums were paid out to journalists to enhance the image of the Ferruzzi family after its acrimonious split with brother-in-law Raul Gardini, who ran the Ferruzzi empire and its Montedison division until 1991. De Paolini, who has appealed against a journalists' order decision to expel him for alleged insider trading, challenged Sama to come up with proof of the under-the-counter payments. Later in the day, Bertone, in charge of LA STAMPA's Milan bureau, said he was taking leave as the newspaper's union representatives issued a communique in which the editorial staff voiced "full confidence in the work of the judiciary and confidence that full clarity will be quickly brought to the `clean pens' case."
