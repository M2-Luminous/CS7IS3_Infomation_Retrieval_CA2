At a binational meeting held recently in Cucuta the parties agreed to establish, after 17 years of talks, a technical committee to exploit and preserve the basin of the Catatumbo River, which "has been damaged by irrational exploitation by the two countries of their respective upper basins," said Omar Baralt, president of the Venezuelan Presidential Commission on Border Affairs. Baralt said that the Catatumbo River, with its headwaters in Colombia and its drainage into the sea in Venezuela, is an ecosystem that supplies 60 percent of the fresh water that flows into Lake Maracaibo. "We have high stakes in this," he warned. Colombia rejected in the beginning any understanding claiming principles of sovereignty, because it argued that Venezuela was merely offering it participation in the preservation of that basin. Baralt added that "in view that no agreement was reached then, we insisted over the past 17 years and managed to reach an agreement with OAS assistance to settle sovereignty problems between the two nations." This agreement states that the two nations, through the OAS, will preserve the basin by implementing a medium-run comprehensive plan. Omar Baralt added that in that zone "not only the basin is being destroyed but there is heavy contamination of the river, because the Departments of Santander and Norte de Santander, which contain 85 percent of the population estimated at between 6 and 8 million inhabitants, are along the Catatumbo River." The president of the commission on border affairs also voiced his concern over the exploitation of coal, which is highly contaminating, which was detected in the Catatumbo Basin.
