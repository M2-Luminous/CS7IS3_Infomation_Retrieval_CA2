The fact that everyone is for the end of hostilities and the return to negotiations is encouraging. As regards this we are not setting any conditions, for we believe that there is no alternative to peace, Krajisnik said. Expressing his optimism, Krajisnik said "peace will come soon." Admittedly, we also have some have objections, primarily to the four-month cease-fire, for we think that a seasonal truce does not lead to an overall solution of the problem, Krajisnik said and added: But if this is a compromise needed to stop the Muslim hawks, who want to continue the war at any price, then we will agree to it. The main stumbling block in the future will be the unequal treatment of the republic of Srpska in the negotiations, Krajisnik said, and specified that he was referring to the lifting of the sanctions. The contact group for Bosnia has not done what it should have done -- that is it has not made clear to all parties involved our position -- that we do not want to negotiate until the sanctions are lifted, Krajisnik said, stressing that the Serbs will firmly insist on this. The Geneva agreement definitely acknowledged two countries in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is better than having three, but we are confused by the territorial division of 51 [for Bosniaks, Croats] and 49 percent [for the Serbs], Krajisnik said. According to him these percentages were used when the option of three countries in the area was being discussed. Any division is possible, but this kind of simplified one, which does not take into consideration the relation between the quantity and quality of the territory, is not acceptable to us, Krajisnik said and added: Perhaps this decision is some misunderstanding, or it is purposeful, but one must know that one percent of Sarajevo is worth five percent of some other part of the Bosnian territory. We do not rule out any combination and the Serbs will, to enable certain corrections, cede some territory to the other side, but much less than the Muslims think we will, he said and stressed: We will cede territory because we want to show the world that we are for peace and cooperation. We have shown this many times so far, but in return our willingness to make concessions was interpreted as a sign of weakness and offensives were then launched against us, Krajisnik said and added, current Muslim attacks on Ozren and provocations around Brcko are parts of the same scenario and if they do not stop the Serbs will have to respond in kind.
