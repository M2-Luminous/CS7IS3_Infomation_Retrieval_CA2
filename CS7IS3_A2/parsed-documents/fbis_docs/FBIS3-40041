According to the first rough estimates, this could give Sweden's three northernmost provinces around 1,000 kronor per inhabitant in EU support. "This EU proposal represents a major step forward," European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel said after Tuesday's negotiations with EU ministers. "It is a good, even a very good basis for continued discussions. I am convinced that on the basis of this we will be able to reach a satisfactory compromise." The new regional support on which the EU countries have reached agreement is based on the proposal from the EU Commission which was vociferously rejected by France and Spain on Monday [21 February] evening. But on Tuesday morning these countries were also able to back the support after its name had been changed from Objective 1(A) to Objective 6 support and had been adjusted on a number of points. Objective 6 support will go to regions with less than eight inhabitants per square kilometer. In Sweden this qualifies the inland areas of Norrbotten and Vasterbotten provinces and Jamtland, but not western Norrland, for which the Swedish negotiators have also demanded support. On the basis of the EU's own figures, Ulf Dinkelspiel estimates that this could give 500 to 800 million kronor per year in Swedish regional support -- a figure which can be compared with Sweden's total regional support of around 3 billion kronor. A snag with the EU's proposal is that it is described as "a transitional arrangement" that will be reassessed in 1999 when the EU reviews its rules on regional policy. "I raised this matter and they were prepared to remove the phrase about a transitional arrangement," Ulf Dinkelspiel said. However, Swedish negotiators are not wholly satisfied with the Objective 6 proposal. They still want support for a larger chunk of Sweden and are asking for clearer figures. On the subject of support for agriculture in Norrland, the Swedish negotiators are also pleased with the openings that have occurred. "The EU's proposal goes a fair way toward meeting our demands even if though it is not as precise as we might wish," Ulf Dinkelspiel said. The EU has given the green light for the principle that agriculture in northernmost Sweden, Norway, and Finland needs special support. In the view of the EU this support can go to smaller farms in areas with less than 10 inhabitants per square kilometer, north of the 62d parallel. However, in certain cases it will also be possible to provide this support south of this line of latitude. The EU has also said OK to areas north of the 62d parallel having the right to expanded so-called LFA [less-favored areas] support from the EU which is normally given to "mountain agriculture" above an altitude of 800 meters. Agriculture Minister Karl-Erik Olsson estimates that the LFA support could cover 25-30 percent of the billion-krona support that today goes to Norrland agriculture every year. Sweden has also demanded that the EU must accept responsibility for half of the sum needed to cover the rest of support for Norrland, but the EU has said no. Sweden must meet that bill itself, it says. "We have not abandoned the demand that the EU must be involved in footing the bill," Karl-Erik Olsson said, but he seems to think that negotiations on this point will be tough. There was also a disappointing message from the EU on Swedish milk and sugar quotas. Sweden has demanded a milk quota of 3.5 million tonnes. As expected, the EU is currently offering 3.1 million tonnes. For sugar production Sweden demanded a quota of 440,000 tonnes, while the EU wants a quota of only 350,000 tonnes. This offer is even lower than the Commission's original proposal. At Tuesday's negotiations the Swedish demand for a phasing-in of its budget contributions was also discussed. In the first few years of Swedish membership Sweden wants to pay a reduced membership fee and then gradually increase its payments. But the EU countries have agreed to reject this demand. "We explained that Sweden is not demanding a rebate. From the first day we want to pay the amount that Swedish EU membership costs the EU. We will be paying our full contribution in 1999," Dinkelspiel said, adding laconically: "The reception was not enthusiastic." On two minor points Sweden and the other Nordic countries were able to reach agreement with the EU. A declaration was adopted to the effect that even after EU membership Nordic cooperation will continue for Sweden, Norway, and Finland. In addition a special Lapp protocol recognizing the Lapps' exclusive right to engage in reindeer farming and stressing Sweden's, Norway's, and Finland's commitment to the preservation of the culture and way of life of the Lapp people.
