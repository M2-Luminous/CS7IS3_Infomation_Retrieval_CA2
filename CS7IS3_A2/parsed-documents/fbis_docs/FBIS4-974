The clashes broke out in Hutu-dominated areas of the city, the sources said. A government statement said Prime Minister Anatole Kanyenkiko had taken measures to "make those who are armed lay down their weapons." Unrest has mounted in some areas on the outskirts of the city for the last few days. Sources said sporadic small arms fire had been reported in the areas for the last few days. The government called on observers from the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to be deployed in the areas "to work with civilian and military officials to create confidence between the different ethnic groups." The fresh unrest came two weeks after the death of Burundian President Cyprien Ntaryamira on April 6 in a plane crash in neighbouring Rwanda, which also killed Rwandan head of state Juvenal Habyarimana. Inter-ethnic unrest in Rwanda is reported to have killed thousands in the two weeks since the plane crash.
