I would like to point out that I do not intend to enter into a polemical discussion with Mr. Secares, but I would rather try to clarify a few points raised in my interview with the same newspaper, an interview that was published a few days before his interview. For the uninformed reader, I would like to recall that "A Future for Romania" was initially the title of one of the three motions submitted to the 28 March 1992 National Convention of the former National Salvation Front [FSN], a motion that was not adopted. During the aforementioned convention, the FSN split and a grouping initially called the Democratic National Salvation Front [FDSN] and later the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] emerged. What happened with the "A Future for Romania" option? Well, it remained outside the party structures, turning itself into a kind of "Political Academy," with an internal life tacitly supported through the functioning of the National School for Administrative Studies and Police, an institution sponsored by this grouping. Of course, as I said, sometime in the middle of 1990, it is infinitely easier to sit on the sidelines and criticize what others are doing. By getting involved, you must cover the sinuous road of achievements and failures, which constantly exposes you to justified criticism of your mistakes. Examining now the road covered by the PDSR (and the FDSN previously), I can honestly say that many things could have been done differently than they actually were. Unfortunately -- or maybe one should say fortunately -- in politics, like in life, you cannot simultaneously follow two roads. You cannot both take a medicine and also not take it if you want to check its usefulness. In politics, you must assume responsibility for decisions where the alternatives are not clear-cut. Most often, you have to choose between 45-55 percent solutions, in circumstances whereby it is impossible to estimate the evolution of the two choices. The people involved in politics are held responsible for all bungling decisions, while the fact that someone has to take a decision of sorts is often omitted. Therefore, we would have gladly welcomed the involvement of the supporters of the aforementioned motion in a party political activity and we would have applauded their successes and criticized their failures. That would have been a more manly and honest dispute. Unfortunately, the majority of motion supporters, including Mr. Vasile Secares, preferred to remain outside the party battle and slightly above it so as to occasionally pass judgment -- often quite pertinently -- on the political climate in Romania. It is like writing reports about a war you are not participating in. However, there is no doubt that they are entitled to their choice. Returning to my previous interview, I would like to emphasize several other elements. First, referring to the political crisis in Romania, Mr. Secares fails to give an appropriate explanation. If he wants to characterize the entire post-December 1989 political life in our country by using the term "crisis," then I must agree with him: Yes, we are going through a political crisis characteristic of the stage of political infancy, whose main feature is the miming of authentic politics, which is not suitable to Romania's situation of today. Indeed, by avoiding the imperious requirements of the current period, the political forces in Romania engaged themselves in a sterile dispute that has nothing to do with what must be done by all of us. I remember a significant moment. A few weeks ago -- to be more precise, in a television broadcast on Monday 25 April -- correspondent Cristache asked Petre Roman, president of the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front) [PD(FSN)], whether he feels he is fulfilling his mission of parliamentarian. With his known elegance and precision, Mr. Petre Roman presented a summary of the parliamentary actions, with which he has combated the governmental solutions. It was a kind of synopsis of an opposition stance. There is no doubt that we do not have the right to ignore the barricade side we happen to be on. Nevertheless, reality is above us all. I would have liked to ask my friend and political adversary Petre Roman what his answers might have been to all those accusations if he had been the leader of the government party or the country's prime minister? In today's conditions, are we allowed to change our options from one extreme to the other in function of our stand vis-a-vis those temporarily in power at a certain point? May we change our position vis-a-vis the relations with the IMF, as a function of whether we are in power or not? Therefore, proceeding from this example, I agree with the term of "politicking" used in the aforementioned interview, a term attributed to the attitude of the majority of the political parties in Romania. If Mr. Secares is exclusively referring to the current moment when talking about the political crisis in Romania, I will tell him that he is wrong and tendentious. As I have already said in the past, the concept of political crisis, as it refers to a given moment, is a formula invented by the opposition in its attempt to gain political capital. For a long time, the PDSR was damned for everything by having the most colorful invectives hurled at it: neo, crypto, and everything else that could be put before the word "communist" was attributed to the party to suggest the revival of communism. Initially, things were simplified to ridiculous proportions when one proceeded to evaluate the Romanian political spectrum: On the one hand, you had an identifiable evil -- that is, the PDSR, an infernal instrument of the return to the past; on the other hand, you had an incontestable good, represented by the forces of opposition, which are allegedly promoting progress and reform, although they opposed all measures for their implementation. This kind of evaluation lasted until a stable majority centered around the PDSR took shape. With the emergence of this majority, the concept of political crisis also emerged. The script is so simple and clear that I am offended by the hope of those who concocted it that we would fall into the trap set for us. The first stage consisted in an attempt to isolate the PDSR from its allies, which helped our party cover the Calvary of reform, by omitting to mention that those who claim to want the reform were also the ones who actually raised the greatest obstacles in the path of reform. I do not want to give examples, so as to not appear too obvious. The second stage consisted of an attempt to turn the PDSR, which ceased to be called neocommunist, into a kind of ping-pong match between the Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR] and the PD(FSN) -- that is, into a kind of minority beggar within a coalition that would have decided its existence. The solution proposed by Mr. Secares for solving the hardships of the transition in Romania is a variant of the "A Future for Romania" type, that is a nonparty or supraparty variant, which would realign the parliamentarians -- some from the PDSR, others from the CDR, and some from the PD(FSN). First of all, I regret that his solution omitted to mention the other parliamentary groupings, which are equally entitled to a role. I also cannot refrain from raising a scholarly question: On the basis of what criteria will those parliamentarians be elected? Are we going to set up a supraparty or an extraparty of just a few people? I believe the realistic thing to do is to convince all parties that, for a certain period of time, we must all work together to come out of the deadlock, while maintaining our identity, as it is confirmed by the various parliamentary and extraparliamentary official acts. I am saying all this because I am deeply convinced that Mr. Secares' solution, although attractive at first glance, is mere utopia. I agree that we are at a crossroads, albeit less obvious than the ones we have put behind us in the past one and a half years of government. I agree that we must undertake something to ensure the triumph of the good values. However, unlike Mr. Secares, I believe that this can only be achieved from within the parties, be they good or less good, as the situation is today. We must pool our political efforts, but only after clarifications that must occur within each party. In the medium run, the parties must shape Romania's political life around several basic choices based on pragmatism: center-right, center, and center-left, with their natural satellites, to preserve the stability of the political spectrum.
