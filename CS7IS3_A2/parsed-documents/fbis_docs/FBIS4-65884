FBIS4-65884 "drweu101_i_94007" FBIS-WEU-94-101 Daily Report 25 May 1994 FRANCE On Prospects for Defense Program On Prospects for Defense Program LD2505111794 LD2505111794 BFN [Editorial Report] Paris France-Inter Radio Network in French at 0620 GMT on 25 May carries a 10-minute, recorded interview with Defense Minister Francois Leotard by Arnette Ardisson. The interview is described as taking place following the debate on the military program in the National Assembly; the date and place are not given. Discussing the point of holding the debate, Leotard notes that they are making plans for the future, and though it is unspectacular, the long-term is the most important thing. Leotard says he and Prime Minister Balladur respect the constitution, and the debate goes beyond party political issues. There is a broad consensus. Ardisson asks whether Leotard would prefer unanimity in the assembly on the defense program, even if the Socialists insist the Baumel amendment on the resumption of nuclear tests is defeated as a price for their support. Leotard responds: "I think that when unanimity is artificial, it is deceptive. I am not looking for unanimity. We are proposing this bill, and we shall have this amendment." Leotard is then asked whether he hopes the amendment will be withdrawn. He replies: "In itself, it isn't an obstacle or provocative. Not at all. It says more or less the same thing as the president is saying, as the prime minister and I are saying -- namely, that at the right time we shall have to hold tests again. But that isn't the main thing in the bill. Let me remind you that we devote twice as much money to conventional weaponry as we do to nuclear arms. Twice as much. And that really is something new; we should stress that." Leotard goes on to say that he does hope the amendment is withdrawn "because it doesn't add anything, and it doesn't come into the area of the law. You know, the assembly more and more passes laws on issues that are outside its competence. This should be an administrative procedure. Tests really fall under administrative procedures -- in other words, an executive decision. But it is proper and good that we should talk about them. As far as I am concerned, as I told the assembly, I have provided for the necessary allocations to enable the head of state, today's or tomorrow's, if he deems it necessary -- and he is the one who has to deem it necessary -- to decide to resume or not to resume. My duty is to prepare the tool, to see that it is possible. But it is up to the president to decide -- today's or tomorrow's. Today's has already responded." Leotard then defends French defense spending by invoking France's history of being invaded and its commitments abroad -- with 200,000 French nationals in sub-Saharan Africa and 11 million sq. km of ocean to defend. There are 70,000 soldiers currently outside metropolitan France. He recalls the lesson learned in 1940, when the French Army found itself up against a modern army. Ardisson asks if Leotard meant what he said about reducing French troops in Bosnia. Leotard answers: "I can tell you that what I said is exactly the case. You'll see -- I'll be only too glad to come and talk to you at the at the end of the year -- the numbers and intentions I have announced will be implemented. It is a French decision, corresponding to the way the crisis is developing: We are going to reduce our forces in Bosnia, and we shall regroup them in Sarajevo. This is a fact, it's a decision we have made, and that's it."
