The wagons, the first of its kind ever bought from China by this South Asian country, were manufactured by the Beijing February 7th rollingstock works, according to Wang Yanping, marketing manager of the works. The factory, a major wagons builder in China, has adopted international standards in manufacturing these wagons valued more than 2 million U.S. dollars, Wang said. Local officials in charge of the matter said that the introduction of the wagons will largely strengthen local railways' cargo transporting capacity. Bangladesh, suffering from traffic jams everywhere, is eager to improve its railway network, and many foreign companies including some from China are competing one another to enter the potential market. Besides cargo wagons, Bangladesh needs to import more locomotives and passenger compartments.
