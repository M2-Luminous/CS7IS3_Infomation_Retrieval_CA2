Speaking to journalists in Parliament at a press conference broadcast by Hungarian Radio, the president said the second free elections would, perhaps, be even more important than the first, as they will prove the continuity of democracy. Inasmuch as the second election in the switch to a civil democratic order will be clean and moderate, it will also provide a good report card on Hungarian democracy, Goncz said. The president called on the country's population to ensure a significant turnout at the elections.
