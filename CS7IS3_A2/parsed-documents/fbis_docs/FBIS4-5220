Hosokawa's announcement comes as Japan is seeking ways to resume the failed trade "framework" negotiations with the United States and as tensions run high on the Korean peninsula over North Korea's alleged development of nuclear weapons. "It would, of course, have an effect on diplomacy," a senior Foreign Ministry official said of the resignation decision. "But all we can do is go ahead with diplomacy calmly. For the time being, we will watch developments on the political scene." Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata was more blunt, saying the latest development would have a detrimental effect on Japan's relationship with the world. "Japan has become a country which can have some influence on various other countries," Hata told a press conference Friday evening, and expressed concern that the world would be anxious about the future course of Japanese politics. Hosokawa's resignation announcement sparked concern among Japanese diplomatic officials, especially with regard to Japan's relations with the U.S. since ties have soured following the collapse of trade negotiations at a meeting between Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton in February in Washington. "We will pay close attention to how the U.S. Government reacts" to Hosokawa's resignation, a senior ministry official said. The U.S. Government was said to have great expectations of the government, which emerged last August after nearly four decades of rule by the Liberal Democratic Party. Washington highly regarded the Hosokawa government as a promoter of political and economic reforms and Hosokawa himself had a trusting personal relationship with Clinton based on common experience and policy goals, according to ministry officials. Although Hosokawa told a press conference he wants to support reform even after stepping down, there is no guarantee the U.S. will be satisfied with the efforts of Hosokawa's successor. The officials saw next week's signing ceremony for a global trade accord under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Marrakech, Morocco, as a crucial opportunity to seek a breakthrough in resuming trade talks with Washington. Hata was expected to go to Marrakech and hold talks with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, but it is not yet clear whether he will go as scheduled as he is touted to be Hosokawa's successor. Japan wants stable and firm relations with the U.S., particularly at present, given the suspicion that North Korea is developing nuclear weapons. North Korea has repeatedly said it wants to hold dialogue only with the U.S. and has refused to hold talks with Japan. Although Hata said there will be no problem in coping with the issue even if the government changes, as Japanese administrations are consistent in continuing policies, cooperation among Japan, the U.S., South Korea and China is crucial to solving the problem. Upcoming diplomatic events also included Hosokawa's planned trip to Europe in early May to meet the European leaders of the Group of Seven (G-7) economic powers. The ministry officials considered the trip essential to getting to know the leaders ahead of the G-7 summit meeting in July in Naples, Italy. Hata was also scheduled to visit Middle East countries from late April to early May. As for visitors to Japan from abroad, Deputy Foreign Ministry Spokesman Kishichiro Amae said the upcoming visit by Egyptian President Husni Mubarak will go ahead as scheduled since it has already obtained cabinet approval.
