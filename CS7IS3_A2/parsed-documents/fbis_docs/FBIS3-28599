Public opinion varied regarding the appropriate timing for the elections, as over 30 percent each supported "as soon as possible after this fall" and "one or two years later." When asked which parties the respondents would like to vote for in the next elections, the LDP won 25 percent support for single-seat constituencies, and 26 percent for proportional representation constituencies. While the LDP held the top positions in both constituencies, its popularity declined by 6 percent from the previous survey held in June 1993 on the eve of the latest general elections. As the result, our latest survey revealed the decline of the LDP and Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]. On a multiple choice question on top priority issues, the second largest group of 46 percent said "anti-corruption measures" is the most important task after the political reform debates, although 68 percent indicated economic issues such as "the yen rate appreciation, recession, and inflation" are more important. It appeared the public strongly believe political reform efforts must not be concluded with the enactment of the new election system. Regarding the appropriate timing for the next general elections, 33 percent said "as soon as possible after this fall (when new election constituencies are prepared)," 32 percent said "one or two years later," and 22 percent said "elections are not needed until the terms of lower house members expire." The respondents' attitudes widely varied on the question. The YOMIURI questionnaire then asked which parties the respondents would like to vote for in the next general elections. For single-seat constituencies, the support rates for the LDP, the Japan New Party [JNP], Shinseito, and the SDPJ were 25, 18, 10, and 8 percent respectively. Both Sakigake and Komeito obtained support of 4 percent, and the Japan Communist Party [JCP] and the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] obtained support of 2 percent. The support rates for proportional representation constituencies were 26 percent for the LDP, 19 percent for the JNP, 10 percent for Shinseito, 9 percent for the SDPJ, 4 percent for Komeito, 3 percent for Sakigake, and 2 percent for the JCP and the DSP. In the June 1993 survey, the rates were 31 percent for the LDP, 15 percent for the SDPJ, and 12 percent for the JNP; however, these figures should be compared with those in the latest survey because Shinseito and Sakigake were organized after the previous survey.
