[Correspondent] Meaning there are changes? [Quray'] Whatever changes are made will be to enhance and flesh out the agreement. The core of the agreement will remain intact. [Correspondent] Do you think a new agreement or new protocols may be worked out between Jordan and the PLO? [Quray'] Certain committees may be revitalized. The existing agreement is the basis. [Correspondent] What remains to be discussed further between you and Jordan? [Quray'] Banking, money, trade, customs -- these are the talking points that must be thrashed out in a manner that should advance and upgrade the distinguished and brotherly ties between Jordan and Palestine. [Correspondent] Do you think the Palestinian-Israeli agreement limits the scope for your economic cooperation with Jordan? [Quray'] On the contrary, I think this agreement has helped put the Jordanian-Palestinian accord into practice. True, the agreement does not satisfy our demands in full, but the door remains open for us to press for our rights, which we will regain gradually. The talks focused on the nature of the Jordanian-Palestinian relationship. It is now clear and spelled out in the agreement. [end recording]
