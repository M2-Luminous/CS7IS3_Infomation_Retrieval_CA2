The so-called political opposition was represented by the democratically oriented intelligentsia forced out of Tajikistan and also by the leadership of political parties and movements officially banned by the Dushanbe regime. Naturally, the main thrust of armed opposition forces penetrating across the Afghan-Tajik border is received by Russian troops, and the concern of their command element is apparent. The latest interviews given by Colonel-General Boris Pyankov, the commander, remind one more of a show of force than concern that peace and agreement are hardly possible without a political settlement of the situation. Nonetheless, in two meetings with members of the Coordinating Center in Moscow on 14 and 16 February Boris Pyankov attempted to get the moderate opposition to reject the "formation of bands" in Afghanistan, probably with a view to splitting up the entire opposition and shifting all of the blame for the conflict onto armed refugees in the neighboring country. The conclusions drawn by the Coordinating Center are that they consider the beginning of talks to be the main problem. These conclusions were ultimately accepted, but how seriously they will be regarded will become clear only after Pyankov has told the same thing to Imamali Rakhmanov, Tajikistan's leader. Neither Rakhmonov nor anyone else from among the Tajik officials has yet voiced support for holding talks with the opposition, however. The first documents have been joint proposals submitted to the Russian government, the presidents of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan and the foreign ministers of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Iran, as well as Ambassador Ramiro Paris-Ballon, representative of the UN secretary general, by the Coordinating Center, the Council for the Resistance in Afghanistan and the Democratic Party. The ambassador has already given his agreement to facilitate the talks. There has still been no official response from Tajikistan, however, with the exception of an interview given the newspaper KRASNAYA ZVEZDA by Imamali Rakhmanov in which he continues to divide citizens of the country he heads into good and bad. On the other hand, delegations from Dushanbe began arriving in Moscow to meet with the refugees and convince them to return. The first trip, by Kozidavlat Koimdodov, deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet, at the end of last year ended in failure. In his interview on Tajik television, however, he depicted it as an achievement. His second trip to Moscow, made on 15 February, was also unsuccessful. Neither the Coordinating Center nor the Foundation for Aiding Refugees agreed to discuss anything with Koimdodov, but this time a MAYAK correspondent sent out a report on the delegation's successes from Dushanbe. "This can be called nothing other than a provocation," the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent was told by Otakhon Latifi, head of the center, and Khabib Sanginov, chairman of the foundation. Furthermore, they do not believe that the delegation was empowered by the republic's Supreme Soviet to conduct any kind of talks. Be that as it may, it appears that Dushanbe is attempting to gain time, and Russian troops are paying for that. Most likely, after the Ramadan fast, the conflicts in Tajikistan will flare up with new force. According to the Russian military, however, they will occur not on the border but inside the republic. It is not clear at this time how the military themselves will react to these proposals. It is known, however, that coalition forces are planning to conduct exercises, and an additional contingent will be sent to Tajikistan. The actions of the Tajik authorities and the Russian military can be explained by their fear of a dangerous escalation. This was probably not a coincidence, but General Boris Pyankov, Prime Minister Abdudzhalil Samadov, Kozidavlat Koimdodov, deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet, and Mecheslav Senkevich, the Russian Federation's ambassador to Tajikistan, (known for having provided diplomatic support for armed detachments of the former chairman of the Supreme Soviet, Safarali Kendzhayev, in the capture of Dushanbe), all found themselves in Moscow at the same time.
