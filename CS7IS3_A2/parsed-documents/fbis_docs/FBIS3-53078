On behalf of those present, I congratulate the honorable and esteemed leader of revolution. This is a great day for all Muslims and for our nation. [passage omitted] It is obvious that Islamic Iran is at the head of a movement today. The first word was spoken by our late imam, and today your excellency is repeating the message, guiding and supervising our people and humanity. We know that as much as this path and way is important for us, it is heavy and bitter for the enemies of Islam. Unable to wage physical war they are frantically waging a psychological war against the Islamic revolution. They miss no opportunity and no occasion to somehow weaken this revolution, the Koran, and the prophet's mission in the world. But, thank God, they usually fail and they are now losing the last game. In Your Excellency's frank and very clear address to the people of Qom yesterday, you determined a suitable path, a fresh move in the new battle scene, by warning pencil-pushers, talkers, and the practical and active forces. Prior to this... [pauses] In the second development plan we have policies which you sketched out and which officially entered the plan for the first time in the history of the revolution. Although in the first plan too we enjoyed the imam's frank messages and views, this time we, the government, had an organized and codified guideline on which to plan policies. Today it is up to the Majles to carefully review the policies which are the rights of the leader, according to the constitution and to religious law. And so we could have policies with peace of mind in the next few years. I think with the very frank language which you used yesterday, our tribunes, pens, and tongues will not allow our enemies in this psychological war to weaken the spirit of our ummah, the Koran, and Islam, or to achieve something by motivating and inspiring the dejected enemies of Islam. Our nation has been and shall continue to be vigilant and to guard the messages and orders of the guardianship of the juriconsult. [passage omitted]
