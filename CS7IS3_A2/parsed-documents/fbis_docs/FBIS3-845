The two political parties opposing President Gnassingbe Eyadema won 43 out of the 81 seats in the National Assembly following the 6 and 20 February legislative elections. [passage omitted] Since no single party won an absolute majority, what will the opposition do to accede to power, in view of the official and final results of the elections? Yao Agboyibor, leader of the Action Committee for Renewal [CAR], has this to say: [Begin recording] [Agboyibor] Forming a coalition is an imperative, for although one can say that in theory no party won the majority, the people's situation is obvious. The results are being hailed as a victory by the opposition, which is a victory for all those who want to see things change in our country. So, there is a kind of spontaneous feeling for the forming of a coalition. Those who champion the old order are together, while those of us who want change must come together. The Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD] and the CAR cannot, under the present circumstances, do otherwise but form a coalition. We have always called for such a move. The time has come for us to translate that call into a reality. A UTD- CAR coalition is imperative for the people. In fact, merely questioning the formation of such a coalition would throw into doubt the idea of such a coalition, which would be a pity. [Unidentified correspondent] Let us assume that such a coalition would hold together. Which of you -- the UTD's Edem Kodjo or you Mr. Agboyibor -- will be the next prime minister of the Togolese Government? [Agboyibor] The problem should not be viewed in terms of a choice between two persons. The parties offered their platforms to the people, who then chose. The results are there to confirm their choices. It is on the basis of these results that we can determine which party is in a better position to assume this fundamental responsibility of heading the government. Once a party has been chosen, its members will make internal choices. [Correspondent] If I got you right, you mean that since the CAR won 36 seats and the UTD seven, the CAR should automatically demand the premiership. [Agboyibor] It is not a matter of demanding, but of complying with the choice of the people. I think that as democrats we must take into account the election results as a criteria for solving the problem. If we emphasize individuals we will not succeed. [Correspondent] It does not seem as though any consultations are currently under way between the UTD and the CAR regarding the appointment of a prime minister. [Agboyibor] Oh, we have made contacts on the basis of the verdict and our contacts are ongoing. [end recording] [Paris AFP in English at 1309 GMT on 14 March in a Lome-datelined item adds the following: "Agboyibor on Monday [14 March] told AFP that he was `delighted' at the result, which he described as a `victory for the Togolese people.' `We are convinced that the consultations which will soon begin regarding the appointment of new leaders will lead to choices in line with the voting,' he said. `Any other outcome would be a scandal.'"]
