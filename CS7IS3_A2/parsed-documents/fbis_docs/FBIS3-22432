However, their low capacity does not resolve the problem with the utilization of consumer waste which sounds extremely acute in the Republic of late. In Belarus, registered waste sites occupy some 700 hectares of land, while the area occupied by unregistered waste sites is even larger. Therefore, the only option is to build waste burning factories similar to ones which are "at service" in all civilized states. RID has learned that the construction of such a waste burning factory is being planned close to Gomel. According to experts, total costs of this construction project will stand at around 320 million German marks. The output of this factory will be 500 tonnes of waste per year. According to the plans, this factory will also burn silt which accumulates in our Republic at a rate of close to 1 million tonnes per year.
