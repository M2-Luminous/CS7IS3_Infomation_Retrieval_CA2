Black-shirted toughs, however, have for a couple of years now been part of the Volga political landscape. Those in the know will remember that the present founding fathers of the RNSWP wore the same uniforms during the ceremony to meet S. Terekhov, who arrived in Kazan last year. Thirty activists of the brown movement led by Mikhail Glukhov, an important local figure of national socialism, have now come down to organize a party on the basis of strict ideas of national revival. As a matter of fact, these ideas are constantly drifting from Barkashov to Terekhov and on to Zhirinovskiy: the revival of a healthy nation, a strong dictatorial state of general prosperity, control by the government apparatus over all the main means of production. Incidentally, Kazan "Glukhovites" (their leader, they maintain, was running for the Duma not without a measure of success) disprove the proposition about a unified red-and-brown front because they parade as the most hardboiled anti-communists. Will this be for long? Experience shows that in minutes crucial and confused extremists' flanks start to draw closer together.
