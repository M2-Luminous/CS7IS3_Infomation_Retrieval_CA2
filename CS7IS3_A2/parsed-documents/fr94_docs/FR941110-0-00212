FR941110-0-00212 FR941110-0-00016 Preference for Intermediate Sanctions Rather than Termination Comment: Several commenters stated that the proposed regulations allow almost unrestricted use of terminations and do not promote the use of intermediate sanctions. They wanted HCFA to revise the proposed rules to encourage and promote the use of intermediate sanctions rather than terminations. Some commenters said that intermediate sanctions enable States and HCFA to promote correction of deficiencies with incentives and pressures different from those imposed by termination or the threat of termination. They enable the State and HCFA to move quickly against facilities with deficiencies and to target their enforcement actions to the nature, character, and extent of the deficiencies. They quoted House Report No. 100&hyph;391(I) at 451&hyph;452, 470&hyph;497, as reprinted in 4 U.S. Code and Cong. & Ad. News, 100th Cong. 1st Sess. at 2313&hyph;271 through 2313&hyph;272, 2313&hyph;290 through 2313&hyph;296; IOM at Chapter 5 (pp. 146&hyph;170); General Accounting Office, ``Medicare and Medicaid Requirements: Stronger Enforcement of Nursing Home Requirements Needed'' (July 1987). Some stated that the regulations place roadblocks to the use of intermediate sanctions. They commented that §488.456 allows termination if a facility fails to submit a plan of correction, or fails to comply with a plan of correction. They also noted that §488.406 describes other remedies as being ``in addition to termination of the provider agreement.'' They stated that this wording makes it appear as if termination is the preferred or most common remedy. They were also concerned that §§488.410 and 488.415 make termination mandatory if a facility refuses the appointment of a temporary manager, despite the fact that temporary management ``is not an optional remedy under the reform law.'' These commenters were concerned that nursing home residents would be subjected to harm because of actual or threatened terminations of their nursing homes. They stated that language in the preamble, indicating that terminations were an enforcement response of last resort, was not reflected in the language of the regulations themselves. Some commenters recommended that the regulations prohibit use of termination as a remedy, except in those circumstances required under OBRA '87 or when alternative remedies have failed and the condition of the building is unsafe. They wanted State regulators to find ways to use alternative remedies to protect residents, rather than making them homeless, or subjecting them to the trauma of threatened termination, stating that ``If the building is safe but care is bad, the operator should be evicted rather than the residents. Used properly, alternative remedies can be used to force a substandard provider to sell the facility.'' Response: We agree that the use of alternative remedies should be encouraged. However, if a facility chooses not to submit a plan of correction, neither HCFA nor the State survey agency has any means to determine how the facility intends to improve conditions of inadequate care and, therefore, no clear picture for how residents will be protected. In such a case, failure to terminate the provider agreement would be irresponsible on the part of HCFA or the State. However, if the facility fails to comply with a plan of correction but achieves substantial compliance, we would not terminate the facility's provider agreement. Allowing a nursing home to participate with deficiencies and with a plan of correction represents a certain degree of risk. The nursing home's lack of success in making corrections could indicate that the risk to the residents has not dissipated. Moreover, facilities that had a civil money penalty imposed could face an increase in their penalty because the noncompliance was uncorrected. The responsible exercise of certification duties requires that residents be protected, even if termination is necessary to achieve that protection. We disagree that temporary management ``is not an optional remedy.'' It is the State's or HCFA's decision as to whether or not to impose temporary management, whether in immediate jeopardy or non-immediate jeopardy situations. In the former cases, there is a choice between temporary management and immediate termination. If temporary management is not imposed, either because HCFA or the State considers that action inappropriate or because the facility refuses to relinquish management control to the temporary manager, the Act requires that the facility's provider agreement be terminated. We have no authority to ignore this explicit statutory requirement. In the latter cases, temporary management is an optional remedy when facilities are found to have widespread actual harm. We note that we have no authority to evict non-complying officers or staff of the provider, as the commenter suggests, or to force the sale of substandard facilities. Comment: Some commenters stated that we had not presented a coherent scheme for choosing remedies which are tailored to fit the desired corrective action.
