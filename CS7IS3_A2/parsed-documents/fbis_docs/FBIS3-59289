For example, authorities from the Ministry of Finance participated in the discussions on finance matters. Relevant officials from the General Staff Headquarters of the Central Military Commission participated in discussions on the stationing of troops. Authorities from the General Administration of Civil Aviation joined in discussions of navigation rights. After discussion, amendment, and arrival at consensus, the Hong Kong Macao Office put the conclusions in writing to be implemented after approval by the Central Committee. During the process of drafting the Basic Law, many views were raised by the secretariat of the drafting committee. In this respect, the Hong Kong Macao Office and the secretariat of the drafting committee overlapped and were difficult to distinguish. The drafting committee included many experts in China such as famous legal scholars Zhang Youyu and Yuan Shaoheng and international law experts Shao Tianren and Wang Jilan. Hu Sheng, one of the drafters of China's constitution, was also a vice chairman of the drafting committee. He and Y.K. Pao jointly led a subcommittee which summarized and organized the proposals and views discussed by each of the special topic subcommittees. These experts are all very influential in China. They weighed every word with extreme prudence and attention to detail in the discussions on the Basic Law. The Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY participated in the entire process of investigation and research, consultations, suggestions and discussions on the drafting of the Basic Law. We did this in two ways. First, the Hong Kong Macao Office handed down a "topic" and asked the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Branch to provide background information, views and suggestions. Second, the NEWS AGENCY Branch voluntarily offered background information and suggestions. This was the usual approach. Using investigation and research units as a basis, the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Branch selected relevant people to form a political system research subcommittee. With Qiao Zonghuai and Mao Junnian in charge, the subcommittee was tasked with studying political systems by gathering materials on the development of democracy and political systems in various countries in the world. They then studied various types of cases and discussions in Hong Kong. After approval by the working committee, written reports on their views and suggestions were submitted to the Hong Kong Macao Office and to the drafting committee. Actually, the British government participated in the drafting of the Basic Law from the start to the finish. They primarily used diplomatic channels, through both countries' embassies and through the PRC-UK Liaison Team. Many issues were touched on in Beijing, but some issues were communicated through the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong Branch. Although the drafting of the Basic Law was a Chinese affair, it relates to the implementation of the PRC-UK Joint Communique. Also, in light of the fact that during the next 12 years of transition, Hong Kong will still be administered by Britain; after 1997 some issues relevant to the content of the Basic Law will require the cooperation of Britain. The Liaison Team will be retained until the year 2000. During this time, some issues may require British cooperation. In summary, the special position and situation of Britain in Hong Kong before and after 1997 led the Chinese government to hold respect for Britain's views and to adopt a welcoming attitude towards Britain's participation. We understand that they not only used public figures employed in the Hong Kong government but also other persons with no official titles to find out what was happening in the meetings. It can be said that Britain participated in the drafting of the Basic Law from the start to the finish. The degree of Britain's participation extended to offering objections to every chapter, section, and paragraph, even to individual words. This level of specificity and detail is seldom seen. [Installment No. 43] [17 Jun p 2] Tan Yaozong's Proposal To Protect Labor Interests Rejected; Nomination of Li Zhuming and Liao Yaozhu to Drafting Committee Provokes Controversy [Text] Hong Kong residents participated only indirectly in the Sino-British talks because these were negotiations between two nations. The Chinese government did not allow the British government to use Hong Kong's opinion as a bargaining chip. In Beijing and Hong Kong, the Chinese government had contact with social organizations and public figures from various spheres in Hong Kong. The government listened to the views and suggestions of the Hong Kong people and paid attention to the views and information on Hong Kong reflected in the Hong Kong media and took these into consideration in making policy. The formulation of the Basic Law was different. It required the direct participation of the people of Hong Kong. As Beijing was considering whether to include Hong Kong people as direct participants in the drafting committee, there were two views. One side felt it was not necessary. The other view was that the committee should include Hong Kong people. The views of the Hong Kong Macao Office belong to the latter category. I discussed this issue with Ji Pengfei in Beijing. We both felt that the people of Hong Kong should participate. My view at the time was that the Basic Law would determine the future of the people of Hong Kong and that representatives from Hong Kong should participate in drafting and formulating the law. Only in this way would the majority of the people of Hong Kong then accept the law as their own Basic Law. In addition, the participation of Hong Kong people would allow for greater understanding of the feelings of all classes of people in Hong Kong during the formulation process and would also allow for a more realistic effort to win the desire of Hong Kong people to rejoin China. Ji Pengfei agreed with my view and asked me to consider a list of names after my return to Hong Kong (this method is the mainland "custom," at the moment in Hong Kong we still have not been able to change this). After he reported this suggestion to the Central Committee and obtained approval, we would proceed formally. I returned to Hong Kong and immediately received notification from the Hong Kong Macao Office that the Central Committee had given approval for 18 people from Hong Kong to participate in the Basic Law Drafting Committee. We had two major "headaches" in preparing the list of names. The first was representativeness; the second was the number of people. The first issue should have been the main principle for consideration, but then 18 people would not have been enough. To increase the number of people, we had to obtain permission from Beijing. Thus, we started working on a preliminary list of names and at the same time requested Beijing to increase the number. Ji Pengfei agreed to add two people, to increase the total to 20. Participation in the drafting of the Basic Law was a matter for all Hong Kong people. In theory, there should be participants representative of all classes of people, but the number of people was too limited. The working committee agreed with my thought that the emphasis should be on representatives from the upper and middle levels, with fewer people from the lower classes. There would be quite a few Communist Party members among the mainland representatives to the committee, and these representatives would compensate for the omission. Later events demonstrated that this approach was not thorough enough. When the 8th plenary meeting of the drafting committee was held in Guangzhou, the section proposed by Tan Yaozong on the protection of labor interests was rejected. I objected to Ji Pengfei and Li Hou about this and tried to rescue the situation. To reassure the British capitalists, some people with close connections to the Hong Kong British Government also participated in the drafting process. To allow Taiwan to be informed on the drafting situation and be involved in the reuniting of Hong Kong with China, we also tried to get public figures with close connections to Taiwan to participate. Finally, however, due to the limitations of the Taiwan political situation at the time, the representative persons could not accept our invitation, and those who could accept our invitation lacked that representativeness and were dropped from consideration. There was controversy within the working committee over two names on the preliminary list. One was lawyer Li Zhuming. At the time, some felt that Li Zhuming leaned towards Britain, advocated radical democratization, and frequently said "no" to proposals from China. I felt that we needed to be tolerant and win over the friendship of this type of person. In the end, I convinced my colleagues who opposed him. The other was Liao Yaozhu, a member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council and a representative to the National People's Congress. Colleagues at the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY branch office all viewed her as a person who was patriotic but tended to express contrary views and put other people on the spot. The new and old vice directors of the news agency as well as many people from cooperating agencies all objected to nominating her. I had visited her father, Liao Ende. He gave his frank opinion of his daughter, "She is a knife that cuts both ways, if she has something to say, she can't hold it in, but she is truly patriotic." I used old Liao's words to convince my colleagues. "What's wrong with cutting both ways! Even for unfriendly criticism, we say `if it is true, correct it; even if it is not, then increase vigilance.' We should follow this even more for criticism from a patriot." [Installment No. 44] [18 Jun p 2] Misunderstood Zheng Weirong But Nominate Him to Drafting Committee; Britain Pleased Tan Huizhu, Li Fushan To Join Committee [Text] After working the list back and forth, we still had 23 names, three over the quota. The list was submitted to Ji Pengfei with the explanation that it could not be shortened further, and it was approved. The Hong Kong Macao Office submitted the draft list of mainland committee members to the working committee to seek an opinion. This list included authorities from relevant Chinese agencies (including Mao Junnian and myself), authorities from various democratic parties, well-known figures from various circles, and senior figures from legal circles. We had no objection, except that among the individuals from the relevant agencies were several retired former XINHUA NEWS AGENCY branch directors. I suggested to Ji Pengfei that these be replaced by younger persons with greather familiarity with Hong Kong and more "liberated" thinking. Ji indicated that it "might be considered." Ji Pengfei convened a meeting of the Hong Kong Macao Working Committee to discuss the drafting of the Basic Law. During the discussion on the namelist for the drafting committee, I repeated my suggestion on the mainland members from relevant agencies. Ji Pengfei immediately agreed and asked everyone: "Who would be suitable?" For the moment, no one responded. I suggested, "What about Zheng Weirong?" No one at the meeting objected. Ji Pengfei said: "Then it will be Zheng Weirong." I did not know much about Zheng Weirong. At the time, I thought that he met the criteria I was considering. Only later did I learn that I had not completely understood him. Only after the final namelist was approved by the Central Committee did the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong branch make contact with the nominees to seek their views and determine whether they were willing to be nominated. Generally speaking, most were pleased to accept. We took pains to seek the views of the Hong Kong British Government on the nominations of public figures with Hong Kong government positions such as Tan Huizhu, who was called the four-fold representative by Hong Kong people (because she simultaneously served as a member of the Executive Council, Legislative Council, the Hong Kong City Council, and a District Council); and Appellate Court Investigation Division (Senior Judge) Li Fushan [Simon Li Fook-Sean]. The government responded "pleased to see them serve." Hong Kong society expressed satisfaction with this, indicating that it was a very significant issue for the people of Hong Kong to participate directly in the drafting and formulation of the Basic Law and to directly reflect the views of Hong Kong people and strive for Hong Kong people's rights. They also felt that this namelist "embraced the best from every sphere, and considered the interests of all sides." However, there were also many discussions such as on the view that there was an overemphasis on the upper class and on commercial circles, with inadequate representation from the local districts and the middle and lower classes. On July 1, 1985, a grand ceremony in Beijing inaugurated the first plenary session of the Basic Law Drafting Committee. Twenty-three Hong Kong committee members and 36 mainland committee members began to discuss the Basic Law to be implemented in Hong Kong 12 years later. Coincidentally, on this day 12 years hence, that is, on July 1, 1997, China will resume the exercise of sovereign rights in Hong Kong. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress viewed the participation of Hong Kong people in the drafting of the Basic Law as very important. Before the first plenum of the drafting committee, National People's Congress Standing Committee Chairman Peng Zhen personally sent invitations to all of the committee members and held a grand ceremony. This was an approach never before used by the National People's Congress. In the past when new committees were established by the National Peoples' Congress, there had never been a ceremony with written invitations issued by the chairman of the Standing Committee. [Installment No. 45] [19 Jun p 2] Youde Waives Registration for Advisory Committee; Zhong Shiyuan, Deng Lianru Decline To Participate [Text] Before the first plenary session of the Basic Law Drafting Committee, there was already consideration of how to achieve more extensive participation by the people of Hong Kong because the 23 drafting committee members were, after all, a small group. I exchanged views with Ji Pengfei, noting that the Hong Kong Government had over 300 advisory bodies to carry out "essential democracy." We could also form an advisory committee in Hong Kong on the Basic Law, as a non-governmental organization, to allow the people of Hong Kong to participate in the drafting of the Basic Law on a broader basis. Ji Pengfei may have already reported this suggestion to the Central Committee and obtained approval, because at the first meeting of the drafting committee, he raised this tentative plan with the Hong Kong representatives and asked for their reaction. They unanimously approved and suggested that the drafting committee vice chairmen in Hong Kong be in charge of setting up the advisory committee. The five vice chairmen in Hong Kong included An Zijie, Bao Yugang [Y.K. Pao], Fei Yiming, Li Guobao (Executive Director and General Manager of the Bank of East Asia), and Xu Jiatun. I was the only one not from Hong Kong. The reason given internally for my inclusion was that I was an authority from the working committee and I should be responsible for matters of principle, but the other four vice chairmen were told that I was included because they might need to draw on me to make arrangements for some specific tasks. Ji Pengfei convened a meeting of the chairmen and vice chairmen of the drafting committee to discuss this proposal. The vice-chairmen from Hong Kong all actively approved, Y.K Pao being the first to express approval. An Zijie mentioned that according to Hong Kong law an organization established in Hong Kong must register wth the Hong Kong Government. It might be awkward, however, for an advisory committtee on the Basic Law to register. He felt that we should ask the Hong Kong British Government to waive the registration requirement. He suggested that we discuss this with Tan Huizhu and ask her to communicate with the Hong Kong British Government. Everyone agreed we could try this. After the meeting, An Zijie and Tan Huizhu, Huang Lisong, and Situ Hua [Szeto Wah] (Chairman of the Hong Kong Teachers Professional Association) immediately contacted Hong Kong Governor Youde who was then in London, by long-distance telephone. Youde immediate agreed that the advisory committee would not need to follow the procedures to register as an organization. An Zijie indicated that we should ask the Hong Kong Government for written confirmation of this and also for full support. No one would openly indicate their views on this. Privately, Ji Pengfei asked me to urge An Zijie not to push the Hong Kong Government on this. After registration was waived for the advisory committee, the charter of the committee then did not require the approval of the Hong Kong Government and there was no requirement to report on the activities or membership list to the Hong Kong Government. To establish the advisory commmittee, we first had to arrange for a draft charter and funding. The five vice chairmen from Hong Kong consulted on whether to call a meeting of the drafting committee members from Hong Kong to talk over this issue. An Zijie again raised a question. If we held a meeting in Hong Kong would we run up against Hong Kong law and be labeled an illegal gathering? The other vice chairmen all felt that since the Hong Kong Governor had already indicated that the advisory committee would be treated as a special case which did not need to register, holding a meeting should not be a problem. Thus we decided to invite all the drafting committee members from Hong Kong (the 23 Hong Kong representatives plus Mao Junnian and myself) to the meeting hall on the 50th floor of the Huarun building in Wanchai to discuss issues related to the establishment of an advisory committee. The meeting was chaired by Y.K. Pao who suggested that five people be selected to draft a charter for the advisory committee. Of the 25 committee members present, there were four from the legal profession. These were Li Fushan [Simon Li Fook-Sean], Li Zhuming, Tan Huizhu, and Liao Yaozhu. They were the obvious choices. An Zijie nominated XINHUA NEWS AGENCY branch vice secretary and drafting committee vice chairman, Mao Junnian, to join the group, because in fact setting up the advisory committee would require the News Agency to assist with certain tasks. At this time, Szeto Wah nominated himself to join the group, but Li Fushan objected and very emotionally announced: "If he joins, I will withdraw." The atmosphere in the meeting suddenly became very tense. I consulted with Y.K. Pao and said that one person more or one person fewer would not make a difference in principle. Whether the group is an odd number or an even number would not matter because it was only to draft the charter. If the small group had different views, three votes against three votes, they could hand it over to the whole Hong Kong delegation of the drafting commmittee to decide. Pao then smoothed things over, and calmed the atmosphere so that finally it was agreed that the six people would form a team responsible for drafting the charter. The advisory committee needed funding. During the fund raising process, Y.K. Pao, Li Jiacheng [Li Kashing], Cha Jiming and others voluntarily took on this burden. They did not want this to be public. To respect their wishes it was not publicized. The XINHUA NEWS AGENCY did not ask for specific details. The secretary and vice-secretary of the advisory committee reported directly to the chairman and vice-chairman. Regarding the number of members of the advisory committee, the Hong Kong Macao Office notified the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY branch that they proposed 80 people, not to exceed 100. Some of the Hong Kong drafting committee members suggested 200. I instructed Mao Junnian and Yang Sheng, the director of the coordination division who assisted him, to "come up with a namelist and then we'll see." I advocated a broader range and a larger number of members. The namelist had to include the upper, middle and lower; the left, middle and right; Chinese and foreign; male and female; old and young; and the so-called "right", including those who opposed the Communist Party, and those who did not approve of Hong Kong reuniting with China. We drew up three lists of 100 people, 180 people and 200 people. After repeated comparisons and deliberation, we finally decided upon a list of 180 members for the advisory committee. After the list was approved by the vice chairmen from Hong Kong, it was submitted to the Hong Kong Macao Office for the record. While deliberating on the namelist, we considered trying to get Zhong Shiyuan and Deng Lianru to join. We sent people to seek their views on this but they tactfully refused without giving much of a reason, just that it was inconvenient for them to participate. [Installment No. 46]
