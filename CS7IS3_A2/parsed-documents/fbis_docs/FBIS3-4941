The puppet army's large-caliber artillery group, moved and deployed in Yulli-ri and Waechon-ri, Chorwon-up, Chorwon County, Kangwon Province, South Korea, showered tens of shells on the area near the DMZ that day. The puppet army's armed rascals occupied battle positions in Sogong-ri, Paju County, Kyonggi Province and Korangpo-ri, Yonchon County and created a stir by firing at random as many as some 2,000 shells of large-caliber machine guns and automatic rifles, while advancing toward the Military Demarcation Line [MDL]. On the same day, the South Korean puppets openly and in broad daylight moved and deployed some 10 armored cars and many armed rascals near the DMZ in the north of Kajon-ri, Inje County, Kangwon Province, South Korea. They also mobilized hundreds of armed rascals to Chungse-ri, Chorwon-up, Chorwon County, Kangwon Province, South Korea, and were immersed in a war frenzy [chonjaeng kwanggirul puryossumnida]. Meanwhile, the puppet army's fighter-bombers flew in formations in the skies above Changsin-ri and Haesang-ri, Kosong County, Kangwon Province, South Korea and were frenzied in ground striking aimed at the northern half of the Republic. Armed helicopters and transportation helicopters moved out in formations in the skies above Yonchon, Paju, and Hwachon and were frenzied in ground-attack supporting and air-borne operations exercises, flying at low and very low altitudes. This worthless fire game [mumohan pulchangnan sodong] shows even more clearly the South Korean puppets' bellicose nature [hojongjok chongche].
