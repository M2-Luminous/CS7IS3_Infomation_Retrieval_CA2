Fernandez, former presidential election campaign director, on 3 June presented his government program within the framework of his campaign to head the ANR [National Republican Association--Colorado Party]. His speech started with a call "to civilian Colorados and military Colorados." The rally was attended by about 4,000 people, most of them top state officials and departmental and municipal authorities. Many well-known leaders of the so-called "Stroessnerist militant faction" [former dictator Alfredo Stroessner's supporters], including Ramon Enrique Reverchon and Juan Jose Benitez Rickman, attended the rally. The night's most noticeable item, without a doubt, was the large number of posters saying "Oviedo '98" [General Lino Oviedo for president in 1998], which was the exclusive responsibility of Guaira Governor Rodolfo Max Friedmann, according to the organizers. Eight of the total of 12 Colorado governors attended the meeting. The event was opened by campaign spokesman and former Education Minister Horacio Galeano Perrone. After talking about the Colorado Party's internal divisions and its history, Galeano Perrone urged Colorado followers to work for unity without exclusions. At the end of his speech, Galeano Perrone emphasized that the faction headed by Fernandez did not accept the division between "military and civilians" and made an ardent call for unity within the party, "accepting the past with its lights and shadows." Several sections of his speech were dedicated to lashing out at other internal movements despite his call for unity. Among those attending were Paul Sarubbi and Gustavo Pedrozo and Deputies Bernardino Cano Radil and Conrado Pappalardo. The presence of Ramon Duarte Vera, the controversial former police chief during the Stroessner administration, also was noteworthy.
