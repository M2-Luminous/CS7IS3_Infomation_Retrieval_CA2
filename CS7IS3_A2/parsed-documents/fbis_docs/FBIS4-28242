But it is uncertain whether or not they can bridge differences over "objective criteria" as the instrument for gauging Japanese auto and auto parts imports, the thorniest issue under the "framework" trade negotiations launched in July last year, government sources said Thursday. The upcoming meeting will follow on from working-level auto trade talks in Washington last week, in which both parties agreed to put on hold the issue of how to set objective criteria. Japan and the U.S. remain widely separated on the "quantitative" aspect of the objective criteria. Washington is unlikely to seek Japan's commitment to promise a certain amount of auto and auto parts purchases in the future, the sources said. But the U.S. may call for the inclusion in auto trade accords some indicators relating to future performances, such as the number of auto dealers in Japan handling U.S.-made cars, the sources said. The sources said Japanese negotiators will respond only to indicators intended to gauge how Japan has done in the past. The coming meeting will also address deregulatory measures, including simplification of safety checking procedures for imports and improvement of standards and certificates, the sources said.
