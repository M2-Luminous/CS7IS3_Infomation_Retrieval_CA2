The Only Thing Is, Will the Present Board of Directors Own Enterprises if Workers Can Only Buy 7 to 9 Percent of the Shares?"] [Text] This question did not get much attention, because it was slipped in near the end of Ukraine President L. Kravchuk's meeting with the directors of the 14 biggest metallurgy enterprises in the country. But it was shoved "under the curtain" by the voices of numerous concerned people. And a mechanism was proposed for ensuring that "90 percent of the shares do not end up in the hands of outsiders." In response, Industry Minister Anatoliy Holubchenko promised that he had arranged with the State Property Fund to reserve 30 to 40 percent of the shares for further buy-out. But the audience hooted that bit of information down too. Clearly, people sensed that the powerful directors' corps would like to become enterprise owners almost automatically. In general the meeting was planned to check up on previous agreements on ways to revive the sector. From Minister A. Holubchenko's report it was clear that the greatest worries are the status of gas payments, trade with Russia and the other CIS countries, and currency regulation; there was particular focus on shortcomings in the buying and selling of currency for tenders. Unquestionably, this meeting brought together old directors, to be sure, but they were discussing how to solve the problems that have arisen during the time of market reforms. Right now, the metallurgy complex is 640 million dollars short of enough to pay for gas. The proposal was made to change the decision regarding compulsory sales of 50 percent of the enterprises' hard currency earnings to the state, and to sell only 25 percent. And 75 percent is enough to pay for gas and to buy essential equipment. A tough future is in store for metallurgical enterprises which have already, essentially, halted production owing to mutual indebtedness. Participants in the meeting also talked about note settlements as a panacea for all economic ills. But in fact they do not work. As yet, a mechanism for introducing them is not fully in place. Mutual mistrust of these papers is apparent both on the part of buyers and sellers. Whatever the future may bring, notes will have to be introduced. One cause of the slowdown in trade with Russia is that sometimes that country sells its raw materials to our producers at prices that are higher than world prices. The cost of raw materials boosts the cost of products. This then is the root of indicator prices whose use the directors called criminal. But the objection can be made that sometimes they sell the same product to Russia more cheaply than in Ukraine. Some directors spoke in thinly veiled fashion about seceding from their Industry Ministry. That question is one that has yet to be discussed. The only thing is, why are discussions about problems like these held by the production council in the presence of the President?
