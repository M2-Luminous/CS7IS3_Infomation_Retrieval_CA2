FR940527-0-00048 FR940527-0-00018 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [OH29&hyph;1&hyph;6066; FRL&hyph;4854&hyph;9] Approval And Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Ohio AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: On November 14, 1991, Ohio submitted major revisions to its particulate matter regulations to make its State Implementation Plan (SIP) consistent with its Statewide regulations and to satisfy Clean Air Act requirements for the Cleveland and Steubenville nonattainment areas. Ohio submitted supplemental material on December 4, 1991, and January 8, 1992. USEPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking on August 3, 1993, at 58 FR 41218. Six letters were submitted commenting on this proposal. Although several commenters requested delay of this final rulemaking, such delay is impermissible under section 110(k) of the Act. USEPA has reviewed the submitted comments, and is taking final action granting limited approval/limited disapproval as proposed, i.e. approving all regulations except for two paragraphs, but determining that the plan does not fully satisfy requirements under Part D of Title I of the Act for the Cleveland and Steubenville areas. If the relevant deficiencies are not remedied within 18 months, the first of the two sanctions pursuant to section 179(b) of the Clean Air Act will take effect. DATE: This action is effective June 27, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the State's submittals, the public comment letters, and USEPA's technical support document of February 24, 1994 are available for inspection at the following address: (It is recommended that you telephone John Summerhays at (312) 886&hyph;6067, before visiting the Region 5 Office.)

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Ohio submitted major revisions to its particulate matter regulations on November 14, 1991, with supplemental submittals on December 4, 1991, and January 8, 1992. USEPA published notice of proposed rulemaking on August 3, 1993, at 58 FR 41218, proposing limited approval of these submittals. The notice of proposed rulemaking includes a history of requirements and State submittals, a description of Ohio's submittal, a review of each submitted regulation, and reviews of whether requirements in section 189 (including requirements for attainment demonstrations and reasonably available control measures (RACM)) and elsewhere in the Clean Air Act are satisfied, concluding with a delineation of the proposed action. For convenience, this section will provide highlights of relevant history and the next section will repeat the description of the State submittal that was provided in the notice of proposed rulemaking. A third section will summarize the remainder of the notice of proposed rulemaking, including the proposed action. A fourth section of today's notice will summarize and review the public comments on the notice of proposed rulemaking. The final section of discussion in this notice will describe the final action on the State's submittal. Ohio submitted its original SIP for particulate matter on January 31, 1972, and submitted substantial revisions on August 4, 1972. USEPA approved the plan and the revisions, most notably including several regulations in Chapter AP&hyph;3 (Particulate Matter Standards), on April 15, 1974, at 39 FR 13539. Revisions to AP&hyph;3&hyph;04, submitted on January 25, 1974, were approved on September 23, 1976, at 41 FR 41692. On August 10, 1976, Ohio submitted EP&hyph;12 (Open Burning), which USEPA approved on February 3, 1978, at 43 FR 4611. Although the State provided various submittals between June 1980 and March 1985, and USEPA proposed rulemaking to approve these revisions on January 2, 1987 (52 FR 91), these submittals were subsequently withdrawn and no Statewide revisions were approved into the SIP. Thus, with the exception of a small number of source-specific limitations, the previously approved Ohio SIP for particulate matter reflects the rules approved in 1974 and 1976, i.e. the 1972 version of the rules now codified in Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) Chapter 3745&hyph;17 (Particulate Matter Standards) and the 1976 version of the rules now codified in OAC Chapter 3745&hyph;19 (Open Burning Standards). On July 1, 1987, USEPA revised the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter, refocussing the standard on smaller particles. Pursuant to the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, 1 Cuyahoga County and the Steubenville area (including portions of Jefferson County, Ohio, and Brooke County, West Virginia) were designated nonattainment for this revised standard, and the State was required to submit plan revisions to assure attainment, require RACM, and satisfy other requirements for these two areas. 1 The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act made significant changes to the Air quality planning requirements for areas that do not meet (or that significantly contribute to ambient air quality in a nearby area that does not meet) the particulate matter national ambient air quality standards (see Pub. L. No. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399). References herein are to the Clean Air Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. sections 7401 et seq. II. Description of Ohio's Submittal The State's submittal of November 14, 1991, as supplemented December 4, 1991, and January 8, 1992, consisted of two principal elements: (1) Statewide regulations, and (2) additional regulations, emissions, and modeling information for Cuyahoga County and the Steubenville area. The Statewide regulations, submitted pursuant to Section 110, reflect substantial revisions to the 1974 regulations presently in the SIP, and constitute the regulations that are presently maintaining the air quality standards in much of the State. The materials relating to the Cuyahoga County and Steubenville nonattainment areas were submitted pursuant to Part D of Title I of the Act, and include the more stringent regulations that Ohio identified as needed to attain the standards in these areas. The regulations submitted by Ohio include all of the rules in OAC Chapter 3745&hyph;17 except Rule 3745&hyph;17&hyph;05 (``Nondegradation policy'') and all rules in OAC Chapter 3745&hyph;75. (Rule 3745&hyph;17&hyph;06 contains no language and is reserved.)
