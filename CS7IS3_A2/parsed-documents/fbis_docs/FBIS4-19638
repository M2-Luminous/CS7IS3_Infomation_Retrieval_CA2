The survival of many German firms, especially in the former East Germany, depends on this, Rexrodt told journalists after a talk with his Russian counterpart Aleksandr Shokhin in Moscow today. Hermes credits total 2.5 billion marks [DM] this year. Shokhin pointed out that Russia "is subject both to internal restrictions and IMF conditions with regard to debts." Rexrodt called on German industry to invest in Russia despite all the difficulties there. It must not miss the right opportunity to "gain a foothold on the Russian market and its great potential." He conveyed to Shokhin the wish felt by many German businessmen "for greater clarity and predictability in Russia, among other things in the tax system and in granting export licenses," Rexrodt said. He added that Russian President Boris Yeltsin's upcoming visit to Germany in mid-May and preparations for the next session of the German-Russian Cooperation Council in St. Petersburg were also discussed. Rexrodt arrived in Moscow last night for a one-day visit. He is to hold talks with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin this afternoon.
