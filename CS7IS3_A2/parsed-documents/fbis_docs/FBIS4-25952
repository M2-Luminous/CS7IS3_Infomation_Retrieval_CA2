It cites concrete examples to prove the point, noting that the protection of the right to the exclusive use of registered trademarks has resulted in the rapid growth of the number of trademarks registered by Chinese and foreign businessmen in China. By the end of 1993, the number of effective registered trademarks had exceeded 410,000. Of these, 350,000 were domestic, with the remaining 60,000 coming from 67 countries and regions, the white paper says. Companies from the United States had only 122 trademarks registered in China before 1979; by 1993 that number had soared to 16,221, more than a hundred times the earlier figure, it adds. In 1993, there were 170,000 applications for trademark registration in China, including more than 130,000 applications for new trademarks registration, among the highest number in the world. The patent law has greatly encouraged inventions and other creations in China, and has proved to be a magnet to patent applications from other countries and regions. By the end of 1993, the patent office of China had handled over 360,000 applications for patent rights. Of those, domestic applications accounted for 86.4 percent, while 13.6 percent were applications from 70 countries and regions. By the end of 1993, 175,000 patents had been approved. The white paper gives an account of China's laws on trademarks, patents, copyrights, technological contracts, and scientific and technological progress, as well as the relevant government decrees, rules and regulations. The white paper notes that China, in accordance with its national conditions and the current tendencies in international development, has formulated and fine-tuned various laws and regulations on intellectual property protection, thereby constructing a socialist legal system for intellectual property protection with Chinese characteristics. Meanwhile, says the white paper, the scope of the intellectual property rights [IPR] protected in China and the degree of protection afforded have gradually conformed with international practices. Effective as of March 1983, the Trademark Law and the rules for its implementation set forth the principles of application, examination and registration in trademark registration procedures which are entirely identical with common international principles. In 1993, the paper continues, China revised both its Trademark Law and the rules for its implementation and made them coincide completely with the requirements of GATT's agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. The Patent Law and the rules for its implementation came into effect in April 1985. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted an amendment to the law on September 4, 1992, which included important revisions. This marked the reaching of a new level of patent protection in China, says the white paper. As regards the Copyright Law, the paper says, it protects computer software in addition to the copyright of written works, oral works, music, operas, quyi (folk art forms including ballad singing, story telling, comic dialogues, clapper talks, cross talks, etc), choreography, works of fine arts, photographs, films, TV programs, video tapes, engineering designs, product designs and their descriptions, maps, sketch maps and other graphic works. China is among a select group of countries that have explicitly listed computer software as the object of protection by copyright laws, the paper says. The Technological Contract Law and the Law on Scientific and Technological Progress, as well as a series of administrative regulations concerning intellectual property protection worked out by the State Council, together further optimize the nation's legal system for the protection of intellectual property rights, in the whole bringing the system close to and in coordination with international levels of protection. The paper also says that China has a complete legal system for the protection of intellectual property rights. China's intellectual property law stipulates the legal responsibilities to be borne by anyone who violates the law, including civil liability, criminal liability and exposure to administrative sanctions, it adds.
