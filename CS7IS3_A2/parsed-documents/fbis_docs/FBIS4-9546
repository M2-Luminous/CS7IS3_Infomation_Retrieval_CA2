President Radovan Karadzic, described Tuesday [26 April] as another in a series of propaganda fabrications of the Bosnian Moslems the story about the alleged thousands of wounded and hundreds of killed in Gorazde. Gorazde is a Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia and the site of almost a month of heavy fighting of the Moslem and Serb forces. After ceasefire accord was reached, evacuation of the wounded with UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] helicopters ensued on Sunday. Zametica's statement, sent to TANJUG, says that "at the height of the Gorazde hysteria, it was claimed that there were 2,000 Muslims wounded and 700 dead. "However, U.N. medical evacuation helicopters have to date brought out only 170 persons, many of whom have been patients for months and could not have been the casualties of the recent fighting," says Zametica and warns that on Tuesday, "two evacuation helicopters returned empty". "The pattern is very clear for those who want to see it: the Muslims manufacture or exaggerate a crisis, international organizations on the ground either say nothing or openly take the Muslim side, and the world media uncritically swallow everything," says he. Zametica claims that "a high-ranking UNPROFOR official confirmed to us that international humanitarian organizations had deliberately engaged in a campaign of lies and disinformation concerning the extent of casualties in Gorazde." In conclusion, Zametica recalls the "case with the `breadline massacre' which was staged by the Muslims, but the Serbs got the sanctions (i.e. F.R. Yugoslavia). With the market place massacre, again staged by the Muslims, but the Serbs got the ultimatum. And now with Gorazde, with one ultimatum on top of another." He adds that "the world diplomats and decision-makers should ask themselves whether they can allow their policies to be so easily dictated by the world media which in turn report lie after lie after lie." A French television Channel One reporter in Bosnia admitted Tuesday that the numbers about hundreds of killed and wounded Moslems in Gorazde were "blown-up" by the Moslem sources, different humanitarian organizations and Western media. The answer to the question where have several hundred wounded and killed Moslems in Gorazde disappeared could not be supplied, as the TF-1 reporter said, by either UNPROFOR or representatives of humanitarian organizations.
