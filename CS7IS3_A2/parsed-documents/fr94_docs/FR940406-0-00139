A new §86.098&hyph;22 is added to subpart A to read as follows: §86.098&hyph;22 Approval of application for certification; test fleet selections; determinations of parameters subject to adjustment for certification and Selective Enforcement Audit, adequacy of limits, and physically adjustable ranges. Section 86.098&hyph;22 includes text that specifies requirements that differ from §86.094&hyph;22. Where a paragraph in §86.094&hyph;22 is identical and applicable to §86.098&hyph;22, this may be indicated by specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;22.'' (a) through (c) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;22. (d) Approval of test procedures. (1) The Administrator does not approve the test procedures for establishing the evaporative and/or refueling emission deterioration factors for light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. The manufacturer shall submit the procedures as required in §86.098&hyph;21(b)(4)(i) prior to the Administrator's selection of the test fleet under §86.098&hyph;24(b) (1), and if such procedures will involve testing of durability data vehicles selected by the Administrator or elected by the manufacturer under §86.098&hyph;24(c)(1), prior to initiation of such testing. (d)(2) through (g) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;22. 24. Section 86.098&hyph;23 of subpart A is amended by revising the introductory text and paragraphs (a) through (l) to read as follows: §86.098&hyph;23 Required data.

For guidance see §86.095&hyph;23.'' (a) through (b)(1)(ii) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.095&hyph;23. (b)(2) For light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, the manufacturer shall submit evaporative emission and/or refueling emission deterioration factors for each evaporative/refueling emission family-emission control system combination and all test data that are derived from testing described under §86.098&hyph;21(b)(4)(i) designed and conducted in accordance with good engineering practice to assure that the vehicles covered by a certificate issued under §86.098&hyph;30 will meet the evaporative and/or refueling emission standards in §86.098&hyph;8 or §86.098&hyph;9, as appropriate, for the useful life of the vehicle. (b)(3) through (b)(4)(ii) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.095&hyph;23. (b)(4)(iii) For petroleum-fueled diesel-cycle vehicles certifying under the waiver provisions of §86.098&hyph;28, the certifications and representations specified in §86.098&hyph;28. (c) through (e)(1) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.095&hyph;23. (e)(2) For evaporative and refueling emission durability, or light-duty truck or heavy-duty engine exhaust emission durability, a statement of compliance with paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(4)(iii) of this section or §86.095&hyph;23 (b)(1)(ii), (b)(3) (b)(4)(i) or (b)(4)(ii), as applicable. (3) For certification of vehicles with non-integrated refueling systems, a statement that the drivedown used to purge the refueling canister was the same as described in the manufacturers' application for certification. Furthermore, a description of the procedures used to determine the number of equivalent UDDS miles required to purge the refueling canisters, as determined by the provisions of §86.098&hyph;21(b)(5)(v) and subpart B of this part. Furthermore, a written statement to the Administrator that all data, analyses, test procedures, evaluations and other documents, on which the above statement is based, are available to the Administrator upon request. (f) through (l) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.095&hyph;23. * * * * *
