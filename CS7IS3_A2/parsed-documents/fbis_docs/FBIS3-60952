[passage omitted] Palestinian sources noted that the five are members of (al-Tanzim al-Siri), a secret organization of Fatah usually used for internal killings. Processions and rallies were held today to mark the 29th anniversary of the establishment of Fatah. One rally, in Palestine Square, turned into a riot during which six locals were wounded by soldiers' gunfire, including a 60-year-old woman. A youngster who threw an explosive charge at the soldiers was also shot and wounded in the leg. Thirty-five-year-old 'Azzam al-Aymuni was murdered in Hebron this morning. He was shot dead while walking in Hebron's 'Isa neighborhood. His body was taken to the forensic institute. He was apparently murdered on suspicion of being a collaborator. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1600 GMT on 2 January adds that "two firebombs were thrown at a fuel tanker in Hebron. The bombs shattered on the road. Soldiers escorting the tanker opened fire at the perpetrators, but they fled the scene."]
