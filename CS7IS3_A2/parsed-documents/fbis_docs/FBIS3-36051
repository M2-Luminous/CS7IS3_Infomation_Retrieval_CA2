In a published appeal to the people, Samadov said that all official talks were now focused on mutual sales and payments but not on former obligatory sale to the state. He says the existing realities place the need for program correctives and the arrangement of normal market relations in domestic and foreign trade. Samadov called on Tajik citizens to come up with coherent proposals on how to improve the functioning of economic mechanisms and effectively utilize the country's natural and human resources. He hopes that the system of accounting for as diversity of views will work on a permanent basis rather than being a short-lived time campaign. [sentence as received] Many say the Prime Minister's call is intended to arrange close cooperation between the government and private sector in the effort to embrace economic reforms.
