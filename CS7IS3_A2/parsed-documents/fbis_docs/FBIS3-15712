N. Rodionov, deputy of the State Duma, by unidentified correspondent; place and date not given; from the "Aty-Baty" program -- recorded] [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Rodionov] All members of the committee understand the aims and tasks of the committee. Insofar as the army is above politics and has no factions or party groupings within it, the committee likewise must reflect the armed forces since in practice it works for the needs of the armed forces by drawing up legislation necessary to them. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Do you think there is a need to criticize the armed forces, and how should it be done? Do people have the right to participate in its reform? Should reform be through public control, the press, or the State Duma? [Rodionov] Everyone can be criticized, the armed forces included, as long as the criticism is based on fact and not on malignant attitudes or personal resentment. The life and activities of the armed forces should be widely publicized in the press, radio, and television--that is, in all mass media. [Correspondent] Don't you presently receive sufficient publicity? [Rodionov] No, it is insufficient. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] What is the relationship with the Defense Ministry of those servicemen currently serving as deputies? Has their status been determined yet? Will they be discharged from the armed forces? What relationship do they have with the Defense Ministry? [Rodionov] To reply to the first part of your question, I will say all of us servicemen elected as deputies to the State Duma of the Federal Assembly are, how can I put it, the flesh and blood of our armed forces. For instance, I am in my 39th year of service with the armed forces, so how can I speak of having some kind of relationship with the Defense Ministry. I am part of the armed forces and do not think of myself in any other terms. Those servicemen who are State Duma deputies think of themselves in exactly the same way. Unfortunately, our present legal status has not been defined. Article 44 of the Law on Military Responsibility and Military Service provides that a soldier's service is suspended for the period of his full-time work in an elected body. This article was abolished by the presidential edict of 24 December 1993, creating a legal vacuum. So now, if a serviceman is to be discharged, then which article should apply? The article on staff reductions cannot apply, since our jobs have not been reduced. The article on bad conduct cannot be applied either, since we have not done anything illegal, and so on. There is no article in accordance with which we could discharge servicemen-deputies. The one remaining article which can be applied is the one which permits us to attach these people to a government body--which the State Duma is--and leave them on active service. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Are you satisfied with the way the situation is currently shaping up in the State Duma as regards military issues? Does something need to be done or strengthened? Do we need to change something before it's too late, or to say something to the deputies and officers? [Rodionov] The Duma is the reflection of the situation in our country and armed forces. Now is a complicated period for the country, as well as for the armed forces and the State Duma. The country and the armed forces will survive this period. There must be progress. I believe our country will come out of the situation in which it finds itself. [Correspondent] Where will this progress come from, and what is the basis for it? [Rodionov] It is the lawmaking work of the Duma. There must be precise legislation, and precise demands must be made on the executive power to implement the legislation adopted by the Duma. Until we start implementing the existing legislation, we will not make any sense from any of the vital activities happening in our country. Independent deputies--those elected from single-mandate districts--will form the basis of the center in the Duma. As a matter of fact, the idea of consolidating all forces to implement the tasks facing the Duma, and on which practically all independent deputies are working, has been enunciated within the new regional policy party grouping. Namely, it is the independent deputies who are not members of any party who must undertake and head this work of consolidation, because the main task facing the Duma is not the clarification of relationships between parties, but the difficult and exacting work of drafting laws.
