FBIS4-6049 "dreas074_c_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-074 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 North Korea U.S. Deployment of Materiel to South Condemned U.S. Deployment of Materiel to South Condemned SK1804072294 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1225 GMT 14 Apr 94 SK1804072294 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1225 GMT 14 Apr 94 Korean BFN [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Anachronistic Way of Thinking Must be Disregarded"] [Text] The U.S. imperialists are escalating their plots for a Northward invasion war. As has already been reported, they deployed some of their 30 ultramodern Apache attack helicopters -- which they promised to deploy to South Korea -- to South Korea on 10 April. The Apache helicopters, which have been deployed to South Korea as a part of strengthening the combatant capabilities of the U.S. Forces occupying South Korea, have arrived in the U.S. Army bases near the Military Demarcation Line. From 10 to 11 April, the U.S. imperialists also mobilized and deployed various kinds of approximately 20 military planes to South Korea from their overseas bases. They have either mobilized or supplied a great number of troops and war equipment to operational areas by air transport from U.S. mainland bases and the Pacific region. It has been reported that the first shipment of Patriot missiles -- which left Texas some time ago -- will arrive in South Korea soon. All these facts are an intentional plot to reinforce their arms to further lead the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war. Therefore, it is a very dangerous military move. As everyone knows, it is our consistent position to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through dialogue or negotiations. However, the U.S. imperialists -- who have unilaterally broken up the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks by fully refusing the implementation of an DPRK-U.S. agreement signed in New York -- have disclosed their attempts to resume the Team Spirit joint military exercise under an unreasonable pretext and have more vigorously maneuvered to strengthen South Korea's military reinforcement by babbling about the so-called sanctions. This is an act like a thief turning on the victim with a club and clearly shows that the United States has no intention at all to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through dialogue, but instead has plotted to crush [apsal] our Republic. Such criminal attempts by the U.S. imperialists have been properly shown by the recent and bellicose remarks by U.S. ruling circles. In an interview with U.S. NBC Television on 12 April, U.S. Secretary of State Christopher even set a deadline for us to accept nuclear inspections, talking about our so-called nuclear issue. Also, he made absurd remarks that if we fail to comply with their unilateral and unjust demands by then, diplomatic pressure will be turned into a more stern step and that he cannot rule out the possibility of conducting a military preemptive strike. Prior to his remarks, even U.S. Secretary of Defense Perry has not hesitated to make bellicose remarks that he cannot rule out the possibility of a U.S. preemptive military strike against North Korea, and that he is willing to take the risk of waging a war. The U.S. imperialists' arms reinforcement plots -- which have been further accelerated under the situations in which the U.S. ruling circles have made such bellicose remarks that agitate war and in which the U.S. naval fleets are mobilized and deployed in waters off the Korean peninsula -- are never coincident. This shows that they have attempted to surely wage a new war on the Korean peninsula by strengthening the military threat or pressure against us. Because of the U.S. imperialists' and South Korean puppets' reckless war plots, a very grave situation in which no one knows when war breaks out [onje chonjaengi tojilchi morunun] is now being created on the Korean peninsula. It is the U.S. imperialists who are the ringleaders of aggravating tensions, as well as the breakers of peace and security on the Korean peninsula. While acting as if it is an international military police, the United states intends to bring our people to their knees with military forcible measures [kanggwon] and force. However, this is an anachronistic way of thinking. The times have passed in which forcible measures and force could be used. It is a foolish daydream if it believes that the method of force can be applied to us. We have the might of single-hearted unity, which is much stronger than atomic or hydrogen bombs, as well as the matchless revolutionary Armed Forces capable of boldly destroying any enemies and of safeguarding the socialist fatherland based on the strong self-reliant national economy and the powerful national defensive capabilities. We are thoroughly prepared to cope with the U.S. imperialists' military pressure or offensive. The persons who sets a fire are doomed to be burned to death by that fire. The U.S. imperialists should clearly see the reality and should not act recklessly.
