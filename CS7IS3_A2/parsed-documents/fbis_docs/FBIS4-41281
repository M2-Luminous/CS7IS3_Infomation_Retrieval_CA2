On General Grachev's Visit to the Transcaucasus"] [Text] Russia has no intention of conceding the Transcaucasus to anyone. The latest confirmation of this obvious fact was the last visit to the region by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, which demonstrated the seriousness of Moscow's intentions. Was the Kremlin satisfied with the results of the Caucasian voyage of the chief of the military department? Most likely it was, although the Russian general was not received in all the Caucasian capitals with the courtesy to which he had every right to lay claim. There was no doubt that Grachev would not have any problems in Yerevan. The question of deploying a contingent of the Russian Army on the territory of Armenia was decided long before the ceremony for signing the corresponding agreement, the conclusion of which, incidentally, was welcomed by all political groups of the republic without exception. The reaction to the agreement on Russia's military presence in Georgia was, of course, not as unambiguous. And there were even quite contradictory stories about the expediency, admissibility, and correctness of the participation of Russian peacekeeping forces in the resolution of the Abkhazian conflict stipulated in the document that was signed in Tbilisi with the approval of the Abkhazian and Georgian parliaments. It is most difficult of all to assess the results of the negotiations in Baku, since the meeting of the Russian minister with the president of Azerbaijan took place behind closed doors, and it is hardly a good idea to believe the information that leaks through them. Both parties are trying to convince the mass media that the future of the Gabarlinskaya radar station was the main subject of discussion at the meeting. And this means that so far no definite success has been achieved in the question of reaching agreement about the Russian plan for regulating the Abkhazian conflict. There is no reason to expect that Azerbaijan will give way on its positions, since Geydar Aliyev had just returned from Istanbul at that time. The meetings on the Turkish land, of course, reinforced the Azerbaijani leader's belief in the "correctness of the chosen path." At the same time Aliyev had nothing with which to counter the persistence of the Kremlin emissary, as a result of which, official Baku, judging from everything, has recognized the inevitability of conceding to the Russian military the right to "be in charge" at the Gabarlinskaya radar station. The final "i" will be dotted during the visit of the Azerbaijani defense minister to Moscow, which was recently arranged for an unspecified date. Then one can expect a more definite response from Azerbaijan to the Russian peace initiative.
