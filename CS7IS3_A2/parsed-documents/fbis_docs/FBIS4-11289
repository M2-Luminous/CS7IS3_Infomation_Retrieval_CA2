Because of the lack of climate control, it is not possible to maintain the stocks necessary to the process. This also negatively affects the quality of the different kinds of alcohol. Factory technicians say the refrigeration problem has been public and under discussion and analysis since January, when the work of that (?factory) began. This problem has affected industrial efficiency in fermentation as well as the mill's alcohol-producing work group, on whom guaranteeing the quality of the product does not depend. [sentence as heard] The product is a traditional one that has many uses and is also exported.
