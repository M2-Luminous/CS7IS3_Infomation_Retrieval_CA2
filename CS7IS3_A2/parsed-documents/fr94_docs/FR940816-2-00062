SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of July 27, 1994, FDA announced that a meeting of the Generic Drugs Advisory Committee with Dermatologic Drugs Advisory Committee representation would be held on September 12 and 13, 1994. On page 38196, in the third column, under Open committee discussion the agenda for the meeting is amended to read as follows: Open committee discussion . In April 1992, the Generic Drugs Advisory Committee met to consider methods for documenting the bioequivalence of topical corticosteriods. Subsequently, on July 1, 1992, the Office of Generic Drugs issued a guidance document entitled ``Interim Guidance for Topical Corticosteriods: In Vivo Bioequivalence and in Vitro Release Methods.'' The purpose of the September 1994 meeting is to reexamine the 1992 interim guidance in light of new experimental data and methods of analysis. On September 12, 1994, the committee will discuss the pharmacodynamic (i.e., vasoconstrictor) measurement of bioequivalence. On September 13, 1994, this topic will be further discussed along with other issues related to the documentation of equivalence according to the interim guidance. Discussion will be limited to dermatologic products and will not include ophthalmic or inhaled corticosteroid products. Pilot data will be presented on the development of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic assays to demonstrate tretinoin bioequivalence. Also, on September 13, 1994, there will be a review of the current status of topics discussed at previous Generic Drugs Advisory Committee meetings. Dated: August 10, 1994. Linda A. Suydam, Interim Deputy Commissioner for Operations. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;20065 Filed 8&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4160&hyph;01&hyph;F
