Delegates at the forum discussed the actions aimed at increasing income and reducing expenses that the provincial administrative directorate will be taking. Jose Luis Rodriguez, minister president of the State Committee for Finance, explained that any measure adopted by the country on the issue will be aimed at stimulating labor, increasing production of goods, and eliminating excess currency. He added that sanctions will be applied to organizations that are not up to date on payments or collection of accounts, which could hide embezzlement of resources and misappropriation of funds. Rodriguez went on to criticize those organizations which are profitable in hard currency but not in the national currency. The concluding remarks at the assembly were made by Jorge Lezcano Perez, a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] and PCC first secretary in Havana City Province. Lezcano underscored the importance of making the workers understand that they can make a difference in the reduction of costs and subsidies and in the profitability of their work centers.
