He admitted that the main difficulty continues to be the search for a formula for a political settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina. "A meeting between five leading powers -- Russia, the United States, Great Britain, France, and Germany -- is not the only possibility, and we have already proposed other options for the cast of participants," Churkin reported, avoiding more detailed explanations. Answering a question about the degree of mistrust which the Muslims feel toward the officers and men in the Russian peacekeeping battalion, the deputy chief of Russian diplomacy said: "I raised this question myself in a conversation with President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and I think I was able to convince him that our military are not an anti-Muslim force in any way." Churkin emphasized the amicable tone of the talks with Izetbegovic, noting: "We are proceeding from the official statements of the Bosnian leadership, and not paying attention to the irresponsible Muslim activists who want war rather than peace." Following the 12 December elections, AFP circulated a report to the effect that the Russian battalion in Croatia, part of which is now redeployed in Sarajevo, voted almost to a man for the communists and Zhirinovskiy's party. In that case, can we count on the impartiality of these people? Vitaliy Churkin gave the following answer to this question: "AFP did not count up the votes. We have secret ballots, and everyone is free in making his decision. I know the servicemen in the battalion. They are highly professional and disciplined officers and men. Today they are standing in the line of fire, preventing both the Muslims and the Serbs from being killed." The president's special representative is convinced that the Kremlin's initiative has saved not only Sarajevo, but also NATO's prestige. In his opinion, air raids would have led to an escalation of war on the entire territory of Bosnia, because they may have created the illusion among some of the Muslims of an easy victory, which in actual fact would have been unattainable. "Following the bombings, the North Atlantic bloc would have had to take the next logical step -- that of bringing ground forces into Bosnia, which would have dragged Europe into the quagmire of a long and futile war," Vitaliy Churkin believes.
