In so doing, they also make public information that is of a strictly confidential nature, citing "informed sources in the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation." The ease with which some journalists, citing Russian military sources, are publicizing information about the timetables, dates, and destinations of the transports of nuclear ammunition is astonishing; especially as the Russian specialists cannot help but be aware that such actions create a real threat to the security of transporting nuclear warheads. Apparently, certain circles in Russia are interested in slowing down or even bringing to a total halt the planned removal of nuclear armaments from the territory of Ukraine. Obviously, were this to happen, Ukraine would again be accused of exhibiting a lack of good faith and obstructing the process of nuclear disarmament. The Press Service of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine hereby declares that such actions are provocatory and intolerable, inasmuch as their aim is to turn up the tension surrounding Ukraine's nuclear disarmament a notch higher. Ukraine remains faithful to her commitment to remove nuclear weapons from her territory. The specialists responsible for the security of these transports are taking all the necessary steps to safeguard this process from any unexpected eventualities. At the same time, because of the indiscretion of Russia's "informed sources," Ukraine is now forced to take additional steps to alter the exact schedule and routes for transporting nuclear warheads.
