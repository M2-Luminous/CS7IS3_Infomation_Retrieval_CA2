Panorama was able to interview one of those arrested, a repentant MRTA member, and in the course of the interview he supplied some details about the MRTA's internal organization. [Picon] The last man in the arrested group of MRTA members did not mean much to anyone: Emilio Villalobos Alba. With his arrest, however, Dincote did not arrest just another MRTA member. Villalobos' arrest meant that Dincote had arrested Peter Cardenas Shultz's successor, that is, the MRTA logistics apparatus chief, the chief of the MRTA special forces, and the man in charge of the MRTA's international network; a member of the MRTA national board, and a member of the MRTA national leadership. That is who Emilio Villalobos, also known as Comrade Celso, is. Emilio Villalobos, Comrade Celso, joined the MRTA in 1984. The police first identified him on 23 December 1985 when Celso, as a member of the MRTA hit squad, attacked the Escala Gigante shop on Alfonso Ugarte shop, where he was injured. He was able to flee, but by August 1986 the police were aware of the attacks he had taken part in and they began to seek him. To this point, Comrade Celso's task in the organization had been to orient the masses and execute armed actions. All this changed, however, on 19 July 1988, when he was arrested and sent to serve his sentence at the Castro Castro jail. This is where Emilio Villalobos's story begins; how he became a member of the MRTA leadership and how eventually he became Peter Cardenas Shultz's successor. Panorama was able to interview the protagonist of this story: Emilio Villalobos, Comrade Celso, who is under arrest today. [Begin recording] [Villalobos] At the time, I held a very high position within the MRTA leadership. At the time, the leaders included a number of MRTA members and many of them had held important posts. [Picon] Such as? [Villalobos] Such as Peter Shultz, Lucero Cumpa, Miguel Rincon Rincon, etc. [end recording] [Picon] Given his prison ties, when he left jail on 6 April 1990, the MRTA selected Villalobos to do important work with one of the most important MRTA leaders, Nestor Cerpa Catolini: [Begin recording] [Picon] Were you a member of the Metropolitan Committee? [Villalobos] That is right. [Picon] What other posts did you hold within the MRTA? [Villalobos] (?Depending) on different needs, I was assigned to the northern region. Later, I took on larger responsibilities. [end recording] [Picon] In view of this new task, Peter Cardenas Shultz ordered, from jail, that Celso be assigned an undercover identity. From that point, Emilio Villalobos, also known as Comrade Celso, became Oscar Balderrama Bernedos, a Bolivian journalist acting as a PRESENCIA magazine correspondent in Lima. With this undercover identity, Celso, together with Nestor Cerpa Catolini, was responsible for planning the most violent kidnappings and assassinations of various Peruvian businessmen. [Begin recording] [Villalobos] (?These) deaths (?had to with) the all-out war we were waging against the Armed and military forces. But in no way whatsoever did the MRTA ever support any project based on killing Peruvians in an indiscriminate manner, or perpetrating actions that would affect the civilian population. We were very respectful in this regard. We even upheld the Geneva agreements. [Picon] Why, then, did you kill kidnapped victims? There are several examples in this regard, such as Ballon Vera, the Spanish businessmen, Miyasato, Furukawa, and several others who were killed by the MRTA. If the MRTA, as you allege, respects human rights and the lives of individuals, why did you kill these kidnapped victims? For money? [Villalobos] Among the many businessmen who were taken prisoner, you will find several -- and some of them have publicly told this to the media -- who have commented on the dignified manner in which they were treated... [Picon, interrupting] But there are also many, like businessman Ballon Vera, who were savagely killed. Unfortunately, they are unable to comment on the tortures they endured, but they were killed. [Villalobos] Among the reports we have available, unfortunately we do have reports of these incidents. We have faced difficult circumstances. But I believe these deaths are part of a war, and there are no wars without deaths. This is a fact. [passage omitted] [Picon] [words indistinct] military with you? [Villalobos] Well, this would have to be in direct relation with the activities I was involved in [words indistinct] both in Lima and in the northern region. [end recording] [Picon] Arrogance and cold blood are the traits that allowed Villalobos to continue to climb within the MRTA leadership. When Dincote 2, headed by Col. Juan Gonzalez Sandoval, arrested Peter Cardenas Shultz, Comrade Celso occupied all of Cardenas Shultz's posts, mainly to receive all the funds obtained from the kidnappings. [Begin recording] [Villalobos] The money is centralized. [Picon] Where? [Villalobos] The national leadership. This money is used as a war fund. [Picon] But the MRTA must be aware of what you do with the money. [Villalobos] Not really... [Picon, interrupting] No one knows what is done with the money? [Villalobos] This is because of the way in which the group is divided up. But all of the organization's needs are met. [end recording] [Picon] These MRTA needs are nothing but brand new cars, luxury houses, and expensive restaurants. Dincote arrested many MRTA leaders thanks to the ostentatious and luxurious manner in which they lived. In addition, Celso was responsible for the MRTA's logistics apparatus and for establishing international communications, mainly with Hugo Avellaneda Valdes, in France, and with Walter Palacios, in Mexico. By then, Celso, already a member of the MRTA national leadership, established his base in Barranca, and from there he planned to establish a new kidnappings base in Arequipa. When the police arrested him on 10 April, Celso had already planned the kidnapping of two Arequipa businessmen. [passage omitted] Celso was arrested in Lima. But before that, the police spotted him entering several houses which turned out to be MRTA bases. It is from these houses that the police seized this important arsenal. When Dincote agents discovered this arsenal inside an MRTA base discovered in Las Flores, they also found a guitar case. They were greatly surprised, however, with what they found inside the case. What they found inside this simple guitar case was the very weapon used by the MRTA to attack buildings such as the Peruvian-American Cultural Institute, the U.S. Embassy, and the house of ex-Minister Bolona. [passage omitted] All of these crimes were ordered by Emilio Villalobos Alba, also known as Comrade Celso, member of the MRTA national leadership. But how did those who carried out the orders given by this criminal terrorist feel about it? You will now have an opportunity to find out what these people feel about the MRTA, and why they decided to leave that subversive organization. This is the testimony of an MRTA member who repented. [Begin recording] [Picon] What actions were you involved in? [Unidentified repentant MRTA member] I was involved in kidnappings and harassment, actions of harassment with rocket launchers and rifles, in the capital. The national leadership was directly responsible for decisions on the kidnappings. [Picon] How was the money obtained from the kidnappings used? [MRTA member] At the beginning, I thought the money obtained from the kidnappings was used to keep the armed struggle alive on the different fronts in the capital. But many times I encountered members in the lower structure, people who worked in the unions, in the shantytowns, people who were dying from tuberculosis, dressed in rags, and things like that. But there were some leaders who had an opportunity to enjoy the money, eat in good restaurants like the Haiti, eat pizza, drink beer in the Miraflores district or places like that. [Picon] Who did that, for example? [MRTA member] The ones who enjoyed these privileges were those in command positions; those who received money within the party. [Picon] Why did you do that, why torture, why murder? [MRTA member] We see here what could be an ideological decomposition of the MRTA. I do not understand why businessman Vera Ballon was tortured, left weighing 49 kg, and then shot. There is no excuse for that. [Picon] What is the MRTA becoming? [MRTA member] If the MRTA continues like that it will become a criminal group having no other choice than its own destruction. [end recording] [Picon] The MRTA has entered its final phase of extinction, and Dincote is playing a very important role in this. This week, Dincote 2 headed by Col. Juan Gonzalez Sandoval made an important capture in the struggle against terrorism.
