Participation in the PFP program would, in line with earlier plans, concentrate on peacekeeping activities. Finland could offer peacekeeping training to those countries that want to take part in the UN's or the CSCE's peacekeeping operations. Finland is also prepared to take part in cooperation in the planning of peacekeeping operations. The government stresses once again that Finland does not seek new defense solutions from the PFP and reiterates its doctrine of Finland's military nonalliance and an independent defense. In the government's view, NATO's PFP serves the stability of our continent and does not create new boundary lines.
