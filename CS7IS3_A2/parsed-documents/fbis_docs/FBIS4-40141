The new deputy will replace Zhiuli Shartava, chairman of the council of ministers of the autonomous republic, who died a tragic death in Abkhazia. At first nine candidates were vying for the seat in parliament. Later three candidates withdrew from the electoral campaign, and two of them urged the electors to vote for Murman Omanidze. Omanidze, 56, is in perfect health. In younger years he actively practiced sports and got the title of master of sports for unarmed self-defence. Aside from it, he showed a special gift for business, when he was still a student of the law department of Tbilisi university. Now he is vice president and executive director of the joint Austrian-Finnish firm Stellar with the turnover of hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars and tens of billions of roubles. Once speaking at a press conference, Omanidze said that if he came to power, he would make Georgia into a flourishing country in two to three years. He, a wealthy man with numerous connections in the business circles of Russia and other countries and without nationalistic prejudices, is giving priority to economic interests. According to reliable sources close to the Georgian leadership, if Murman Omanidze is elected deputy to the Georgian parliament, he may soon become prime minister of the republic.
