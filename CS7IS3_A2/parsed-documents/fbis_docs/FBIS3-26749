The stipulations of the Administrative Method are as follows: -- All commodities imported by selling units (including commodities imported through border trade at ports) must be reported to and checked by or registered with organs of commodity inspection in Hainan within prescribed time, with such documents as contracts, invoices, packing lists, bills of lading shown. Import commodities related to security and public health must be imported according to law in China. Regarding import commodities that must be checked according to law by commodity inspection organs, no one is allowed to sell them without prior checking or without getting a pass at the inspection. -- For selling units that directly import the following nine electromechanical products: automobiles, motorcycles, motorcycle engines, television sets, refrigerators, air conditioners, refrigerating compressors, air conditioning compressors, and kinescopes, it is necessary to produce valid "import commodity safety permits" provided by suppliers, and signed and issued by the PRC State Administration for the Inspection of Import and Export Commodities, and to bear the "CCIB" mark authorized by the State Administration for the Inspection of Import and Export Commodities. Commodities arriving in Hainan must be reported to and checked by commodity inspection organs promptly. The "commodity inspection label" will be issued after getting a pass in the commodity inspection. Only when the label is put on the outside package can a commodity be sold to consumers in the market according to relevant laws and regulations stipulated by industrial and commercial administrative departments. -- When producing invoices of import commodities sold, selling units should state clearly the countries of origin, specifications, and models of commodities. -- Commodity inspection organs and industrial and commercial administrative departments spot check, supervise, and administer import commodities in the realm of circulation according to law and can spot check, at any time, import commodities to be sold in the realm of circulation, but selling units must never, under whatever grounds, reject the spot check.
