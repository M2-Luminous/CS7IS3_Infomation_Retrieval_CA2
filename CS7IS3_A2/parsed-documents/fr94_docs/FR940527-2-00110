SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Notice is hereby given of the pendency before the Department of a proposed class exemption from the restrictions of sections 406(a)(1) (A) through (D), 406(a)(2), 406(b)(1) and 406(b)(2) of ERISA and from the taxes imposed by section 4975 (a) and (b) of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (E) of the Code. The Department is proposing the class exemption on its own motion pursuant to section 408(a) of ERISA and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR part 2570, subpart B, (55 FR 32836, August 10, 1990). 1 1 Section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) generally transferred the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue administrative exemptions under section 4975(c)(2) of the Code to the Secretary of Labor. Background The Department is proposing the class exemption contained in this notice as part of a continuing effort to facilitate voluntary settlements arising from investigations involving violations of title I of ERISA. The rules set forth in section 406 of ERISA prohibit various transactions between plans and certain related parties, unless a statutory or administrative exemption applies to the transaction. These related parties, such as plan fiduciaries, sponsoring employers, unions and service providers, are defined as parties in interest in section 3(14) of ERISA, and, in the absence of an exemption, may not engage in transactions described in section 406 of ERISA with a plan. Specifically, section 406(a)(1) (A) through (D) prohibits a fiduciary of a plan from causing the plan to engage in a transaction that constitutes a direct or an indirect: Sale or exchange or leasing of any property between the plan and a party in interest; lending of money or other extension of credit between the plan and a party in interest; furnishing of goods, services or facilities between the plan and a party in interest; or transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party in interest, of any assets of the plan. Section 406(a)(2) provides that no fiduciary who has authority or discretion to control or manage plan assets shall permit the plan to hold any employer security or employer real property if he knows or should know that holding such security or real property violates section 407(a) of ERISA. Section 406(b)(1) and (b)(2) prohibits a fiduciary, with respect to a plan, from dealing with the assets of the plan in his own interest or for his own account; or acting in his individual capacity or in any other capacity in any transaction involving the plan on behalf of a party (or representing a party) whose interests are adverse to the interests of the plan or the interests of the participants or beneficiaries. In addition, such transactions are generally subject to taxation under section 4975 of the Code. In the past, the Department has frequently exercised its statutory authority under section 408(a) of ERISA to grant both individual and class exemptions from the restrictions imposed by section 406 of ERISA where it has been able to find that the statutory criteria have been met. 2 This process has been helpful in providing exemptive relief for transaction which were otherwise prohibited, but were in the interest of the plan. 2 Section 408(a) of ERISA provides, in part, that the Department may not grant an exemption unless a finding is made that such exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of the plan and of its participants and beneficiaries and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of such plan.
