In today's articles and commentaries, the papers stress that what happened at the UN Security Council yesterday reveals the magnitude of the dangerous anti-Iraq plot and underlines the deep links between the Zionist and U.S. interests and a full U.S. readiness to implement Zionist circles' desires to weaken Iraq and curb its pan-Arab intellectual renaissance. AL-QADISIYAH says that the split the Iraqi position has effected among the permanent UN Security Council member states affirms the legitimacy of the Iraqi position and the legitimacy of any move that Iraq might deem necessary to open for its people a window of hope for ending the blockade. AL-QADISIYAH continues: Lifting the blockade has become a matter of life or death for the Iraqi people. Therefore, as a people, they are entitled to do whatever their leadership, which is aware of the dark corners of the political plot that is being implemented against them, deems necessary to lift the blockade by all available means and to reassess all the stands that have led and lead to maintaining the blockade against them. BABIL says that the Iraqi people are waging the battle of Iraq and the Arab nation together, and that their success in putting an end to the blockade means thwarting the attempts and plans to besiege the masses of the Arab nation. Reviewing the current Arab state of affairs, BABIL indicates that Libya, just like the people of Iraq, is being subjected to an air blockade. Meanwhile, Sudan is being subjected to an aggressive scheme aimed at imposing an unjust blockade, and our Palestinian people have been subjected to a continuous Zionist siege since the breakout of the intifadah. The paper says that the policy of imposing blockades has been adopted as an available means to besiege the Arab nation, beginning with the countries rejecting U.S.-Zionist hegemony, and ending with any hope for success by emerging Arab powers. BABIL warns the Arab nation against the gravity of the schemes to besiege the Arab nation. It urges parties, movements, federations, unions, and all social forces to work and struggle to support Iraq's pan-Arab position and to confront the evil powers. It calls on Arab institutions, beginning with the Arab League and its organizations and ending with Arab regimes, to adopt a clear and explicit stance against the continued blockade. BABIL stresses that the current circumstances experienced by the Iraqi people provide a historic chance for whoever wants to atone for his sins or the sins being committed in his name against the Iraqi people to do so, for such sins have encouraged the aggressors to launch their treacherous aggression and to maintain the blockade. To atone for their sins, they should declare a clear and explicit stance against the continued blockade. AL-JUMHURIYAH describes what happened at the UN Security Council yesterday as an obvious political and diplomatic defeat for the United States and Britain and an end for the U.S. honeymoon at the UN Security Council, which has lasted for over three years. The paper says that when three members--France, Russia, and China--of the five permanent members demand that the positiveness of the Iraqi position be recognized, it signals a change and a number of important facts, most prominent of which is that the United States has lost its ability to issue easy resolutions and to impose its will on the Security Council. The paper explains that Washington has come to realize the long- term significance of this change, which particularly means that the battle for lifting the blockade has entered its most critical turning point and that the U.S. logic has proved unsuccessful unconvincing even inside U.S. Congress. AL-JUMHURIYAH continues: What happened at the Security Council yesterday reveals a third fact which tells us that renewing the blockade every two months is no longer something that can be unilaterally decided by the United States. Rather, such a decision is now influenced by the wills and interests of other countries, because the blockade not only harms the Iraqi people, but also the international community as a whole. The paper expresses confidence that month after month, the stand of the states supporting the lifting of the blockade will become stronger and firmer, thus leading to the emergence of a legal argument and a conflict of interests which will turn the disagreement that emerged yesterday to a crisis that will escalate violently every two months, thus provoking disputes and differences, and perhaps a serious crisis, until the blockade comes to an end.
