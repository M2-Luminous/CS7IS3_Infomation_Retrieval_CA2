As Secretary General Wilhelm Hoynck stated on Friday [4 February], various CSCE institutions have been united in the new CSCE Secretariat in Vienna and have been slimmed down in terms of personnel. The number of employees in Prague will be reduced from 40 to eight; in Vienna a few more will be added to the about 100 employees. Originally, CSCE activities were divided between Prague and Vienna. As its seventh observer mission in the former East bloc, the CSCE plans a mission in Tajikistan.
