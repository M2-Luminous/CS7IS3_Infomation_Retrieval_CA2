Lukashenko demanded that the chairman of the State Security Committee, Gennadiy Lavickiy, "show this material to the public." In the meantime, Lavickiy told INTERFAX that his committee "has no such materials," and that Lukashenko's statement "is too cheap even for a primitive political provocation." At his meeting with voters in Gomel Lukashenko dismissed the charges that he opposes the agreement on unifying the Belarusian monetary system with Russian. "I do not oppose it," he pointed out. "However the documents on unifying the two monetary systems are a political show, since Belarus has gained nothing from it in real terms, and Moscow does not want to speak with the Belarusian government." According to Lukashenko, "a truly equitable agreement with Russia can be signed only by his own team, if he is elected president."
