The two ministers pointed out the importance of a bilateral political dialogue that would enable the two foreign ministries to consult and act together under the circumstances of extremely rapid developments in the area. "Obviously, besides these general issues, I presented the Hellenic side also some major projects of economic collaboration for which we have requested political support from the Greek authorities," Melescanu said. He also mentioned that they are several extremely important projects that are envisaged to be worked out with Greece in the ensuing period, projects that are to be financed by the European Union, such as the subway in Salonika and a electric power railway link between Athens and Salonika, in which Romanian companies are interested. The Romanian foreign minister also mentioned that discussions covered extensively the area of conflict of both sides' interest, especially the Yugoslav crisis. "Practically, we agreed that several positive signs are showing up and that probably Romania's and Greece's contribution is to encourage such positive steps and expand the understandings concluded until present". In that context Melescanu said that several similarities of opinions were noticed, including the idea that the cease-fire and the improvement of the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina should be used to launch a global process of negotiations that would lead thus to a global solution to the crisis in former Yugoslavia. Also approached were obviously issues related to the economic sanctions, to the embargo, the two sides expressing their support for the decision adopted by the European Union Committee that is for a correlation of the progress made during negotiations with the slackening or the complete lifting of economic sanctions.
