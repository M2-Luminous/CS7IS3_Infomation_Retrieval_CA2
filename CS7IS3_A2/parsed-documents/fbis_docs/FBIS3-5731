Susumu Yamaji, chairman of Japan Airlines Co. (JAL), told a luncheon meeting sponsored by the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan, "we want a U.S.-Japan agreement which reflects today's conditions instead of the position of 40 years ago." International aviation should be governed by a bilateral agreement based on "a give-and-take principle," he said. But the current accord between Tokyo and Washington, a product of the postwar period, was influenced by "the circumstances of the time when the power of the United States was overwhelming," he said. Yamaji, also chairman of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Executive Committee, has led the Japanese team in civil aviation talks with the U.S. Yamaji said Japanese airlines, for example, have only two weekly "beyond rights" flights from Tokyo to Brazil via Los Angeles, while U.S. airlines have 149 weekly flights beyond Japan to countries in North and South Asia and Australia. He also said that under the pact, Japan is forced to take a "rather peculiar" route to Mexico via Vancouver, rather than the more cost-effective route via Los Angeles. "U.S. airlines are exploiting the full benefits of their very advantageous position stemming from the 40-year-old accord," he said. Yamaji said U.S. airlines, bent on fully employing their "outdated" rights, are attempting to further grab their share and control of global markets, advocating free competition under the name of "open skies." But the attitude has angered more and more countries, prompting France and Thailand to end their agreements with the U.S., and Germany once came close to doing so, he said. "When you talk about liberalization, you have to prepare rules that offer fair chances to all players," Yamaji said. He said Japan is not considering forming an alliance with other Asian countries that have disputes with the U.S. in future talks with Washington. On a reported plan by JAL to raise its air fares in first- and business-class seats on overseas routes, Yamaji said it reflects "business judgment" made by IATA. Any airline belonging to the 225-airline IATA must receive its approval for a fare hike. The plan is then accepted by the transport authorities of each country. JAL's latest move came at a time when global airlines are aiming to trim fares in order to survive the intensified race. JAL has decided to slash fares for economy class, Yamaji said. JAL, which suffered around 50 billion in pretax losses in the latest accounting year, is expected to incur a similar loss in the current year that ends in March.
