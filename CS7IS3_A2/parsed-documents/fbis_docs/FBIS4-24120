More than one dozen people were killed and many more wounded in the city today. After the heavy defeats it has suffered, it is thought that the rebel army is reorganizing to mount another offensive against the city of Kuito and its outskirts. Our correspondent Abel Abraao reports. [Begin Abraao recording] UNITA on several occasions interrupted the shelling of the city today. This was followed by snipers' fire. A source from the government forces' operational command views the relative calm in the city of Kuito today as a preparation for future actions by the Black Cockerel's troops against the city and its outskirts, after the heavy defeats they suffered over the past 48 hours. Thus, it is expected that the city of Kuito will experience fierce clashes and violent shellings at a time when many people are dying in the war and from lack of medicine. [end recording]
