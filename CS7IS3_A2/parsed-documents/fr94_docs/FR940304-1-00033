FR940304-1-00033 FR940304-1-00008 Response: Customs agrees and has determined to eliminate proposed §146.98(b) from the revised proposed rule; and proposed §146.98(c) is now redesignated as §146.93(e). In addition, as previously emphasized, revised §§146.93, 146.95 and 146.96 now provide for consumption within the subzone. Moreover, Customs has decided to add an Appendix to proposed subpart H as revised in order to give detailed examples of attribution as well as the relative value calculation. Conclusion After careful consideration of the comments received and further review of the matter, it has been determined to republish the proposal with the modifications noted and to allow interested persons an additional opportunity to submit comments on the proposal. Also, Customs has determined to add definitions in the revised proposed rule for ``feedstock factor'', ``petroleum refinery'', and ``refinery operating unit'', and to eliminate the definitions for ``protection of the revenue'' and ``stock in process'' formerly set forth in proposed §146.92(m) and (o), respectively. Commenters on the original proposal need not resubmit their comments. They will be considered along with any new comments received in response to this notice.
