This Order is issued pursuant to: (1) Commission rule 30.3(a), 17 CFR 30.3(a) (1994), which makes it unlawful for any person to engage in the offer or sale of a foreign option product until the Commission, by order, authorizes such foreign option to be offered or sold in the United States; and (2) the Commission's Order issued on August 18, 1992, 57 FR 38437 (August 25, 1992), authorizing certain option products traded on the LME to be offered or sold in the United States. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 4, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Francey L. Youngberg, Esq., Division of Trading and Markets, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street NW., Washington, D.C. 20581. Telephone: (202) 254&hyph;8955. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission has issued the following Order: Order Under Commission Rule 30.3(a) Permitting Option Contracts on the LME Aluminum Alloy Futures Contract Traded on the London Metal Exchange To Be Offered or Sold in the United States Thirty Days After Publication of this Notice in the Federal Register Absent Further Notice By Order issued on August 18, 1992 (``Initial Order''), the Commission authorized, pursuant to Commission rule 30.3(a), 1 certain option products traded on the London Metal Exchange to be offered or sold in the United States. 57 FR 38437 (August 25, 1992). Among other conditions, the Initial Order specified that: 1 Commission rule 30.3(a), 17 CFR 30.3(a) (1994), makes it unlawful for any person to engage in the offer or sale of a foreign option product until the Commission, by order, authorizes such foreign option to be offered or sold in the United States. Except as otherwise permitted under the Commodity Exchange Act and regulations thereunder, *␣*␣* no offer or sale of any London Metal Exchange option product in the United States shall be made until thirty days after publication in the Federal Register of notice specifying the particular option(s) to be offered or sold pursuant to this Order. By letter dated October 31, 1994 the London Metal Exchange (``LME) represented that it would be introducing an option contract based on the LME Aluminum Alloy Futures Contract. The LME has requested that the Commission supplement its Initial Order authorizing Option Contracts on High Grade Primary Aluminum, Copper-Grade A, Special High Grade Zinc, Standard Lead, Primary Nickel and Tin futures contracts, 57 FR 38437 (Aug. 25, 1992), by also authorizing the Option Contract on the LME Aluminum Alloy Futures Contract to be offered or sold to persons in the United States. Upon due consideration, and for the reasons previously discussed in the initial Order, the Commission believes that the request for authorization to offer or sell an option contract on the LME Aluminum Alloy Futures Contract should be granted. Accordingly, pursuant to Commission rule 30.3(a) and the Commission's Initial Order issued on August 18, 1992, and subject to the terms and conditions specified therein, the Commission hereby authorizes the Option Contract on the LME Aluminum Alloy Futures Contract to be offered or sold to persons located in the United States thirty days after publication of this notice in the Federal Register , unless prior to that date the Commission receives any comments which may result in a determination to delay the effective date of the Order pending review of such comments. Under such circumstances, the Commission will provide notice.
