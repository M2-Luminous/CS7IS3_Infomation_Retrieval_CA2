In concluding the conference (Zhang Wenzhu), deputy secretary general of the provincial people's government, delivered a speech in which he put forward demands for the province's work of safe production. (Zhang Wenzhu) said: The province's situation in safe production in 1993 was as elsewhere in the country and a peak of production accidents cropped up again. The number of various accidents occurring in 1993 reached more than 28,000, resulting in the deaths of 4,800 persons. This is another large-scale increase in accidents since the first over-4,000-person occurrence of deaths recorded in 1992. The economic losses caused by these accidents last year reached more than 160 million yuan and showed a 45.15 percent increase over 1992. Traffic accidents left the largest number of persons dead followed by deaths and injuries caused by industrial and mining enterprise accidents. (Zhang Wenzhu) pointed out: The province's situation in safe production is still unstable though it has been somewhat alleviated since the beginning of this year. Important and appalling accidents still continue to occur. For this, the provincial people's government urges leading personnel at all levels and the responsible persons of enterprises to resolutely and successfully deal with the relations between security and production, between security and economic results, and between security and reform. A good job should be done in implementing the tasks of handling these relations. (Zhang Wenzhu) stressed: We should seize the emphasis and weak link of safe production and do a good job in conducting safe production. In particular, we should enhance the security supervision and inspection over the key industries, trades, and departments of communications and over coal mines. We should also do a good job in conducting propaganda and education on safe production. As for personnel who will be in special posts, we should employ them through training and keep them in line with state regulations. (Zhang Wenzhu) said: According to the state unified arrangements, we will launch the weekly campaign of safe production from 16 to 22 May this year. Through the campaign, we should foster a social environment in which everyone shows concern for security and pays attention to security in doing everything. Listening to the telephone conference at various branch halls were leading personnel from the provincial people's government, from the people's governments of various cities, from the relevant departments and bureaus under the provincial level organs and various city level organs, and from the supervisory and procuratorial departments in charge of security management --about 300 persons in all.
