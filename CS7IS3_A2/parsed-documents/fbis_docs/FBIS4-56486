A group of U.S. lawyers headed by New York Federal District Judge Jack B. Weinstein arrived in Peru to study the Peruvian judicial and penal system, especially aspects related to antiterrorist legislation. Vega said he had received no request for a meeting from the U.S. lawyers, but had he done so he would "never" meet with them. Vega told the media he knew the visitors had come to see Peruvian prisons, and in this regard he added, "I will send them pictures of the prisons." The Human Rights Commission of the New York Bar Association will meet with Jorge Avendano, dean of the Lima Lawyers Association, with representatives of the Pro-Human Rights Association, and with the Human Rights Commission of Congress. Avendano said the U.S. lawyers had contacted him, and they would meet in the Lima Lawyers Association headquarters on 5 May. Avendano indicated that the visitors want to study the real situation of the Peruvian criminal justice system. A few months ago, after paying a visit to the country, a delegation of jurists headed by U.S. lawyer Robert Goldman criticized Peruvian criminal legislation in a report that was rejected by government officials.
