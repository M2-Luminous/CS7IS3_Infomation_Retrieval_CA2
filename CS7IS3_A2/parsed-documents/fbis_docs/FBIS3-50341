This was said in Belgrade this evening during the first round of Yugoslav-Hungarian talks at foreign ministerial level. [passage omitted] This evening [Hungarian Foreign Minister] Geza Jeszenszky briefed his hosts about the essence of Hungary's foreign policy and its European orientation. In this orientation, Jeszenszky said, priority is given to Hungary's relations with its neighbors, which, he was told, coincides with the Yugoslav orientation. The Hungarian guest was told that the FRY is also Europe-oriented, that our country is very close to being admitted to the Council of Europe and other important European institutions, but is kept away from the European processes of integration with the outbreak of the Yugoslav crisis. Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladimir Jovanovic informed his Hungarian counterpart and his associates about the present moment in the Yugoslav crisis, particularly about the war in Bosnia. He said that Yugoslavia made a great contribution to the establishment of a just peace in that former Yugoslav republic and that, unfortunately one side (Muslims) is not ready to accept a solution which the other two warring sides have accepted. Despite this the FRY will continue to invest efforts to stop the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to have the sanctions lifted. Vladislav Jovanovic spoke at length about the sanctions against the FRY. He underscored that their maintenance leads to the escalation of the war in Bosnia and the destabilization of the Balkans. Besides, the Yugoslav foreign minister said, the sanctions are not only affecting the FRY but many other countries as well, especially neighboring ones. In view of this, the Yugoslav side said, the FRY expects neighboring countries to more resolutely oppose the extension of the sanctions and hopes that Hungary will make an effort to have them lifted as soon as possible. Opinions were also exchanged this evening on the activities of the CSCE. In this context, the talks centered on Hungary's role as a member of the so-called CSCE troika -- the former, the current, and the future chairing country -- as well as its role as that institution's chairing country next year. The Yugoslav side expressed its readiness and wish to have Yugoslavia readmitted to the CSCE as a full-fledged member. However, it was stressed, such a decision should be made by those who had frozen Yugoslavia's membership and the FRY's readmittance should be dignified and without preconditions. [passage omitted] Geza Jeszenszky was told this evening that Belgrade appreciates what Hungary has been doing so far in its relations with the FRY. Hungary is one of the few countries that refused to introduce visas for Yugoslav passport holders since the outbreak of the crisis, while other countries had done so for less justified reasons. Consequently, it is in Yugoslavia's interest to improve its ties with Hungary and to gradually promote cooperation in all areas relevant to the two countries' needs and potentials, Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky was told in Belgrade this evening.
