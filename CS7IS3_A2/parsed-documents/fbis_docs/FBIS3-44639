Recently, the central authorities issued a document to all localities, instructing the leaders not to overestimate the "risk-enduring capacity" of the public. At a time when reform measures are being announced, all localities are required to draw up emergency measures, "which may look casual outwardly but strict inwardly," which aim at dealing with shocks and contingencies which may break out any time. The "Emergency Center" of the Central Bank is also "ready for battle," preparing to cope with any unexpected changes in the exchange market. Luo Zhiling, vice minister of the State Planning Commission, admitted that the panic purchases of grain in parts of China since last November have served to prepare the public for future price rises. He claimed that reform is not aimed at bringing about a general rise in commodity prices, and the state will take steps to stabilize prices. Relevant sources have disclosed that China's four major specialized banks, namely the Bank of China, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the People's Construction Bank of China, has sent urgent cables to their branches in all parts of the country, summoning directors of all provincial- and regional-level branches to attend a meeting in Beijing next week to discuss issues concerning deepening reform and the anti-corruption struggle. It has been learned that the major agenda of the meeting for branch heads will be the possible impact produced by the unification of the existing dual rate system of renminbi, as well as the commercialization of specialized banks. It has been noted that the Beijing leadership has showed concern over the possible impact produced by the announcement of a series of reform measures this year, and is also plagued by unsatisfactory results of the anticorruption struggle which was launched at an early time, for fear that all these may serve to further impair the reputation of the government. In order to prevent "a fine start and poor finish" for the anticorruption campaign, the central authorities recently sent instructions to all localities, warning that though they can tune down their propaganda pitch a little, no localities are allowed to claim to have attained "accomplishments at the present stage" of the anti-corruption campaign, for only the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection has the right to say so. At present, the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection is carrying out intensive investigations into several "super-large cases," yet at a very slow pace. The leadership cherishes the hope that the cracking of several major cases can set off another upsurge of the anti-corruption struggle and show all nationalities the determination of the central authorities. The Central Bank Gets Prepared for Unexpected Changes, and Sets the Bottom Line of the Exchange Rate at 10 to the Dollar Sources have revealed that before it scrapped the dual-rate currency system, the People's Bank of China (the central bank) made full preparations for possible big ups and downs in the exchange market when it began to float the yuan. Although nothing serious happened during the first three days, the 24-hour emergency center (the duty room) still "maintains its combat readiness." It has been learned that the leadership has set the bottom line of the renminbi exchange rate at 10 to the dollar, and once the exchange rate drops to this level, the bank will strive to stabilize the rate with all necessary measures, including selling U.S. dollars and resuming a number of administrative methods previously in use. Predictions show that the exchange rate of renminbi will remain relatively stable before the Chinese New Year, mainly because most foreign businessmen stationed in Beijing have returned to their own countries for the Christmas holidays and enterprise demands for foreign exchange are also relatively low. After the Chinese New Year, however, along with the "rise of temperature" of the entire economy, the exchange rate of renminbi will go through real tests. In recent days, an apparent rise has been registered in Beijing's commodity prices; imported electric home appliances, in particular, are often in short supply. Stories have it that shortly after an advertisement for Sony brand electric home appliances was published on the newspaper, citizens rushing to the shop were surprise to find an increase of more than 10 percent over the advertised price; while prices of ordinary Japan-made hi-fis also went up from over 4,000 yuan to over 5,000 yuan, registering an increase of more than 20 percent. Prices of grain, oil, and some basic consumer goods remain relative stable under state control. It has been learned that when the policy of unifying dual exchange rate was first announced, Foreign Exchange Certificates (FEC) traded in Beijing at 1 to the yuan; though the rate later rose to 1 to 1.45 yuan, FEC dropped again yesterday to 1 to 1.25 yuan. In the black market, people only want to buy, they do not sell, U.S. dollars, for most people intend to buy U.S. dollars for future use. The black market rate generally remains at around 8.68 to the dollar in a recent period, similar to the state swap rate. In Harbin City, center of Sino-Russian trade, however, people are trading the yuan at 9 to the dollar. Rates in coastal port cities, like Yantai and Weihai, are higher that those in inland areas.
