Their total number now equals to 1,100 people. Various ways are being studied to ensure their security, including probable further reductions, he stressed. However, the recall of Russian experts from several sectors of the economy, which are vitally important for Algeria, is linked with definite difficulties, which may affect both friendly Algeria and Russia. Touching on his Thursday meeting with Algerian ambassador to Moscow, Posuvalyuk explained that the demand to toughen security measures in order to protect Russian specialists, handed to the Algerian side, was "worded in the most resolute form". The sides also discussed ways to "approach the very concept of this security from a new angle, in particular, to lodge the Russians more compactly, which would make it easier for the Algerian law enforcement bodies to ensure their protection". The ambassador stressed the difficulties with which the Algerian police was now confronted. It was decided to establish closer contacts of the Russian Embassy and the Algerian contractors with the local security services.
