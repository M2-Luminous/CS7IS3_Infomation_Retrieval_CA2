On the same day, the South Korean puppets swiftly deployed some 20 tanks and about 300 armed bandits to Ogum-ri from Manu-ri, Paju County, Kyonggi Province, and brought large-calibre guns into the demilitarized zone along the Military Demarcation Line from Kajon-ri, Inje County, South Korean Kangwon Province. The desperate military exercises against the northern malf of Korea fully show the aggressive and bellicose nature of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets.
