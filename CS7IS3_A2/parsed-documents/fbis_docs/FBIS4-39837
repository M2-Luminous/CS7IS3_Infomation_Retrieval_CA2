Victor Catana, the co-chairman of the Join Control Commission, told BASAPRESS that this is untrue. "Bender is an inseparable part of Moldova and thus the city police is a constitutional organ," he said. According to the [1992] Snegur- Yeltsin agreement, the city is declared a zone of high security and, hence, the Moldovan police's presence in Tighina is established by the same agreement, said Catana. According to him, the local administration subordinated to the self-proclaimed Dniester Republic exerts pressure on the police and this results in increased crime. "Regardless of these actions the police will stay in Bender to perform its duty of protecting public order and the rights and interests of the people," concluded Catana.
