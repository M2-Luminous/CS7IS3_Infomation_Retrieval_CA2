The other day the Justice Ministry registered an interregional movement calling itself "New Names," which has been joined by some participants in the electoral bloc of the same name, including federal ticket leaders Vladimir Mironov, director of the Institute of Politics; and Oleg Sokolov, chairman of the youth organization of the Russian Social Democratic People's Party. At the same time, Vyacheslav Lashchevskiy, chairman of the Russian Youth Union, who used to head the electoral bloc, will not take part in the forming of the new organization. "New Names" intends to adhere to a social democratic trend and keep in touch with all public political associations far removed from extremism. To date, "New Names" has six regional organizations in Tataria [Tatarstan], Bashkiria [Bashkortostan], and Tambov, among other places. According to "New Names" spokesman Artem Smolyannoy, primary organizations were set up in those regions where the electoral association managed more than 5 percent of the vote. Mr. Smolyannoy pointed out that although many activists of "Rutskoy's Party" participate in the work of the new organization, most of the participants in the project have nothing to do with the Russian Social Democratic People's Party. This perhaps explains why "New Names" is quite ready to accede to the Treaty on Accord. (Their signature is not there yet because they have not been invited to add it).
