Everything seems to have driven John Major to prompt this European crisis. As far as politics is concerned, the facts are well known. Unappreciated by his electorate, who recently humiliated him by granting Labor a triumph in the European elections, the British prime minister is, above all, unpopular within his own party. Indeed, the Conservatives accuse him of lacking charisma, while the Right of his party -- which has not forgiven him for betraying Thatcher and which accuses him of being too European (no less!) -- is just waiting for its chance for revenge. So John Major had everything to gain from being tough in Corfu, because in that way he disarmed the Thatcherites while at the same time displaying strength of character, which hitherto has not been regarded as his foremost quality. The second reason for Britain's veto is less petty. True, the Belgian prime minister -- from whom John Major wanted to withhold the presidency of the Commission -- is the opposite of an extreme economic liberalist and therefore of a British Conservative. A Christian Democrat, but from the left-wing of this movement, Jean- Luc Dehaene is indeed, from the political viewpoint, another Delors, imbued with social Catholicism; convinced that it is the state that creates the difference between a market economy and the law of the jungle; and, last, a supporter of a Europe that is present on the international scene and whose influence extends beyond that of a free trade area. All this is a matter for a genuine debate -- a political Europe versus a free trade Europe; a Europe of social consensus versus a laissez-faire Europe; the Europe of the new ideological Right versus the Europe of the social-democratic and Christian-social center. Then there is the question of the historical vision. Here there is no debate. The facts are clear to all: John Major's Britain is simply blind. It refuses to see, first, that the United States of the post-communist era has its mind mainly on regaining its economic health, that leading the world is the least of its concerns, and that it therefore no longer needs a Britain which, halfway between itself and Europe, will represent it there. Britain no longer has a future as a forward post of the United States. Its future is Europe. It has no other, but, incapable of acknowledging this obvious truth, it fails to see that it could perform an exceptional role within the European Union. A crisis is in fact looming within Europe, because of the influence that Germany is acquiring. It is the Union's most populous country, and also the one which will derive the greatest benefits from it. Austria, Finland, Norway, and Sweden -- the four states that will join the Union next year -- are closer to the Germanic world than to France, Britain, or southern Europe. Already Europe is sliding toward the north, toward Protestantism and austerity. And this is just the first step. Central Europe is knocking on the Union's door. It will enter, too, and this part of Europe is, from every viewpoint -- historical, cultural, linguistic, and of course economic -- indissolubly linked to Germany. Having been invented by the French, the united Europe is becoming a German Europe. It is no conspiracy. It is worse than that. It is geography that is dictating this, because united Germany is at the center of the western part of the continent, which now extends as far as the borders of the former USSR. Apart from the Germans, who are terrified by this situation, each country is behaving as though the collapse of the Wall had changed nothing. The French in particular still base their entire foreign policy on strengthening the "Franco-German axis." But some day, doubtless soon, the malaise will surface. If only it wanted to, Britain could, by making a real commitment to Europe, become the guarantor of the continental balance, helping to counterbalance Germany's power. Britain needs Europe as much as Europe needs it. And yet because of Britain Europe is losing time. And losing itself.
