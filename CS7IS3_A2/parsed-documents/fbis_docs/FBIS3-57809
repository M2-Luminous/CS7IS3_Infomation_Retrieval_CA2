In this encounter, which has become traditional for the head of state, who has the honor, the honor to pass his greetings on to the citizens, best wishes to everyone, to each person. Best wishes to those who are citizens of Italy in their homeland, and to those who live abroad, to those immigrants who are in this country for work, in particular to immigrants, hoping that they come to regard Italy as their second homeland and that they forget certain uncivil episodes. The Italian people are all hospitable. Best wishes to those who are guests for reasons of study or work, or are passing through, and are starting 1994 with us. Happy New Year to everyone and happy New Year to Italy. A year has gone by. It seemed almost impossible: the precarious political situation, the explosion that has already started and is increasing with regard to the penal emergency, with the widespread involvement of the political and economic-financial area. Then, [a year ago] in this room, I was holding meetings so that the first government could be formed. At that time, economic reality was delicate, not to say serious, with heavy repercussions for employment, and the instability of the currency, which had already been devalued, and the incredible succession of ministers resigning -- seven -- with immediate replacements and sometimes repeated, and above all the face of Italy before Europe and the rest of the world. There were many worries, perhaps even fears. How difficult it was to find a glimmer of optimism anywhere. How difficult it was to try to find hope. Then there were the bombs, almost to prevent us from hoping. I found myself thinking of the spes desperantium, the hope of the desperate. I was interior minister when I went on a visit to Yugoslavia to sign anti-terrorist agreements. My guide was a professor who set great store in showing me that he had nothing to do with the regime, Tito had already been dead for some time. Suddenly he said, come with me, and took me into a church, leading me up to a beautiful sculpture of the Madonna, but above all he pointed out to me what was written underneath: Spes desperantium, the hope of the desperate, of those who cannot find hope. Many times I thought of this: The bombs in Florence, Milan, Rome, and the victims, and the desperation of relatives and work colleagues, and the terror. It was almost like an anxious expectation of further violence, and people had one inexpressible or unexpressed question: Who wants to destabilize, who wants to destroy the strong spirit of this, our people, who and why? The judges at work with the judicial police, were involved without respite in a search for the motives and the guilty, to restore security to citizens, so that citizens could feel safe. Sufficient thanks will never be said to those who carry out this work. Yet the year has ended, with the efforts of parliament, and what efforts, and of the Constitutional Court and of the magistrature, with the initiatives of the Amato and the Ciampi governments. Allow me for a moment to remember: It was my responsibility and honor to ask Giuliano Amato last year and Carlo Azeglio Ciampi eight months ago to form and lead a government. In the first instance, the political moment was very delicate, and the second was devoid of every valid indication from parliament, when I telephoned Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the then governor of the Bank of Italy, and I said to him: Governor, be prepared. These were choices, which among other things have done much to markedly increase Italy's standing, and not only in Europe. There were the unstinting efforts of the forces of order and of the Armed Forces both inside and outside Italy, even in far off places, to serve peace efforts. There were the efforts of the public administration. How disappointed I am when I hear someone condemning the whole public administration for being useless, badly prepared, and inefficient. Why must we speak destructively, without thinking of how many people known to each one of us give their lives to their work. With the efforts of many, very many private sector operatives, the year has ended. Our currency has been strengthened. The economy is showing signs of recovery. The fight against crime has known great successes. The year has ended because of the strength of Italians. The year has ended because of the courage and the active patience of Italians. Think of the admirable rebuilding and the perfect restoration in Florence. Think of the calm firmness of the Milanese, of the immediate recovery of Rome, whose art and faith had been wounded, and of the ever-present volunteers who are versatile and untiring, and of the admirable fire fighters who were present everywhere. Over all of this ruled the determination of those in charge of fine arts, to stubbornly restore everything to the way they were, as though nothing had happened. This is the Italian miracle that repeats itself from time to time. Many people fought and hoped for this tiring recovery in every field. Many people paid, even with their lives. Recently, many people have fallen in the world of work. Many people have paid with their health. Who could ever forget those of us who have died for peace and solidarity, right up to the latest, innocent, and very young Red Cross volunteer whose generosity was only surpassed by her desire for privacy. What a vocation and what an example. Many people have prayed in Catholic churches, in all the other Christian churches, in synagogues, and in mosques. Many people have hoped, believed, and acted, spurred on only by an invincible and admirable faith in man. The year has ended. Some observations are of comfort. The first is that Italians, we Italians, have a great love for this our homeland, and we are ready to pay the price for its rebirth. The year that is about to end has brought much evidence of this, a great deal of evidence. Furthermore, I want to say it again, the certainty that democracy has largely entered the veins of Italians and has become the life of this our people. Thus it is a strong and conscious guarantee against every possible folly. While the world is still bloodied from wars and crimes, by merchants of death, drugs, and arms, whose only concern is wealth at all costs, the European and international communities have acknowledged our strong will to recover and are increasing faith in our future. A year is beginning that can and must be decisive for our recovery. The whole world is watching us and is expecting composure and wisdom from us in the upcoming general election, so that in each one of our choices, in the differences in the way we think and plan, we can place the good of Italy above all else. The world is watching us because it knows that Italy's presence is before all else essential for peace, for peace in the world, how important its presence is for Europe, which has been and always remains our primary political future, aiming with a strong will at a substantial and efficient political community. Italy's presence is essential for the peoples who, after the winter of the Soviet dictatorship, with their fledgling democracy are moving toward collaboration and their desired participation in the community of the free world. The world is watching us and is confident that Italy's role and responsibility in the Mediterranean and for peace in former Yugoslavia and the Middle East is being carried out. In the last few days, two lights have been lit for the hopes of peace, following a great deal of work: The meeting between Israel and the Palestinians, and the relations between the Vatican and Israel. This is a great page of new life in the history of thousands of years. It is an exceptional testimony to peace, in this church of John Paul II's, to whom our heartfelt thanks go. For this New Year the Italian people want one thing above all else: That a new leaf is turned. This was expressed unequivocally in the April referendum, they want a new leaf to be turned over a past of abuses, illegal behavior in public and economic life, without ever throwing away all that which is vital and essential for the freedom of the Italian people, all that is constructive and has been used from the Liberation to today. We must make sure that we never forget all those who have saved the life and freedom of man in our homeland. The first new page is opening. No one can deny the courage that was involved in the unveiling of the wounds and in the desire for justice and transparency. There must continue to be courage and willpower until this chapter is closed, with the pronouncement of the responsibility of the guilty and of the innocence of those who are found to be without guilt, with the recognition of the delicate and essential work being carried out by the magistrature. Citizens must also rediscover a constant serenity, must not be fearful but must have faith in justice, citizens must be at peace, whether they be accused or injured parties. Justice must be defended from a kind of politics that seems to want to contaminate it or exploit it, it must be defended from those who only grasp its spectacular aspect, and justice must be freed from those who have had -- it hurts to say this -- moments that were not peaceful as a result of the contagious desire for the guillotine or the pillory. As far as justice is concerned, these are two evil manifestations. Justice has the right to be universally respected and believed. We have a great need for calm and serenity, so that political life and economic activity can regain their indispensable efficiency and normal way of working. This goes for all of us. Here is the second important page: The reforms. It is necessary that everything that has been elaborated since the very first parliamentary debates at the bicameral committee of this legislature, rather than being lost contributes to study and experience, so that the new parliament can make our Constitution better able to answer the more pressing needs of our people. We must not lose sight of those ideas that are real and alive, which will not die if those who say that they believe in them, instead of exploiting them, serve them with humility and disinterest. We must put into effect the great humanitarian principles that endure our personal limitations and give us the certainty that many dishonest people will never trample over those who are not dishonest and do not want to be. We must all work to rediscover and restore the richness of ideas, values, and history of our homeland. We will then see the strength and vitality of this immense richness and how it is greater than our poverty and our failings. I place my optimism, my stubborn optimism, in this and only this: It is in the existence of this cultural and spiritual richness, it is in the firm conviction that with everyone's goodwill, and the sacrifices of each one of us, every obstacle will certainly be overcome. Then there is the social page, which is important, of complete importance for a state that is truly fit for man. We need the human issue of work to reduce and cancel the wounds of unemployment and the tremendous fears connected with uncertainties about one's job. It is an issue of civilization and is not an issue that disappears easily, especially when faced with a marked world crisis that is also hitting economically strong countries, and which requires above all, that it is truly believed that the respect of the right to work is the first sign of a people's civilization. Here we must acknowledge that the government and parliament have already made significant efforts. But we are fully aware of the issue, the issue worries us: The issue must not and cannot leave us in peace. When we have done or think that we have truly done all that is possible, let us think: Of course, we can do more if we believe in the rights of man. At this point we come across the always burning issue of youth, school, and a first job. These issues are connected, which means that space must be given to the voice of the young, or rather the young are responsible protagonists. Without including parties, it is easier to stray into speculation or to make it suspected than to give advice and valid help. I have met and spoken to thousands of young people, even while president of the republic, and I am convinced that dialogue is the serious, useful, and valid way. I know that many times it has been held. It is necessary to make young people responsible. It is useless to discuss whether we can trust them to drive a car at 16 if no serious thought is given to their cultural and human formation, which can prepare them for more essential and important responsibilities in life. We ask the young to have faith in ideals and human values, we ask them for the enthusiasm to overcome many problems, we ask them to be generous toward those who are less intellectually gifted, are less physically or materially able. We ask them for solidarity for those who need it and for those who are suffering, and this is right. But we must give young people opportunities to live. We must give them motivation and possibilities to plan their futures. We must never take away their hope. But first and foremost we want to provide young people with our example, which we have lived and paid for, of hard work, honesty, and sacrifice, of faith in essential values. This is our most important duty, of each one of us, mine first and foremost. Once again I want to say: Young people, never surrender, do not think that it is easy to tell you this when we know the difficulties that you must overcome. Never let yourselves be pessimists, even when faced with tiring and unfair situations, do not be pessimists. You educators, have faith that the daily provision of your life to young people will never be lost, never. Happy New Year to young people. Happy New Year to happy children, and above all to those who are not, and perhaps will never be. Happy New Year to the parents that live with them, and happy New Year to all those who sacrifice themselves specially for these unhappy children, without being parents. Happy New Year to old people, to those old people who think that they are a burden and an encumbrance because they do not have anyone able to make themselves rich with their experience. Happy New Year to everyone: To happy families and to ones that are suffering, because the family is the heart of a people's life. Happy New Year to people who are alone in the hope that someone realizes that they are alone, to those in hospital, in prison, to those who watch over the suffering and prisoners, to those who hope for health -- and we hope that it can be recovered quickly, and to those who hope for freedom, because once justice has been suspended the target of freedom is not reachable, it would not be human. Happy New Year to those who feel marginalized, in the hope that they experience the gift and warmth of community. Italy needs solidarity and fraternity, a little more love, but also a great need to know how to give solidarity, fraternity and love, only those who know how to give it are truly capable of human sensitivity. Unfortunately we are faced with a serious evil that is trying to tear and destroy our tissue of human society. It is the terrible climate of suspicion, the climate of insinuation, of making people feel bad, of the evil that is insinuated: The worst problem in the life of a people. This is the typical evil of dictatorships, which should not exist in a free and democratic country because dictatorships have always been made stronger by these evils that divide people of every human faith, dictatorships have depended on fear, not only of the dictator, but the fear that suddenly appears between men and breaks every link and creates the constant anguish of not knowing what will happen tomorrow. There is a great thirst for truth and loyalty, for cleanliness, reciprocal respect, there is a thirst for humanity. The Italian people have a great wealth of this. It is the thirst of a humanity that replaces and sweeps away forever the climate of cohabitation, omerta [Mafia code of silence], lies, craftiness. Let us relieve ourselves of these evils that have caused and will cause much damage to our community. Before ending, let us look for a moment at how many good people there are: Everyone of you will know some of the many people who are satisfied with their lot, who have many difficulties to overcome and face them calmly, without complaining, many sick people -- I know many, many write to me -- ill people without hope who spread hope and even joy, because hope and joy is inside us. It can be helped by events, episodes and meetings outside, but it is inside us. Many people who lack all solidarity are always ready to give it to others. Many people are devoted to this need without anyone ever thanking them. Not many evenings ago I went to speak to a caravan [as heard] where ex-drug addicts spend much of the night near the Rome railway station waiting in case some others suffering from the same evil problem need them. The team's doctor is the only one who is not a former addict. The others think of nothing except the giving of themselves. Many people are devoted in this way: Hidden unknown heroes, of solidarity and love, which is the richest and most human kind of heroism. Unfortunately, we all share this vocation. [sentence as heard] It is the heroism that holds its doors open to each one of us. Each one of us can walk down that path. To the people, and they are many, who this year have been an example to me and my life, to those who have given me a gift of comfort, help, prayers and support, I offer a big heartfelt thank you. Everyone reminds us that we are at a delicate and dangerous crossroads and it is true, but beware, for we are not being asked to do anything, absolutely anything that is exceptional, nothing heroic. Let us not assume heroic tones. We are only being asked to do our duty well, absolutely nothing else. We are not being asked to save our homeland, but to serve our homeland, yes, and with love. If we do this, one day, turning back, we will see that the crossroads has been passed. The important thing is that the whole Italian population passes it on foot, everyone, and that everyone wants to and can walk together. It depends on all of us. It depends on all of us, to walk and help those who cannot, to walk because the whole population must walk. Last year I said that Italy would rise again, and it was a wish from my heart. Now I feel able to say that Italy is rising again: and so, best wishes to Italy.
