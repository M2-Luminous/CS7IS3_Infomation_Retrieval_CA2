The president said at a news conference he held with President Demirel this afternoon that the talks also dealt with various topical issues in the Arab region, in addition to international issues. Commenting on developments in Yemen, President Mubarak affirmed that there is absolutely no plan to send Arab troops to Yemen, noting that he warned the Yemeni president and his vice president before the fighting erupted. He said that the Egyptian Foreign Ministry had previously addressed appeals to the Yemeni parties in this connection. President Mubarak remarked that it is the entire Yemeni people who will suffer from that fighting. Touching on Egyptian-Turkish bilateral issues, Mubarak noted that the joint higher committee involving the two countries will meet in June or July to discuss scopes of cooperation in detail. Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said that his visit to Egypt reaffirms the deep ties that have linked the two countries. He said that Egypt and Turkey are major regional states and that they both seek to bring about peace and stability in the region to serve the people's interests. Demirel added that he congratulated President Mubarak on the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement on autonomy in Gaza and Jericho in Cairo last Wednesday. He remarked that the Egyptian policy in this context is consistently successful. Touching on the economic embargo on Iraq and its impact on Turkey, and whether he had discussed this issue with President Mubarak, Demirel said: The issue was raised during the talks. He pointed out that the international community is not prepared to do anything to lift that embargo at present. President Mubarak opened the news conference with a speech in which he welcomed the Turkish president to Egypt. He said: We made it a habit to meet every once in a while to exchange views on hot issues and those of common interest in the Middle East, as well as other issues like Bosnia-Herzegovina. Mubarak added: We focused in our talks on bilateral relations and discussed many issues in this context. The president noted that a businessmen's delegation will visit Istanbul in June. He also said that they agreed to hold a meeting of the joint Egyptian-Turkish higher committee in June or July to be cochaired by the prime ministers of both countries to discuss bilateral agreements. We consider these agreements very important because we think of Turkey as a major and central regional state and we want to maintain strong and good ties with it, Mubarak said. President Demirel then delivered a speech in which he thanked President Mubarak and said: It is my pleasure to visit Egypt as a guest of my dear brother President Husni Mubarak. I feel I am in my home in this great country because the close ties between Egypt and Turkey are built on foundations of a common cultural and historical heritage. He said those bonds strengthen fraternal relations between the peoples of Egypt and Turkey. He said every high-level visit between the two countries prove the depth of bilateral relations. He said the two countries, which he described as crossroads for several continents, have common political objectives. President Demirel said Egypt and Turkey are trying to achieve economic development while sparing no effort to help bring about peace and stability in their common region. He added: During our talks today, our exchange of viewpoints was fruitful. We reviewed all aspects of bilateral cooperation and stressed during the talks that there is not any difference in our views toward political issues. Demirel went on: We agreed that the relations of economic cooperation between Egypt and Turkey need further efforts and support to match the strong political relations between us. He stressed that stronger cooperation will reflect positively on the peoples of the whole region. He explained that Egypt and Turkey are the biggest countries in the region, and they both feel they are responsible for the region's peace and stability. President Demirel said that he and President Mubarak discussed several regional problems and reviewed the situation in the Balkans and in the Caucasus. The former Soviet Union is being restructured and we are interested in such matters because they affect both Egypt and Turkey. President Demirel said he was pleased with his meeting with President Mubarak. He added: I congratulated President Mubarak on the success of his efforts, which were rewarded by the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement in Cairo. I also told him that he should consider the signing of this agreement his birthday present. The Turkish president expressed hope that the 50-year-old Middle East conflict will come to an end and that a new vista of opportunity will open for Egyptian-Turkish cooperation. He said that the two countries should walk "hand in hand" toward a new horizon of peace and prosperity in the region. The two leaders then fielded questions by journalists. Answering a question on the events in Yemen, President Mubarak said: "I wish to make it clear that we warned the Yemeni president of the implications of the Yemeni crisis, even before the fighting started. I told the Yemenis that their troops are deployed close to each other and that unless they separate them, fighting may break out and will be hard to stop. They did not listen." I sent several appeals to the Yemeni president and the Egyptian Foreign Ministry did the same, Mubarak said. I told Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih: "It would be wise if you separate the troops and try to calm down the situation. You have to sit together and work out your differences. Otherwise, the entire Yemeni people will suffer." President Mubarak added: "Fighting then erupted in Yemen. They are exchanging shells and accusations. They bombarded each other's airports." The Arab League is today meeting at the level of representatives, Mubarak said. He added: I do not think that there are any plans to send Arab forces to Yemen. Newspaper reports to this effect do not match reality. I think that all the Arab League can do is appeal for an end to the fighting and for a peaceful solution that would enable the Yemenis to go on with their lives. The current fighting is a loss for all Yemenis, Mubarak stated. Answering a question on Egyptian-Turkish cooperation, Mubarak said: We have discussed several areas of cooperation, including tourism, but I do not wish to go into detail. The Higher Egyptian-Turkish Committee, which is cochaired by the two prime ministers, will discuss various aspects of cooperation, such as joint projects and banking agreements. Mubarak pointed out that his talks with Demirel touched on trade, friendship agreements, and the formation of a committee on tourism. A journalist asked Mubarak if there had been progress concerning the proposal Mubarak made during his visit to Turkey in February concerning Egyptian-Turkish-Saudi cooperation. Mubarak answered by saying: Let us begin with Egyptian-Turkish cooperation. If another country wishes to join us, it is up to that country to make its wishes known. Asked whether Turkey can play a role in the Middle East peace process, President Mubarak said: I would not specify precisely this role. However, I can frankly say that Turkey is a strong state in the region and so is Egypt. Turkey is a very important state in the Middle East. Asked whether he had discussed with the Turkish president regional cooperation in fighting terrorism, President Mubarak said: We discussed this topic. The two countries' foreign ministers will discuss the kind of cooperation that can exist between the two countries in this domain, in addition to discussing the possibility of other countries joining this cooperation. We will do this quietly in the beginning to see what this cooperation will produce. Asked whether he discussed with President Mubarak the economic embargo imposed on Iraq and its effect on Turkey, President Demirel said: We discussed this topic but did not go into detail. As you know, the international community and the alliance (formed during the Gulf War) are very sensitive about the Gulf war and Iraq's stand. In my personal opinion, it is [not further identified] against these sanctions. However, the international community is not prepared to do anything in this respect. Demirel said: The sanctions have harmed the Iraqi people, not just the Iraqi president. Asked about his concept of cooperation between Egypt and Turkey to confront terrorism in the region, Demirel said: Cooperation between Egypt and Turkey is excellent and there are no problems. What we discussed today and what we will discuss in the future will be beneficial for the Egyptian and Turkish peoples. Commenting on Demirel's remarks, President Mubarak said: We are anxious to have good cooperation between Egypt and Turkey in all domains.
