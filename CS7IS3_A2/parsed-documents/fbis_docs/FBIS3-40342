(Rudower Chaussee 5, 12489 Berlin) has developed a hot gas filter to be used for desulfurization of coal gas. The filter can be used in future combination power plants. It consists of a ceramic filter coated with zinc oxide on a foundation of polyurethane sponges. In order to produce the filter, the synthetic sponges are soaked in a clay suspension and fired at temperatures of up to 1,200 degrees Celsius. In so doing the synthetic burns up completely and leaves behind a ceramic matrix with a structure similar to the sponge. The ceramic is then dipped in a zinc-oxide-clay suspension and again fired. In this way an active zinc-oxide coating is formed, which is responsible for the desulfurization process. The thickness of the layer is between 40 and 400 microns. The hydrogen sulfide in the coal gas reacts with the zinc oxide to form zinc sulfide and water. The filter can be used with a gas temperature of up to 1,000 degrees Celsius. At higher temperatures the pore structure is destroyed. The thicker the zinc-oxide coating of the filter and the pressure of the coal gas, the greater is also the conversion rate of the hydrogen sulfide. During the conversion process, the pore volume of the filter decreases. In so doing, carbon deposits and small zinc sulfide balls form in the filter matrix. After it has done its job, the filter can be regenerated by adding air. In the exothermal regeneration reactions the deposited carbon is burned and the zinc sulfide converted to zinc sulfate. The latter again decomposes at higher temperatures into zinc oxide and sulfur trioxide. During the regeneration, the temperatures in the filter increase more the more carbon and zinc sulfide it contains. Since during this process it is possible to reach local temperatures of more than 1,000 degrees Celsius, the filter should be monitored and regenerated gently. It works best at a desulfurization temperature of 560 degrees Celsius and a pressure of between one and 19 bar. Conventional gas purification in a wet-chemical process normally takes place at temperatures up to 175 degrees Celsius. But the higher the temperature of the coal gas can be for the cleaning, the greater is the overall effect of the combined power plant. Hot gas purification at temperatures above 300 degrees generally results in an increase in efficiency of up to four percent.
