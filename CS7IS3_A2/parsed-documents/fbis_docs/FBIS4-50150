Taiwan will also hold bilateral tariff talks with a number of nations while in Geneva, including Canada, which is expected to ask Taiwan to cut tariffs on more than 800 items. Director-General Huang Yen-chao will represent Taiwan during the talks with Canada. Delegation members will hold talks with the European Union and Switzerland on May 17 and May 19 respectively, and Taiwan is expected to meet with representatives from Colombia, Mexico, and Korea on May 20. The delegation will also exchange views with South Africa, Chile, and Australia during the three days of meetings. So far, Taiwan has held tariff reduction negotiations with the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Turkey, South Africa, Hungary, The Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, and Japan. Bilateral tariff talks with GATT contracting parties are considered vital to Taiwan's smooth entry into the Geneva-based world trade regulating body. Taiwan was accepted as a GATT observer in September 1992 and is expected to become a full member by the end of this year.
