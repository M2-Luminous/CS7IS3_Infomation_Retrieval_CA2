After that, it must be silent. You have changed the party into a chancellor's election club, even though you are not yet chancellor. [Scharping] The SPD will always be a party that takes pleasure in discussion and is open to reform. It will never be a chancellor's election club. But the government program will be adopted in June. If anyone then has a different opinion it is clear that such an opinion will not be shared by the SPD. It is comparable to soccer. In training, a misplaced pass is tolerable, but in a match, it may lead to defeat. [FOCUS] You are speaking from experience. The tax debate in March was a classical misplaced pass. [Scharping] We must concentrate all our instruments to fight unemployment and reach the goal of social justice. We want economic recovery, which is why the tax quota will not be increased. Kohl and Waigel have imposed unprecedented burdens on the citizens. Now everyone knows that the SPD will abolish the solidarity surcharge on all incomes, because the Federal Government has imposed it on every taxpayer. The SPD wants a tax-free subsistence minimum, a considerably improved family allowance, and merely a surcharge for less than 20 percent at the upper end of the income spiral. The limit will be 120,000 German marks [DM] for married people and 60,000 for singles. This makes more sense economically, because it eases the lower- and medium-income groups of tax burdens. Such a measure will have a favorable effect on the economic cycle. [FOCUS] Such a measure would hit the elites that you need for economic recovery. [Scharping] My understanding of elites has nothing to do with incomes or the search for personal advantages. Otherwise, you would also have to consider Zwick and Schneider [two corrupt entrepreneurs] as forming part of the elite. [FOCUS] You are creating an envy barrier. [Scharping] Do you have any other prejudices in store? [FOCUS] After all, the upper half of the taxpayers finance 90 percent of the total income tax. [Scharping] That is a misleading figure. [FOCUS] It was calculated by officials in the Federal Finance Ministry. [Scharping] It only makes sense to put the tax revenue in proportion to the total sum of incomes. [FOCUS] Acrobatics with figures. Every average calculation is inaccurate. [Scharping] Now you are criticizing your own questions. Under the Bonn coalition, those who pay DM2,000 in taxes will in the future have to pay DM2,150. The SPD thinks that it should be DM50 more, which would be reasonable for such high incomes. [FOCUS] You want the middle class to pay according to the motto that those who do not have much should get something from those who have a bit more. As usual, it is hard to get at the highest income groups. Stars, top sportsmen, serious entrepreneurs move to tax oases abroad. Zwick and Schneider disappear. Skilled workers and engineers stay and pay. [Scharping] I do not take part in discussions on the superrich. Zwick and Schneider are cases for the public prosecutor; they can hardly be used as examples in your comparison. The SPD wants everyone to help finance German unity in accordance with their financial capacity. By the way, this is also in line with our constitution. That is the point. The situation now is this: Workers and employees, small and medium-sized enterprises, and employment-intensive firms have had to pay an excessively high share through ancillary wage costs. The SPD certainly is not the only one to state that higher income earners can make a slightly higher contribution. A real upswing requires economic activity at home and companies that invest. We want to ease them of some of their burdens. People like [Employers' Federation President] Murmann and [German Industry Federation President] Tyll Necker share these ideas. I do not think we can impute social envy to them. [FOCUS] For how long would the surcharge planned by the SPD have to be paid? [Scharping] The SPD does not want to increase the tax quota but is seeking just distribution! As a result of the wrong way of financing German unity, the Kohl government has accumulated an incredible debt mountain. There is still no end in sight to the necessary annual transfer of approximately DM16 billion to eastern Germany. As long as there is such a high financial requirement, no responsible finance politician can abolish such a surcharge. To stimulate growth and employment it is much more important to lower the ancillary wage costs. With clear economic growth, we can reduce the state quota over the medium term. [FOCUS] Let us discuss the misplaced passes again. Your comrades in Kiel are calling for a speed limit, a property tax, an energy tax.... [Scharping] We cannot invite the party members to take part in the discussion and then complain about their statements, including proposals that do not get a majority. I am opposed to symbolism in politics. [FOCUS] Why do you reject a speed limit? [Scharping] There are better ideas than to impose bans. Remote data processing would be an idea. We must differentiate in terms of traffic and the environment. [FOCUS] There are many road signs imposing bans in Rhineland-Palatinate. [Scharping] If you have come by highway A61 you will certainly have seen that we are changing this. [FOCUS] No. We think ecologically and have come by train. [Scharping] That is commendable, but you really missed something. On that highway you can study the advantages of a differentiated approach. We have limited the speed on four-track highways, but there is virtually no speed limit on six-track highways. Following the introduction of the ban on passing for trucks, accidents have drastically decreased. [FOCUS] What are you going to do with the speed limit? Will or will it not be introduced? [Scharping] The speed will be limited but in a differentiated way. We are seeking European harmonization, which must include options allowing us to consider traffic and environmental conditions. [FOCUS] Why are you opposed to a general speed limit? [Scharping] We must create a reliable framework for the economic sector, including the automobile industry. We want environment-considerate growth. In Japan, "ecolution," a combination of evolution and ecology, is being pushed. In the United States, the state and the automobile sector are jointly seeking a "clean car." However, in Germany, we waited very long before we introduced the catalytic converter. An ecological car is above all a technical challenge. [FOCUS] The banks are an important economic factor. They played a disastrous role in the Schneider bankruptcy. How can this be prevented in the future? [Scharping] The Schneider bankruptcy is going at the expense of many small- and medium-sized enterprises and at the taxpayers' expense. The Schneider case has led to an intensive debate on the necessary extent of the supervision of banks. This issue has for months been intensively discussed in a different context between the Bundesbank and commercial banks. The banks should do everything to prevent damage to craftsmen at their cost. The decision whether every bank should do so separately, or whether they should create a common, adequate emergency fund, should be left to the banks. In any case, they must help the people concerned. After all, the reputation of German banks is at stake. [FOCUS] This is only an appeal. Do you also intend to regulate it by law? [Scharping] There has been a discussion for years on the concentration of economic power with the banks -- and thus also on the concentration of risks. However, before we call for laws we must know whether current provisions have been violated or whether the laws are really inadequate. If there are gaps or deficiencies in the current laws, our legislative bodies are called upon to act. I think that in such a case, we should do what is necessary.
