The aim of the delegation's visit to Georgia was to choose agricultural and industrial products in exchange for Georgia's still unpaid debt. The Turkmen side once again showed its full understanding of the current complex economic situation in the republic, which was reflected in the fact that Georgia will supply Turkmenistan with Georgian products in exchange for 3 billion cubic meters of gas worth several million U.S. dollars, as envisaged in the bilateral agreement signed in 1994. Meanwhile, our Turkmen friends accepted the prices suggested by us. The head of state thanked the Turkmen side for their fruitful cooperation and understanding of our problems. Shevardnadze said: Our republic's population knows very well about your realistic support, and we will do everything to carry out our responsibilities. At the meeting, Shevardnadze raised the issue of the importance of finding new and economically useful ways to transport Turkmen gas to Georgia and other countries. Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia, Deputy Prime Minister Zurab Kervalishvili, and other officials were present at the meeting.
