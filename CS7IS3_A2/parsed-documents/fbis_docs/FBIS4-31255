The increasing resistance to fundamentalist policy and demands of the 5th Corps for offensive actions are causing a mutual settling of scores between individual armed groups. It has been learned that the greatest number of clashes, killings, and the burning and destruction of houses is being directed against progressive Muslims, who are advocating a cease-fire with [self-proclaimed leader of autonomous province of western Bosnia] Fikret Abdic. Well-informed sources have learned that in Bihac there is real chaos. Anarchy and criminals are everywhere, and war profiteers are taking up key positions of authority. Refugees from Prijedor, Novi, and Krupa are refusing to take further part in the fighting because their commanders are pushing them to take up the hottest positions, while locals are engaged on secondary tasks or are exempt from military service. In keeping with orders from Sarajevo, the command of the Fifth Corps is preparing an offensive against Serbian-held areas. As a result, the inhabitants of the villages of Sturlic, Nisici, and Hale have already been evacuated. However, problems in connection with certain tasks have caused clashes within the command of the 5th Corps, and as a result several officers have been dismissed. All these problems and clashes are continuing with undiminished intensity and are causing a very difficult and uncertain situation in the Cazin region.
