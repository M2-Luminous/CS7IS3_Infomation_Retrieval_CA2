Addressing the Second Session of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) that closed here today, Li said developing socialist democracy is an important part of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. It is also a common task for the Communist Party of China (CPC) and various democratic parties, and constitutes a prerequisite for stepping up China's economic construction and restructuring, said Li, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee. "Without democracy, it would be impossible to fully arouse people's initiative or realize broad-based unity; and without democracy, there would be neither socialism nor socialist modernization," he said. Li, who is also a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, noted that as democracy is historical, specific and relative, it will be certainly subject to restraints by economic, political and economic factors in society. Therefore, progress in democracy cannot deviate from the reality or transcend historical stages, he added. Seeking democracy by neglecting specific conditions will not only make it impossible to achieve the objective of developing democracy, but also produce adverse effects on economic growth and social stability, he said. According to Li Ruihuan, China is currently deepening reforms and establishing a socialist market economic structure, while the people are steadily improving their cultural standards and enhancing their sense of becoming involved and competition concepts. All this has made it possible to promote progress in democracy, he noted. He said that studying the development of modern Chinese democratic politics must proceed from conditions in China, be based on the reality of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and be guided by the fundamental tenets of Marxism. The fundamental task of socialism is to liberate and develop productive forces. "This point of view influences and decides many aspects in China, including the development of democratic politics," he said. The essence of socialist democracy is to let people be masters of their country. Therefore, positive and steady development of socialist democratic politics must always adhere to the principle of doing everything for the people and always depending on the people, he added. It is necessary to observe people's feelings carefully, learn their wishes timely, and do real things for them unswervingly. "We should be good at pooling people's wisdom, fully respect their initiatives and voluntarily accept their supervision. We should cultivate a democratic style of work, boost the sense of democracy, create and accumulate the experience of developing democratic politics through close links with the people," he said. Li Ruihuan called for combining development of democracy with that of a legal system. It is necessary to legalize and systemize practices and experiences which are recognized by the public as having universal significance and which reflect the principle of people being masters of the country. It is necessary to establish a sound legal system so that systems and laws will not change with a change of leadership or with a change of the views and attention of leaders, he said. It is necessary to maintain the authority of laws, help people better protect their rights and interests according to law, stop and punish any deeds that infringe upon people's democratic rights, and ensure that people enjoy all their democratic rights, he said. Li said that the National People's Congress system and the Communist Party-led multi-party cooperation and political consultation system are the main forms of China's socialist democracy, which must be adhered to and improved. At the same time, various democratic forms must be established and improved at the grassroots level to enable people to play their role as masters of the country in grassroots-level social and political life. In short, Li summarized, "Based on national conditions, we must absorb and borrow all achievements of human civilization and make every effort to develop a socialist democracy with Chinese characteristics, which carries forward our fine traditions, has features of the times, reflects the basic tenets of socialism and meets the requirements of a socialist market economy."
