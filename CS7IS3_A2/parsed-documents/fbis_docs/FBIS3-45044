The base is located in the Great Badain Jaran Desert. More than 60 grass-roots units are scattered along the 22 small settlements in the 4,870 square km desert. People call the base "the isolated islet" because of its extremely difficult living conditions. [passage omitted on efforts to improve the living conditions] More than 500 college graduates have been assigned to the base in recent years. Some 85 percent of them have become professional technical backbone elements, over 90 percent have performed meritorious service, and nearly 100 of them have been rated as outstanding intellectuals or outstanding scientific and technological cadres. In scientific research and experiment, the base has set the highest records in the number of guided missiles launched on a single day, in a single month, and in a single year. It is also the first base in China to successfully complete a multi-targeting, minimum-altitude missile launching. It accomplished more than 100 scientific research and experimental tasks with flying colors. Six of the scientific research projects filled in the gaps in China's scientific and technological field, and dozens of research results received state or military science and technology progress awards.
