Silvian Becker, section head of BfV Department 6 (international terrorism), died in a military hospital in Tripoli the week before last. At the time of going to press, details of the circumstances, including the death of his wife, were still unknown to German officials; the bodies had not yet been released by Libya. Becker had told the BfV in Cologne that he was going to Egypt for a vacation. A passenger car, which had obviously been used by the couple, was found undamaged in Tripoli. There is a basic ban on travel to Libya for all BfV employees. The BfV is wondering whether the tourists were kidnapped or enticed away from Egypt. Relatives claim that the Beckers went to Libya through Tunisia. The official was highly valued as an expert on the Middle East and northern Africa. His colleagues describe him as a "prudent man, and not an adventurous type." A double agent? "Very unlikely, if you knew him," it is said in Cologne.
