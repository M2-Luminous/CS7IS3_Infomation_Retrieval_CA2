FR940902-0-00022 FR940902-0-00009 40 CFR Part 799 [OPPTS&hyph;42111D; FRL 4047&hyph;2] Office of Water Chemicals, Final Test Rule; Clarification AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Clarification of final rule. SUMMARY: On November 10, 1993, EPA published a TSCA section 4 final test rule requiring testing of 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (TMB) (CAS No. 108&hyph;67&hyph;8). After EPA published the final rule, certain manufacturers questioned the scope of the manufacturers, importers, and processors subject to the test rule. EPA is now clarifying that only manufacturers, importers, and processors of TMB as an isolated product, and not persons who manufacture, import, or process the substance as part of complex mixtures or substances, are subject to the final test rule requiring certain health effects testing. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 2, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan B. Hazen, Director, Environmental Assistance Division (7408), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Rm. E&hyph;543B, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, (202) 554&hyph;1404, TDD: (202) 544&hyph;0551. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On November 10, 1993, EPA issued a final rule requiring manufacturers and processors of TMB to conduct oral 14&hyph;day repeated dose and oral 90&hyph;day subchronic toxicity studies on TMB (58 FR 59667). In the preamble to the final rule, EPA responded to a comment from a manufacturer concerned that the proposed testing program for TMB would cause substantial economic impact for its company that would likely force it to discontinue sales of this chemical in the United States. EPA stated in response that the impact will be less than originally noted in the proposal because the cost of the testing program required by the final rule is less than the testing program proposed originally. In addition, EPA noted that it believed that the commenter would not be the only company required to test because there are other manufacturers that might be subject to the test rule, including ``several manufacturers of C9 aromatic hydrocarbons, which contain 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene.'' Manufacturers of the C9 aromatic hydrocarbons, petroleum refiners, challenged EPA's final rule arguing that they had received inadequate notice that they might be subject to the test rule. After reviewing the record, EPA agrees that there is some question whether these manufacturers received sufficient notice that they would be subject to the test rule. As a result, EPA is issuing this Notice to clarify that only manufacturers, importers, and processors of TMB as an isolated product, and not persons who manufacture, import, or process the substance as part of complex mixtures or substances, are subject to the final test rule requiring certain health effects testing. This then leaves open the issue of whether the testing requirements would, if fulfilled, cause the original commenter to suffer a substantial economic impact. EPA has revisited this issue with the commenter and has been advised that this issue is no longer of concern because the company has received voluntary contributions to cover some of the testing costs (May 3, 1994 letter from Koch Industries to EPA). EPA believes that public comment on this clarification is unnecessary because: (1) Nothing in the actual regulation is being changed and this merely aids in interpretation of the regulation; and (2) to the extent that confusion has mistakenly led some persons to believe that they are subject to the regulation, this provides relief from that perceived requirement. In summary, for persons who manufacture, import, and process TMB as an isolated product, the test rule is valid and applicable to them. EPA is now clarifying that persons, including relevant petroleum refiners, who do not manufacture, import, or process TMB as an isolated product are not required to submit test data, letters of intent to test, applications for exemptions, import certifications, or any other item that may be required pursuant to a final test rule under TSCA section 4. Additionally, only exporters of TMB as an isolated product or as part of mixtures known to contain previously isolated TMB are subject to the TSCA section 12(b) export notification requirements (40 CFR part 707). A public docket has been established for this clarification (OPPTS&hyph;42111D). This docket consists of support material for the clarification.
