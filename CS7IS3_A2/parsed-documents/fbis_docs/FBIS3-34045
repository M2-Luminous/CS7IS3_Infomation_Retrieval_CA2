We are in a process of negotiations with the PLO, the Palestinians, about the Gaza-Jericho First; first phase, to put it into a test, to see what can be done. But, in this agreement, we achieved the following: One, during the period of the interim arrangements, Jerusalem remains united. We did not succeed to achieve it in Camp David. [applause] Second, to remain in all the settlements. And, believe me, to my humble opinion, many of them have no justification whatsoever. They don't contribute whatsoever to Israel's security. Not all of them, a considerable number of them. Today, the way that they were established creates a problem to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and the security forces to protect the lives of the settlers, because they were not settled in a way to protect the life of those who live there. Gush Qatif, yes; many others, no. I believe that in 1994 we'll see a year in which decisions -- and major decisions -- will have to be made. It's a year which I believe will serve as a crossroads in which direction developments in the Middle East, especially in the context of the Arab-Israeli conflict, will go: towards peace or towards stalemate, and whatever stalemates have created in the past in the region.
