Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, member of the PLO Executive Committee, said that the renewed U.S. commitment to achieving a comprehensive and just solution will help the entire peace process. In a statement to our radio, 'Abd-Rabbuh expressed the PLO's leadership appreciation for the stand reiterated by President Hafiz al-Asad in his talks in Geneva yesterday with regard to linking normalization with Israel with a comprehensive solution on all fronts. The Palestinian official expected the talks between Syria and Lebanon on one hand and Israeli on the other to enter a serious phase. He expressed hope that these talks will witness real progress. He said that, at the same time, he believes that the difficulties facing all parties call for reactivating the comprehensive coordination among all Arab countries or among the five cordon states. Thus, in the absence of an official PLO stance, Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, head of the PLO Information Department, who was optimistic on the eve of the Geneva summit today believes that the results of this summit were not disappointing.
