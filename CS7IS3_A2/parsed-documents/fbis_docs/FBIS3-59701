Inc.] [Text] The Kansai Electric Power achieved significant results as a leader in the development of phosphoric acid ``first generation'' fuel cells. We are now making excellent progress in the research and development of molten carbonate ``second generation'' fuel cells. Developing a 100kW class stack, the largest of its type in the world, is one of the results of our current program. Molten carbonate fuel cells have not only the same attractive features as phosphorous acid fuel cells, but also other advantages which are high generating efficiencies, low cost from not using platinum catalysts at all and the availability of coal gas. Fuel cells produce hydrogen in their reformer from fuels such as natural gas. Internal reforming is accomplished by fuel cells that contain this reformer within the main body of the fuel cell. The two types of these fuel cells are the direct and indirect types; they are distinguished by how their reformer catalysts are filled. In the indirect type, since the reformer is isolated from the electrode within the fuel cell, deterioration of the reformer catalyst caused by the electrolyte can be prevented. This type of fuel cell also features high efficiency because it utilizes heat from the cell reaction. We anticipate that indirect-type internal reforming fuel cells will yield high generating efficiency, feature a long service life, and be feasible for near-term commercial installations. For these reasons we, jointly with Mitsubishi Electric, have been proceeding in earnest with their development. We began in 1988 by developing a 3kW class stack. By 1992 we had developed 10kW class, 30kW class, and 100kW class stacks. Operating them for over 2,000 hours yielded promising results, including favorable basic characteristics and low deterioration rates. While developing these stacks, we also developed a CO<inf> 2</inf> recycling system in which PSA (Pressure Swing Adsorption) equipment is used to extract CO<inf> 2</inf> from exhaust gas of the anode and recycle CO<inf> 2</inf> to the cathode. Each of these technologies was developed with the intention of future commercial application. Based on what we have learned, we expect to achieve generating efficiencies of 60% for about 50MW class, and 50% for small scale 1MW class internal reforming molten carbonate fuel cells plants. We now intend to verify our expectations regarding generating efficiencies and other basic characteristics by developing and operating a small-size plant. After doing so, our next step will be to develop a high-efficiency MW class plant. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.
