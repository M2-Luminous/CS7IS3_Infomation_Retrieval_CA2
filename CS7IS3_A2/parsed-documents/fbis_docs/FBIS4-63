Doonan and C. Govender] [Text] Durban March 31 SAPA -- Natal African National Congress leaders on Thursday [31 March] welcomed the announcement of a state of emergency in Natal/kwaZulu provided it was aimed at establishing a climate for free and fair elections. The emergency was announced as political violence continued to rage in Natal with an unprecedented toll of close to 300 expected for March. African National Congress Midlands leader Harry Gwala said while his organisation was opposed to an emergency "for obvious reasons", it appeared the current declaration was aimed at establishing a climate for free and fair elections. "We're hoping the security forces will deal with those elements bent on destabilising the election and not turn it (the emergency) on victims of this violence," he said. Mr Gwala said he further hoped the security forces would liaise and co-operate with "organisations and communities affected". He rejected Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi's contention that deploying troops in kwaZulu would be perceived as an invasion. "KwaZulu is not separate from South Africa, it's an integral part. There's no such thing as an invasion at all." Northern Natal ANC Secretary Senzo Mchunu said his region hoped the emergency would mean deployment of the SA Defence Force and SA Police in areas of violence in the province. He lashed out at the IFP's rejection of the emergency, charging the party was "not genuine or serious" about the loss of life in the territory. "No person in Natal could say they don't want an added security presence here in the light of the violence. What is at stake is the lives of the people. The state of emergency will bring policing closer to the people," he said. Southern Natal ANC secretary S'bu Ndebele said the kwaZulu Police had not fulfilled its duty of maintaining law and order. "Chief Buthelezi's refusal to discharge his task as chief minister and minister of law and order leaves very little alternative. "We do welcome the move. The ANC wants action on the state of anarchy that now prevails here, where people can go on the rampage and no-one is willing or able to?stop them." A statement from the ANC's southern Natal Media Officer Dumisani Makhaye said all democratic forces should ensure the emergency was not used to "trample on the rights of people". "The state of emergency must ensure free campaigning for or against the elections and peaceful demonstrations. It must be meant to protect free political activity for all organisations and parties and to stop the carnage. No rational person can be against this. "The state of emergency must take all necessary measures to prevent those forces that are bent on causing violence against the people. "The Transitional Executive Council, Independent Electoral Commission and the South African Government must jointly administer its implementation."
