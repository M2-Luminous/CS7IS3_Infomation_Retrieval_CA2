[Al-Tarifi] In my opinion, diplomatic relations reached a very advanced stage. Yesterday, we concluded our discussion of the issue of agreement on the lands of both state and absentees. God willing, we will reach agreement on the issue of communications today. Two subjects, that is, organization and planning, and water, will be discussed next week. There is also the subject of jurisdictions, which is now being discussed in Paris as it is linked to the economic committee there. [Mu'addi] Regarding the subject of visas, land registration, and water resources, has an understanding or agreement been reached on these topics? [Al-Tarifi] Regarding visas, yes there is an agreement. The subject of water resources will be discussed next week, God willing. [Mu'addi] Can we then say that next week will witness the end of negotiations within the framework of the Civilian Affairs Committee and that powers can be transferred to the Palestinians? [Al-Tarifi] I hope so, God willing. [Mu'addi] Has the Palestinian side made preparations and formed special cadres to take civil authority over from the civil administration? [Al-Tarifi] In my opinion, and you know this, brother Sa'id, all present departments are currently run by Palestinians. Very few Israeli officials are present. We have qualified Palestinian cadres and we can assume power immediately.
