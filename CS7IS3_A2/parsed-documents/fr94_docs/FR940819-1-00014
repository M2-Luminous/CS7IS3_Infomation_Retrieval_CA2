The address for all the above-listed persons is: Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410. (The telephone numbers are not toll-free.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Department is announcing a revised date for the Technology Demonstration described in its proposed rule (59 FR 37360, July 21, 1994). The Department is also extending the deadline for submission of comments on the proposed rule to Friday, September 30, 1994, to allow commenters additional time to incorporate into their comments any views they have developed as a result of the Technology Demonstration. In addition, the Department is announcing the availability of an electronic conference as another tool for interested persons to exchange information and ideas on the computer loan origination (CLO) aspects of the proposed rule. The electronic conference will be for discussion only; comments must still be in writing and submitted as described above under the heading addresses in order to be considered by the Department during the development of the final rule. This on-line conference will run 24 hours per day from August 19, 1994, to September 30, 1994, and will provide industry and individual users who access the conference an opportunity to discuss and debate with one another the CLO aspects of the proposed rule through a computer network. The conference is called CLOnet and can be accessed by calling Metasystems Design Group, Inc. (MDG), in Arlington, Virginia, telephone (703) 243&hyph;6622. There is a monthly charge of $20, after which connect time is unlimited and free (other than long-distance charges). A personal computer (PC), modem, and communications software are required to access the conference. The Department is using this opportunity as a trial for supplementing its existing FHAnet with the subject-specific CLOnet. Both conferences can provide an excellent interactive method for the public to ``meet'' on and discuss relevant matters. Because the purpose of the current CLOnet is to provide an electronic medium for discussion of the effect of the proposed rule on CLOs and consumers, any HUD employee who chooses to participate in the discussion may do so only in his or her individual capacity and not in any official capacity as a representative of the Department. Authority: 12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq. ; 42 U.S.C. 3535(d). Dated: August 16, 1994. Nicolas P. Retsinas, Assistant Secretary for Housing_Federal Housing Commissioner.
