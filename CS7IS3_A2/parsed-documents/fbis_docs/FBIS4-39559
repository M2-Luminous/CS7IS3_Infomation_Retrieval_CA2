German Specialists Say His Health Is Excellent"] [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] According to the DPA agency, "seven specialists have examined Chernomyrdin but made no diagnosis. According to chief urologist Professor Rudolf Gogenfellner, Chernomyrdin's health condition is excellent." The question arises: Is Chernomyrdin's unexpected trip to Germany a way of "setting the stage" for his resignation "for health reasons"? It is noteworthy that, according to a source in the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry, people from the entourage of First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets, who are currently staying with him in Malaysia, indicated that their "chief" might soon become prime minister. Oleg Soskovets, who did not rule out such a possibility, seems to be further distancing himself from his boss. Another likely candidate for the post of head of government -- Commodity Producers Federation Chairman Yuriy Skokov -- is behaving amazingly calmly in this situation. According to a source in the federation apparatus, the federation is working in a normal mode.
