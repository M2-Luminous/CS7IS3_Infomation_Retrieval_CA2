In order to bring the workforce into conformity with production volumes, we have to lay off approximately 37,000 people. To this we must add 30,000 retirees who are condemned to live in the Norilsk industrial zone because they don't have enough money to move back to the "mainland." As a result of the Gaydar reform, the money they had saved for retirement or for a rainy day became worthless overnight. After all, the cost of living in the North is much higher than in the country's central regions. They have all become hostages to the North. Anatoliy Gluskin, member of the combine's council of labor collectives: The Norilsk Nickel Concern, of which our combine is a part, the Krasnoyarsk Nonferrous Metals Plant, and two enterprises on the Kola Peninsula were once known as the flagship of the ferrous metals industry. There is no other combine in Russia like it. We accounted for up to 90 percent of all nickel and cobalt, 30 percent of all copper, and 50 percent of world extraction of platinum and platinoids. But now the question of the Norilsk Combine's very survival has arisen. The combine was always extremely profitable. Our profit margin was triple that of the gold-mining industry. We export 100,000 tonnes of nickel. But the problem is that 40 percent of our exports are intercepted by Moscow. Precious metals are also a total state monopoly. That's hundreds of millions of dollars more. At the same time, we experience constant delays in getting paid. And the banks are imposing more and more penalties for late payments. People came to Norilsk to earn money. A man, a heart patient, comes up to me and says that the doctor has ordered him to return to the "mainland" immediately. Otherwise he won't survive. He had 23,000 rubles in his savings account. Three years ago, he could have bought himself an apartment and a car. Today that money isn't even enough to buy a ticket to Moscow. We are like voluntary prisoners. Boris Degtyarev, chairman of the Norilsk Design Institute's trade union: We been making the rounds of government offices in Moscow for a week now. We tell officials that the North is a big place, with 11 million people. There are dozens and hundreds of enterprises there. But there are only a handful like the Norilsk Combine. We tell them that in order for the law on the North to be effective, there has to be a system of priorities as to who should be helped first. If necessary, production has to be cut back. Some of the people who lose their jobs have to have a guaranteed opportunity to move to inhabited areas. What are the region's other unique characteristics? The Ukrainian diaspora alone accounts for 15 percent of the total population. These people became unwanted overnight. How can a person return today to Ukraine or Kazakhstan, for example? Every republic has its own laws. An intergovernmental agreement is needed here. These people worked for Russia too, and so Russia must play a part in providing their pensions. That's one thing. Second, there has to be strict implementation of the government decrees that have been adopted. The government recently issued a decree that seems pretty good at first glance--"On Appropriating Interest-Free Subsidies for Housing Construction." But again, government officials, without consulting Northerners but sitting in their offices in Moscow with no knowledge of our unique situation, wrote that you can obtain the subsidies only by quitting your job in the North and moving to the place where you intend to live. That's laughable. Who is going to give you a loan in a region that is itself eking out a semi-impoverished existence? Gennadiy Bondarenko, chairman of the Metallurgists Trade Union: When the collective sent us to Moscow, people hoped that we would be able to air our problems at the state level. We were able to see Shakhray only on the sixth day. He heard us out attentively and then turned us over to his aides. They, in turn, sent us to the State Duma, and there we were told to see the regional deputies faction. And that's all we've been able to do so far. Aleksandr Danilov, chairman of the Oktyabr Mine council of labor collectives: Today's difficulties are the result of old mistakes. The basic cause is that the social infrastructure is too big. Some 263,000 workers and office employees live in the Norilsk industrial region. Of them, 126,000 are employed by the Norilsk Combine. Of those 126,000 employees, 45,000 are our basic work force--the miners and metallurgists. So it turns out that 137,000 are people whose salaries are paid from the budget. They even outnumber the combine's employees. The combine cannot support such a large number of people, if only because production volumes are certain to drop. Fifty percent of everything that is shipped into the territory is paid for with hard currency and proceeds from the sale of metal produced by the combine. Most of our output is sold by the state. We are permitted to sell our products only within the country. We were among the first 10 of the second 100 enterprises that acquired licenses to sell their own output. In conclusion, it can be said that there is no effective state program to develop the Norilsk industrial zone.
