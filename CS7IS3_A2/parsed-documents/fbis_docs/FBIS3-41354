They also seized 40 kg of cannabis resin or treated kif. Drug enforcement agents patroling between the Akid Lotfi border control point and the town of Maghnia apprehended a certain "B.B.," age 27, unemployed, as he was coming from the border in a Peugeot 404. In the trunk of the car they found 160 250-gram wafers of kif divided into four parcels--a total of 40 kg coming from Morocco. The Moroccan supplier, a certain "B.M.," 24, unemployed, who entered Algeria the same day at the Akid Lotfi border checkpoint on a valid passport, was arrested by elements of the regional service. According to the same source, this person filled orders for drugs in the Moroccan town of Ketama and delivered them to Oujda. From there, a Moroccan border runner who lives near the border smuggled the kif into Algeria via a circuitous route, deliving it to a certain "D.A.," 47, unemployed, in the socialist village of Akid Lotfi. Other members of the drug ring had set up a rendezvous for the following day at the town of Akid Lotfi to conclude their transaction, which according to police involved at least 20 kg of kif, according to officials in charge of the investigation. The second Algerian buyer was identified, and police were checking into his background and whereabouts. We would note finally that the border runner charged 1,500 Algerian dinars per kilogram for his services. The drug itself cost 18,500 dinars and sells for 30,000 dinars (wholesale) in Algeria.
