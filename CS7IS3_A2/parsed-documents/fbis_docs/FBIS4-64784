What can we expect from an SPD government? [Lafontaine] Everything is clear for us now: There will be no tax increases with the SPD! This has been settled. On the contrary: We will lower the tax burden for average earners. Solar pfennig or taxes on childless couples -- no such things will take place with Rudolf Scharping and me. I am, however, calling upon [Finance Minister] Theo Waigel: Stop the Omerta! The Sicilian law of silence must no longer be applied to the planned tax increases by the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union and the Free Democratic Party of Germany. [Koch] What are the coalition's plans on tax increases? [Lafontaine] There is increasing evidence that the Federal Government is planning a whole package of tax increases following the Bundestag elections. The government coalition has prepared specific plans for increasing the value-added tax, property tax, and the mineral oil tax. In addition, motorists will be burdened with tolls. [Koch] Have you forgotten that the SPD wants to introduce a 10-percent supplementary charge? [Lafontaine] The Federal Government's 7.5-percent solidarity surcharge will also hit small and medium earners. We will abolish that immediately. Our supplementary charge will completely relieve 80 percent of all taxpayers of this solidarity surcharge. This will be a major tax cut for the great majority. For the remaining 20 percent -- that is, married couples earning gross annual incomes of 120,000 German marks [DM] and singles at DM60,000 marks -- we will increase the government's 7.5-percent surcharge by a mere 2.5 percent. Since the little people have been the only ones that have had to pay in the past, this will be a justifiable sacrifice for German unity. [Koch] The SPD is losing in opinion polls; is the "comrade trend" shaking? [Lafontaine] All polls indicate that the SPD is ahead, and the Kohl government does not have a majority.
