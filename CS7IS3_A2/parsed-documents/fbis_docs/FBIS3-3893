C. Tsai] [Text] Taipei, March 19 (CNA) -- In a new bid to help address Taiwan's snowballing trade deficit with Japan, a market development and technology transfer center will be established on July 1, economics officials said Saturday [19 March] Promoted by C.F. Koo, chairman of the Taiwan-Japan Economic and Trade Development Foundation, and Economic Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang, the center aims to push for trade and technological cooperation between the two countries, they noted. The center will coordinate domestic efforts to seek technology transfers from Japan, which could be achieved through strategic business alliances, they pointed out. Currently, domestic organizations responsible for promoting trade ties with Japan include the Republic of China [ROC] Committee of the East Asian Businessmen Conference, the Taiwan-Japan Business Cooperation Conference, and Taiwan's Japan-oriented Exporters Association. The officials stressed that the combined business forces of the two countries in capital, technology, and marketing will certainly help promote the upgrading of the industrial base in Taiwan. The goal could be achieved by beginning with the establishment of joint ventures to produce key parts and components in Taiwan, they said. In goodwill response to Taiwan's new move, a group of Japan's senior business executives including Shoichiro Toyota, the newly- elected president of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), will visit Taiwan in early July. The Japanese side is planning to organize the largest-ever technology transfer group with a view to promoting the transfer of high-tech know-how to Taiwan, the officials said. Taiwan has been plagued by a huge trade deficit with Japan. The trade imbalance, which totaled US$14.22 billion in 1993, is expected to top US$16 billion this year.
