They Are Power in the Republic"] [Text] For three days, groups of experts of Belarus and Russia were in session at a government residence not far from Minsk. They were discussing one more time the mechanisms and terms for merging both countries' monetary systems. First Vice Premier Mikhail Myasnikovich stated in a news conference that accord had been reached on the question most painful for Belarus -- single prices of energy resources. In the meantime, according to Myasnikovich, Belarus buys Russian oil at $77 per tonne whereas Moscow sells it at $45 to its internal consumers. The same ratio of $75 against $17 applies to gas. Responding to the Russian claim that single energy prices were a disadvantage for Russia, the Belarus experts spoke about the advantages Russia has: free transit of all types of transport across Belarus territory, gas pipelines and oil pipelines, the free-of-charge presence of Russian strategic troops on the republic's territory. As some politicians and observers think, Moscow has no reason for agreeing to single prices. They argue that once Belarus volunteers (especially in the wake of Shushkevich's resignation) as it does for the closest possible union with Russia, it should be set the toughest terms. Thus, it is quite natural that the question of including Belarus in Russia's monetary system is political first and foremost. Belarus Prime Minister Kebich, who has placed the main political chips on the merger, obviously realizes this too. Scoring a success here is especially important for him in light of the impending all-Belarus political strike. At this point, not only opposition politicians and bankers, but some ministers, too, also realize the danger of the action being undertaken. Your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent has learned by chance about a conference in one of the ministries where its head was painting for his staff a sad prospect of the agency's work after the merger of the monetary systems. None the less, a brief effect of external improvement in the wake of the "rubleization" of Belarus is supposed to take place. Realizing this, Kebich, together with his cabinet, hypes the successes of another round of talks, insisting especially that cash is supposed to be exchanged at a one-for-one rate. The Russian delegation, as the talks have shown, is not too eager so far to agree to go along with such a fabulous rate as far as Belarus is concerned. However, as the prime minister stated to your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent: "The experts' business is to work, but it is up to the two premiers to say the last word on prices and the level of rates."
