FR941110-1-00124 FR941110-1-00011 Appendix G to Subpart A_UNEP Recommendations for Conditions Applied to Exemption for Laboratory and Analytical Uses 1. Laboratory purposes are identified at this time to include equipment calibration; use as extraction solvents, diluents, or carriers for chemcial analysis; biochemical research; inert solvents for chemical reactions, as a carrier or laboratory chemical and other critical analytical and laboratory purposes. Production for laboratory and analytical purposes is authorized provided that these laboratory and analytical chemicals shall contain only controlled substances manufactured to the following purities: ␣ 1␣ 1␣ CTC (reagent grade) 99.5 1,1,1=trichloroethane 99.0 CFC&hyph;11 99.5 CFC&hyph;13 99.5 CFC&hyph;12 99.5 CFC&hyph;113 99.5 CFC&hyph;114 99.5 Other w/ Boiling P < 20 ○ C 99.5 Other w/ Boiling P<20 ○ C 99.0 2. These pure, controlled substances can be subsequently mixed by manufacturers, agents or distributors with other chemicals controlled or not controlled by the Montreal Protocol as is customary for laboratory and analytical uses. 3. These high purity substances and mixtures containing controlled substances shall be supplied only in re-closable containers or high pressure cylinders smaller than three litres or in 10 millilitre or smaller glass ampoules, marked clearly as substances that deplete the ozone layer, restricted to laboratory use and analytical purposes and specifying that used or surplus substances should be collected and recycled, if practical. The material should be destroyed if recycling is not practical. 4. Parties shall annually report for each controlled substance produced: the purity; the quantity; the application, specific test standard, or procedure requiring its uses; and the status of efforts to eliminate its use in each application. Parties shall also submit copies of published instructions, standards, specifications, and regulations requiring the use of the controlled substance.
