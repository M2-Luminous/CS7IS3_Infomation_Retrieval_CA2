Supreme Council Wants To Protect Cabinet From Extraneous Influence"] [Text] Ukraine's Supreme Council is soon going to amend the law on the president, INTERFAX' Kiev correspondents report. The proposed amendments reserve for the president only the functions of head of state, denying him control of the cabinet. Thus parliament is determined to turn the president into rather a symbolic figure not vested with any serious powers. Incidentally, this is not the first "campaign" by the republic's Supreme Council against -- in this case -- the powers of Mr. Kravchuk. The first one was several months ago and ended quite successfully for the Supreme Council. The objective at that time was to eliminate the system of presidential representatives in the regions, and it was then that Leonid Kravchuk stated he would not run unless the law was revised since he had no intention of becoming a toy in the hands of various political groups. Early in May, however, with the question of Mr. Kravchuk's participation in the elections still undecided, the time factor, so to speak, came into operation and all the current president's opponents stated with one accord that they saw no reasons for bringing the 26 June event forward while there was no time left to review the law. Realizing he had no way out and that the elections could just as well proceed without him, Kravchuk had to join the presidential race, deferring until better times the hopes of having his representatives in the regions. And there came a blow beneath the belt, so to speak. Hoping that few people would pay attention to what are generally radical amendments in the law one week before the voting, the Supreme Council is going to strip him of control over the executive branch. Kravchuk may be no economic figure. Indeed, he is not. Still he has every right to accuse the Supreme Council of ingratitude: It was he who proposed, a week ago, the compromise figure of Vitaliy Masol for the position of prime minister. Precisely in order to avoid yet another president-parliament crisis. It may of course be supposed that, in getting ready to amend the law, the Supreme Council is simply out to protect Masol, whom it is quite happy about, against attacks by a new president. What if he happens to be, say, not Kravchuk but Kuchma, whose entire election program consists solidly of economic slogans? He would certainly keep a big drawer in the presidential desk for his ideas for laws concerning the economy. There is just one "but." Given its present composition, parliament would be hard pressed to amend the Constitution. It requires at least 300 votes. At the moment the powers of only 336 deputies out of the requisite 450 have been confirmed.
