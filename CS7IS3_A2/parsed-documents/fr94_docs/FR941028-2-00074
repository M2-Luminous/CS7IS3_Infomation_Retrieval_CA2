L. 97&hyph;276), which authorizes Federal agencies to offset a Federal employee's salary as a means of satisfying delinquent debts owed to the United States (5 U.S.C. 5514 (a)); 26 CFR 301.6402&hyph;6 et. seq., chapter I, subchapter F_Procedure and Administration (Tax Refund Regulations issued by Internal Revenue Service); and 24 CFR part 17, Administrative Claims, subpart C 17.60 and 17.125 through 17.140, Salary Offset Provisions (HUD). Objectives to be met by the matching program: The matching program will allow HUD to discover the identities and locations of postal employees who are indebted to the Department and to collect debts owed to the Federal Government. Records to be matched: HUD will provide extracts from its systems of records entitled HUD/DEPT&hyph;2, Accounting Records, last published in the Federal Register at 55 FR 17676 on April 26, 1990, containing records of more than 250,000 debtors of the records to be matched. Disclosures will be made under routine uses of the records maintained in that system (including categories of users and the purposes of such users). Notice procedures: As a condition of matching, HUD has made modifications to the loan application forms for the participating programs to expand the Privacy Act Statements on these forms. Incorporated within the Privacy Act statements on the individual application forms is the notation ``that the information provided by the applicant can be used for computer matching purposes and to collect debts owed to the Federal government.'' Any deficiencies as to direct notice procedures to the individual for the matching program are cured by the indirect or constructive notice that will be afforded to the subjects when the public notice of the proposed match is published by HUD in the Federal Register as required by subsection (e)(12) of the Privacy Act. Categories of records/individuals involved: The debtor records include these data elements: SSN, claim number, program code, and indication of indebtedness. Categories of records include: Records of claims and defaults, repayment agreements, credit reports, financial statements, and records of foreclosures. Categories of individuals include: Former mortgagors and purchasers of HUD-owned properties manufactured (mobile) home and home improvement loan debtors who are delinquent or in default on their loans, and rehabilitation loan debtors who are delinquent or in default on their loans. Period of the match: Matching will begin at least 40 days from the date copies of the signed (by both Data Integrity Boards) computer matching agreement are sent to both Houses of Congress or at least 30 days from the date this Notice is published in the Federal Register , whichever is later, providing no comments are received which would result in a contrary determination.
