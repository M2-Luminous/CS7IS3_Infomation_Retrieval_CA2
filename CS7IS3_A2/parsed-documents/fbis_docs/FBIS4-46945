G-7: Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, the USA, France and Japan. E-10: Belarus, Bulgaria, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Poland, Russia, Romania, Slovakia, Ukraine and the Czech Republic. The third "East-West" Conference of Ministers of Economics, Industry and Trade of the G-7 countries and of the ten reforming countries was recently held in the Polish capital. The "East-West" conferences (the two preceding ones were held in Germany and Japan) dealt with not only the forms of cooperation between the G-7 countries and the reforming ones, but also areas of possible technical assistance which can bring early returns and promote market relations and democratization in the former Eastern Bloc countries in the best way possible. A feature of the Third Conference is the "East-West" business forum that preceded it which furnished a reply to the intentions voiced earlier of drawing the business community into the discussion of possibilities and conditions for accelerating reform in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The direct participation of about 200 businessmen in the transformation process imparted a dynamic and genuine character to the meeting. Their proposals and recommendations for the governments of the 17 countries spelled out in the Warsaw Declaration were presented to the Ministers and discussed at round-table sessions. Those present acknowledged the following as the three pillars of partnership between the advanced countries and the reforming countries: an effective private economy, foreign investment and international trade. Hence the goals of the ten countries are these: 200 billion dollars in direct foreign investment, 70 percent of GNP produced by the private sector, and 17 percent of trade should be conducted with countries of the G-7 (currently this figure stands at 6-7 percent). As was stressed at the conference, the countries which belong to the so-called E-10 Group are currently experiencing a difficult transition to a market economy. Apart from the variations in their economic development, there are certain problems they all share. First of all, there has been a marked decrease in GNP caused by a slump in industrial production accompanied by high inflation and unemployment rates. There has also been a plunge in trade between the former CMEA countries. But the first positive effects of the economic changes are appearing. Some countries have registered a significant GNP increase, and others have registered a slowing in the downward-trend. This tendency has been due to increases in output: in Poland -- by 6.2 percent and in Hungary -- by 4.3 percent. The first results of privatization have also been appearing. According to estimates, in Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary, toward the end of this year fifty percent of their GNP will be created by the private sector. Everyone agreed that for the economic reforms in the E-10 countries to be successful, there needs to be considerable activity by foreign investors. Benefits from their investments are many and diverse: they spur production growth and job creation, they pay taxes which add to the budget, and they introduce state-of-the-art technologies and modern-day managerial techniques. Foreign capital in Eastern Europe since 1989 has totaled more than 20 billion dollars. The biggest share has been invested in Hungary (5.6 billion US$), then Poland (3.0 billion US$), followed by the Czech Republic (2.16 billion US$). At the same time, the value of foreign capital in international investment markets totalled 200 billion dollars last year. Of that sum, South American and Asian countries succeeded in attracting 56 billion dollars. In China, for example, foreign investment totaled 26 billion dollars. The capacious market of "the Ten" will remain attractive for foreign investors. In the view of many participants in the Warsaw meeting, there are vast investment opportunities in the Russian and Kazakh fuel industries, the Ukrainian agriculture sector, the region's transportation, water-management and energy-producing infrastructure, as well as in the development of the banking and telecommunications sector. The G-7, voicing its readiness to invest before the year 2000 a total of 200 billion dollars in the post-socialist countries, is nonetheless setting its own stipulations. They concern explicit investment conditions, especially a plain and unequivocal tax system, as well as customs privileges, possibilities for profit repatriation, patent protection, privatization, and how jurisdiction is divided between the central government and the local authorities. As to the latter, businessmen recounted quite a few impressions of their association with bureaucrats of every stripe who seemed to be deliberately created to prevent the formation of a market. "Businessmen will invest their money provided it can make a profit." A British entrepreneur was hammering this idea and his colleagues were nodding with approval. The conferees in Warsaw continued their essential conversation about a model program for restructuring industrial enterprises. The basic concept of the program drafted by a group of Japanese specialists envisages the development and implementation of pilot projects, under a Western technical aid scheme, to restructure the basic enterprises in different industrial sectors of the countries undergoing reform. This goal is to introduce into these firms effective management techniques and to expedite their privatization. So far only Japan has taken real steps in this direction. Japan's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Industry has enlisted the services of the "Nomura" private research institute and the "Rotobo" association and has drawn upon funds earmarked by the Japanese government, with aid and assistance from the Russian State Committee for Industrial Policy. This group has formulated a project for restructuring the Murom engineering plant and has started similar work on the Smolensk garment-making association called "Charm." Japanese Minister Eijiro Hata informed the Warsaw conferees about a series of seminars being prepared to discuss Japanese experience in the field of industrial policy, to be held in Poland and Russia later this year. "The "East-West" conference is truly unique because it realizes two fundamental ideas," First Deputy Economics Minister of the RF Andrei Shapovalyants told this correspondent. "One of them is that now, on the geopolitical plane, an economic mechanism is being created for cooperation among all countries in conditions of reform of the post-communist countries, and this raises the question: in what form can the Western countries help those being reformed precisely in the way of developing market relations and building a civilized economic mechanism which should perhaps take shape towards the close of the year 2000 in all countries constituting "the Ten." The other idea is to see how direct investment, forms of technical aid, and organization of aid in privatization and in solving the questions having to do with liberalization, work directly for the entrepreneur. So, it is important that not only officials but also representatives of the business world have come together here. [quotation marks as published] How do you view the sum of 200 billion dollars as investment for "the Ten" with respect to the Russian economy? I would not view this figure as a binding plan which we have to implement. It is meant as an estimate of possibilities afforded by the E-10 investment market so as to be able to implement effective projects which would attract the interest of foreign investments. That the requirements of every country exceed manifold this sum is crystal-clear. To distribute the sum in anticipation of which country will implement a highly effective project is not essential yet. What is meant is a total estimate of projects that can be "mastered" by Western investors. And do you believe that 70 percent of Russia's gross national product will be created by the private sector by the year 2000? A program for post-voucher privatization to enter into force after July 1, 1994 is in the works. Under that program, depending on the chosen scheme, it will take the shape of either investment trading or portfolio investments, and maybe it can place heavy emphasis on foreign investment, drawing foreigners into the sphere of privatization. Which regime will be decided upon will determine whether the private sector will account for 70, 62 or 54 percent of the economy. I would not regard this as a binding plan. Together with the 200 billion dollar sum we have interlinked estimates whose accuracy still needs to be verified. That is to say, for each of the countries it would be essential to make an elementary survey as to what foreign investments will do to increase the proportion of private capital within the economy. I for one am confident that in Russia, for instance, the growth in the share of private capital will be due not to foreign investment but to the development of inner processes of privatization.
