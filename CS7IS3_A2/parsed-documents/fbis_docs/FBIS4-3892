The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) issued a circular recently urging unremitting efforts by party organizations to educate journalists on press ethics. The circular says that the recent case of illegal nationwide fund raising by the Beijing Great Wall Machinery and Electronics Industry Corporation, fanned by false reports by some bribed journalists, revealed the extent of the problem. Some correspondents had seriously disrupted the economic order and harmed the interests of the state and people by faking news stories in favor of the sponsoring parties, according to the circular. The circular calls for strengthening the "development of ethics of the press community". Over the past decade, more Chinese journalists have from time to time wandered astray from their professional ethics to write advertising in the guise of news after receiving various benefits. A standard package of benefits in covering promotional events include a "small gift", a "red paper bag" with cash and a banquet after the press conference. The practice reached its climax in 1992. A few reporters could not be attracted to a press conference if they were unable to receive similar benefits. Some crew members from television stations went even further. It is in such situations that some reporters have succumbed to corrupt practices. But the circular gives credit to the overall quality of the press circle, saying that journalists have made outstanding contributions to the country's reforms and opening up. The unhealthy tendency was halted after the Propaganda Department released a circular last year, banning all "paid news coverage" and "sales of book numbers", codes that represent official permission to publish, according to the latest circular. The circular says it is imperative to use the "Great Wall" case to educate reporters and editors nationwide. It also demands that party committees in various localities conduct an inspection into how the circular's guidelines against paid journalism are being implemented. Press units should formulate rules and regulations to prevent future occurrences of this practice and should be subject to the supervision of the public, says the circular.
