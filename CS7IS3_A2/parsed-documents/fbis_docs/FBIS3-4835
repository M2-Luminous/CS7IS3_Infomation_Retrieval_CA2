Government forces have withdrawn to positions about 10 kilometers (six miles) south and west of the base at Anlung Veng -- the radical faction's headquarters for all guerrilla operations in north and central Cambodia -- to positions they held six months ago. Toan Chhay, commander of the 4th Military Region and governor of Siem Reap province where the base is situated, told AFP by telephone that his 1,200 government troops were re-grouping. "Now we gather our forces to attack again and we will re-capture Anlung Veng within 10 days at the most," he said. He said the decision to withdraw came because "our soldiers lacked food and supplies. The KR have captured the base itself but we are still in the Anlung Veng area," he said. Cambodian armed forces control most of the surrounding area, he said. [passage omitted] Co-premier Hun Sen said the guerrilla shelling had forced the government to make a tactical retreat from the centre of Anlung Veng. But he emphasised that Anlung Veng was more than just the base and it covered a very big area. The government has persistently described the loss of the base, which it captured after a six-month struggle against the guerrillas, as a tactical withdrawal and not a military defeat. [passage omitted] Speaking at a press conference in the capital, Information Ministry spokesman Sieng Lapresse claimed government troops were engaged in pitched battles with the guerrillas. "Sometimes they (the KR) get in our frontline and three or fours hours later we recapture it, so that's the battle," he said. When asked about the military commander's admission that troops had withdrawn from the centre of the base, the exasperated spokesman replied: "Don't believe me because I know the situation changes fast. If you pick up this story and write it, before the ink dries it changes." Sieng Lapresse went on to say that commercial rather then military reasons may have been the motivation for the rebel counter- attack. The KR finance their guerrilla operations by selling logging and [words indistinct] to primarily Thai business interests, many of which are controlled by the Thai military. Anlung Veng was a major centre for logging activities. When the government forces captured the base, "a great number of logs" were left behind by the retreating guerrillas, he said. "One of the primary goals of the KR was to try and get these logs out through Thailand," the spokesman said. Government officials said part of the estimated 600-strong guerrilla force attacked from Thai territory, and that once the guerrillas pushed the government troops back, trucks followed in their tracks to pick up logs. "I don't know if they were Thai trucks but trucks came and picked up logs and went back in that direction which is north of Cambodia," the spokesman said without referring to Thailand by name. The guerrillas also had a lot of weapons caches in the area, he said. "When we attacked they were unable to get them out on time so they try to come and get their weapons and ammunition back," he said.
