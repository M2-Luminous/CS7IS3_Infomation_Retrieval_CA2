In remarks to the local press, he added the state government, which he heads, and the federal government will continue their steadfast efforts to promote and reach peace. The EZLN, the governor has said, has respected the cease-fire. Bishop Manuel Ruiz, mediator of the Chiapas conflict, said on 26 March in San Cristobal de las Casas, the site of the peace talks between the EZLN and the federal government, the Zapatists' decision to halt the consultations and declare a state of alert responds to the country's prevailing situation. He added the date for the second peace talks has not been set yet. The Zapatists, according to the communique issued 25 March and carried by the local and foreign media, came in the wake of the murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio, presidential candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, on 23 March.
