Setinc Resigned"] [Text] Ljubljana -- Mile Setinc, director of the Government Information Office, resigned yesterday. He denied that disagreement in the LDS [Liberal Democracy of Slovenia] over the adoption of the Law on Radio and Television was the reason for his departure. It is known that Setinc favored more representatives of civic groups and professional organizations without party affiliations in the state Radio-Television Council. The Assembly adopted an alternative, a compromise between his proposal and the proposal backed by the LDS, which would allow representatives of political parties to dominate the Council. Setinc said that he has "personal" reasons for his resignation.
