Moravcik, who was yesterday entrusted by President Michal Kovac with the creation of a new government, said he expected that the new Slovak government would be made known "by Thursday at the latest." He emphasized that the new government would have to concentrate on the decisive area of the economy. "In the economy we have to ensure that an end is put to some negative trends, which are not yet appearing, and to lay the foundations for the new government, which after the elections will be able to develop these foundations," Moravcik said. He also indicated that his government would have to take several unpopular measures. "We have to introduce a realistic picture of Slovakia, especially of the economy. When people take such a picture as the reality, they will understand the measures which are unavoidable to ensure the development of a society with good prospects after the new elections," Moravcik said. Moravcik declined to give the names of the candidates for the ministries, because talks with them were not yet over and it was necessary to give the president space to decide and confirm the nominations. "Publishing the nominations would be a form of pressure on the president," he said. "Nothing of good quality is born easily and simply, and thus the composition of the government, too, will be the result of fairly complicated talks," Moravcik said about the course of negotiations between the five parties which decided the fall of Meciar's government. At the same time he announced that the new coalition had already decided on the foreign minister, but did not reveal his name. Moravcik said that during the creation of the government the emphasis was being put on the expertise of its members. The nascent government coalition did not intend to correct the "very unusual" decision made by Meciar to recall all the state secretaries, but it did intend this week to prepare nominations for these posts. The next premier also admitted that there would be further changes. "At lower stages of the state administration, too, we are interested in respecting expertise, and from this point of view we have to make some changes, of which there might be quite a few," he said.
