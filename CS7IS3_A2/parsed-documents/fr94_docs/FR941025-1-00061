FR941025-1-00061 FR941025-1-00013 Regulatory Analyses and Notices Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures The Department of Transportation has determined that this rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action within the meaning of Executive Order 12866, nor a significant regulation under the Department's Regulatory Policies and Procedures. The regulations should create savings for recipients by reducing the costs of administering grants. The DOT Operating Administrations award approximately $23 billion through forty separate assistance programs annually. An undetermined portion of these funds are utilized for small purchases. Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) requires that, for each rule with a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,'' an analysis be prepared describing the rule's impact on small entities and identifying any significant alternatives to the rule that would minimize the economic impact on small entities. We certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because they do not affect the amount of funds provided in the covered programs, but rather modify and update administrative and procedural requirements. Excutive Order 12612 (Federalism Assessment) This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612. The rule primarily applies to State or local governments. This action may have some Federalism benefits by removing some procedural restrictions on grantees; however, the Department certifies that this proposal does not have sufficient Federalism implications to warrant a full Federalism assessment under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612. Paperwork Reduction Act We certify that this proposed rule would not impose any additional reporting or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35. List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 18 Accounting, Administrative practice and procedure, Grant programs, Grants administration, Insurance, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.

It is proposed that title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations be amended as follows: 1. The authority for part 18 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. 322 (a).
