Municipal leading comrades Zhang Lichang, Li Shenglin, Li Huifen, and Zhang Haosheng, responsible comrades of relevant committees, offices, and bureaus, and party and administrative top leaders of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises attended the meeting. Zhang Lichang gave an important speech at the meeting. He said: Tianjin's development of situation is very encouraging. During the first quarter of this year, the achievements in several major economic norms were the best during recent years. The four major fighting objectives of "3-5-8-10" proposed by the municipal party committee and the municipal government are greatly supported by the broad masses of people, and the popular morale is greatly boosted. Using a period of eight years to generally conduct grafting, readjustment, and transformation in state-owned large and medium- sized enterprises is the key to invigorating the existing number of enterprises of this category, the basis, and the requirement for realizing other fighting objectives. Practice showed that it is not realistic to adopt the attitude of "waiting for, relying on, and asking for help" in the course of changing the backward outlook of enterprises and that we must emancipate ourselves. It is necessary to fully mobilize the masses to "show their special talents." At present, we are facing a very favorable international and domestic macro environment. As long as the upper and lower levels across the municipality seek unity of thinking, strengthen confidence, work on their own initiative, take voluntary actions, develop cooperation at home, conduct grafting externally, and try by all possible means to use domestic and foreign funds, all difficulties will be resolved, old enterprises will be rejuvenated, and Tianjin will have great hope. Li Huifen addressed the meeting. He said: Since the beginning of this year, with the spirit of never delaying the work of one day, the municipal relevant departments have conducted lots of investigations to know the real situation and to determine the enterprise category, size, and planning work. In line with the actual municipal situation, at present, we have designated 748 enterprises as the municipality's state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, of which three are exceptionally large enterprises, 138 are large enterprises, and 607 are medium-sized enterprises. At present, relevant departments have formulated plans for enterprise grafting, readjustment, and transformation. These plans have defined a high starting point, clear ideas, and explicit objectives, and placed the resting point on raising economic efficiency, cultivating new economic growing points, and laying a good foundation for the next step of work. Li Huifen set forth demands on successfully conducting grafting, readjustment, and transformation in state-owned large and medium- sized enterprises. She said: It is necessary to fully understand the major significance in successfully conducting enterprise grafting, readjustment, and transformation work. The four major fighting objectives of "3-5-8-10" is an important policy decision of the municipal party committee and government for invigorating Tianjin's economy. Of this, using eight years or so to generally conduct grafting, readjustment, and transformation in state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises is the basis and requirement of these four objectives and where the key to realizing the four objectives lies. Without the sustained and steady development of the industrial economy, it is impossible to quadruple the GNP of the whole municipality three years ahead of schedule; it is also difficult to renovate dangerous and shabby houses if enterprises have difficulties and workers have no money to do it; and in building coastal new areas, it is necessary to have stable social environment and economic conditions. Judging from Tianjin's present situation of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, owing to some historical reasons, some state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises in the municipality have not been transformed for a long time, and the phenomenon of outdated enterprises and obsolete equipment is very serious. Among the state-owned large and medium- sized enterprises, there are some money-losing enterprises. The fundamental way out to end the situation of low level, unmarketable products, and low efficiency in these enterprises is to accelerate enterprise grafting, readjustment, and transformation, update and upgrade products, and urge enterprises to end deficits, increase profits, and raise economic efficiency.
