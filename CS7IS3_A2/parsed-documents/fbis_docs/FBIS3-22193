[Text] Russia's Pacific coast is threatened by a general environmental disaster. Freighters and nuclear submarines belonging to the Pacific Fleet and loaded with liquid radioactive wastes are docked at seaports in the Far Eastern region. Furthermore, some of the vessels are in a dangerously dilapidated condition. The situation is extremely hazardous, and at this time there is no solution to the problem. That was the announcement made a few days ago by Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, administration chief of Maritime Kray. MN Dossier There are only 10 areas in the Far Eastern seas where radioactive waste (both liquid and solid) is dumped. Just one of these, located in the Sea of Japan 105 nautical miles from Vladivostok, 80 miles from Nakhodka and 295 miles from Hokkaido, has over the past 20 years been the dump site for more than 33,000 cubic meters of liquid radioactive wastes with a total radioactivity of 10,842 curies. In addition, 9,846 cubic meters of solid radioactive waste with a total radioactivity of 2,230 curies has also been dumped there. At the same site the sea floor at a depth of 3,250-3,700 meters is littered with 1,689 containers and 18 vessels filled with solid radioactive waste taken from the power units of nuclear submarines, five steam generators and 21 circulating pumps, which are not even in any sort of container whatsoever. For many years the Pacific Fleet dealt with radioactive waste quite simply: it was all dumped at sea. After a recent international scandal in which daring members of the omnipresent Greenpeace organization located and announced to the whole world radioactive dumping by a Russian freighter in the Sea of Japan, central agencies have decreed an end to such operations. The extremely polluted Far Eastern seas, which are being turned into a radioactive dump, got a respite. Liquid radioactive waste is now being stored on shore. No one knows what to do with it. The people of the Far East have been put in a difficult situation before by the military units based in their region. One need only recall the numerous accidents at sea and on land for which the Pacific Fleet has been responsible. Three years ago the fleet command attempted to carry out an unprecedented operation in Postovaya Bay near Sovetskaya Gavan: disassembly of reactors on board outdated nuclear submarines mothballed there. On orders from Admiral Gennadiy Khvatov, Pacific Fleet commander, the complex task of removing the reactors' radioactive nuclear fuel-containing cores -- a task that requires trained specialists and special conditions -- was to be carried out by the local garrison. But the sailors had never done that kind of work before, and the bay was not specially equipped for the job. The residents of Sovetskaya Gavan and the town of Vanino learned of the planned secret operation by chance. It cost them a great deal of effort to stop the military from going ahead with the operation. Now there has been another emergency. The defenders of our maritime borders cannot utilize liquid radioactive waste, the inevitable by-product of nuclear submarine fleet operations. At any moment the coastline and all its inhabitants could take a drink of that waste. As they expanded the nuclear might of the Pacific Fleet military experts gave no thought to safe means of utilizing wastes and disassembling decommissioned submarines. Local residents' health and very lives were not taken into account. Many very beautiful bays and gulfs along the Russian Pacific coast have long been inaccessible to people. They are literally occupied by military units. Crammed beyond all measure with military equipment, unique natural sites are a depressing sight. In some places decommissioned submarines have been sitting at anchor, aging, for years. Yet experts warn that decommissioned submarines should be decontaminated and components utilized immediately. Everything that presents a danger should be disassembled without delay and disposed of properly. After time has passed it is not only difficult to carry out such operations, but, depending on the technology, sometimes impossible. If, of course, the appropriate safety procedures are taken... The creation of the Pacific Fleet, the largest and most powerful in the world, cost our country a tremendous amount. Now more substantial expenditures will be required to halt the destructive effect of this monster on our lives. Thus far the Russian Government neither sees nor hears this problem at all. But the Americans have responded. Watching with alarm the Russian Far East, their troubled neighbor in the Pacific region, they have now become seriously worried. The Bablock-Wilcox Company, which specializes in supplying nuclear energy equipment to the U.S. Navy, has expressed a willingness to provide our navy with the most modern technology for the neutralization of radioactive wastes and utilization of nuclear submarines. Donald Ray, a company representative who visited Vladivostok a few days ago, reported that the U.S. Government, which supports the Bablock-Wilcox initiative, plans to allocate $10 million to implement it. Japanese specialists are also working on a program to help Russia set up special storage facilities for its nuclear materials. Our military circles have always been very wary of advice from outsiders, particularly when it comes to foreign advisors, and they react very negatively to any interference in the area of their interests. However, today it appears that there is no other option than to cooperate with anyone who expresses a desire to help. Russia's eastern shore is in great distress. It would appear that it is there that humanity has come to the final frontier, beyond which there lies nothing.
