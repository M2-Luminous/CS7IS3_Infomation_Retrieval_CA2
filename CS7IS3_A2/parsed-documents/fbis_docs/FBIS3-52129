He added: We are certain that the Egyptian authorities will discover the facts and identify those behind this crime. According to al-Muntasir, the purpose of this crime is to drive a wedge between Egypt and Libya and spoil the relations between the two countries, particularly since several parties have an interest in clouding the atmosphere. Al-Muntasir's remarks came in response to a question by AL-SHA'B concerning the mystery surrounding al-Kikhya's disappearance during a news conference held at the Libyan Foreign Ministry yesterday. In an exclusive statement to AL-SHA'B, Egyptian ambassador to Libya Lieutenant General Mustafa al-Shadhili has noted that he completely rules out Libya's involvement in this issue. He added that he is almost certain that Libya has nothing to do with this issue, as the investigations will show. Libyan sources have stressed that Libya is not connected to the incident for the following reasons: 1. Al-Kikhya is practicing politics and does not carry arms. Were the principle of abduction to be used, which is rejected, it would be more worthwhile to use it against those who carry and train with arms. 2. Al-Kikhya's position on the Lockerbie case was in line with the Libyan stance. Al-Kikhya denied Libya's responsibility for blowing up the U.S. aircraft. 3. Various attempts are being made by some Western states to spoil Egyptian-Libyan relations. 4. The incident comes at a time when the Western charges against Libya in connection with the Lockerbie issue have started to collapse. Thus, something new had to be found to strike at Libya.
