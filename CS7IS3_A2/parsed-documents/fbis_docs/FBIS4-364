FBIS4-364 "drafr068_c_94002" FBIS-AFR-94-068 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Leaders' Summit Previewed Leaders' Summit Previewed MB0804064494 Johannesburg SAPA in English 2255 GMT 7 Apr 94 MB0804064494 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Report by Craig Doonan and Clive Govender] [Text] Durban April 7 SAPA -- Friday's [8 April] summit between South Africa's four key leaders comes amid unprecedented levels of political violence in Natal/kwaZulu and a hardening of positions on this month's election. African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, State President F W de Klerk, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] President Mangosuthu Buthelezi are to meet at a secret venue in what is widely perceived as a last-ditch attempt to save the country from a bloody poll in three weeks' time. On the eve of the summit, the ANC, through Mr Mandela and its Natal region, was adamant there was no chance of an election postponement. But IFP marchers in Empangeni this week demanded elections be delayed to allow international mediation to run its course. A memorandum presented by the marchers warned the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] it would find it difficult to conduct peaceful, free and fair elections unless the IFP's constitutional demands for federalism were met. This came as violence threatened to engulf the Natal/kwaZulu region, with scores of townships and rural settlements already under virtual siege and death tolls climbing at alarming rates. Despite last Thursday's declaration of a state of emergency, more than 120 people have been killed in what amounts to an average daily toll of more than 17 lives. Although IEC Vice-Chairman Dikgang Moseneke said on Thursday the commission was forging ahead with preparations for elections in Natal/kwaZulu, electioneering has become virtually impossible in many areas of the region. His view was endorsed by IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler. Elections would be held in kwaZulu in spite of political unwillingness, Mr Justice Kriegler said. At least two voter education workshops have been attacked and a National Party MP in northern Natal was forced to flee a mob while putting up posters last week. KwaZulu MPs and tribal chiefs have also made it clear to Mr Justice Kriegler that the IEC is unwelcome in many rural areas under kwaZulu control. ANC Southern Natal Chairman Jeff Radebe said the ANC was hoping Friday's summit would pave the way for free and fair elections in Natal. "We'd like the king to indicate to all his subjects that it is a democratic right for everyone to vote. The ANC would also like to indicate to His Majesty what we feel about the future of the Zulu monarchy. We are hoping to dispel some misconceptions," he said. Mr Radebe said Mr Mandela would meet King Zwelithini privately at the undisclosed summit venue before the four leaders meet. IFP Central Committee member Thembinkosi Memela said his party remained inflexible on its rejection of the negotiated interim constitution. "We will be firm on these issues, and that is the reason why international mediators have been called in to settle the constitutional dispute -- because we are firm." He said Zulu self-determination and King Zwelithini's demands for sovereignty would also be addressed at Friday's talks. A Durban newspaper on Thursday reported King Zwelithini was prepared to become ceremonial head of kwaZulu/Natal and drop his demand for an independent Zulu kingdom if this would help reach a settlement. Mr Memela, however, said he was unaware of this development. Questioned on whether anything concrete was likely to come out of the summit, Mr Memela said: "In the light of escalating violence, everyone is serious about solving these problems. But I'm neither very optimistic nor very pessimistic. I expect the leaders to do the best they can under the circumstances." Meanwhile, University of Durban-Westville political analyst Kiru Naidoo said: "It would be too much to expect a significant breakthrough at this extremely late stage. I can't imagine anything that can be arrived at that would pave the way for the IFP's participation in elections. If (Friday's) meeting can secure free and fair political activity, that is the most significant thing one can expect. To reduce tension, we would need King Zwelithini to urge his followers -- as difficult as they would find the situation -- to allow the democratic process to continue unhindered."
