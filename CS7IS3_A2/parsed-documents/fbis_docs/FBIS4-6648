Tomiichi Murayama told a party meeting that the SDP will continue efforts to keep the coalition intact against growing speculation that the SDP may leave the alliance over policy gaps. Murayama, speaking at a meeting of the party's leadership body, the Central Executive Committee, expressed willingness to continue talks with other coalition partners to find a breakthrough to deadlocked negotiations on cementing policy accords. The coalition hopes to come to a consensus prior to picking its candidate for a new premier in the Diet election who will succeed outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Talks among the coalition partners remain at an impasse over how to find common ground to document policies on two remaining key policies -- tax reform and Japan's stand on North Korea's suspected nuclear development program. Murayama told the meeting that the SDP will modify its own alternative on the two key issues, saying the coalition partners can not reach agreement on policy talks if they refuse to change any wording.
