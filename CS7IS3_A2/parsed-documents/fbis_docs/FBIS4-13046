They must define their position toward the elements that seek to partition the homeland using desecrated money, money that we would have liked to have used on development rather than on the purchase of weapons and explosives and disturbing public order. This money could have been better spent building a hospital or school or treating an incurable disease instead of [words indistinct] and disturbing the public peace. Dear brothers: We are absolutely confident that all unionist patriots of all political organizations and parties -- the General People's Congress [GPC], the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], the Yemeni Reform Grouping, and others -- will place the interests of the homeland above all narrow and selfish interests. We would have liked for this crisis not to have been dragged out. The struggler 'Abdallah al-Sallal was a martyr of the political crisis that was fabricated to redivide the Yemeni homeland. This unity was brought about through peaceful and democratic means, in which there was no annexation or coercion. The unity was the result of prolonged dialogue that went on for years and culminated on 22 May 1990, the date that saw an end to the division of a homeland into two systems of government and to the legacies of imamism and the end of odious colonialism throughout the land. We engaged in protracted dialogue long enough. Things came to a head on many occasions and we battled and conspired against each other long enough. There was the 1972 war in which the victor was the loser. Then there was the second 1979 battle, in which the victor was also the loser. We are now working in earnestness and dedication and a sense of responsibility to defeat all schemes meant to fuel sedition within the ranks of the one Yemeni family. In that effort we are aided by all the dedicated unionist patriots of all the political groups and parties. We should work together toward defeating all these schemes that seek to split the national unity and reintroduce partition. The reintroduction of division would be a terrible ordeal. Division will not be permitted to return. There will not be a return to the state of affairs where there were the Democratic People's Republic of Yemen in the south and the Yemeni Arab Republic in the north of the homeland. That would be a disaster for all sections of this people, especially now that we have political pluralism, unity, and political parties throughout the country. Neither the GPC, nor the Yemeni Reform Grouping, nor the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, nor the Right Party, nor the League of the Sons of Yemen Party, nor the Democratic Nasirite Party, nor the YSP, nor any other political faction will be custodian in one half of the homeland or the other. The true and basic need is for these political parties to spread across the land. No one has the right of custodianship on what used to be known as the north of the homeland or what used to be known as the south of the homeland. God forbid, if we were sucked into the schemes of the fabricators of the crisis, who were paid to tear the Yemeni unity asunder, and if the Yemeni people fought among themselves throughout the land, we would have to come to an understanding and sit at the negotiating table to solve this problem as happened in 1972 and 1979. In other words, as political groups and parties we must sit at the negotiating table and solve our problems before any harm is done. I thank all brothers and comrades who have played a positive role on the Political Forces Dialogue Committee for their efforts. I hope that each of them will remain a support for unity instead of secession and that they will not take the side of any political groups directly or indirectly, neither behind the scenes nor through the telephone, to tell this or that party they are in the right. In my name and on behalf of my fellow members on the Presidential Council and the executive and legislative branches, I ask God's mercy for the soul of Marshal 'Abdallah al-Sallal, whose departure was a great loss to the homeland.
