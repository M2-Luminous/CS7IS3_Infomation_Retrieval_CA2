It is to be welcomed that immediately after the NATO summit in Brussels, the chancellor is informing parliament of its results and is giving us his assessment. This is the right way to deal with parliament, Mr. Chancellor, this is how it should be done. [applause] The fact that you, Mr. Chancellor, have given a positive assessment of the summit is no surprise. Perhaps it will come as a surprise to you that we, the opposition, contradict you, how shall I put it, in only muted terms, or even actually agree with you. [applause] We also regard the result, apart from individual questions and points of criticism, as generally positive. This also applies, Ladies and Gentlemen, to the question of NATO's expansion, on which most interest as been focused. You know, Mr. Chancellor, that we Social Democrats back the expansion of NATO toward Central and East Europe, that we are in principle, in favor of it. In principle, this means that NATO expansion makes sense if it helps to develop a new European security structure that, and I stress this point, serves to stabilize the continent as a whole. We believe this can only happen if NATO: (a) retains its character as a collective system of defense and (b) helps by means of its existence and policies to create or support a collective European security system. The point of this statement is to formulate an objective and, at the same time, a condition. We cannot support a security structure that offers Europe as a whole, not more but less security because it becomes the source of new tension. [applause] And for this reason an expansion of NATO is not possible at the moment. I am well aware, Ladies and Gentlemen, that the countries that now wish to join, the Baltic states, Poland, the Visegrad states as a whole, take a different view. They see themselves in a specifically threatening situation that they would like to avert by speedy NATO accession. Whether this will prove successful is a matter for debate. However, I understand their position, and I also understand the fact that there is a degree of disappointment in the countries I have mentioned. Polish politicians and others have expressed this disappointment and I understand it. But it will be very wrong if in Poland or anywhere else, the impression emerged that the West did not want them, or was once again leaving them to their fate. [applause] This is not the case. For one thing, the decisions taken at the NATO summit retain the option for accession, or rather, they actually open up this option. For another, the approval of the Partnership for Peace represents an offer of cooperation that, depending on the practicalities, is a far-reaching one, particularly when viewed in the context of subsequent accession. And third, no one should have any interest in adding grist to the mill of those forces in Russia that are stirring fear of encirclement, in reality to prepare a new imperial role for Russia. [applause] We know that such forces exist, Ladies and Gentlemen. They did not win the elections in Russia, but they are menacingly strong. Everything that we know about them, and what we hear from their representatives, worries us, [it worries] us and others whose concern is of course even greater than ours for sheer geographical reasons. We do not want to strengthen these forces in Russia, which is why the West in fact, is taking Russian concerns into account. But that does not mean, to put it quite clearly, that we concede to the Russian leadership, the Russian president, a kind of right of veto over NATO expansion. However, since we want the democratic reformers to be strengthened and to succeed, we should avoid anything that makes their position in their own country any more difficult. We are at one with the government on this. I would add that in the current [Russian] Government and within the Russian military there are isolated voices that betray a hegemonical stance with a kind of Monroe doctrine, at least with regard to the countries of the former Soviet Union. Ladies and Gentlemen, anyone who behaves as if Zhirinovskiy has already taken power possibly helps to bring this about. [applause] We welcome the invitation to a Partnership for Peace addressed to the members of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, and to other CSCE countries, as an offer of achieving expansion of NATO to the east through practical cooperation, in what is termed an evolutionary process. It would be desirable for cooperation with the invited countries to develop in such a way that, in the end, the eastward expansion of NATO will become superfluous, because a functioning collective security system had already developed. That is pie in the sky at the moment, I know, and you would have to be quite optimistic to think such a development probable, but nothing is possible without optimism. At least we, the opposition in the German Bundestag, also ask our neighbors to the East to get involved in this cooperation. We Germans want this cooperation, because we have a vital interest of our own, in overcoming the situation in which we find ourselves of being a frontier country. From our point of view, it is desirable that our neighbors should be in the same system of cooperation and security that we have entered into. That this cooperation should not be restricted to military issues, Ladies and Gentlemen, should be especially stressed here. There will be no security in Europe if economic problems are not also solved, if we do not succeed in giving the people in East Europe the hope that economically things will improve. The suitability for NATO, if I may put it that way, of an East European country does not depend, first and foremost, on whether the equipment of its Army is NATO-compatible. What is decisive is progress in efforts to improve people's opportunities in life. [applause] Only if, Ladies and Gentlemen [applause], only if this proves successful can we create stability, without which there can be no lasting peace in Europe as a whole. Partnership for Peace must therefore, be accompanied by a partnership for development -- in economic, social, and democratic terms. Making this partnership reality and offering concrete aid is the proper way, and the only one that offers the promise of success. [applause] Germany on its own has done much, and we are not criticizing this, on the contrary. However, Mr. Chancellor, I cannot see any integrated security and development policy ideas for East Europe. The German Government has repeatedly described itself as the advocate of the countries of East Europe, I recall statements to this effect especially from you, Mr. Kinkel. And it is true that the government never tires of constantly assuring as many East European countries as possible that Germany will support them in every possible objective, above all, in their wish to join the European Community, or rather the European Union. I believe the government means what it says, but we should not forget that Germany on its own cannot possibly deliver the support that is expected. I repeat, what is needed is an integrated concept for security and development that is supported and materially backed by all our Western partners, if possible by Japan as well. [applause] Security, Ladies and Gentlemen, is not only, not even first and foremost, a military problem. Mr. Chancellor, you know this as well as I do. However, I cannot detect any willingness on your part to take the correct foreign policy decisions that follow from this. At any rate, I have heard nothing to this effect in your statement today. You could, Mr. Chancellor, say in your defense that this was not, and could not have been, the subject of the NATO summit. However, I take a different view. Have we not always stressed, not least yourself, that NATO is more than an alliance with just a military purpose. Is NATO not also a forum for political debate and agreement, as well as a policy tool? We at any rate take this view, Mr. Chancellor, and for this reason we would have liked the alliance's heads of state gathered in Brussels to have taken a wider understanding of the concept of partnership than they in fact did. Once again, security is not just a military problem. But unfortunately, it is the case that in the unstable current situation, in view of the numerous conflicts and brutal wars, that military calculations have moved to the fore, in the face of the high hopes many people had after the fall of the Iron Curtain and the collapse of Communism. We dreamt of a peaceful, free, economically flourishing Europe, of a Europe that could return to its roots in unity once again. Ladies and Gentlemen, I am still hopeful, but I admit that my hope is now mixed with concern, fear, and anger. The peoples of East Europe have returned to Europe from Communist imprisonment, it is true. But how have we, who so praised their role in the liberation of East Europe, how have we accepted them here? Europe is in fact still divided and will remain so for a long time unless there is a great joint effort. And there will be no secure peace in Europe so long as this practical division remains. [applause] It is quite correct, that with the collapse of the Soviet empire, the danger of a great apocalyptic war has diminished. That Ukraine, which is after all numerically the third nuclear power in the world, finally seems prepared to dismantle its nuclear potential, further reduces the danger. Nevertheless, nasty and brutal conventional war has returned to Europe and we can apparently find no strength to act preventively, that is to prevent war. We have as yet no effective strategy for curbing or ending war. Yugoslavia is a frightening example. I have read the statements at the NATO summit on Yugoslavia, on Bosnia. The Serbs and the other peoples who are killing each other in the former Yugoslavia believe, I am afraid, not a word of them. I am, Mr. Chancellor, in agreement with the organizational decision concerning the relationship between NATO and the WEU [Western European Union]. The recognition of the European Union as an equal partner with the United States on foreign and security policy issues, the definition of the WEU in the communique as the defense and security instrument of the European Union -- we can accept that. I am however, not in agreement because action here is once again more on the level of military organization, without any progress being discernible in the formulation of a joint foreign and security policy. [applause] The WEU is to become capable of independent military action but without double military structures arising -- we accept that. But is there -- quite apart from the German nonclarities -- clarity about what is to be achieved with this military operational capacity of the WEU? You know that I think that military precautions, including a realistic component of deterrence, which in my view helps to prevent war, are right and necessary. But, that once again the military aspect is to be organized first without previously gaining clarity about political strategies, worries me more and more. And it makes me suspicious not least because you, Mr. Chancellor, have not spoken here today about this group of decisions by the summit. I definitely want the joint European defense and security identity, with the Bundeswehr as an alliance army. But I am opposed to even giving the impression that Europe is striving for the role of an intervention force acting on its own prerogative. [applause] That NATO or the WEU could and should take on roles within the framework of the United Nations or the CSCE is controversial here only to the extent that we are talking about the range and nature of such tasks. You know the different positions. We all of us [in the SPD] object if it is a matter of laying claim to an independent military role for the WEU, the European Union, beyond defense and outside the alliance area. We have already done that in the case of NATO, and we do it even more decisively in the case of the WEU, thus without the United States and Canada. Allow me, Ladies and Gentlemen, an aside here. I find it astonishing that the government insists on expanding the radius of action of the Bundeswehr, and that it insists on this so strongly. That extends right to the suggestion by Mr. Schaeuble that the Bundeswehr should be deployed more within Germany. This is a suggestion that I find, if I may say so, a politically absurd idea. [applause] At the same time, Ladies and Gentlemen, they are carrying out an endless debate on the numerate strength of the Bundeswehr. Are you not at all aware that the fitness of action of the Bundeswehr, that has just undergone the greatest restructuring in its history, will be seriously endangered by that. You yourself, Mr. Chancellor, began this debate at the defense conference in Munich -- please note I have nothing at all against the strength of the Bundeswehr being discussed -- but I beg you not to come up with new figures every two to three months and not just to consider this with regard to budgetary considerations. The security position and the task of the Bundeswehr must also be included somewhere [in this debate]. Only then can this be called a rational debate. [applause] In any case, I find it a total contradiction that the tasks of the Bundeswehr are now being expanded by means of the WEU plans, but that its possibilities in real terms are to be constantly reduced. This is not how a responsible defense and security policy functions. That, Mr. Chancellor, is a stop-go policy. [applause] One final observation. We were, Mr. Chancellor, not very happy with the result of the summit meeting of the heads of state and governments of the European Union in Brussels in December. We had wanted to see greater determination to fight mass unemployment in the European Union. The unemployment figure of 18 million in the European Union makes this an urgent priority. The Federal Government acted particularly obstructively here. The proposals of the [European] Commission to finance job-creating infrastructure measures were shelved, as were the proposals to reduce incidental salary costs, to reduce the burden on labor, and to compensate for this by means of an energy tax. We regret this and we will use this opportunity here in parliament today to say this, there was no earlier opportunity. Although we are discontented with your European achievements in a specific case, I will confirm that we take your European involvement: (a) seriously and (b) do not believe it is illusionary. [applause] We Germans need Europe, because, for one thing, Europe -- in addition to NATO -- has fundamentally contributed to the fact that we have lived in peace in West Europe for 48 years. This cannot -- you also said that today -- be taken for granted but is a result of political creative power over many, many years. It is important to particularly point this out again today because it is more fashionable in your ranks, Mr. Chancellor, than in ours, to not only criticize European development but to even question it. We also have some criticism to make, we are certainly not in agreement with everything that is done or not done by the Commission in Brussels or by the Council of Ministers. However, we will adhere to our commitment to Europe. We do not believe convinced Europeans are illusionists: They can produce solid instead of emotional arguments to show their commitment, both peace and economic arguments. The people we think are illusionists, even gamblers, are those who set the national state against Europe and thus, for whatever reasons, want to take Europe back to the 19th century. [applause] We are also patriots. We love our country. But we are and remain, convinced Europeans. And we will not stop dreaming of the dream of the United States of Europe and working on bringing it about. [applause]
