FR940921-0-00018 FR940921-0-00010 40 CFR Parts 52 and 81 [NC66&hyph;1&hyph;6567a; FRL&hyph;5071&hyph;5] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans and Designation of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes; State of North Carolina AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Direct final rule. SUMMARY: On April 27, 1994, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Management (NCDEM), submitted a maintenance plan and a request to redesignate the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County area from nonattainment to attainment for carbon monoxide (CO). The CO nonattainment area consists only of Forsyth County. Under the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (CAA), designations can be revised if sufficient data is available to warrant such revisions. In this action, EPA is approving the North Carolina request because it meets the maintenance plan and redesignation requirements set forth in the CAA. DATES: This final rule will be effective November 7, 1994, unless critical or adverse comments are received by October 21, 1994. If the effective date is delayed, timely notice will be published in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Written comments should be sent to Ben Franco, at the EPA Regional Office listed below. Copies of the redesignation request and the State of North Carolina's submittal are available for public review during normal business hours at the addresses listed below.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background In a March 15, 1991, letter to the EPA Region IV Administrator, the Governor of North Carolina recommended the area of Winston-Salem/Forsyth County be designated as nonattainment for CO as required by section 107(d)(1)(A) of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAA) (Public Law 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q). The city was designated nonattainment and classified as ``moderate'' under the provisions outlined in sections 186 and 187 of the CAA. (See 56 FR 56694 (Nov. 6, 1991) and 57 FR 56762 (Nov. 30, 1992), codified at 40 CFR part 81, ยง81.334.) Because Winston-Salem had a design value of 9.7 ppm (based on 1988 and 1989 data), the area was considered moderate. The CAA established an attainment date of December 31, 1995, for all moderate CO areas. Forsyth County has ambient monitoring data showing attainment of the CO NAAQS, during the period from 1990 through 1993. The area has continued to monitor attainment to date in 1994. Therefore, in an effort to comply with the CAA and to ensure continued attainment of the NAAQS, on April 27, 1994, the State of North Carolina submitted a CO redesignation request and a maintenance plan for the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County area. The request for redesignation submittal and maintenance plan was approved by NCEMC on April 14, 1994. North Carolina submitted evidence that a public hearing was held on March 25 and 28, 1994. II. Evaluation Criteria The 1990 CAA Amendments revised section 107(d)(1)(E) to provide five specific requirements that an area must meet in order to be redesignated from nonattainment to attainment. 1. The area must have attained the applicable NAAQS; 2. The area must meet all applicable requirements under section 110 and Part D of the CAA; 3. The area must have a fully approved SIP under section 110(k) of CAA;
