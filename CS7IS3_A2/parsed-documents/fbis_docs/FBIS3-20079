Can the two superpowers really become equal partners? Some observers consider the question to be at least premature. Others are already prophesying a new form of rivalry. I think both those positions are wrong. We Russian democrats who are behind this policy have encountered tough political -- even armed -- resistance. Unfortunately, during these turbulent days, there were times when we were neither understood by our friends and allies in the West nor did we receive sufficient support from them. Even in the current critical situation -- we in Moscow need every conceivable assistance -- we hear threats of curbing economic cooperation from the West. Such threats are provocative and senseless. Behind those threats, there seems to be a manic desire to recognize the United States alone as a world power. However, if the United States wants to solve every problem in the world alone, it will overreach itself. Incidentally, despite the difficult situation in which it finds itself, Russia remains a superpower, not only because of the arsenal of nuclear weapons that it possesses, but also because of its raw materials, technical know-how, and strategic position. The principles of "strategic partnership" that were formulated in Vancouver in 1993 and in Moscow in 1994 remain as important as ever. Those lofty declarations of intent must be translated into concrete facts. Instead, reactionary forces are seeking to create myths. For example, it is asserted that Russia is condemned to having a totalitarian regime forever and will always pursue a confrontational course vis-a-vis the rest of the world. Such myths can easily become reality, if the the treaties that our presidents have signed are not observed. Some politicians in Washington and elsewhere only want to assign Russia the role of a junior partner. In their view, a "good Russian" is always an obedient Russia, never a leader. What should Russian democrats think about the new chauvinist tones that can be heard from Washington? Russia cannot accept a subordinate role in world politics. That would be unjustified and politically dangerous. Nationalist extremists and other reactionaries would soon profit from the acceptance of such a role. They are really trying to do that already. If we do not shortly begin to develop a strategy and appropriate mechanisms for a mature relationship with a realistic basis (can we venture to use the German term "realpolitik" to describe it?), the Russian and U.S. prophets of catastrophe will exploit the current situation in the way they want. Both countries would only lose out as a result.
