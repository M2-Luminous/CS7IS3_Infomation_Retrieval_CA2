The [Belgian] Economic Affairs Ministry has signed an agreement with China's State Planning Committee to exchange information and experiences. Belgium is the first country to have signed an agreement of this kind with the People's Republic of China. "It is an interesting agreement. Through the more intensive high-level contacts, we will both come to know and trust each other better. We ultimately will obtain a better understanding of how the economic system operates in China and also vice versa," Cabinet Chief Gilles de Kerchove said two days ago in an interview with DE FINANCIEEL EKONOMISCHE TIJD in Beijing. He believes this is evident from the experiences gained through a similar agreement with the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Mr. de Kerchove signed the agreement last Friday [6 May] on behalf of Melchior Wathelet, deputy prime minister and minister of economic affairs. Chen Jinhua, president of the State Planning Committee, signed for China. The agreement includes provisions for an exchange of economists and scientists to undertake scientific research. Seminars also will be held on specific topics relating to economic and social developments in the two countries. China has reached agreements of a similar nature with three other industrial countries, Japan, South Korea, and Germany, but these are not laid down in writing. [passage omitted]
