The misappropriation of accounting information stored in a computer and the lieutenant colonel's persuasive techniques to further increase his income will not be able to compete with the notorious history concealed behind his blackmail. For Cassella, the misappropriated information was worth $500,000. This was his fair price for not disclosing the deposits made by foreigners and the foreign transfers very secretly managed by a banking house through two "covert" companies that, in typical Argentine fashion, acted as "financial caves" for unholy deals. The blackmail report, filed in a fit of rage by one of the people managing the "covert finance companies," upset the Central Bank authorities who had done nothing despite ewvidence of large-scale money laundering that had been discovered after a Social Security Bank [BPS] inspection. Cassella struck a successful deal. The money launderers' blackmail was based on the two "covert" companies' requirement for secrecy. Cassella figured "it is not a crime to steal from a thief." Thus far, he has been able to escape court action and, furthermore, be promoted in his professional career. [passage omitted] A more careful review revealed that the two "covert" companies, Relmon, Inc. and Urafix, Inc., were actually part of an economic team. In a nutshell, they were linked to a banking house established in Buenos Aires and Montevideo. Recently, this banking house has been attempting, unsuccessfully, to obtain a banking license. Behind Relmon and Urafix appeared Exprinter International Corporation [preceding three words in English], the main concern grouping the Exprinter Banking House and the Exprinter Tourism company in Uruguay and linked to the Bunge y Born group and the Deutsche Bank in Argentina. Therefore, the inspectors collected evidence on the existence of "financial caves," a reality that "everyone" but the Central Bank "is aware of." [passage omitted] A typical Uruguayan solution, at least for this Uruguayan fiscal haven, was implemented. The BPS debt was accepted without a word, to prevent the closing of the banking house and the affiliate companies. The criminal report was withdrawn by the injured people and the judge expressed reasonable doubt on the method to be pursued in this strange case. On 16 March alone, the judge sent the dossier to the prosecutor. The judge, however, sent it to the wrong prosecutor's office. Therefore, court proceedings began last week to determine the actions to be taken on the blackmail report, as this is a crime that is being officially (that is, beyond the injured people's will) investigated when the injured people strongly recant. After this stormy summer season ended, Lt. Col. Cassella was promoted to colonel. It was not reported if he finally managed to collect the $500,000, but his representatives claim they reached a "settlement between the parties." The measures taken by the Central Bank, which is supposed to control financial activities, also were not reported. The BPS inspection and the blackmail episode exposed the money laundering operations in Relmon and Urafix. The money launderers will consider that Montevideo no longer represents a safe center because the "controls" that the state does not implement actually are implemented by the personal initiative of gangs of blackmailers dressed in uniform. It is no longer possible to trust anything.
