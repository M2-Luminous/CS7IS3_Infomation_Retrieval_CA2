Chongwadae [presidential office] wants, however, to drastically reform the annual reports to better suit a civilian government and move away from past practice, which was almost ritualized and devoid of substance under the militaristic and authoritarian administrations of former Army generals. Instead, the Kim administration wants to introduce "an efficient and effective" practice of reporting on annual plans by each ministry to the chief executive, Chongwadae officials said Monday. The decision is in line with Kim's style, which has quickened the pace of operating government affairs, including the New Year's presidential press conference, the officials explained. Unlike previous presidents, Kim gave his press conference in the first week of the new year. As a result, the administration plans to cut the period of the so-called national policy reports by half, winding them up before Jan. 31. In the past, reports to presidents had been dragged into February or even March sometimes. The administration hopes to wrap up reports by mayors of big cities and provincial governors within February. In order to save time and unnecessary complication, Kim will receive reports from two ministries a day, all in the morning, at Chongwadae, if possible. In the old days, presidents went out to the offices concerned. Of the 28 ministries and agencies, Kim will probably go only to the Agriculture and Fisheries, Defense, Home Affairs and Education Ministries. The number of officials he will meet will also be reduced with heads of offices of planning, and bureau chiefs, in addition to, of course, ministers. This year's reports will also rid of "militaristic" charts and slides and let ministries be brief and to the point with their new year plans, the officials said. One Chongwadae official said that since Kim has already elaborated on the administration's goal for this year, which is internationalization of the country, the ministries are expected to place emphasis on ways to boost competitive strength. Unlike past governments, the Kim administration will check the progress of each plan reported by the ministries on a quarterly basis, the official said.
