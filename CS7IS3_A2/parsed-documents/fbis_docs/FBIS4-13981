In the festival, which will last three days, 39 selected news programs, 31 television programs, 27 music and song programs, 20 radio programs, and 65 other productions relating to graphics, photography, and posters will be assessed. At the festival's opening ceremony, Mr. Larijani delivered a speech in which he said: Holding this kind of festival leads to the improvement of the cultural standards of our Voice and Vision colleagues in two respects--the assessment and appraisal of the year's cultural work and the exchange of experiences. The head of the Voice and Vision referred to the means by which the enemies of Islam carry out their cultural onslaught and to the expansion of satellite broadcasting. He added: Today, the expansion and increased activity of satellite broadcasting has become a serious problem for Europeans, because it will bring about the destruction of their cultural identities. He went on to say: We are not opposed to the positive dimensions of satellite broadcasting; we must also strive toward improving the quantity and quality of our programs while adhering to our Islamic criteria.
