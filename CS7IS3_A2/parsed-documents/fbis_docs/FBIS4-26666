The Chang Jiang River Shipping Corporation (Group) plans to extend its navigation routes both to the east and west along the country's longest river, so that foreign vessels can directly transport their cargoes to the inland areas. As the first trial shipping enterprise group designated by the State Council, the corporation now has 110,000 employees and 2,548 ships, with fixed assets of 5.26 billion yuan (about 650 million U.S. dollars). Its annual handling capacity of goods is 80 million tons, 51 percent of the total along the Yangtze. It can also carry 35 million passengers a year, 99 percent of the total. China has given approval to 13 Chang Jiang ports to open to foreign vessels. Now 10,000-dwt [deadweight ton] ships can reach Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu Province, and 5,000-dwt ships can anchor at Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province. By the end of March this year more than 3,000 foreign ships had entered the Yangtze. Over 50 Chang Jiang ports in Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi and Hubei provinces have established shipping ties with 50 foreign counterparts. The Chang Jiang flows 6,300 km from the Qinghai-Tibet plateau to Shanghai, where it empties into the sea. The river is the third-longest in the world, after the Nile and the Amazon.
