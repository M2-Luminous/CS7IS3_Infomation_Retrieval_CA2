FR940819-1-00002 FR940819-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Farmers Home Administration 7 CFR Part 1924 RIN 0575&hyph;AA88 Construction and Repair AGENCY: Farmers Home Administration, USDA. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) proposes to amend its Planning and Performing Site Development Work regulation. This proposal is consistent with Section 716 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 which amended Section 535 of the Housing Act of 1949 to allow the Secretary to accept subdivisions that have been approved by local, county or State agencies. FmHA will no longer review or approve subdivisions, but will review individual sites for the program. This action is consistent with similar actions being proposed or enacted by HUD and VA. A good site approval authority will allow FmHA to bring into the program many low cost homes in subdivisions that have already been developed. Many of these were not previously reached because the seller would not, or could not afford to furnish FmHA all the required data for a total subdivision approval. To assure that lower income people, particularly minorities and single women head-of-households, are afforded quality sites, subdivisions must meet the community standards and the sites must meet FmHA's site underwriting criteria. Environmental reviews will be required on a site by site basis and cumulative effects will be addressed when indicated. DATES: Comments should be received on or before October 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit written comments in duplicate to the Office of the Chief, Regulation Analysis and Control Branch, Farmers Home Administration, USDA, room 6348, South Agriculture Building, 14th and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20250. All written comments will be available for public inspection at the above address during regular work hours. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Billy Chapman, Senior Loan Specialist, Farmers Home Administration, USDA, Room 5334&hyph;S, South Agriculture Building, 14th and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20250, telephone (202) 720&hyph;1485. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Classification This rule has been determined to be not-significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.
