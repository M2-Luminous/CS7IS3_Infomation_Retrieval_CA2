According to Zhang Jiakun, deputy governor of the province, Fujian plans to pour 300 billion yuan (about 34 billion U.S. dollars) in the upcoming six years into the construction of such infrastructure projects as airports, harbors, railways, highway, telecommunications and power plants. In addition, the province is to push ahead with reforms of the systems of banking, finance and foreign currency exchange, and simplify the procedures for foreign investment so as to attract more investment from overseas. Situated on China's southeast coast facing Taiwan across the Taiwan straits, Fujian is the ancestral home of eight million Overseas Chinese and 800,000 residents from Hong Kong and Macao. Some 80 percent of the population of Taiwan can trace their roots to the province. Deemed a frontier for national defence, however, Fujian benefited little from the state economically in the first two decades after the people's republic was founded in 1949. With the introduction of the policy of opening up to the outside world and the easing of tensions across the Taiwan straits, the province spent a total of 15 billion yuan (about 1.78 billion U.S. dollars) during the 13 years from 1979 to 1992 on energy, raw materials, communications and telecommunications projects. A total of 13 such projects went into production last year alone. Now the province's three airports -- in this provincial capital, Xiamen and Wuyishan -- boast over 70 routes linking it with all the major Chinese cities as well as Hong Kong, Singapore, the Philippines and Malaysia. Its 400 harbors of various sizes connect the province with Hong Kong, Macao, Singapore, Japan and Thailand. Modern railway and highway transportation and telecommunications facilities make the province an increasingly attractive spot for overseas investment along with an ample power supply. Along with improved infrastructure, various organizations have sprung up in Fujian to help foreign investors with registration, hard currency adjustment, insurance and supply of production materials. The move has proved effective as the province had approved the setting up of 12,797 overseas-funded enterprises by the end of 1993, with a total contractual investment of 22.52 billion U.S. dollars. Nearly six billion U.S. dollars of this has actually been used, making up ten percent of the country's total foreign investment. In the first quarter of this year the province attracted 626 million U.S. dollars in overseas investment and exported 1.45 billion U.S. dollars-worth of products, representing increases of 52.1 and 42, 8 percent, respectively. To accelerate its economic development, Fujian has further drawn up policies to encourage overseas investment in infrastructure construction and push ahead with reform in various sectors so as to meet the international standards of economic development. The province is also busy working out regulations to protect the legal rights of overseas investors.
