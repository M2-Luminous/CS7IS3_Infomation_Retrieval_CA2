He said that according to a protocol signed with Belarussian First Deputy Defense Minister Aleksandr Tushinskiy Thursday all contracts between the two countries' military enterprises will be concluded directly, without mediators. This will enable both countries to significantly reduce their military expenditures. For his part, Tushinskiy pointed to the importance of the agreement to start bilateral consultations on the utilization of components of the fuel used for surface-to-air missiles and bombs. At present, Belarus lacks its own technologies and equipment for this, Tushinskiy said. Representatives of the two countries' commands supported the creation of joint military enterprises and financial and industrial groups to manufacture a wide range of products.
