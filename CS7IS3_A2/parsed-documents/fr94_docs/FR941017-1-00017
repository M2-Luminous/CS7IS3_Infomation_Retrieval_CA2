FR941017-1-00017 FR941017-1-00001 The Commission requests public comment on the draft regulatory analysis. Comments on the draft analysis may be submitted to the NRC as indicated under the ADDRESSES heading. XIV. Regulatory Flexibility Certification In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Commission certifies that this proposed regulation will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This proposed regulation affects only the licensing and operation of nuclear power plants. Nuclear power plant site applicants do not fall within the definition of small businesses as defined in Section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632), the Small Business Size Standards of the Small Business Administrator (13 CFR part 121), or the Commission's Size Standards (56 FR 56671; November 6, 1991). XV. Backfit Analysis The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this proposed regulation, and therefore, a backfit analysis is not required for this proposed regulation because these amendments do not involve any provisions that would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1). The proposed regulation would apply only to applicants for future nuclear power plant construction permits, preliminary design approval, final design approval, manufacturing licenses, early site reviews, operating licenses, and combined operating licenses.
