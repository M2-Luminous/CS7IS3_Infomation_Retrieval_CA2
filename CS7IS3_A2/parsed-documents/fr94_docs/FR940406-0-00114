FR940406-0-00114 FR940406-0-00011 The second issue pertained to the unstabilized condition of the vapor storage canister(s) prior to SEA testing. In the NPRM, EPA proposed that the canisters of SEA vehicles be stabilized through a bench procedure, prior to refueling emissions testing, to help account for any large differences that may exist between an unused canister and a broken-in (aged) canister. Most manufacturers commented that artificially aging canisters prior to emissions testing using either the procedure in the 1987 proposal or the evaporative emissions rulemaking is inconsistent with SEA testing and that performing the aging process would significantly add to the time needed to complete testing. This would make it difficult to conduct the correct number of tests per twenty-four hour period as proposed by ยง86.608(g) for LDVs and ยง86.1008(g)(3) for LDTs. Additionally, several manufacturers indicated that if their vehicles were to undergo the entire refueling test procedure (with all of the necessary preconditioning drive-downs), the vehicles may accumulate too many miles to be sold as new. EPA agrees that the proposed bench-aging procedure, as well as the updated procedure, adds significant time to SEA testing and, therefore, this final rule does not include an artificial aging procedure. EPA would have preferred to include an aged canister in the SEA test requirement, but at this point sees no practical way to incorporate the aged canister requirement and also address the manufacturers' concerns. Manufacturers are required to perform the complete refueling test with new canisters for both integrated and non-integrated designs. However, if manufacturers still have concerns about conducting the required number of tests per twenty-four hour period or accumulating too much mileage, they may, upon EPA approval, perform the seal test described in Section C above, for either integrated or non-integrated designs, during an SEA. The seal test is aimed at verifying the integrity of fillpipe seals and vapor lines and eliminates consideration of potential canister emissions by thoroughly bench purging the canister prior to the refueling event. The canister preconditioning and preparatory driving are also eliminated, allowing manufacturers to complete testing without the additional mileage accumulation associated with the full test. Finally, the same 0.20 g/gal standard would apply and failure of the seal test would be considered equivalent to failing the full refueling emissions test. During an SEA, manufacturers will test selected SEA vehicles until a pass or fail decision has been reached for both the exhaust emission test and the refueling test. The 0.20 g/gal refueling standard is subject to 40 percent Acceptable Quality Level, which is the same criteria used for exhaust emissions. 3. Nonconformance Penalties (NCPs) In the regulations governing NCPs (40 CFR 86.1103&hyph;87), EPA specifies the criteria which must be met before an NCP will be made available for a new emission standard applicable to any subclass of heavy-duty vehicles (i.e., vehicles with a GVWR in excess of 6000 lbs, including the LDTs with a GVWR between 6,001 and 8,500 lbs. which are covered in this regulation (HLDTs)). As described in those regulations, an NCP may be established for a new emission standard if substantial work will be required to meet the new standard and a technological laggard is likely to exist. Substantial work means the application of technology not previously used in a vehicle class or subclass or the significant modification of existing technology or design parameters.
