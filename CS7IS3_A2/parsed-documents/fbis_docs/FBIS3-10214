The peaceful occupation, in which dozens of workers and peasants are participating, was undertaken after it was rumored that the candidacy of Antonio Ponce, MPD candidate for deputy from the northern Andean Province of Imbabura, was going to be disqualified. MPD leader John Pule accused the TSE members, who belong to populist, Social Democratic, and rightist parties, of trying to disqualify that candidacy. Nevertheless, he did not explain the reason for that fear. Acting TSE President Medardo Oleas and some TSE members are meeting with the leaders of the building's occupiers, which is located in a residential area in northern Quito, to try to solve the problem. The TSE is finalizing the details of the legislative, municipal, and provincial elections that will be held in three months. These will include a plebiscite on several constitutional reforms announced yesterday by Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen.
