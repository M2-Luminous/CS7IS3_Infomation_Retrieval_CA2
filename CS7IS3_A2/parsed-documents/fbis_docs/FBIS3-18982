RAI asked a group of researchers from the University of Pavia to monitor the coverage given to the issues and the protagonists of the election campaign for nine days, from 25 February to 5 March. Programs scrutinized included news bulletins, debates, open forums, and light entertainment programs. Dario La Ruffa reports: First of all, it should be said that the rules drawn up for the general election have limited political news coverage, especially on the Fininvest channels. Before the official start of the campaign the Fininvest channels allowed parties and candidates on average four times more space than during the 25 February to 5 March period; RAI remained consistent. Let us see who was given the most coverage on news bulletins between the end of February and the beginning of March: The Liberal-Democratic [Forza Italia-Northern League-National Alliance, etc.] grouping -- excluding Radical leader Marco Pannella -- obtained 33.1 percent of political coverage on RAI. They obtained 41.6 percent of coverage on Fininvest channels. The Progressive Alliance [Democratic Party of the Left-Network- Greens, etc.] obtained 30.5 percent of coverage on RAI news bulletins and 32.7 percent on Fininvest. The center grouping -- the Pact for Italy and the Italian Popular Party -- obtained 25.0 percent of the coverage on RAI and 17.9 percent on the Fininvest channels. Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia was the single party that obtained the most coverage on RAI news bulletins: 21.6 percent of the relevant air time. The PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] obtained almost the same amount of coverage: 21.5 percent. The gap was much larger on the Fininvest channels: Forza Italia obtained 29.2 percent of coverage and the PDS received 21.2 percent. [passage omitted]
