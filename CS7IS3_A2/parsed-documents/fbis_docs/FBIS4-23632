Abiola. The police declared Chief Abiola wanted on Saturday [11 June] and asked anyone with information about his whereabouts to give such information to the nearest police station or security agency. A statement by the police in Lagos said that it has been established that the activities of Chief Abiola and his clique transcended the quest for the actualization of the 12 June phenomenon. The police stated that the activities included well laid down plans to cause public disorder, breakdown of law and order, and forceful overthrow of the Federal Military Government. It added that their activities had enjoyed the tacit support of linkages of some foreign missions in Lagos. The police said all efforts made to invite Chief M.K.O. Abiola to clarify issues on current investigations had failed. It also said that investigations are being conducted in the premises of some media houses suspected to be storing some arms as part of a grand design to force a change of government.
