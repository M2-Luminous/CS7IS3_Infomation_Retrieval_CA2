Speaking to our correspondent Sheli Yehimovich this morning, Minister Peres said that although 'Arafat has the right to reject the Cairo agreement, this rejection leads to the conclusion that a meeting would be pointless. He added that Palestinian rivalries are hurting the main goal of advancing toward peace, which should be put before squabbles. Mr. Peres noted that Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas], head of the Palestinian delegation, is the one who should have spoken about the Cairo agreement, but after confirming the existence of the agreement in a television interview, Abu-Mazin became mute and Nabil Sha'th took the floor. Referring to Knesset Member Dalya Itzik's proposal to give up the Qatif Bloc in exchange for the Palestinians' agreeing to reduce the Jericho area, Minister Peres said he is categorically opposed to this.
