As you well know, all the urban and rural prefectures and one tenth of the cities have a kohsetsushi (Technology Upgrading Center) located in it. The total number of researchers is about 15,000. This number is 1.5 times the number at national research institutes, excluding universities, and is in no way a small number. Also, in contrast to the high concentration of the researchers of private, national, and special corporations in the Tokyo metropolitan district, naturally, these researchers are distributed throughout the regional areas. In kohsetsushi, 4,200 to 4,300 people, a little less than 30% of the total, are in the so-called industrial system that belongs to a commercial and industrial department. The number of researchers at the kohsetsushi in the Chugoku region is about 320 people, 7 to 8% of the national total. Even when looked at in terms of the percentage of the total population and industrial shipping nationwide, this is an adequate number. Industrial kohsetsushi centers were positioned as organizations to provide technical support primarily to small- and medium-sized enterprises in regional areas. When support of the advance of Japan's industrial modernization is considered historically, they have played a major role in the introduction of advanced technology primarily from Europe and the United States to regional small- and medium-sized enterprises and support industrial modernization in Japan. The kohsetsushi center which has developed throughout the country is a uniquely Japanese institution. In the past they were closely studied by developing countries, primarily in Asia, but recently, advanced countries in Europe and the United States have shown a heightened interest in them. Even the difficult to pronounce Japanese word ``kohsetsushi,'' which is how they are generally referred to in Japan, is used unchanged in English; it even appeared in the campaign promise of President Clinton for a policy of industrial support. This seems to be the result of the recent economic development in Japan being viewed with amazement by other countries and its source being carefully investigated. When something like this is heard, the view of foreign countries will truly continue to change. Recently, the promotion of science and technology in regional areas throughout the country has been stressed. Technology in the prefectures is being advocated and the Government Industrial Research Institutes are continuing to be transformed into industrial technology centers in many prefectures. The kohsetsushi is also in a transition period. To summarize this trend, it is research directed and research centered. The work of the kohsetsushi is roughly classified into the three pillars of research and development, technological leadership, and requested testing; now, the shift is towards research and development. This demonstrates that within the move in Japan towards more advanced industrial technology, the major switch is from the technical guidance support of the past by the kohsetsushi centers to support for research and development; that is, the objective is to nurture small- and medium-sized enterprises that have technical development strength. In order to do this, various reforms such as cultivating human resources that have a high research potential and improving the research content are moving forward. Let me introduce some characteristic cases from Fukuoka prefecture where I used to work. (1) Along with converting four research institutes that all had regional names into research laboratories that carry the names of technical fields in 1990, a planning and control department was established to conduct overall planning and coordination. In addition, an industrial technology center that integrates the organization was started. As an organization with a degree of independence and self-reliance from the main office, the center's head was ranked at the assistant director level in the administration. (2) For the past several years, many people have been retiring so six new people were hired in 1991, and six to seven new people are being employed each year. On average, the retirees graduated from technical high schools, while the people entering were trained at national universities like Kyushu Technical University, and two have received doctorates. Most of the applicants are skilled and about half have business experience. Academic credentials are improving rapidly. (3) As for the research content, support for the commercialization of products is hidden in the shadows. Fundamental and advanced themes related to food allergies, synthetic bimolecular films, clathrate compounds, and new glass are becoming prevalent. These themes are being actively pushed forward by young researchers primarily in regional universities and national institutes in cooperation with very enthusiastic small- and medium-sized enterprises. The shift to research in Fukuoka prefecture is occurring smoothly overall, but administratively, priority hardware like buildings and equipment, and software like academic trip expenses and libraries for the research environment are remarkably scant. Moreover, a major problem is inexperienced research management that includes a lack of research leaders in the labs. Although many problems abound, at least compared to five years ago, the people and the substance has changed. For the two years I was there, dynamic changes were realized. These kinds of changes at the kohsetsushi centers have a difference in degree but are occurring throughout the country. The form in 10 years will probably have a completely different image than it has today. This is one part of the restructuring throughout Japanese society in the continuing move from a developing country to an advanced country that leads. We would like the national institutes in regional areas to look carefully at the changing kohsetsushi and develop close ties in order to contribute to the industrial activities of the regions and carry out creative research exchanges.
