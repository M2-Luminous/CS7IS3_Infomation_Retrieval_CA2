They are filling in the details and soon will sign an agreement. The Thai Government has set forth an auto policy to boost the domestic production rate for diesel engine parts to 70 percent (currently 50 percent) by June 1996. Because each of the three companies has local production bases, they will divide labor in production of engine parts, effectively using each others' facilities and aiming to achieve the domestic production rate within a short period while pursuing merit of scale. The target will be diesel engine parts for one-ton pickup trucks (including for export) that they each produce locally in Thailand. Toyota has built a casting plant for engine manufacture in the outskirts of Bangkok with "Siam Toyota Manufacturing," a joint venture with Siam Cement Group, a large Thai conglomerate, as the nucleus, and soon will put it in operation. The local sales companies of Nissan and Isuzu have also inaugurated "Naharoha Industries," a joint investment with Siam Naharoha Foundry, a casting parts company of the Siam Cement Group, and have a casting factory in the outskirts of Bangkok. Siam Toyota will supply block castings to Nissan and Isuzu, and Naharoha Industries is studying in the direction of supplying Toyota with head parts and crankshafts. The Thai Investment Committee (BOI) is obligated to boost the domestic rate for diesel engine parts from the current 50 percent to 60 percent by fiscal 1994 (July 1994 to June 1995), and to 70 percent during fiscal 1995 (July 1995 to June 1996).
