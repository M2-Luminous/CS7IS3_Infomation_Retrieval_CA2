FR940621-2-00031 FR940621-2-00021 Morgantown Energy Technology Center Grant; Financial Assistance Award To Maurer Engineering, Inc. AGENCY: Morgantown Energy Technology Center, Department of Energy (DOE). ACTION: Notice of acceptance of an unsolicited financial assistance application for Grant award. SUMMARY: Based upon a determination made pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(B) the DOE, Morgantown Energy Technology Center gives notice of its plans to award a 24 month Grant to Maurer Engineering, Inc. with an associated budget of approximately $180K of which the Sandia National Laboratory will cost share approximately 45 percent. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Laura E. Brandt, I&hyph;07, U.S. Department of Energy, Morgantown Energy Technology Center, P.O. Box 880, Morgantown, West Virginia 26507&hyph;0880; Telephone: (304) 291&hyph;4079. Procurement Request No. 21&hyph;94MC31171.000. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The pending award is based on an unsolicited application for the project entitled ``Evaluate Russian Advanced Drilling Technology''. The overall objective of this project is to evaluate Russian drilling motor and drill bit technology to eliminate unnecessary research in advanced drilling in the United States. This effort will compare Russian and United States technologies utilizing from 4&hyph;6 Russian experts. Based on their personal experiences, literature reviews, and personal interviews, the grantee will complete a document identifying areas where each country leads technically, where each technology compliments each other, and where cooperative Research and Development (R&D) would be beneficial. One of the DOE's missions is to accelerate the development of new drilling technology products that will reduce cost or improve efficiency for drilling new oil and gas wells in the U.S. This proposed effort will enable the Government to evaluate a wide variety of advance drilling technology research areas that are poorly understood in the U.S. Performance of this study has the potential to save millions of dollars in duplication of effort in performing advanced drilling technology research potentially already completed by the Russians. The development of U.S. based advanced drilling systems will permit the gas industry to have the appropriate drilling technology to develop competitive sources of natural gas in the future. The assurance of a reliable supply of natural gas over the next 2 to 3 decades will do much to ease the U.S. dependence on imported oil until substitute sources of energy can be developed. The proposed effort will provide clear benefits to the general public as regards the future of U.S. energy. Issued in Washington, DC, June 14, 1994. Randolph L. Kesling, Acting Director, Acquisition and Assistance Division, Morgantown Energy Technology Center. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;15049 Filed 6&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;P
