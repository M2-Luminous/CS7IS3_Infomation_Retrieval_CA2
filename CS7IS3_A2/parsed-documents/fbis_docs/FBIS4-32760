"I realise that I may have to choose: Either remain a minister, or a member of the party," said Pol. When asked if one can be a member of an opposition parliamentary caucus and a minister at the same time, Pol replied: "It is virtually impossible." Pol recalled that he voted against the decision of his party to join the opposition to the government coalition and that he does not represent any specific political grouping in the ministry, but finds himself there due to his experience and qualifications. The National Council of the Union of Labour decided on Sunday to switch over to the ranks of the opposition. The direct cause behind the decision was, according to Union of Labour leaders, the "Strategy for Poland" economic policy presented by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Grzegorz Kolodko which in their opinion signals a shift to the right in the government's policy.
