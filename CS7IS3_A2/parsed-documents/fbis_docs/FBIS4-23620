He was reacting to UNITA's position accepting the government's offer in general, while insisting on governing Huambo Province. [Begin Lourenco recording] Our latest offer is final and nonnegotiable. Our offer to UNITA is in accordance with the proposal of the observers in the peace process. We offered UNITA the post of deputy governor of Huambo Province. This offer is nonnegotiable. As a matter of fact, the issue of UNITA's participation in the country's government has already been concluded. It is no longer being discussed. It is not on the negotiating table. On 13 June the two delegations will begin discussions on modalities to implement the extension of state administration throughout the national territory. [end recording] Joao Lourenco decided not to make any predictions on the peace talks between the government and UNITA under way in Lusaka. [Begin Lourenco recording] It is difficult to make any predictions because there are still issues to discuss; there are pending issues on the negotiating table. We do not know how long it will take to discuss them. Discussions on the extension of state administration could be difficult or easy. The principle is that the state authority should be extended throughout the national territory, from Cabinda to Cunene Provinces. We are going to see what UNITA's reaction will be -- whether or not it will show resistance. It is therefore extremely difficult to predict how the discussions will evolve. [end recording]
