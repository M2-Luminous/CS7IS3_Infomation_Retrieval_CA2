FBIS3-44062 "drafr015_c_94019" FBIS-AFR-94-015 Document Type:Daily Report 25 Jan 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA IFP President Reiterates Non-Recognition of TEC, Rulings MB2001151294 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1457 GMT 20 Jan 94 MB2001151294 Johannesburg SAPA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Durban Jan 20 SAPA -- The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] would only be able to implement rulings in kwaZulu territory by force, Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] President Mangosuthu Buthelezi said on Thursday [20 January]. He said the kwaZulu government would not safeguard the lives of South African security forces deployed in the territory without permission from the kwaZulu Police [KZP] commissioner. Speaking in Ulundi at a passing-out parade for KZP recruits, Mr Buthelezi repeated that kwaZulu did not recognise the TEC's authority. The TEC could make "as many rulings on kwaZulu as it likes but it will not be able to implement those rulings, except by force". He also reiterated that any attempt to deploy South African security forces in kwaZulu without permission from the KZP commissioner would be viewed as an invasion. The IFP leader has previously said such an "invasion" would be resisted. Mr Buthelezi said the TEC's request for deployment of South African forces in kwaZulu amounted to "interfering in our internal affairs and compromising the sovereignty of kwaZulu". The TEC last year requested the SAP [South African Police] be deployed in four violence-ridden areas of northern Natal/kwaZulu policed by the KZP. The decision followed a Goldstone Commission report on the existence of a hit squad in the KZP. Mr Buthelezi said the kwaZulu government was "deeply hurt" by the report and again denied there was such a hit squad. The TEC this week made a third request for KZP Commissioner Gen Roy During to appear before it to report on the finding that at least one KZP hit squad had been responsible for several deaths, including those of African National Congress members. An employee at Gen During's Ulundi office said he was on leave until the end of January.
