Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, said China would be most unwise to undo electoral changes when it takes over the colony in 1997. Senator Evans was responding to an Australian Television interview to China's criticism of him as irresponsible over the Hong Kong issue. The comment carried by the XINHUA News Agency followed Senator Evans' expression of admiration on Wednesday for the democratic reforms being promoted by Britain through its Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten. Senator Evans said his statement of support during Mr. Patten's official visit to Canberra was not the first time Australia had backed the electoral changes. Australia's foreign minister said Britain was taking a few modest steps on the path of democratization. Senator Evans said it was consistent with the terms of the agreement between China and Britain. He said Australia and rest of the world should stand firm on the democratic principle involved in Hong Kong. Senator Evans is scheduled to visit China in early April.
