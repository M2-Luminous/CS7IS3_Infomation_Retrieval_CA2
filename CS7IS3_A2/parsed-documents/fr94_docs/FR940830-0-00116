FR940830-0-00116 FR940830-0-00014 One comment stated that paragraph (a) should clearly state that the year referred to means assessment year. This amendment has been made in the final rule. One comment suggested that the phrase ``ownership records'' in paragraph (b) should be changed to ``BLM records'' to underscore that BLM is not the official repository of mining claim ownership records. The BLM does not consider itself the keeper of the definitive record of ownership, and this paragraph in the proposed rule is not intended to imply that it is. One comment said that the phrase ``record title'' in paragraph (c) should be changed to ``BLM records'' in order to avoid suggesting that the BLM ownership records are the official legal title records. The paragraph has been amended to remove this misleading implication. The principal authors of this final rule are Frank Bruno and Roger Haskins of the Division of Solid Minerals, assisted by the staff of the Division of Legislation and Regulatory Management, BLM. It has been determined that this final rule does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, and that no detailed statement pursuant to Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) is required. The BLM has determined that this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental review pursuant to 516 Departmental Manual, Chapter 2, Appendix 1, Item 1.10, and that the rule will not significantly affect the 10 criteria for exceptions listed in 516 DM 2, Appendix 2. Pursuant to the Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR 1508.4) and environmental policies and procedures of the Department of the Interior, ``categorical exclusions'' means a category of actions that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and that have been found to have no such effect in procedures adopted by a Federal agency and for which neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The Department also certifies that this document will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ). The fee may represent an economic consideration for a small, marginal operation that does not qualify for an exemption under the rule. However, most small operations would qualify. A small entity that holds a valuable mining claim will not be deterred by the annual fee, and many of them will qualify for an exemption. Most marginal claims were already abandoned in 1993 upon promulgation of the regulations implementing the Act of October 5, 1992. As required by Executive Order 12630, the Department of the Interior has determined that the rule would not cause a taking of private property. The requirement that a modest fee be paid to hold or maintain an existing unpatented mining claim, mill or tunnel site constitutes a reasonable regulatory burden, and it will have no effect on a claimant's use of his or her claim or site as long as he or she complies with the requirement. The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that these regulations meet the applicable standards provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. The provisions for collection of information contained at 43 CFR Parts 3730, 3820, 3830, and 3850, and subpart 3809 have previously been approved by the Office of Management and Budget and assigned clearance numbers 1004&hyph;0104, 1004&hyph;0110, and 1004&hyph;0114. Information collections for Parts 3730, 3820, 3830, and 3850 were consolidated under clearance number 1004&hyph;0114 in the July 15, 1993, rule (58 FR 38186). As this rule removes obsolete or inoperative sections of Title 43, Code of Federal Regulations, and extends the information collection-related effect of the previously enacted Act of October 5, 1992, and implementing regulations published on July 15, 1993, this rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.
