They sent a letter protesting against a proposal from the Federal Reserve Board that foreign but not local banks should be made to pay the cost of stepped-up prudential examinations by the U.S. banking authorities. The letter was addressed to Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, and to various U.S. congressmen. It expressed the EU's "serious concerns" at the "clearly discriminatory" charges. "We strongly urge the U.S. authorities not to introduce a discriminatory examination fee in breach of longstanding policy," the letter said. The U.S. authorities have invited public comment on the regulations before they are finally promulgated. But the EU ministers said the charges, being aimed specifically at foreign banks, flout the "national treatment" principles of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
