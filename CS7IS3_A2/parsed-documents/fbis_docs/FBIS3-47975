A tribunal in the southern province of Ba Ria-Vung Tau handed down the sentence earlier this month following his arrest last July, the exiled sources said. The Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam based in the Australian capital Canberra said in a statement received here that another monk Thien Tho was sentenced to 18 months house arrest. Two other monks, Dong Hai and Dong Hy, were allowed to go free but remain under police watch, it said. No official in Hanoi could confirm the report. "The hearing was held in secret on January 5 in an army establishment," the statement from the exiles said. "The local press were barred." Vo Hanh Duc, 48, and abbot of Son Linh pagoda since 1983, was arrested last July for having "conducted activities against the law" and "handing out documents hostile to the socialist government of Vietnam," according to the charges. The abbot began a hunger strike several weeks ago while in prison and his health is deteriorating, the statement from the exiles said. According to Buddhist sources, about 100 monks and their supporters were arrested during violent confrontations with security forces on July 9 when a crowd challenged the eviction of the abbot from his pagoda. Most of those arrested were released recently, the sources said. In other incidents, of four monks accused of provoking dissent last May in the central city of Hue, two were sentenced to four years jail and the other pair to three years. Five civilians classed as agitators for joining an anti-government demonstration last May in Hue received sentences ranging from six months to two years.
