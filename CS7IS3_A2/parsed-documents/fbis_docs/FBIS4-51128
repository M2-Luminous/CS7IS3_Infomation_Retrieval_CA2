The state-owned assets of coastal areas in east China, including Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian, posted an average growth rate of 21.7 percent; those of south China regions, including Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan, 17.3 percent; and those of Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and other regions 16.6 percent. In terms of regional distribution, coastal areas captured a bigger amount of state-owned assets than others.

The entire state-owned economy is continuously expanding and represents a leading force of China's national economy. He also pointed out: As a result of deepening reform and opening up wider, state-owned enterprises have been continuously invigorated and their economic efficiency has turned for the better.
