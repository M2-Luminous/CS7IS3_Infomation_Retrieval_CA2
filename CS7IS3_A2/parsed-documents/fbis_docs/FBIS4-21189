Among the accusers are U.S. Senator John Kerry and U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno. The high-ranking judicial official also requested the Executive Branch to create the necessary conditions for harmonic cooperation in the struggle against drug trafficking. This is the reason he held a meeting yesterday with Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta. De Greiff, during a new conference upon his return from abroad, said that Colombia is possibly giving in to pressure from U.S. officials and one senator. In this regard, the prosecutor gave as an example the letter that Gabriel Silva, Colombia's ambassador to the United States, sent to Senator John Kerry in which he explains the Executive Branch's position on the surrender policy to justice. In addition, he indicates that the government ``opposes the surrender of drug traffickers under conditions inconsistent with their level of criminal guilt.'' Meanwhile it suggests that De Greiff seeks the opposite by indicating that the prosecutor's opinions are not those of the Executive Branch. In this regard De Greiff said: ``When, how, and where has the Prosecutor General's Office or specifically the prosecutor general sought something different? Quietly but firmly I ask those who have been involved in episodes to present any evidence they may have on this. Furthermore, I ask the competent institutions, in this case the Congress, to investigate if it is true or not that the prosecutor general has cooperated with drug trafficking, as is published in the same daily that invented the wanted pardon or amnesty (for the drug traffickers who surrender to justice).'' In addition, the prosecutor general said that to strive for the cooperation from another nation to be received with the commitment to previously consult with the nation that is cooperating, on the use it will give to the evidence supplied or on the legal measures that these could justify, would be an attack on sovereignty. ``I have been and I am in favor of the nations' legal cooperation with Colombia in my country's solitary or practically solitary struggle against the drug trafficking scourge. However, this has to take place within the bases of respect for sovereignty, and fundamentally within the parameters of independence in the Judicial Branch and in keeping with the constitutional and legal provisions on the matter,'' De Greiff said. The prosecutor, referring to a letter he sent to a U.S. judge, in which it is indicated that in Colombia there is no evidence that Dandenys Munoz Mosquera, alias ``La Quica,'' was involved in the Avianca airplane explosion, he said that this was distorted by some media. De Greiff said that all he pursued with that letter was for that nation's judicial official to be informed of some facts relevant to a decision he should have or would have to make, but in no case did he attempt to mediate for any specific individual. To defend his action, the prosecutor general based his procedure on a court decision issued by the Constitutional Court that states: ``the omission of a judicial action on which is based the exercise of a fundamental right escapes all justification and de-naturalizes the legal aspect, turning it into a mere exercise of power in the abnormal exercise of jurisdictional duty.'' Meanwhile, De Greiff announced a new tone in his relations with the media given that ``some media with criteria I do not want to label--that everyone should label according to his conscious and his heart, as Dr. Eduardo Santos used to say--have interpreted in their own fashion the measures that in given cases the prosecutor general has taken, and what is even worse, they have distorted them...'' For this reason, the high-ranking judicial official announced that from now on he would communicate with the media in writing in the briefest form possible and through press communiques. The prosecutor general also made reference to the situation of the bishops who allegedly have cooperated with the guerrillas. In this regard he said ``it is not true that the Prosecutor General's Office has voiced its opinion on its agreement or disagreement on the testimonies of cooperation with subversive groups.''
