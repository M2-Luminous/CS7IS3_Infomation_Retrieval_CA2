It is well-known that a divorce is inevitable; the question is what side will get most of the inheritance -- the property and constituency of the SDS. At the present stage of the divorce proceedings it appears that Filip Dimitrov and other leaders affiliated with him have the upper hand. They will probably succeed in establishing the blue [SDS] party, which many people have wanted for a long time. It is precisely this side to the divorce that is pressing for an extraordinary national conference, because they know that the delegates from the local branches will demand new elections, hoping to become parliament members. Naturally, this variant does not excite the Democratic and Radical-Democratic Parties. The result will probably be an even greater emancipation of the SDS parliamentary faction vis-a-vis the SDS National Coordinating Council, which claims to lead it. This is the reason that the Radical-Democratic Party launched the idea of holding a "national meeting," rather than a conference. Such a meeting will be attended by elected officials (mostly National Assembly members and mayors, in other words, people who are not in a hurry to part with their mandates). Against this background it appears that the talks proposed by the Movement for Rights and Freedoms [DPS] would be impossible or at least, certainly futile. On the other hand, one could not exclude the possibility of "separate" agreements between the DPS and certain more moderate SDS leaders and parties.
