SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response Title: Reporting Requirements Under EPA WasteWise Voluntary Challenge Program (ICR No. 1698.01). This ICR requests approval for a new collection. Abstract: EPA's Office of Solid Waste (OSW) is requesting approval to collect information from respondents that participate in EPA's voluntary WasteWise program. The program encourages businesses to engage in waste reduction activities and focuses on three waste reduction areas: waste prevention, recycling collection, and purchasing or manufacturing items with recycled content. To participate in the program, an organization must complete and submit a registration form to EPA. The registration form provides EPA with general company information and specifies the facilities committed to the WasteWise program: it must be signed by a senior official who has authority to commit the company to the program. In addition, each participant must develop waste reduction goals and complete and submit a one-time Goals Identification Form to EPA; participants must also report annually on the progress made toward achieving those goals in the Annual Reporting Form. The information collected will be used by EPA to develop and provide targeted technical information to assist organizations' waste reduction programs, identify and exchange waste reduction opportunities, and gauge the program's progress. Burden Statement: The respondent burden for this collection is estimated to average 16 hours per response for the Registration Form; 48 hours per response for the Goals Identification Form; and 78 hours per response for the Annual Reporting Form: for an estimated annual respondent burden of 142 hours in the first year and 78 hours each subsequent year. These estimates include all aspects of the information collection including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Respondents: Businesses and non-governmental organizations. Estimated Number of Respondents: 200 in Year 1; 300 in year 2; and 400 in year 3. Estimated Number of Responses per Respondent: 3 during first year of program participation; 1 in subsequent years. Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents: 28,500 hours in Year 1; 29,850 in Year 2; and 37,650 in Year 3. Frequency of Collection: One-time and annual. Send comments regarding the burden estimate, or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to: Sandy Farmer, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Information Policy Branch (2136), 401 M Street, SW, Washington, DC 20460.
