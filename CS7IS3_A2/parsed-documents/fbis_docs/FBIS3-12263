[Al-Husayni] The Palestinians in Hebron, who were the victims of that massacre, are now living under a strict curfew; anyone who walks on the street is fired upon. The curfew is imposed on all other Palestinian towns: Bayt Sahur, Bayt Jala, Bethlehem, Ramallah, Nablus, Tulkarm, Qalqiliyah, and all the Palestinian towns and villages. People are moving freely in Qiryat Arba', the center where the crime was planned. Even the closure decision that the Israelis claim to have made is not in force; the area is not closed and the settlers are free to leave the settlement and return to it from Hebron and elsewhere. This shows the nature of the Israeli approach, which can only produce other such practices by the settlers--practices that the Israeli army completes, either by encouraging them or by participating in them. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] There is more than one question about the implications of that criminal act. Was there really collusion between the Israeli Government or the Israeli army and the settlers? [Al-Husayni] Israel's past approach created a particular Israeli mentality. This mentality is not necessarily exclusive to settlers; it can also extend to many of the Israeli soldiers, whose conduct is usually in line with what these settlers want. For instance, this settler killed 38 Palestinians inside the mosque. When the worshipers came running out of the mosque to escape the settler's fire, the army fired on them and killed 15. This mentality--incriminating the Palestinian just because he is Palestinian and always finding excuses for the Jew just because he is a Jew--is the core of the problem. This is what makes the existence of settlements the adversary of any attempt to achieve peace. We believe that the settlements' continuing presence is tantamount to a time bomb that will blow up among us at any minute. That is why our basic demand is to withdraw the settlers and end the presence of settlements in the areas from which Israel will withdraw. While this is being achieved, the Israelis must disarm the settlers completely. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] This horrendous crime makes us pause to clarify things. How can the Palestinians be completely protected in the coming stage? [Al-Husayni] The best temporary measure would be international protection. But the final formula must be total Israeli withdrawal from our occupied Palestinian territories. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Then you demand international protection? [Al-Husayni] We demand international protection. But until this is guaranteed, several steps must be taken. They should start by disarming settlers, changing the army's orders to open fire, and, more importantly, take practical steps in negotiations by beginning to withdraw immediately from Gaza and Jericho. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What about continuing peace talks between you and the Israeli side? [Al-Husayni] I believe that any talk of negotiations must be preceded with an agenda in which the settlement issue takes priority. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Do you mean that the issue of settlements should take a new form? [Al-Husayni] It is no longer possible to defer the issue of settlements to the second phase; it must be discussed immediately. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What will the next Palestinian step be following this dreadful massacre against worshipers in the Ibrahimi Mosque? [Al-Husayni] If Israel wants to maintain the peace process, it must take these measures. On the negotiating level, we must start discussing the issue of settlers and settlement and immediately start to discuss the final solution. Second, Israel must take practical measures, including disarming settlers and evacuating the settlers from the areas that might cause provocation. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Thank you very much, al-Husayni. [Al-Husayni] My thanks to you.
