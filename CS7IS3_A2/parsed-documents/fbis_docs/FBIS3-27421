A UN spokesman said in New York today that it was the Muslim side who attacked the UN troops. But he did not denounce the Muslims. The UN peacekeeping forces were reportedly attacked with mortars on Tuesday at Ribnica, some 20 kms southwest of Tuzla, with two military vehicles being hit and five Swedish soldiers wounded. The chief of staff of the Nordic battalion in Tuzla said the fire "came from the area that is held by the Bosnian Serb army". But Milovanovic said it was impossible for the Serb forces to bomb the place from their positions 22 kilometers away. The Belgrade headquarters of UN peacekeeping forces in Bosnia said Croats and Muslims were fighting each other around Ribnica. It remains unclear who shot at the UN peacekeepers. The chief of staff of UN forces in Bosnia Angus Ramsay threatened air strikes against the Serb forces. However, the commander of the UN forces in Bosnia, Michael Rose, ordered a careful investigation into the incident. After the attack, the United Nations discussed the possibility of NATO air strikes against Tuzla area. The UN has sent four fighter planes to fly over the area of northeastern Bosnia to investigate. UN secretary-general's special envoy Yasushi Akashi refused the request for air strikes because "targets for strikes are unclear". Since the UN peacekeeping forces were sent to the former Yugoslavia, 76 UN soldiers have been killed and 830 injured. The western nations have recently asked to reopen the Tuzla airport by force to guarantee the convey of humanitarian aid. They warned that if Serbs opposed the plan, NATO would launch air strikes against the Serb positions. Observers said that attacks on the UN troops might become an excuse for NATO air strikes on Serb-held positions near the Tuzla airport.
