FR941017-2-00035 FR941017-2-00021 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY [FRL&hyph;5090&hyph;8] New Hampshire: Adequacy Determination of State/Tribal Municipal Solid Waste Permit Program AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Notice of Tentative Determination to Fully Approve the Adequacy of the State of New Hampshire's Municipal Solid Waste Permitting Program, Public Hearing and Public Comment Period. SUMMARY: Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, 42 U.S.C. 6945(c)(1)(B), requires states to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLFs), which may receive hazardous household waste or small quantity generator hazardous waste will comply with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR part 258). RCRA Section 4005(c)(1)(C), 42 U.S.C. 6945(c)(1)(C), requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether states have adequate ``permit'' programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate issuance of a rule for such determinations. EPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill permit programs. The Agency intends to approve adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of the STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes that early approvals have an important benefit. Approved State/Tribe permit programs provide for interaction between the State/Tribe and the owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators located in State/Tribes with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibilities provided by 40 CFR part 258 to the extent the State/Tribal permit program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that, regardless of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any facility, the federal landfill criteria shall apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLF facilities. The State of New Hampshire has applied for a determination of adequacy under Section 4005(c)(1)(C) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6945(c)(1)(C). EPA Region I has reviewed New Hampshire's MSWLF permit program adequacy application and has made a tentative determination that all portions of New Hampshire's MSWLF permit program are adequate to assure compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria. New Hampshire's application for program adequacy determination is available for public review and comment at the places listed in the ADDRESSES section below during regular office hours. Although RCRA does not require EPA to hold a public hearing on a determination to approve any State/Tribe's MSWLF permit program, the Region has tentatively scheduled a public hearing on this determination. If a sufficient number of persons express interest in participating in a hearing by writing to the Region I Solid Waste Program or calling the contact given below within 30 days of the date of publication of this notice, the Region will hold a hearing, in Concord, New Hampshire, on the date given below in the DATES section. The Region will notify all persons who submit comments on this notice if it appears that there is sufficient public interest to warrant a hearing. In addition, anyone who wishes to learn whether the hearing will be held may call the person listed in the ``CONTACTS'' section below. DATES: All comments on New Hampshire's application for a determination of adequacy must be received by the close of business on November 16, 1994. If there is sufficient interest, a public hearing will be held on December 2, 1994, at 10:00 a.m., in New Hampshire. The State will participate in the public hearing, if held by EPA on this subject. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be sent to Mr. John F. Hackler, Chief, Solid Waste and Geographic Information Section, mail code HER&hyph;CAN6, EPA Region I, John F. Kennedy Federal Building, Boston, MA 02203&hyph;2211.
