But this drew the response that not a single draft law had been received by parliament. Where exactly are they? Your special correspondent put this question to Mikhail Mityukov, first deputy chairman of the State Duma. [Mityukov] All we have received is a list of priority legislative acts scheduled for implementation in the first quarter of 1994. These lists were sent from both the government apparatus and the president's administration. But we have still not received the texts themselves. True, we can find three draft laws from the government on which the State Duma is working. [Ignatyev] What do you think, where exactly are the draft laws sent by the president right now? [Mityukov] They are in the Russian Federation president's State-Legal Administration.... [Mityukov ends] Maybe the draft laws went to State Duma committees? The editorial office approached Security Committee Chairman Viktor Ilyukhin for an explanation. [Ilyukhin] Of the 60 draft laws included on the list of priority legislative acts by the Russian Federation Government (letter No. 0085 p-P-36 of 4 February 1994), the State Duma has received only three draft laws. As regards the president's administration, not a single one of the 54 draft laws scheduled for consideration in parliament as of 5 April 1994 (letter No. PR-266 of 4 March 1994) has been submitted. [Ilyukhin ends] In our quest for draft laws requiring urgent consideration we telephoned the Russian Government apparatus' department for collaboration with federal organs of representative power and public organizations. The reply we got from there was that it was impossible to give the exact number of draft laws sent to the State Duma because it receives legislative acts via various channels. Only Ruslan Orekhov, chief of the Russian Federation president's State-Legal Administration can throw some light on the situation that has developed. But owing to a lack of time he communicated via an aide that he would be not able to give the newspaper any time for several days. ...Meanwhile The "Yuridicheskaya Literatura" Publishing House will start publishing a single collection of Russian legislative acts in the near future in accordance with the president's edict on the procedure for publishing federal laws and bringing them into force. The weekly collection will include laws, presidential edicts, and government decrees. In addition, they will also be officially published in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, Sergey Filatov reported.
