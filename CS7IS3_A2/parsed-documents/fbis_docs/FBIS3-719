Overt criticism of the government is already banned, but the Campaign for Democracy [CD], a leading opponent of former President Babangida and advocate of the implementation of the June 12 election results, has continued its campaigns, especially over the proposed national conference. Well, now, according to the Campaign for Democracy, a number of its officials have been arrested. Josephine Hazely asked our Lagos correspondent, Janet Anderson, who the arrested people were. [Begin recording] [Anderson] The statement says that Femi Falana has been arrested -- he is a very prominent member of the Campaign for Democracy and a human rights lawyer -- along with two other members of the Campaign for Democracy. They are Fatai Jubril and Ladi Adebayo. They were both arrested in Ketu, the statement says, on Wednesday [9 March]. [Hazely] Now, what about the Campaign's chairman? Is he also being sought after, I understand? [Anderson] The statement says also today, some plainclothes policemen went to the headquarters of the Campaign for Democracy to ask for Dr. Beko Ransome-Kuti, but he is actually out of the country at the moment on an official visit abroad, so they weren't able to find him. [Hazely] Did the Campaign for Democracy's statement say why three of their members have been arrested? [Anderson] The statement suggests that the two members who were arrested originally on Wednesday were arrested for being in possession of posters and leaflets, which had captions like: A Dictator Cannot Give Democracy and Abacha Cannot Deliver. It separately says that Femi Falana was arrested today when he had been told that these two members of the CD were arrested, he went along to the police station where they were being held at [name indistinct] and there, he was arrested as well himself. [Hazely] The authorities themselves haven't come up with any word yet on the arrest of these men, have they? [Anderson] No, there hasn't been any official response yet, but the press statement only came out within the last hour. [Hazely] And you don't want guess at how people will react to this, once news gets round that these men have been arrested? [Anderson] I think that there will be some surprise that this has happened. This is the first time that members of the Campaign for Democracy or the other groups who are part of the Campaign for Democracy have been arrested since the new leadership of Gen. Sani Abacha came in. There was an incident earlier this year, when a particular magazine had all of its copies seized and the press came down very heavily on Gen. Abacha's government as a result of that. So I wouldn't be surprised to see some quite heavy headlines over the next few days about this. [end recording]
