Another 20 cholera victims are currently receiving treatment at the local health center. The communicable disease which occurred in the district was reported to have spread to the interior region. Prior to this, three children died of the disease in Simpang Kramat. The North Aceh Health Department chief, Dr. T. Marwan Nusri, clarified to KOMPAS on 10 Mar that the six victims died in Sawang after contracting the disease. They were Syaribanun (50), Aisyah (45), Maneh (40), Abidin (65), Maryam (65), and Hasan (65). Four of the victims died in their homes while the other two died at the health center in Sawang. All of the victims were from the interior region, which is far away from the health center. It was understood that Dr. Marwan had personally visited the affected Sawang district on Wednesday 9 March. At the same time, he had distributed medication and taken water samples from hundreds of wells around the district. He suspected that the well water was contaminated by the virus. Marwan said: " The cases which occurred in Sawang were considered as extraordinary." He said that a temporary test conducted indicated that the water from a river was unfit for consumption.
