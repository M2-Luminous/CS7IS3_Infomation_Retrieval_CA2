Viktor Stepanovich and Vladimir Volfovich: a Secret Alliance?"] [Text] To obtain a solid gain in an election campaign it is not at all necessary to take part in it. Among politicians experiencing a feeling of profound satisfaction from the results of the 12 December voting is apparently Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Back in November, when few doubted the success of Russia's Choice, representatives of this bloc were complaining to MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS' correspondent about the constant counteraction on the part of the head of the Council of Ministers which, according to them, went as far as telegrams with direct instructions to sink the Gaydarites. Naturally there was no doubt that in the event of Choice's victory (the convincing victory on which it was counting at the time) the premises of the head of the Russian Government could have received a new occupant. In order not to fall out with Viktor Stepanovich completely, Russia's Choice made a statement about supporting his candidacy, specifying that the ongoing reform course must remain unchanged. On the other hand, Shakhray's Party of Russian Unity and Accord from the very start of the campaign was far more definitive in its statements: "coalition," "a compromise figure," "the premier must stay on," and "Gaydar has no chances," which evoked strong sympathies on Chernomyrdin's part. However, the current head of the Council of Ministers is looking for friends not only among the more or less decent Shakhray followers. Russia's Choice, having refused to participate in preliminary "consultations," cited among its reasons the "fickleness" of its interlocutors, who are constantly changing earlier approved candidacies. On 4 January Zhirinovskiy said that the Liberal Democratic Party would propose for this post 61-year-old Vladimir Gusev, former first secretary of Saratov Obkom and former deputy chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers, who is currently listed on the Liberal Democratic Party slate (although not a member of this party) as vice president of the Promyshlennik corporation. According to information at MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS' disposal, Chernomyrdin has asked Zhirinovskiy to propose his candidate for the post of speaker. Viktor Stepanovich also has another trump up his sleeve: Under the constitution, he may perform the president's functions for four months, should the president resign. And then? It is silly to make guesses, but the mass media are being very actively placed under government control (meaning its apparatus-"economic" half). Consider the fact that they have their own press minister (head of the Council of Ministers press service); the recent attempts to take control of the former Parliament Hour program; a certain list of a dozen papers worthy of generous state subsidizing; and the actually revived State TV and Radio Committee, directed according to the government concept. It should be noted that some mass media organizations are already confidently calling Chernomyrdin not only the number two man in the state (which corresponds to his post) but also as catching up with the president in the charisma of a "nationwide leader." "Master," "real man" [muzhik], "our man," "tough," "laconic" (therefore intelligent), "a strong hand," and so forth: the image being created is very impressive indeed. The former head of Gazprom received his high post 13 months ago as a "compromise figure." "A sound economic manager" was how he was described: It is thanks to him that our homes are still warm. A world-level manager; our gas workers have outdone Ruhrgaz and included lucrative contracts (according to experts, Ruhrgaz has already recovered and is again picking up). It is difficult, however, to enter big-time politics and stay "a mere specialist." For instance, Gaydar, who in November 1991 was a little-known cabinet theoretician, by the time of his second coming to the government had Russia's Choice and the Association of Private and Privatized Enterprises to his credit. There is no doubt that Viktor Stepanovich too has had enough time to acquire numerous political, economic, and commercial contacts presupposing certain obligations. Chernomyrdin promised to make public his ideas about the personal composition of the Council of Ministers on 17 January. So far it is only known that in response to the supposition that Gaydar and Soskovets will be first vice premiers and Yarov and Zaveryukha plain vice premiers, he said: "You nearly got it." And also that he has invited Shokhin to stay in the government. Boris Fedorov, on the contrary, will apparently be shown the door. Nonetheless, Yeltsin's decision to leave Chubays as vice premier no matter what has added optimism to the Russia's Choice part of the cabinet. Which after the latest events (the decision to build a new parliament complex and the "ill-advised and destructive" agreement with Belarus on the exchange of its currency for the ruble at a 1:1 rate) has started talking about the need "to distance itself" from the mistakes of the government, and it may be ready to distance itself too far.
