But the First Day of Negotiations on the Black Sea Fleet Division Has Ended Inconclusively"] [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] The current situation has been commented on by Aleksey Kalinin, former Black Sea Fleet commander; and Valeriy Volodin, chairman of the Coordinating Council of the Black Sea Fleet Officers Assemblies. The keynote of their statements was the impossibility of dividing the fleet. But if the presidents so wish, then both the main and all the other Black Sea Fleet bases must remain in Crimea. As for the Ukraine Navy base, both Kalinin and Volodin, as well as other Black Sea Fleet representatives, persistently urged Pavel Grachev not to allow its deployment in any of Crimea's populated areas. Kalinin proposed that the Ukraine Navy headquarters and its installations be located in Odessa, Nikolayev, or Ochakov, but "in no circumstances in Crimea." Summing up the results of the meeting, Russian Federation Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said that he has taken note of everything that was said and that "we must have 80 percent of the fleet, and then it will be a sound fleet. We shall stick to our guns." [passage omitted] Reliable sources say that the Ukrainian side has expressed its readiness to lease Sevastopol to Russia for five years, as its main Black Sea Fleet base, with a subsequent extension of the term; and to withdraw the Ukraine Navy Headquarters and other installations from Sevastopol. Kiev, however, insists that Black Sea Fleet units leave the cities of Izmail, Ochakov, Odessa, and Nikolayev, as well as populated areas in Crimea. The Russian side agrees with this in principle but is against redeploying its units from Feodosiya and Novoozernyy (Donuzlav). Ukraine proposes dividing the fleet fifty-fifty, so that 15 to 20 percent of battleships and auxiliary vessels go to the Ukraine Navy while the remaining part (30 to 35 percent) Kiev promises to transfer to Russia on mutually beneficial terms. Yesterday at 1200 talks began at the Black Sea Fleet Headquarters between the defense ministers of Russia, Army General Pavel Grachev; and of Ukraine, Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy. Radetskyy declared that the negotiations cannot proceed with the participation or even in the presence of Yuriy Meshkov, president of the Republic of Crimea; or Viktor Semenov, chairman of the Sevastopol City Council. Meshkov and Semenov left the room. According to information in possession of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent, the president of the Crimean Republic has left for Simferopol. [passage omitted]
