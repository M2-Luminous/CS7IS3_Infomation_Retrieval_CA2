Japan will stop loans and investment to Haiti's military authorities in line with U.N. Security Council Resolution 917, adopted on May 6, Foreign Ministry officials said. The Japanese Government has already banned flights between Japan and Haiti except for regular passenger flights, and has also taken measures to prevent Haiti military leaders from entering Japan, under the U.N. sanctions, it said. Tokyo will also abide by a trade embargo against the Caribbean state which takes effect at Saturday midnight, it said. Foreign Ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada said in a statement that Japan strongly hopes leaders of the Haiti military will take immediate steps to restore democracy. The Security Council unanimously voted on May 6 to tighten sanctions against Haiti's military rulers to force them to allow the return of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and restore democracy. The resolution calls for banning entry of Haiti military leaders into all U.N. member countries, and embargoes exports to Haiti except for medical goods and food. It also recommends U.N. member countries to ensure that the Haiti military and its leaders cannot use their funds and financial resources. The Haiti Army ousted Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected president, in a coup in September 1991.
