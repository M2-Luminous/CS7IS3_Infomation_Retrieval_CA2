FR940429-2-00080 FR940429-2-00062 Commonwealth contend that its exclusion of Mr. Gray from consideration for employment was job related and consistent with business necessity 9 and safe performance of the job. Com. Resp. at 45. I reject that contention because, at the time of the hearing, Commonwealth employed two other individuals with uncorrectable hearing losses. D&hyph;13. Inasmuch as there is no apparent reason for differentiating correctable and uncorrectable hearing loss with respect to job relatedness or safety concerns, I conclude that Commonwealth violated section 503 of the At when it refused to hire Gray unless he had his hearing loss surgically corrected. 9 One of the stated reasons is Commonwealth's possible future medical liability if the individual elects to correct the condition. Com. Resp. at 45. Increased costs to an employer, however, is not a valid reason for rejecting a handicapped applicant. OFCCP v. E. E. Black, Ltd., 19 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1625 (Ass't Sec'y. Dec. 1979) modified on other grounds, E. E. Black, Ltd. v. Marshall 497 F. Supp. 1088 (D. Hawaii 1980). See also City of Los Angeles v. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702 (1988) (practice of requiring women to make greater contribution to pension fund than men because they live longer, and therefore generally receive greater pension benefits, is discriminatory under Title VII); 29 CFR part 1630, app., 1630.2(m) Qualified Individual with a disability (``The determination of whether an individual with a disability is qualified *␣*␣* should not be based on speculation that the employee *␣*␣* may cause increased health insurance premiums *␣*␣*.'') B. David Worthington. OFCCP contends that there is no indication that its case in regard to Complainant Worthington was settled when he was hired by Commonwealth or that Mr. Worthington intended to terminate his employment voluntarily in December 1981. OFCCP therefore argues that it may seek retroactive seniority and back pay on behalf of Worthington. Exceptions at 43. The record establishes that OFCCP was not seeking back pay for Mr. Worthington, and was not entitled to receive back pay on his behalf because Worthington was earning more elsewhere than he could have at Commonwealth. T. at 683; P&hyph;36. See R.D. and O. at 12. Inasmuch as OFCCP is not asking that Mr. Worthington be reinstated, the request for retroactive seniority is moot. Irrespective of whether the case has been settled, OFCCP has failed, as the AJL found, to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. I therefore accept the ALJ's recommendation that the complaint be dismissed as to Complainant Worthington. C. Wilda Matthis. The ALJ found there was no question that Complainant Matthis had moderate scoliosis, R.D. and O. at 16, and Commonwealth does not dispute that she was handicapped. Based on the contraindication for heavy manual labor, however, the ALJ found that she was not qualified for the manual labor position for which she applied. Id. at 5, 16. The test of whether a handicapped individual is qualified is if the individual possesses the ability to perform the job. Texas Industries, slip op. at 14. The record establishes that Ms. Matthis worked as an automotive parts dispatcher at Sears where she inspected cars, pulled wheels, and carried pipes, mufflers and brakes. P&hyph;2. Inasmuch as this constitutes manual labor and there is no other evidence that she could not perform manual labor, I find that she was qualified to work in a manual labor position at Commonwealth. Since she was rejected for employment because of her scoliosis, OFCCP established a prima facie case of handicap discrimination as to Ms. Matthis. Commonwealth contends that its job qualification requirements, which is this case caused Ms. Matthis to be rejected for employment in part because of radiographic evidence of a back abnormality, are job related and consistent with business necessity and safe job performance. Com. Resp. at 69&hyph;76. The job qualifications as applied essentially screened out Ms. Matthis because of an increased risk of injury. As such, they must be examined with special care. Bentivegna, 694 F.2d at 622. The evidence in this case fails to justify refusing employment to Ms. Matthis because it does not establish a reasonable probability of substantial harm, Mantolete, 767 F.2d at 1422, or even predict that any injury would ever happen if she were employed in a manual labor position. Texas Industries, slip op. at 21. An orthopedist reported Ms. Mathis had ``asymptomatic idiopathic scoliosis [which would not] limit [her] activities.'' p. 21. See T. at 447, 975; PX 3; DX 23. I find that Commonwealth violated Section 503 by refusing to hire Complainant Matthis. D. Kenneth Sherrard. The ALJ noted that Complainant Sherrard had severe scoliosis, R.D. and O. at 16, and Commonwealth concedes that he is obviously handicapped. Com. Resp. at 61. As with Ms. Matthis, and ALJ found that Mr. Sherrard was not qualified for employment in mechanical maintenance which involves heavy manual labor. R.D. and O. at 5, 16. At the time of his application, Sherrard had worked for ten years as a maintenance mechanic, P&hyph;2, and an orthopedist recommended that he could continue working in that capacity. P. 17. I find that Mr. Sherrard was qualified to perform the job for which he applied at Commonwealth and, because he was rejected for employment based on his scoliosis, OFCCP made a prima facie case of handicap discrimination as to him.
