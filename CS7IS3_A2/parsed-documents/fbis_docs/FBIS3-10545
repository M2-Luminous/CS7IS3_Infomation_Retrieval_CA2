In a news conference the UN representative announced that the next round of talks is slated for 23-27 March in Mexico City. He explained that the two topics discussed in this round were the approval of the negotiations calendar on pending topics from the general agenda and the topic of human rights. Arnault also remarked that it was not possible to complete the topics in these negotiations in view that by consensus all sides agreed that a new round of talks was necessary. The government representatives and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) leadership had planned to complete talks by Monday -- talks which seek an end to the war that has afflicted Guatemala for more than 30 years.
