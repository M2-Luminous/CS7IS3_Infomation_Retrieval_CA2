Parliament Chairman Juozas Bernatonis said Monday [3 January] "it is rumored that Sajudis members collect signatures on blank sheets of paper." In a statement circulated Monday, the executive secretary of Sajudis, Jurgis Razma, said the organization's board never even discussed a possibility to start collecting signatures for a referendum. Razma said regional branches of Sajudis have not been authorized to deal with the matter either.
