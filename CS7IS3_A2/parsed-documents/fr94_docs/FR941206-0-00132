FR941206-0-00132 FR941206-0-00018 Operating north and south of 36 ○00 N. lat.: This action results in different trip limits south and north of 36 ○00 N. lat.; the trip limits for thornyheads and Dover sole south of 36 ○00 N. lat. are less restrictive. It also closes all commercial fishing for sablefish north of 36 ○00 N. lat.; and current trip limits for trawl and nontrawl gear are unchanged south of 36 ○00 N. lat. This raises questions about the application of trip limits and the sablefish closure for vessels that operate both north and south of 36 ○00 N. lat. during December 1994. The trip limits and sablefish closure will be applied in much the same way as the trip limits for bocaccio and the Sebastes complex are applied north and south of Cape Mendocino, CA (59 FR 46002, September 6, 1994). In the limited entry fishery, a vessel that fishes for any species north of 36 ○00 N. lat. during the month is subject to, for the entire month, the closure for trawl-caught sablefish and the trip limits for Dover sole and thornyheads caught north of 36 ○00 N. lat., no matter where the fish are possessed or landed. Similarly, if a vessel fishes for Dover sole and thornyheads south of 36 ○00 N. lat. and possesses or lands them north of 36 ○00 N. lat., the northern limits apply to that vessel for the entire month. No vessel may possess or land sablefish north of 36 ○00 N. lat. during December, no matter where the fish are harvested. In the limited entry nontrawl and open access fisheries for sablefish, the daily trip limit and closure would be applied the same way, except on a daily rather than a monthly basis. Widow Rockfish: The 1994 harvest guideline for widow rockfish is 6,500 mt, which is further allocated between the limited entry (6,260 mt) and the open access fisheries (240 mt). On January 1, 1994, the cumulative trip limit for widow rockfish was set at 30,000 lb (13,608 kg) per month (59 FR 685, January 6, 1994). At the Council's October 1994 meeting, a continuing review of the best information available indicated that, through early October, 80 percent (5,207 mt) of the 1994 harvest guideline for widow rockfish had been landed and the harvest guideline would be reached by November 25, 1994. Therefore, the Council recommended that the cumulative trip limit for widow rockfish be reduced from 30,000 lb (13,608 kg) per month to 3,000 lb (1,361 kg) per trip. NMFS agrees. Even by reducing the trip limit to 3,000 lb (1,361 kg) on December 1, the harvest guideline may still be exceeded by about 3 percent for the year. Secretarial Action NMFS hereby announces, pursuant to 50 CFR 663.23 (b)(2), (c)(1), and (c)(2), changes to the following management measures for the limited entry and open access fisheries as announced at 59 FR 685, January 6, 1994, and subsequently modified at 59 FR 23638, May 6, 1994; 59 FR 29736, June 9, 1994; 59 FR 33700, June 30, 1994; and 59 FR 46002, September 6, 1994. In addition, paragraphs E.(3)(b) through (e) on sablefish and the DTS complex are redesignated as E.(3)(c) through (f). All other current provisions remain unchanged. 1. Widow Rockfish B(1) Limited-entry Fishery. No more than 3,000 lb (1,361 kg) of widow rockfish may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed per vessel per trip. (Widow rockfish are also called brownies.) B(2) Open-access Fishery. Within the rockfish open access trip limits (see section G., 59 FR 23638, May 6, 1994), no more than 3,000 lb (1,361 kg) per trip may be widow rockfish. 2. Sablefish All Gear, All Fisheries North of 36 ○00 N. Lat.: E.(3)(b) Sablefish Closure _Limited Entry and Open Access Fisheries. The trip limit for all commercial gear north of 36 ○00 N. lat. is zero. It is unlawful to take and retain, possess, or land sablefish north of 36 ○00 N. lat. in the limited entry and open access fisheries. For vessels that operate both north and south of 36 ○00 N. lat. during December 1994 (see paragraph E.(5)). 3. Dover sole, Thornyheads and Trawl-Caught Sablefish_Limited Entry Fishery E.(3)(c)(ii) Trip Limits. (1) North of 36 ○00 N. lat., no more than 6,000 lb (2,722 kg) cumulative of Dover sole and no more than 1,500 lb (680 kg) cumulative of thornyheads may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed per vessel in a calendar month. (2) South of 36 ○00 N. lat., no more than 30,000 lb (13,608 kg) cumulative of the DTS complex may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed per vessel in a calendar month, of which no more than 8,000 lb (3,629 kg) cumulative of thornyheads and 6,000 lb (2,722 kg) cumulative of trawl-caught sablefish may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed per vessel in a calendar month. (3) In any trip south of 36 ○00 N. lat., no more than 1,000 lb (454 kg) or 33.333 percent of the legal thornyheads and Dover sole, whichever is greater, may be trawl-caught sablefish; and no more than 5,000 lb (2,268 kg) may be trawl-caught sablefish smaller than 22 inches (56 cm) (total length). (4) For vessels that operate both north and south of 36 ○00 N. lat. during December 1994 (see paragraph E.(5)).
