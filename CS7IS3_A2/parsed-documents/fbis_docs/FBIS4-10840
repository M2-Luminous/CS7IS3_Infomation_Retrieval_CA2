Council members of five Assembly factions went to the presidential building to discuss with Minister Antonio Lacayo three points on which the two branches disagree but on which some progress was made today. One point is the procedures to create and eliminate taxes in the country. The two branches agreed to establish mechanisms to do away with unilateral decisionmaking. [Nicaraguan Assembly President Luis Humberto Guzman] "The basic principle underlying the agreement is that the government presents fiscal policy proposals and the National Assembly will decide on the contents of the proposals." [Lacayo] "It would be much better if these taxes are established by joint agreement, as mentioned by the Assembly president, and do away with unilateral decisionmaking." Another point discussed was constitutional reforms. According to the Assembly president, the government is willing to cooperate on the promulgation of articles that would pave the way for the constitutional reforms. [Lacayo] "If we can reach an understanding or an agreement next week, I do not see why President Chamorro cannot sign the proper document when she returns next week." Lacayo said that today's meeting shows there is no crisis between the two branches but only disagreements that stem from the branches' independence. [Lacayo] "May I stress that this disagreement can always be settled through dialogue. We made some progress in today's meeting, which we are concluding." One result of the dialogue is that it was clarified today which obligations the government could sign with international banks. [Lacayo] "We will never set down in an international public document an obligation in the name of another branch. We will set down the Executive Branch's will. But we will never commit neither the National Assembly, nor the Supreme Court of Justice, nor the Electoral Tribunal, to things to which only they can commit to." He also said that the possibility of vetoing the Labor Code was not discussed and that the Executive Branch made a commitment so the Code benefits workers. He announced that a meeting with all Nicaraguan sectors will be held on Wednesday to discuss the ESAF [Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility] document and settle any remaining doubts. [Lacayo] "Some drafts have been distributed. Some people have reacted to these drafts. We will share with them the most recent versions, which in some respects are more positive than the previous drafts." Regarding the military organization bill, Lacayo said the government and the Army together intend to complete the bill before 25 April.
