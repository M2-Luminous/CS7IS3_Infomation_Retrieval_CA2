He was speaking at a joint news conference of the Russian and South Korean presidents today, "We cannot look with indifference at North Korea's attitude toward the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, signed earlier, and we are prepared to take every action," the Russian president said. At the same time, he said that the issue "is dragging on and there is still no positive solution." Boris Yeltsin said that "if the opportunity presents itself, this question will be discussed with U.S. President Bill Clinton." The Russian president believes that it is premature to speak about sanctions against North Korea, as no decision has yet been made on convening an international conference on North Korea's nuclear problem. However, he said, "if North Korea tries to cancel the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Russia will be forced to tackle this problem stage by stage. It would first have to issue a warning, and then the world community would have to take sanctions in relation to North Korea." Regarding the 1961 Treaty with North Korea on friendship, cooperation, and mutual aid, Boris Yeltsin reminded that an amendment has been made to the first artcile of the Treaty. "It contains no rigid statement regarding the fact that we are helping and taking the side of North Korea," The Russian president stressed. Boris Yeltsin admitted that the Russian debt to South Korea now totals 1,400 million US Dollars. President Boris Yeltsin admitted that the Russian debt to South Korea impedes bilateral economic cooperation, but nevertheless called on Korean businessmen to invest in the Russian Far East. Russia owes South Korea $1.4 billion, and $400 million are overdue debts. "This serious problem impedes the development of major projects between the two states", yeltsin said at the news conference, citing the construction of a gas pipeline from the Siberian Republic of Yakutia to Korea as an example. Other major projects include the development of the Far Eastern port of Nakhodka and the construction of a trade center in Moscow. It is important for us that the South Korean president has shown undertanding with regard to rescheduling the debt, Boris Yeltsin stressed. Asked whether Russia intends to take upon itself to pay out compensation to the victims of the Boeing shot down over Russian territory, Boris Yeltsin said that this tragedy occurred during the cold war, and "is complicated by a number of circumstances." He said that the documents on that prblem have been handed over by the Russian side to the international commission, which concluded that "the primary party to blame was the crew of the KAL airline company, which must accept responsibility." Regarding the problem of North Korean workers in Russia, Boris Yeltsin said that "every foreigner on our territory has the right to leave Russia if he so desires." Touching on the nuclear problem with regard to the DPRK, President Kim Yong-sam stated during the joint news conference with the Russian president that the leaders of the two states agree on "the need for complete transparency" with regard to suspicions that the DPRK is developing nuclear weapons. Both presidents, Kim Yong- sam noted, agree to maintain constant contact with one another on this problem, with the aid of a special telephone line. Kim Yong-sam told correspondents that he has invited Boris Yeltsin to visit the Republic of Korea in the near future. The dates of the visit, he said, would be agreed by diplomatic channels. Kim Yong-sam attaches "historic significance" to the fact that Boris Yeltsin has given him archive documents connected with the war in Korea between 1950 and 1953. The ROK president stated that he is extremely satisfied with his visit to Russia and said he has favorable impressions of Moscow and the capital's residents, in connection with the changes being brought about by the reforms.
