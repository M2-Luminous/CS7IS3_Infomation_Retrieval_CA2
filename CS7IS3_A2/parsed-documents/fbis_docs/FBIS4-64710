The authorization bill, which was approved during last night's Assembly session under Vefa Tanir, transforms the Public Corporations High Council into the Privatization High Council and the Public Corporations Administration Chairmanship into the Privatization Administration Chairmanship. Under the bill, the authority to privatize is given to the Privatization High Council, chaired by the prime minister and composed of three ministers and the chairman of the Privatization Administration. However, privatization decisions regarding commercial institutions, which do not fall under this [word indistinct] status but whose entire capital belongs to the state or to public corporations, will be approved and effected by a Council of Ministers decree. The bill expands the scope of privatization and stipulates that a Privatization Fund be established to collect the income resulting from privatization moves. Furthermore, the bill envisages that unemployment benefits be paid to persons, who are employed on a salary in the institutions pegged for privatization, who are dismissed with severance pay, and who are left unemployed as a result of the privatization, reduction in size, liquidation, or closing down of these institutions. Moreover, an account will be opened in order to assist these persons in finding new jobs and retraining them, and funds will be transferred to this account from privatization revenues. Under the bill, the duties allocated to the Public Corporations Administration with the aim of encouraging the workers to save and utilizing these savings as well as the administration of the Public Corporations Fund is transferred to the Treasury and Foreign Trade Undersecretariat. According to the bill, the Council of Ministers will be able to use the authority to issue law-decrees in connection with privatization measures for three months.
