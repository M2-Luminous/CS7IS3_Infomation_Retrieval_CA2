The domestically made 4-inch, 64-inch STN-LCDs come in yellow, blue, and B&W modes. In addition to the STN-LCD modules themselves, the CAS institute researchers independently developed the appropriate software technology, certified by a CAS-organized technical expert committee at the end of 1993. This software includes computer simulation and design routines and device fabrication programs.
