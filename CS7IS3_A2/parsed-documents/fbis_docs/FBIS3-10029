During a conversation with Mexican legislators visiting the Caribbean island -- a conversation to which PRENSA LATINA had access -- the foreign minister said this fact is the first achievement of the preparations now under way for the meeting scheduled for April. We are reaching out a hand and a bridge to those who want to maintain normal relations with our country, and those who say they have nothing to talk to us about have excluded themselves, he added. Answering questions from the visitors, Robaina said the idea behind the conference is to speak to people who are living abroad for different reasons, and he noted that family ties cannot be broken because of ideological positions. Among the opportunities presented by the conference, the minister noted possible academic exchanges, the possible granting of scholarships to emigrants wishing to study in Cuba, and the editing of publications for Cubans living abroad. Robaina also said paperwork for entering and leaving Cuba could be facilitated, because "the time has come to change rigid rules" that have always been prompted by the aggressive attitude of certain sectors now trying to exert pressure once again to discourage attendance at the conference. We believe normal relations with Cuban emigrants constitute one of the elements that can help change U.S. Government policy so that the pressure from those inciting violence against Cuba will cease to exist, as well as the pressure exerted on those who are opposed to the hysteria, he noted. Robaina said different conditions exist today, and this is why the emigrants have already said they want to attend the conference and talk about a future of acceptable ties with their country of origin.
