What do you think of this? [Fuwa] It did not split from the framework of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] politics. Last year, it was sucked into the Hosokawa Cabinet, which took over LDP politics. Thereby, the SDPJ introduced the single-seat constituency system and liberated the rice market. The SDPJ never did soul-searching for the things it did during the Hosokawa administration. Moreover, Chairman Tomiichi Murayama signed the Hata administration's policy agreement. Some of its members are getting angry about the party's approach toward the LDP. However, the SDPJ became an LDP-like opposition party. Birds of a feather flock together. That is all. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What to you think of the Hata administration? [Fuwa] The administration, which became an overwhelming minority in both houses, has no right to do something new. It is common sense under the democratic system that it should immediately hold a general election by dissolving the House of Representatives. Moreover, it became a minority as a result of its own mistakes. The Hata administration forcefully tried to increase the consumption tax and to enact a law to deal with an emergency on the Korean peninsula. Moreover, it formed a new parliamentary group to realize its intentions but contradictions burst out. We will have some troubles unless we destroy their dangerous intentions by holding a general election after dissolving the House of Representatives. We will not allow them to deal with the important issues without the people's consent. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the political style of the "Ichi-Ichi line" between Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa? [Fuwa] It is impossible under the democratic system to have a puppet government. Nobody has had such a political style since the time of former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka. In this sense, the Hata administration is worse than the Tanaka administration because Hata himself knows that he is being controlled. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano resigned. [Fuwa] He made remarks that are exactly the same as the claims of the wartime government and military. Hata's responsibilities for assigning such a person to the ministerial post will not go away even after his resignation. The prime minister himself should explain his views of the war. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How are you going to deal with the tax and Korean peninsula issues, including North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development? [Fuwa] Since we are in a depression, we need to improve the people's purchasing power. It is outrageous to talk about increasing the consumption tax rate. They are talking about finding a source of revenue to cover a shortfall from the tax reduction. But, they increased the public utilities charges before we could feel the effect of the tax reduction. Now they are talking tax increase. It is not reasonable. They have to give up the idea that "the consumption tax rate needs to be increased because there is no other revenue source." You mentioned the Korean peninsula issue. First of all, our stand is to say that we need to wipe out all nuclear weapons in this world. The Korean peninsula situation is always linked to the issue of enacting laws to deal with emergencies. This is an excuse to send the Self-Defense Forces abroad. It is very dangerous to go along with U.S. sanctions against North Korea. We are against it. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How about the prospect of dissolving the House of Representative and holding a general election? [Fuwa] It is difficult to predict because each party's intentions are involved. However, I think we should do it immediately. The public supports it, too. Some people are saying that "we should redraw the single-seat electoral districts in a hurry because we managed to change the election system after all the troubles we went through." I think that they are trying to do something unreasonable again. They should not do that. It is reasonable to have an election under the current system (medium-sized electoral district system) [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] The Japan Communist Party [JCP] changed its stand and is now saying that a general election should be held under the medium-sized electoral district system. Isn't that correct? [Fuwa] It is. The JCP is the party that was most opposed to introducing a single-seat electoral district system. We are the first to prepare ourselves for an introduction of the system. However, the coalition became a minority government and demolished this line by itself. They should aim at holding an election under the medium-sized electoral district system if they want to find out the people's intentions by dissolving the House of Representatives. It is a matter of course. [passage omitted]
