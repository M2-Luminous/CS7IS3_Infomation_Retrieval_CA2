FR941227-0-00066 FR941227-0-00013 26 CFR Parts 1 and 602 [TD 8580] RIN 1545&hyph;AN06 Disposition of an Interest in a Nuclear Power Plant AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. ACTION: Final regulations. SUMMARY: This document contains final regulations relating to certain Federal income tax consequences of a disposition of an interest in a nuclear power plant by a taxpayer that has maintained a nuclear decommissioning fund with respect to that plant. These regulations affect taxpayers that transfer or acquire interests in nuclear power plants by providing guidance on the tax consequences of these transfers. In addition, the final regulations extend the benefits of section 468A to electing taxpayers with an interest in a nuclear power plant under the jurisdiction of the Rural Electrification Administration. The regulations also make a number of other changes and clarifications to the existing regulations to aid in the administration of section 468A. EFFECTIVE DATE: These regulations are effective December 27, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Peter C. Friedman, (202) 622&hyph;3110 (not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act The collections of information contained in these final regulations have been reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) under control number 1545&hyph;1378. With respect to ยง1.468A&hyph;3(h)(2) (xii) and (xiii), the estimated annual burden per respondent varies from 1 to 2 hours, depending on individual circumstances, with an estimated average of 1.5 hours. With respect to ยง1.468A&hyph;3(i)(1)(ii)(B), the estimated annual burden per respondent varies from 20 to 30 hours, depending on individual circumstances, with an estimated average of 25 hours. Comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and suggestions for reducing this burden should be directed to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, PC:FP, Washington, DC 20224, and to the Office of Management and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503. Background This document contains amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR parts 1 and 602) under section 468A. Section 468A, relating to nuclear decommissioning costs, was added to the Internal Revenue Code by section 91(c) of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98&hyph;369, 98 Stat. 604). On November 20, 1992, the IRS published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking (57 FR 54734) setting forth proposed amendments to the regulations under section 468A. Section 468A(c)(1)(B) authorizes the Secretary to issue regulations that prescribe the extent to which a taxpayer must include amounts from a nuclear decommissioning fund (a Fund) in gross income upon the disposition of an interest in a nuclear power plant to which the Fund relates. Section 1.468A&hyph;6T (TD 8094, 51 FR 25033) published in the Federal Register on July 10, 1986, treated such a disposition as a taxable distribution of assets in the Fund to the taxpayer transferring the interest. In response to generally adverse comments on this rule, final regulations (TD 8184, 53 FR 6800) published in the Federal Register on March 3, 1988, stated that guidance on the tax treatment of these dispositions would be provided at a later date. These regulations are issued to provide this guidance.
