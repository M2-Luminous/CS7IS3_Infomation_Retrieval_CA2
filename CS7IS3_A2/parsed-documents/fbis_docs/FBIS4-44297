Details of the map drawn up by the "contact group" are to be submitted to Bosnia-Herzegovina's Croat-Moslem federation and separatist Serbs in the next few days. The group will also provide for possible sanctions if parties to the two-year conflict fail to accept the carve-up which gives the Croat-Moslem federation 51 percent of the former Yugoslav republic's territory and the Bosnian Serbs 49 percent. The Serbs currently control 70 percent. At their last meeting in London on June 16 the senior officials had practically agreed on where to draw the borders between the warring parties, diplomats said. The map will be detailed and not leave out any disputed areas. But both Bosnian Serbs and Moslems have so far rejected the proposed carve-up, saying it favored their foes. The mainly Moslem Bosnian government has called for 58 percent of the territory to form the Croat-Moslem federation. Agreements reached by the diplomats and experts from Britain, France and Germany (representing the European Union), Russia, the United Nations and the United States will be submitted to a ministerial meeting in Geneva early next month for approval. A German proposal for the ministers to meet on July 5 has not been confirmed. A G-7 summit of leading industrialized nations in Naples on July 8-10 will then appeal to the warring sides to accept the proposals, billed as the "last chance" for peace by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly Churkin. It is feared that a refusal would lead to a flare-up in the former Yugoslav republic where a shaky one-month truce ends on July 10. [passage omitted]
