FR941110-0-00033 FR941110-0-00016 The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA '87), Public Law 100&hyph;203, enacted on December 22, 1987, amended the Act to incorporate specific provisions for nursing home reform. These provisions included specific revised requirements for the survey and certification process (section 4202 for Medicare and section 4212 for Medicaid) and for the enforcement process (sections 4203 and 4213). Sections 4202 and 4212 of OBRA '87 added new sections 1819(g) and 1919(g) to the Act to revise and expand Medicare and Medicaid provisions, respectively, on State and Federal responsibilities for survey and certification, types of and requirements for surveys, survey team composition and responsibilities, requirements for validation surveys, procedures for investigating complaints and monitoring compliance, disclosure of results of inspections and activities, and provisions for penalties imposed on the States for failure to comply with survey process requirements. Sections 4203 and 4213 of OBRA '87 added sections 1819(h) and 1919(h) to the Act to specify the Medicare and Medicaid enforcement process, respectively, and specified remedies for noncompliance to be used in lieu of or in addition to termination of facilities' participation in the programs. Section 411 of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (MCCA), Public Law 100&hyph;360, enacted on July 1, 1988, also included a number of technical and correcting amendments affecting these OBRA '87 provisions. These changes will be discussed in detail later in this preamble. On August 28, 1992, we published a proposed rule in the Federal Register (57 FR 39278) setting forth our proposal for altering the requirements for surveying facilities and expanding the choice of alternative remedies for HCFA and the Medicaid State agency to apply in lieu of or in addition to termination of facilities that do not comply with participation requirements. In the proposed rule we said that our goal is to promote facility compliance by ensuring that all deficient providers are appropriately sanctioned. Termination is still possible any time a facility is identified as having deficiencies, and if a facility continues to have deficiencies after a specified period of time, the law requires that Federal payments for services in that facility cease at that time. In the proposed rule we indicated that we are implementing the Congress' mandate, as indicated in OBRA '87, to abandon our traditional hierarchical requirement system and develop a system capable of detecting and responding to noncompliance with any requirement. The system we proposed was built on the assumption that all requirements must be met and enforced and that requirements take on greater or lesser significance as a function of the circumstances and resident outcomes in a particular facility at the time of survey. The surveyors will determine the existence or nonexistence of immediate and serious threat to residents as well as the severity and scope of a deficiency to arrive at a conclusion as to the seriousness of that deficiency in that facility. The proposed regulations incorporated scope and severity surveyor guides for determining the remedy or remedies to apply. We also proposed that the selection of a particular remedy be based on the nature of the deficiencies and the remedy (or remedies) that either HCFA or the Medicaid State agency believes is most likely to achieve correction of the deficiencies. As we stated in the proposed rule, we believe that remedies applied in the manner described within the proposed regulations will deter violations as well as encourage immediate response and sustained compliance.
