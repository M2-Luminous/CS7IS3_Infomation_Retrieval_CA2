[Toepfer] We understand the German EU presidency as a comprehensive task. At the same time, I have taken over, on behalf of the FRG, the chairmanship of the UN Committee for Lasting Development. In March 1995, we will hold a conference in Berlin of the states that have signed the convention on climate protection. And it is a matter of course that we are acting in the EU and in Germany toward the goal of achieving a lasting development. This includes the energy problem, because 70 to 80 percent of the environmental problems are linked with energy consumption. Therefore, we will adopt this as a central goal of environmental policy. [Krispin] Are there already specific concepts for the Berlin climate conference? [Toepfer] We have a climate convention, which is binding under international law. In addition, the EU has committed itself to achieving a stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions at the level of 1990 by the year 2000. In particular during Germany's EU presidency, we will have to work on that, because some states, such as Spain, will still increase their carbon dioxide emissions. Only if several states reduce their emissions will we be able to stabilize the values in Europe. Germany has to prove that we are able to clearly reduce the emission of carbon dioxide, which we have already been doing. [Krispin] A total of 15 percent of the reduction is due to closing down industry in the east. In the west the absolute value is stable, which means a negligible reduction of the per capita value given the increase of the population in the old laender. However, Germany wants to save 30 percent. Where is the other 15 percent supposed to come from? [Toepfer] We will reduce the use of brown coal for electricity production, because brown coal is the most difficult energy source regarding carbon dioxide. We will manage this with new coal-fired power plants with a high efficiency, such as in Jaenschwalde or at Schwarze Pumpe. This means a considerable challenge regarding jobs, which we confront by means of improvement measures in brown coal strip mining. In the west we must act in the field of energy supply to our households and in industry. For this purpose, we must correspondingly amend the decree on the use of heat. This means, above all, for the old laender that waste heat is to be used more efficiently, for instance via power-heat coupling. In the new laender, existing district heating plants are to be preserved, but are to be restructured for power-heat coupling. [Krispin] Where can we save most? [Toepfer] The greatest potential for reduction lies in the field of private households, followed by energy supply and industry. Smaller but still important potential can be found in small businesses and in the use of renewable energies. Regarding the increase in traffic, it is necessary to stabilize the carbon dioxide values. [Krispin] How do you want to do that? [Toepfer] During our EU presidency, we want to pass a decree, according to which the average consumption of newly registered cars must gradually approach five liters [consumption per 100 km] by the year 2005, because the cars that are registered nowadays will still drive for another 10 years. Their consumption is about 7 liters. The average consumption of the overall number of cars is considerably higher. In early 1993 the EU should have presented such a decree. Unfortunately, it did not do that. Now we will urge a change. The other approach is a carbon dioxide energy tax. Over the past three-and-a-half years it has only been discussed in the EU, but has not been adopted because there is considerably resistance against it in the EU. We will try to make our legal and tax concept in the EU quite clear to bring about a decision. Furthermore, the FRG must make it clear that it has found a realistic approach to achieving its self-imposed goal of a 30-percent reduction in carbon dioxide. [Krispin] The German Institute of Economic Research (DIW) has now stated in a study that the FRG could introduce an energy tax on its own without suffering any economic disadvantages. [Toepfer] I believe that the arguments in this study are very one-dimensional. [Krispin] Why? [Toepfer] Because the structural effects are not sufficiently taken into account. The DIW report is correct in stating that changes in the tax burden are also linked with dynamic technical developments, which are considered to be an advantage for Germany as a business location. However, we should do everything to get a general consent in the EU regarding the tax developments. [Krispin] According to the study, energy-intensive industries, such as the chemical and steel industries, would pay higher taxes and the service sector would pay lower taxes. [Toepfer] But the question is how we can achieve the goal of full employment simultaneously with foreign trade stability and environmentally compatible growth. I do not believe that we can suddenly change from a structure that is also characterized by industry to a structure that is solely oriented toward services. We agree with our French colleagues that in those places where we make exports we should take fewer national measures. In those places where we have regional markets, such as in many services, we can act on our own more easily. However, German chemical industry, for instance, must stand on its own in international competition. [Krispin] What about the structural change? [Toepfer] Of course, we must support structural change in the spirit of an ecological-social market economy. However, what should be the speed of implementation and how can ecological changes be made without entailing social imbalances? We are in a situation of upheaval and we have to implement the transformation of a planned economy into a market economy system. We are making progress with that. The economic growth rates in the new laender prove that.
