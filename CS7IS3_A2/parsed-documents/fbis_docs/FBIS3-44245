[Maurison] Yes, it is true, the foreign minister categorically denied the fact that [word indistinct] task force which is getting ready to come to Lesotho to enter the (?focus) between the two factions of the army. He said that the Government of Lesotho knows nothing about the meeting in Gaborone and the outcome of such a meeting, and as such, they will never accept any foreign task force because they are in complete control of the situation at home. [White] But, I thought that the Botswana minister [as heard] was in Gaborone for this meeting? [Maurison] The Lesotho deputy prime minister and the minister of law and justice were both attending the Gaborone meeting. [White] So, how can they deny any knowledge of it? [Maurison] I think it is very easy for the foreign minister to deny knowledge of this because in the last few days government has been saying one thing today and then denying it flatly the next day, but everybody knows that the deputy prime minister was in Gaborone for the meeting with the minister of justice. [White] But the official line now is that they don't want any kind of outside intervention? [Maurison] The foreign minister assured the army at Makoanyane barracks that the government would never accept any foreign task force from South Africa or anywhere for that matter. [end recording]
