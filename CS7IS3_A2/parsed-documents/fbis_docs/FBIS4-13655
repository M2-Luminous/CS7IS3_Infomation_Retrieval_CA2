Meanwhile, they have declared their intention to continue these detentions under the frequently repeated pretext of Israeli security. At a time when the negotiating Palestinian side in Cairo is insisting on the release of all Palestinian prisoners -- be they for or against a settlement -- in order to save as much face as possible and to depict the expected settlement as involving the entire Palestinian people, Israel's rulers are intent on embarrassing and blackmailing the Palestinian negotiating side and showing its weakness. Otherwise, this arbitrary campaign of detentions, which is liable to accelerate tension in the occupied territories and not vice versa, would not have been launched. If all democratic forces in the Arab homeland, Israel, and the world are expected to condemn the recent campaign of detentions, the Palestinian negotiating side is duty bound to draw from this campaign appropriate lessons, perhaps most important of which is to stop the slide and deterioration of the Palestinian negotiating position.
