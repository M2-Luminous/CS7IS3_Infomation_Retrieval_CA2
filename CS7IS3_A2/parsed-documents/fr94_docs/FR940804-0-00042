FR940804-0-00042 FR940804-0-00018 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Part 0 [FCC 94&hyph;193] Ethics agency: Federal Communications Commission. action: Final rule. summary: The Commission has amended its rules regarding the appointment of the Designated Agency Ethics Official (DAEO) and the Alternate Designated Agency Ethics Official (ADEO). Personnel in the Office of General Counsel have been designated to be the DAEO and ADEO. This change will consolidate management of the ethics program established by the February 3, 1993 regulations of the Office of Government Ethics that established new uniform standards of ethical conduct for officers and employers of the executive branch of the Federal Government. effective date: July 20, 1994. for further information contact: Marjorie S. Bertman, Office of General Counsel (202) 418&hyph;1740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Order In the matter of: Amendment of Parts 0 and 19 of the Commission's Rules of Commission Organization and Governing Employee Standards of Ethical Conduct. Adopted: July 20, 1994. Released: July 28, 1994. By the Commission: 1. On February 3, 1993, regulations of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) that establish new uniform standards of ethical conduct for officers and employees of the executive branch of the Federal Government became effective. See 5 CFR 2635, 57 FR 35006 August 7, (1992). 1 OGE regulations also require the Commission to formally designate an agency official to be the ``designated agency ethics official'' or ``DAEO'' to coordinate and manage the Commission's ethics program. In addition, these regulations require the agency to appoint an alternate DAEO or ``ADAEO'' to serve in an acting capacity in the absence of the primary designated agency ethics official. See 5 CFR 2638.201&hyph;2638.202. The purpose of this Order is to designate personnel in the Office of General Counsel to those positions and to make the necessary changes in the Commission's rules to effect that designation. Specifically, this Order delegates authority to the General Counsel to assume the responsibilities of the DAEO and to implement the ethics program established in the new OGE regulations. 1 Under the scheme established in the new OGC regulations, most of the Commission's existing Part 19 rules have been superseded by OGE'S regulations. We will restructure Part 19 to remove the superseded sections and to renumber the provisions that may be retained in accordance with the OGE regulations in a future order. 2. Under the OGE regulations, the DAEO is required to be qualified to counsel agency personnel concerning the new OGE ethics standards and to counsel departing and former agency officials on post-employment conflict of interest standards. 5 CFR 2638.202(b)(3)&hyph;(4). In addition, the DAEO has responsibility for managing the agency's ethics program, including liaison with OGE, reviewing financial disclosure reports, monitoring ethics training, and monitoring administrative actions and sanctions. The DAEO may appoint ``deputy'' ethics officials to perform any of these functions, but such deputies work under the DAEO's supervision. See 5 CFR 2638.204. 3. Under current Commission rules, the General Counsel has broad delegated authority to provide ethics counseling, and other duties that are very similar to the principal functions performed by the DAEO under OGE's regulations. Specifically, the General Counsel now has overall delegated authority to act as ``legal counselor for the Commission to provide guidance on matters relating to ethical conduct,'' and to serve as the ``Commission's designee to the Office of Personnel Management'' on matters covered by the OPM (now OGE) rules governing ethical conduct. 47 CFR 19.735&hyph;105(a)(1). In fact, most of the responsibilities set forth in the OGE regulations, with the exception of the management of the financial disclosure statements, are already delegated to the Commission's General Counsel. 2 2 The current Commission rules give the Chief, Operations Support Division authority to serve as the designated agency ethics official for the purpose of receiving, reviewing and certifying financial disclosure statements. See 47 CFR 0.231(h). Our informal survey of other agencies also indicates that designating the senior legal official as the DAEO is consistent with the general practice of agencies of similar size. In light of these factors, we think it is appropriate to designate the General Counsel as the DAEO. 4. Accordingly we shall add a new ยง0.251(a) to delegate authority to the General Counsel to act as the ``designated agency ethics official.'' The rule will delegate authority to the Associate General Counsel for Administrative Law to act as the ``alternate designated agency ethics official.'' 3 3 A conforming amendment will be made to ยง0.231(h), 47 CFR 0.231(h). 5. The amendments adopted in this Order are rules of agency organization and therefore the Administrative Procedure Act's prior notice and effective date requirements do not apply. 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(A). Authority for the amendments adopted herein is contained in sections 4(i) and 5(c)(1) of the Communications Act. 47 U.S.C. 154(j) and 155(c)(1). 6. It Is Ordered, effective July 20, 1994, that Part 0 of the Rules and Regulations is amended as set forth below. List of Subjects in 47 CFR Part 0 Organization and functions (Government agencies).
