ACTION: Notice of revised contract rent annual adjustment factors. SUMMARY: The United States Housing Act of 1937 (1937 Act) requires that the assistance contracts signed by owners participating in the Department's section 8 Housing Assistance Payments programs provide for annual or more frequent adjustment in the maximum monthly rentals for units covered by the contract to reflect changes based on fair market rents prevailing in a particular market area, or on a reasonable formula. This Notice announces revised Annual Adjustment Factors (AAFs), which are based on a formula using data on residential rent and utilities cost changes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the HUD Random Digit Dialing (RDD) rent change surveys. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 26, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gerald J. Benoit, Rental Assistance Division, Office of Public and Indian Housing (202) 708&hyph;0477 (TDD: (202) 708&hyph;0850), for questions relating to the section 8 Voucher, Certificate, and Moderate Rehabilitation programs; James Tahash, Program Planning Division, Office of Multifamily Housing Management (202) 708&hyph;3944 (TDD: (202) 708&hyph;4594), for questions relating to all other section 8 programs; for technical information regarding the development of the schedules for specific areas or the method used for calculating the AAFs, Michael R. Allard, Economic and Market Analysis Division, Office of Policy Development and Research (202) 708&hyph;0577 (TDD: (202) 708&hyph;0770). Mailing address for above persons: Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410. (Telephone numbers are not toll-free.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 8(c)(2)(A) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(c)(2)(A)) requires HUD to provide for adjustments in the maximum monthly rents for units covered by the section 8 Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) Contracts. Adjustments must reflect changes in the Fair Market Rents (FMRs) prevailing in particular market areas, or they must be based on a reasonable formula. HUD has elected to establish the AAFs using the formula-based alternative. HUD regulations provide that the AAFs will be published annually in the Federal Register (24 CFR 888.202). These revised AAFs are applicable (subject to the limitations on applicability discussed below) for adjusting Contract Rents on or after November 8, 1993, the anniversary date for this publication.
