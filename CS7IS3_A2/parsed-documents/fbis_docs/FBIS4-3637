Between 13 and 18 April, accompanied by provincial party Secretary Xie Shijie, provincial Governor Xiao Yang, Yang Xizong, chairman of the provincial people's congress standing committee, provincial party Deputy Secretary Song Baorui, and other comrades, Comrade Qiao Shi inspected work in Sichuan. He inspected medium and large state-owned enterprises and township and town enterprises, listening to work reports by the Sichuan Provincial CPC Committee and Chengdu City CPC Committee. This is an important year for deepening reforms in our country. Qiao Shi paid close attention to the implementation of various measures for reforms and specific problems arising in practical work. He said: Since the last quarter of last year, more reform measures have been promulgated which carry greater weight. This has been an urgent demand of the situation and a demand for pushing forward our country's socialist modernizations. We must seize opportunities both at home and abroad which are favorable to our country's construction. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we must conscientiously implement the spirit of the 14th National CPC Congress, and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, to firmly and resolutely implement those reform measures which have been promulgated. We know that these reform measures have played an important role and that they have achieved initial results, receiving a favorable response both at home and abroad. Of course, to carry out extensive and profound reforms in a big country like ours, we are liable to encounter some problems. In the face of them, we must be cool-headed and calm. If those problems can be solved earlier, we must firmly grasp our work to solve them as early as possible. If some problems cannot be solved for the time being, we must actively create conditions to solve them gradually. Qiao Shi pointed out: In the course of implementing the various reform measures, we must truly strengthen the party leadership. Leaders and cadres at all levels must: Be clean and honest and exercise self-discipline; oppose corruption and work hard for the people; show concern for the livelihood and work of the masses; lead them to overcome difficulties and solve problems; and they must push forward with the various undertakings. During the inspection tour, Qiao Shi also issued important instructions on enterprise reforms, rural work, and so on.
