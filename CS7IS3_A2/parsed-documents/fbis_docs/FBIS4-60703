He was speaking at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in Washington. During the intense session, the president made a comprehensive presentation of a wide range of political, economic, and strategic issues involving Pakistan-U.S. relations. He, however, emphasized that relations between the two countries should not be allowed to become hostage to the Pressler Amendement. Speaking of nuclear nonproliferation, the president said Pakistan cannot sign the treaty unilaterally in the face of security threat posed by India's military build up in the region and its hegemonic ambition. President Leghari dilated in detail on the Kashmir issue and highlighted the human rights violations being committed by Indian troops in the held valley. The president earlier had a similar meeting with the House Foreign Relations Committee headed by Mr. Lee Hamilton. Addressing the influential Middle East Forum of the Council of Foreign Relations, the president said the threat to regional and global peace arises from the Kashmir dispute, New Delhi's arms build up against Pakistan, and India's pursuit of a nuclear weapons and missile program. He said security in South Asia will improve dramatically if the core issue of Kashmir is resolved peacefully. On Afghanistan, the president said Pakistan sided with the Afghan resistance at a great cost and peril to itself. Thus it contributed in small measure to the demise of the cold war.
