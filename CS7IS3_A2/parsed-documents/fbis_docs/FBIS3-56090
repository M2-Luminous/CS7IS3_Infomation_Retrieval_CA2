During a break, an Interfax reporter asked several lawmakers to forecast election results. The Kemerovo Region's Governor Aman Tuleyev believes that First Vice-Premier Vladimir Shumeyko will be elected Speaker of the House, "even though I voted against him." He explained his belief by the fact that administration chiefs and other House members had come in for too much pressure from the executive branch. Tuleyev voiced fear that if Shumeyko were elected Chairman, the House "would turn into a Presidential Council." He remarked for this reason that regions were at odds with the central government on both political and economic issues. At the same time, he argued that Shumeyko's victory meant overall regional support for the president and government. President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov of Kalmykia believes that the Federation Council should mirror the interests of voters rather than cow tow the government, "a line being sought to be imposed on House members." He noted in this connection that the government's policy had not been reflecting the interests of constituents in recent time. That, in his words, was borne out by the parliamentary elections on December 12. "If the nation had backed up the government's course, there wouldn't have been the Zhirinovskiy's phenomenon," he remarked. According to Ilyumzhinov, the nomination of Shumeyko means presidential pressure on deputies. He admitted that he himself had voted for Peter Romanov. Ex-Speaker of the House of Nationalities of Russia's former Supreme Soviet Ramazan Abdulatipov declared that he had no doubt about the endorsement of Shumeyko as Speaker. In his opinion, the election of the First Vice-Premier meant that the House "extends a hand of cooperation to the country's president and government." "It is important that the Federation Council's position be appreciated by the Head of State and Council of Ministers," he said. The Nizhnyy Novgorod Region's Governor Boris Nemtsov feels that if Shumeyko is elected, the Federation Council will have proper relations with the president. However, he noted that "the interests of the lawmakers, representing Federation Territories, must not suffer from personal attachments of Shumeyko and Yeltsin." Nemtsov agreed that the Council could become a buffer between the president and State Duma. However, neither the president nor Duma can desire a mediator, he added.
