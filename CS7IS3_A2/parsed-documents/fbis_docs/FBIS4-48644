There is a hive of activity here, even on this Sunday, as the new members of Parliament prepare for this week's first historic sitting of South Africa's first legislative body, elected by all the people in the country. All 400 members of the National Assembly in Parliament have been inaugurated, as well as the 90 members of the Senate, on Friday. Now the work can begin. But how will the new Parliament function? That is what we are discussing tonight. With me are two ministers of the government of national unity, Mr. Roelf Meyer, the minister of provincial affairs and constitutional development, and then also the deputy minister of this department, Mr. Mohammed Valli Moosa. Let us begin with this portfolio and its name, which is a little different to the one you held previously. Mr. Meyer, how will you divide the functions between the two of you? [Meyer] Well, let me first say that the department, as it was previously known, namely Constitutional Development, of course dealt with the management of the negotiating process and the creation of the new constitution as we know it now. From this point the main aim is support for the constitution writing body, that is the two houses of Parliament who have joint tasks and who have to oversee the creation of the so-called final constitution. I believe that our department will primarily have a support function, to ensure the completion of that task. Concerning the working relationship between my colleague Valli and myself, I want to say that we -- as was my approach in the past -- will work together as a team. We do not have specific divisions of functions between us and over the past week we already met with advisers in the department. It will not be any different from the type of cooperation we experienced in the previous dispensation, over the past few years. [Robinson] But you are from different parties. Mr. Moosa, would you like to emphasize certain things more? Would you do that through your party or would you first like to find consensus with Mr. Meyer here before you go to Parliament with any suggestion? [Moosa] Well, there's no denying that Mr. Meyer comes from a different party than myself and of course we have been elected by the .. [changes thought] Our parties have been elected by our constituencies because of the policies which we had and our policies are not exactly the same on all matters, but notwithstanding that, we have been the architects of the concept of the government of national unity, and I think the positions which Mr. Meyer and I are in at this point in time is an ideal position to give reality and meaning to the concept of government of national unity and it's for that reason that we really need to be working as a team. We've already agreed that we would work as a team and we have started doing that. You must understand that the role of constitution-making, and the role of the department, and the role of government would be slightly different over the next two years as it was over the past few years. Over the past few years you had a situation which can be characterized as a conflict, on the one hand, between the government and various other groups, the ANC being the principle of those groups. At this point in time there isn't such a situation. You don't have a situation where the government of national unity is in conflict with one or other major political party as such and the main work of the debate about constitution-making will take place in the constitutional assembly, and for us as a department -- would be to facilitate and to give whatever backup we can give there in that sense, and of course our own party-political aspirations we will tend not to voice them within the department -- but in Parliament, of course, when I speak in Parliament, when Mr. Meyer speaks in Parliament he would be speaking on behalf of his party and he would articulate the viewpoint of his particular party which would be different from my viewpoint. I think we have had a discussion and we don't believe that that would in any way prejudice our ability to work as a team and fulfill the duties which the president has allocated to us. [Robinson] Well let us come to the practical aspects of that, Mr. Meyer. The first thing that has to happen is this constitutional body -- as it is officially referred to in the constitution -- has to meet, that is the Senate in other words, and the National Assembly together -- these two bodies together must write the new constitution within the next two weeks. The first task is for this body to meet. When, specifically, will this happen? [Meyer] This will happen on Tuesday morning, at 11 AM [0900 GMT]. This will be a formality really. The constitution states that it must meet within a certain period from the first sitting of the Senate, this joint meeting ... [Robinson interrupting] Can we just get clarity on this issue. The Parliament must meet in any event -- for its opening -- now if it meets for the first time then will that at the same time be the constitutional body or is that the Parliament? [Meyer] I think one must differentiate between the two. When the National Assembly and the Senate meet on Tuesday, then they are meeting as the constitution writing body, and then they will meet to elect their own chairman to that relevant body. When Parliament meets at 2.15 PM [1215 GMT] the afternoon, to listen to the president's opening address, then it meets as a joint assembly of the National Assembly as well as the Senate. [Robinson] In other words the Parliament? [Meyer] In other words the Parliament, then as the two separate bodies, although the venue is the same and the people who are meeting are the same people. [Robinson] Well, that's an interesting point, Mr. Moosa. There's been speculation in the press about the position of Mr. Ramaphosa. Would he, for instance, be a candidate for the chairmanship of that Constituent Assembly? [Moosa] Well, what I would say is that the Constitutional Assembly, for us certainly as the ANC and I think for many other parties, has been one of the most important bodies that we have succeeded in creating as a result of the process of negotiations. It occupies a central position in the interim constitution and it has the massive task of finalizing a new constitution for this country, finalizing the boundaries of the regions, finalizing what the powers and functions of the provinces are going to be, finalizing the Bill of Rights and various other matters, and therefore, if I can speak for the ANC, we place a tremendous amount of weight on the Constitutional Assembly and you can be certain that the person we chose to be the chairperson of the Constitutional Assembly would be one of the most senior members of the ANC. I'm not in the ... [changes thought] I have just come from a caucus meeting now. I am not in a position to ... to .. you know, say it on the air, but I can assure you that it will certainly be reserved for one of the most respected people in the organization. [Robinson] Mr. Meyer, we are used to this -- there are these negotiations between the National Party and the ANC -- for example, the speaker of Parliament is an ANC member, but the chairman of the Senate, the president of the Senate as he is called, is someone from the National Party. Who is actually going to sit as chairman of that Constituent Assembly? [Meyer] I think it has been an arrangement between Mr. de Klerk and Mr. Mandela, namely that two of these posts -- the executive chairmanship, namely the speaker and the chairman of the constitution-making body would be filled by the ANC, and the Senate's presidency by the National Party. This is a prior arrangement and who these people are going to be will be left to both parties to decide. So at this stage it is the ANC's choice regarding that chairmanship. May I just add something as regards the role of this body? It has a prescribed role. The constitution defines in detail what its task is going to be, and how it must carry out this role as regards the putting into place and the acceptance of the final constitution for South Africa. But at the same time one has to reiterate this for the sake of peace of mind, namely, that an extensive task regarding the putting into place of a future constitutional dispensation has already been finalized during the multiparty negotiations process which we had over the last three years. What is indeed needed now, of course, is to implement the existing constitution as it now stands in two ways. The one is to market it to the public at large, and the broader public must get involved in it, also through specific institutions and sectors of the... [Robinson, interrupting] How? How? [Meyer] Let us say the church community and the business community, for example, have a specific interest in the acceptance of the final constitution. [Robinson] Can they get involved in committees, for instance, to come forward and give evidence? [Meyer] That will have to be determined by the constitution-making body itself; in other words, it is not for us to prescribe. But the way I see it, there are specific ways whereby opportunities can be created to enable institutions from outside to give input in that regard, because what is the eventual objective? To my mind the objective is to see to it there is a broad involvement and acceptance of our future constitutional dispensation. The second is to take a look at specific technical aspects of this constitution. There are certain issues which come to mind and which have to be examined for further improvement; such as, for instance, the Bill of Fundamental Rights. Chapter 3 as it now stands in the current constitution and which deals with that aspect will, in my opinion, have to be improved further in its entirety. It is not complete enough, and I think that all the parties in the negotiation process have already indicated this. From the point of view of the National Party we have already pinpointed certain issues which we would like emphasized and we are sure that the ANC has also indicated that they would like to have certain clauses expanded. In any case, there is a constitutional principle which states that the Bill of Rights must conform to all recognized universal fundamental rights. So we must maintain that criterion, and it will also be the constitutional court's task to decide whether the constitution meets that particular constitutional principle. There are other aspects as well. From the point of view of the National Party, we would like to see that the constitution be improved, also some of its federal characteristics, and we must determine to what extent it is necessary to improve it. And also other aspects such as the concept of a government of national unity. Our agreement is that this government of national unity should govern for five years, that is, until 1999. This means that the final constitution will have to undergo a change. And these are some of the aspects which we have to investigate and improve on. [Robinson] Well, Mr. Moosa, would you foresee that the present constitution, the interim constitution, would be changed radically over the next two years? [Moosa] Well, I think some aspects of the constitution have to change. As Mr. Meyer has said... [Robinson, interrupting] What in particular, [words indistinct]? [Moosa] Well, I don't think that I'm particularly, I'm having sleepless night about any particular aspect, but on the one hand, I think what has been said already -- all provisions concerning a government of national unity would have to be reviewed and they'll have to be up for discussion. That was a specific agreement for a period of five years. Whether you replace it, and what you replace it with, how you form the new executive after five years, what shape that government would take -- those are questions that will have to be answered. On... [Robinson, interrupting] Even the possibility of continuing the government of national unity? [Moosa] Well, I wouldn't like to preempt what the Constitutional Assembly is going to do, but most certainly from the ANC's side, our approach always has been that a government of national unity is a temporary measure in order to ensure that there is a smooth transition, and that we have never seen it as a permanent position as such. And then you must remember that it's the first time in this country that we are setting up the type of provincial governments that we have now in the constitution. None of us can say for certain as to how well that provincial dispensation is going to work in practice. Once we put it into practice, then there will be a need to amend the interim constitution in order to make it more workable, in order to make the system of provincial government more smooth. We would also find, now that we have democratically elected provincial governments, and democratically elected premiers, those provincial governments may well want to demand additional powers. You must know in the past there were no real representatives of provinces at the multiparty negotiating table. Those who came from regional governments didn't really enjoy status because they were not regarded as democratic. So that would come under discussion, and we could well have a situation where the position of provinces are strengthened, but that is a possibility also that could emerge. On the bill of rights, I would also agree. You know, there are very controversial and sensitive issues, like the abortion question. Now, the present bill of rights that we negotiated merely skirted around the issue simply because at the multiparty negotiations we didn't think we were in a position to legislate on that sort of question. It is a very fundamental question to many people, it can divide societies. On that kind of issue the Constitutional Assembly will have to encourage very broad debate in society, with all concerned groups, particularly the religious community, women's organizations also. And that whatever the new constitution says about that matter must reflect the dominant view in society. [Robinson] We had initially planned to have a commercial break at this point, but I think we should continue with this discussion. Let us now go on to provincial government as Mr. Moosa has already mentioned that. Now, I want to refer to these points: first, the establishment of liaisons between the national government and provincial governments, and does the constitution make provision for a commission in the provincial government, Mr. Meyer? [Meyer] The commission in provincial government could play a very important role. It could contribute towards development in the provincial government, and could also present important advise regarding communication between the central and provincial government. It can also play an important role, specifically in the constitution-making body, on how provincial government should develop in the future. So, the commission is an important body. The constitution specifically makes provision for establishing it, and this should be done during this coming week. The constitution specifically states that the commission should be set up within a month after the new constitution has been implemented. [Robinson] Have you already appointed members for this commission? [Meyer] My colleague and I have held joint consultations with the president on this matter and we are now in the process of consulting with other parties, and an interesting point is that members should be appointed from every province by the president after consultations, respectively, with the other premiers. So, in other words, it is important for joint consultations, and... [Robinson, interrupting] To stop you there, how do these consultations with the premiers take place, over the telephone, or is there a specific body, I believe there is actually such a committee of premiers? [Meyer] Not yet, so far. I will get back to that aspect, but before I get to it, there is the whole issue of consultation with the premiers: A colleague and I discussed if this should take place on the basis of consultation between parties, and when we have obtained the names from our respective provincial colleagues, we will get together for deliberations on this, and if we can reach a consensus, then we will make a recommendation to the president. [Robinson] You say you have agreed to liaise at party level? That effectively means that Mr. Moosa here will consult with seven premiers, and you effectively only with one. Now who is going to liaise with Dr. Mdlalose in Kwazulu/Natal? [Meyer] That is incidentally so, but at the same time you must remember that the National Party also has representatives in those provinces where the premiers are ANC members. So in other words, I also liaise with National Party representatives in those provinces, and we try to get the maximum possible consensus among us before a recommendation is made to the president in that regard. The final decision on the matter will rest with the president, but as in most cases -- and I think this is the tone that has already been set -- it takes place in the spirit of the government of national unity. This is the atmosphere and spirit fortunately in which liaison takes place in this specific instance. But to return to the other aspect that you referred to on the issue of consulting with the premiers and a possible committee of premiers, it is being speculated that at the meeting of premiers this coming Wednesday here in the Cape, the president and the deputy president will be present, at least at the start of the meeting. The meeting will take place chiefly to discuss some of the common points which also constitute stumbling blocks, and have visibly come into being particularly with the phasing in of provincial governments, and with the issue of rationalization of administrations. We must remember that up to now we have had up to 17 different administrations, according to the old constitution. All those are being converted into one central administration, plus nine provincial administrations. And I personally think it leaves room for potential uncertainties and also confusion, because in the end it concerns those who occupy posts, and the provision of services to people. And all this we will have to try and sort out. For this reason, it has been decided to hold the meeting this coming Wednesday specifically with premiers here in the Cape. [Robinson] Just on the question of being fair to all provinces, Mr. Moosa, would you in any way discriminate against the other provinces, Western Cape and Natal, that are not under the control of the ANC, because physically you are in a position to dish up the money. You could withhold money to those provinces. [Moosa] Well, fortunately the constitution has very detailed provisions as to what the relationship between central government and provincial government should be. There are certain constitutionally entrenched powers which belong to the provinces. The only thing which we are working on at this point in time is how to transfer the administration and the executive authority for these powers to provinces. But they are entitled to certain powers, and that's in the constitution. As far as financial matters are concerned, there again are detailed provisions on that. There are also provisions for the establishment of a financial and fiscal commission on which all the provinces would be represented, and that financial and fiscal commission would do all the analysis and develop recommendations and proposals for central government as to what the allocations and budgetary requirements of the various provinces should be. But even apart from all of that, what you must remember is that as a government, as a government all of South Africa's people are our people. Whether they live in a province that's controlled by one party or another party is a separate matter as such. The reconstruction and development program is for all the people. The houses that are going to be built, or the electricity that would be provided must be provided as much for a province controlled by Tokyo Sexwale as a province which is controlled by Frank Mdlalose, and that is the policy of the government. [Robinson] Just this -- there are two other bodies that I would quickly like to refer to because our time is running out. One is the Afrikaner Homeland Council. So how do you feel about this question now after the election, of providing for that, and looking into the matter of a volkstaat [homeland]? [Moosa] Well, we had -- the one thing that you must know is that the government would, and the parties which are in the government would keep to their undertakings, and we had undertaken prior to the elections that we would enter into negotiations through this body called the Afrikaner Homeland Council on the question of a volkstaat. And one of the assessments that would now have to be made after the elections is what is the support base of those who say that there should be a volkstaat, where is the support base of that? And we would have to begin to look at the feasibility of that. So that's a matter that we would enter into negotiations with, quite honestly, with those who believe in a volkstaat, but I think that everybody would have to accept the realities of the democratic will of the people, and I think that the election results are a real good basis for us to take those negotiations hopefully to their conclusion in a fairly short space of time. [Robinson] Thank you very much Mr. Meyer [as heard], in conclusion -- in a few seconds unfortunately -- we still have the council of traditional leaders. Just tell us briefly what they do specifically? [Meyer] Bodies like that have been appointed to see to the interests of traditional communities on a national scale, and particularly of the highest in these communities, the so-called chiefs; to coordinate and to liaise, and this body has also been set up to make sure that this function can be fulfilled according to the prescriptions of the constitution. [Robinson] Thank you Mr. Meyer, thank you Mr. Moosa.
