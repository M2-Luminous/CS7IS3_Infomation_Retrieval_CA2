The move follows outbreaks of rioting and public criticism in recent months over the gap between the rich and poor, and which culminated in rumours of violence two weeks ago. Informal meetings have been held in several cities between military leaders and businessmen, focusing on observing the legal minimum wage and improving the treatment of employees. Companies also agreed last week to take part in a community development programme. Ethnic Chinese business leaders have welcomed the army's promise to protect them from any violence. The companies have made commitments to pay the minimum wage, with many noting that when transport, food and medical payments are included, many workers receive more than the minimum. In Surabaya, for instance, where minimum wages are 3,200 rupiah a day, workers normally receive an additional 2,500 rupiah in allowances plus annual bonuses. The companies say the government accepts that a minimum wage of 7,000 rupiah a day would not be economic. Meetings have stressed the need for the ethnic Chinese-owned companies to pay salaries on time and to treat indigenous Indonesians with respect, in a polite and professional way. Military and local government officials are also establishing a programme of social and community involvement under which companies are seen to be publicly supporting the community, especially its poorer members. Projects will include supply of bathroom and toilet facilities in poor villages, building of kindergartens, and help with medical items such as spectacles for the poor. Companies have been told that they must involve themselves in charitable and sponsorship activities so that they are not seen as only interested in making profits. Company executives, who remain cautious about the possibility of outbreaks of violence, say that the measures are a positive way to reduce the perception of unfairness. "The behaviour is the important thing," says one company chairman. "We are all Indonesians working together for our company and good work should be rewarded with good pay and professional treatment. " Younger ethnic Chinese executives say they have integrated too deeply into Indonesian society to consider leaving, even if there is racial trouble. "We have to be patient, and take a low-key approach," says one business leader when asked about allegations of arrogance by wealthy ethnic Chinese displaying their success with big houses and luxury cars.
