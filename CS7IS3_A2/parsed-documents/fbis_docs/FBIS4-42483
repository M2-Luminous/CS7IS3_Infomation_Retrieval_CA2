Bruno Rougier reports. [Rougier] Ariane was not launched because the arm which was supposed to feed the rocket with hydrogen did not open. The rocket is held by two arms that open five seconds before launch. Unlike the hydrogen arm, the oxygen arm opened. The reason is still unknown, but there is one key thing I must emphasize: the launcher is not in danger at the moment. Technicians are now busy cleaning the two tanks. The hydrogen tank will normally be emptied by the attached tube. As for the oxygen tank, a purification system will likely be used; this should take several hours. Following this technician should know why the arm failed to open. In addition, the launching system will be examined to replace some spare parts and repair some connections. Ariane Space management has refused to say when a new launch will take place. According to experts I met this morning, the delay could take a week.
