Reports from the State Statistics Bureau (SSB) say 4,989 of China's 50,000 towns achieved an agricultural and industrial output value of more than 100 million yuan (about $11.5 million) each in 1992. Four hundred and thirty scored 500 million yuan (some $57.5 million). And 72 of them managed more than 1 billion yuan (some $115 million). Most of these well-off towns are in the coastal areas of the Southeast, where rapid economic growth has been achieved over the past decade. According to the list worked out by the statistics bureau, 944 rich towns are in East China's Jiangsu Province, 892 in Shandong also in East China, more than 500 in Zhejiang and another 425 in South China's Guangdong. Experts said the survey showed up the disparity between the economic growth in different areas of China. However, they stressed it was encouraging that 100-million-yuan towns have sprung up in relatively poor areas, especially in Western parts of China, such as Guizhou Province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, which has two towns in the top-500. This improvement was a result of the State's efforts in recent years to narrow the gap between China's east and west. The State handed out 5,000 million yuan ($575 million) in loans last year to support the development of rural enterprises in inland areas, while local governments produced a number of preferential policies, said China Business Times. As a result, the total annual output value of township enterprises in 20 inland provinces and regions was 400 billion yuan about $46 billion) last year, about 60 per cent more than 1992. China's top 10 towns are: Caigongzhuang in Tianjin; Qianzhou, Shengze, Luoshe and Zhouzhuang in Jiangsu; Beivao and Guizhou in Guangdong; Ninghai in Shandong; Xinzhaize in Liaoning; and Maqiao in Shanghai. Experts say the growth of these wealthy towns is an indication of improvement in China's rural economy since the country began its reforms in 1979. Statistics show more than 20 per cent of the rural population live in "100-million-yuan towns." They also showed these towns produced half the country's agricultural output value and two thirds of its output value from rural industries. Booming rural industries have been the biggest contributors to the development of the wealthy towns, the statistics show. Non-agricultural production accounted for 88 per cent of the towns' total output value, about 24 percent higher than the country's average. Meanwhile, a small number of them are close to becoming industrial centres, with 96 per cent of their wealth coming from non-agricultural production. The output value of township enterprises in these prosperous communities made up 52 per cent of the country's total.
