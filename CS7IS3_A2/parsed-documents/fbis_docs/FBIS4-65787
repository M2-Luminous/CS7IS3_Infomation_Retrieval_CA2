The paper addresses people who are dissatisfied with Finnish society, and who are especially opposed to membership in the European Union [EU]. The paper, THE CITIZEN IS ON YOUR SIDE, is scheduled to be published monthly. It will primarily be distributed through direct sales on streets and in marketplaces. The paper will be published by the Helsinki-based Citizen Cooperative, which will be founded during the latter part of May. Until then, the paper's financial affairs are being handled by Sirkka Korhonen, from Nurmes, and Eero Taivalsaari, from Helsinki, who came up with the idea for the paper, and who are both opponents of EU membership. According to editor in chief Taivalsaari, the intention is not to stop the publication of the paper after the popular referendum regarding the EU. Based on Taivalsaari's calculations, 13,000 issues of the paper would need to be sold, in order for the paper to remain financially viable. When announcing the birth of the new paper, Taivalsaari stated the reason for producing such a publication to be the lack of public debate about alternative solutions. The paper declares itself to be politically unaligned, although Taivalsaari admits that its ideology "fairly closely" originates from issues put forth by the Finnish People's Independence Front. Among others, Korhonen, who is one of the paper's central backstage figures, is active within the Finnish People's Independence Front. Ella Karki-Sormunen, who is responsible for marketing the paper, is secretary general for the Independence Front.
