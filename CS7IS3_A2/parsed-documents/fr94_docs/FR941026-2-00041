L. 92&hyph;463), the Environmental Protection Agency gives notice of a meeting of the Effluent Guidelines Task Force (EGTF). The EGTF is a subcommittee of the National Advisory Council for Environmental Policy and Technology (NACEPT), the external policy advisory board to the Administrator of EPA. The EGTF was established in July of 1992 to advise EPA on the Effluent Guidelines Program, which develops regulations for dischargers of industrial wastewater pursuant to Title III of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq. ). The Task Force consists of members appointed by EPA from industry, citizen groups, state and local government, the academic and scientific communities, and EPA regional offices. The Task Force was created to offer advice to the Administrator on the long-term strategy for the effluent guidelines program, and particularly to provide recommendations on a process for expediting the promulgation of effluent guidelines. The Task Force generally does not review specific effluent guideline regulations currently under development. The meeting agenda will include continued discussions on draft recommendations concerning subcategorization of industries in effluent guidelines. There will also be consideration of a draft report on methodology for conducting preliminary industry studies. The meeting is open to the public. Limited seating for the public is available on a first-come, first-served basis. The public may submit written comments to the Task Force regarding improvements to the Effluent Guidelines program. Comments should be sent to EPA at the above address. Comments submitted will be transmitted to Task Force members for consideration. Dated: October 21, 1994. Eric Strassler, Designated Federal Official, Effluent Guidelines Task Force. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26550 Filed 10&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P
