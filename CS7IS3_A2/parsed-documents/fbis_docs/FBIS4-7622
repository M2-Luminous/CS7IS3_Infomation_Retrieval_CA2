Granic warns that the attack came after the adoption of the resolution extending the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] mandate and granting it greater authority, and after the recent cease-fire agreement signed between representatives of the Croatian authorities and Serb rebels from the occupied areas under UN protection. Citing media reports and statements by senior UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees] and ICRC [International Committee of the Red Cross] officials on crimes committed against Muslims and Croats in the Prijedor region over the past few days, and on the inability of international humanitarian organizations to protect a large non-Serb population in northern Bosnia, which has been under pressure to leave, Minister Granic said that these criminal actions must be urgently stopped. The Republic of Croatia will otherwise be faced with a new wave of refugees, a burden with which it will not be able to cope given that it is already caring for about 500,000 refugees, Granic said. He calls on the UN Security Council to do everything in its power to halt these crimes. The latest attacks on Zupanja Posavina indicate that the Croatian request to UNPROFOR to ensure firm control of the borders of the Republic of Croatia -- outlined in the 16 March letter from Franjo Tudjman, president of the Republic of Croatia, to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali -- is fully justified, Minister Granic says at the end of his letter.
