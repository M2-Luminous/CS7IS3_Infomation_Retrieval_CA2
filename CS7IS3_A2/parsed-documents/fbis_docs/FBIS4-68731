For a while Limonov was a member of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and was even a minister in its "shadow cabinet." We are offering our readers excerpts from E. Limonov's new book. The book itself will soon be released by the Konets Veka publishing house. Parisian Secrets On 19 September 1992 Zhirinovskiy called me from Moscow and said that they were arriving on the 23rd. He me asked to arrange for a meeting with the National Front and with Chirac. He also asked me to get in touch with the Russian Embassy. He said that his hosts in Paris will be "our businessmen, a certain banker." The next day at 0800 I was awaken by Zhirinovskiy: "Eduard, please get me the telephone numbers of Chirac and Pasqua. I will talk to them myself." I promised that I would, but not before 1000, and besides, he should not count on me getting their home telephone numbers--this is not Russia, you have to follow protocol in everything. If I get the numbers of their personal secretaries, this will be a great achievement. By 1000 I delivered to Minakov the telephone numbers of the RPR [Rally for the Republic] chairman and Paris Mayor Chirac and former Minister of Interior Pasqua. If only the LDP people knew what efforts this had cost me! And what strings I had to pull! Zhirinovskiy clearly had an exaggerated notion of his fame. The French newspapers did write about him, but not much, during the presidential elections in Russia in 1991, but in September 1992 he remained a "dark horse" for this country. Chiefs of the international departments of major newspapers asked me "who?" when I called and invited them to a press conference. Political figures who had never heard of him were not anxious to meet him, while those whose secretaries understood who Zhirinovskiy was actively did not wish to meet him. A majority, however, completely indifferent to his name, were simply busy; besides, meetings with leaders of parties in France are not arranged on a moment's notice: "Is is all right if we drop in? We are right around the corner, a 10-minute walk." I was completely dumbfounded to learn that Zhirinovskiy and his team nevertheless made several raids on parties' headquarters, uninvited, the only calls being to find out the addresses associated with the telephone numbers I gave them. The result of these raids, in my opinion, was zilch: They were received by whichever party functionary happened to be at the headquarters at the time. In most cases these people even refused to provide their names. "If Zhirinovskiy always travels abroad this way," I remember thinking, "this is a deception." Returning to Russia, the LDP will circulate in the mass media reports of meetings with leaders of French parties. And the Russian masses, seeing among them the name of Le Pen, which they are more or less familiar with, will think naively that Vladimir Volfovich received a warm welcome in the political establishment of France, while at other parties the people who talked to him may have been secretaries on duty or doormen. On Friday 25 September I arrived at the hotel Amina (where Zhirinovskiy and his team stayed) earlier than 0945, because I wanted to make sure that everything was going as it was supposed to. We are going to visit Mr. Le Pen at home, not at the party headquarters. We drove down the Champs-Elysees. French and Kazakh flags were flying everywhere: Kazakhstan's President Nazarbayev was in Paris at the time. I think there was only one Frenchman who knew that these were Kazakhstan's flags--Mitterrand. Passing Montrait Park [as transliterated], we approached the cast iron gate of our destination. We were led upstairs to a large living room with yellow-ocher wallpaper. Yellow roses adorned the coffee table between two yellow leather coaches. A couple of marble busts in the corners of the room. The terrace to the left of the entrance provided a magnificent view of Paris from the Saint-Cloud hill; the right terrace opened to the garden. We were left alone. After peeking at the terraces, Zhirinovskiy said to Minakov: "See how politicians live here, Valentin Nikolayevich. This is how the head of a party should live! And I huddle in a two-room apartment..." "Far from all political figures in France have villas, Vladimir Volfovich," I interjected. "Jean-Marie Le Pen inherited this villa from a deceased National Front member, who left the villa to him in his will." Zhirinovskiy stayed on the subject and began to talk very seriously about this being a good idea--to will property and apartments to a party... and that it would be good to include this point in the LDP rules. I thought that he was suffering from a middle class complex toward the upper class standard of living. If Zhirinovskiy ever comes to seize power, he will live in the fast lane and greedily grab property. Zhirinovskiy was silent throughout the entire first half of the meeting. It so happened that I had to talk more than the others. "Aside from the language problem, his knowledge of local politics is not great," I wrote in my diary at home the next day. In the end he did get into the conversation. His French is poor, stammering, university-level, dead, hard to understand for the interlocutor, because it lacks precisely the hundred or so most frequently used modern words. "Where did these icons come from?" I asked Le Pen. It turned out that he had known artist Ilya Glazunov for a long time--that is where the icons came from. He had not seen Glazunov for about 10 years, though. "What happened to him? He used to be nationalist and monarchist a good 20 years ago." I explained what had happened to Glazunov. We started talking about the American penetration of Russia and France. Cultural and political. "I would prefer to eat borscht in a cellar than an American hamburger in McDonald's on Pushkin Square," said Le Pen gaily. Zhirinovskiy then bragged about his only victory: 6.2 million votes in the presidential elections. And said that his LDP is the largest right-wing party in Europe. Le Pen, being a polite host, did not argue. He in turn asked Zhirinovskiy why his party had such an unsuitable name: "Here, Mr. Zhirinovskiy, the liberal democrats hate the National Front; they are our enemies." Stammering, Zhirinovskiy began to explain that for the Russian people "nationalism" brings out an association with Nazism (not true, Russians most often use the word "fascism." "German fascism," "Italian fascism"); that Russians have not yet matured for a party name that would include the word "national." As he was saying this he cast sideways glances at me. The Russian National Assembly and the National-Republican Party already existed, and in October of the same year the National Salvation Front [FNS] was launched. Zhirinovskiy was lying. Since the LDP delegation expressed the desire (and Vladimir Volfovich louder than everyone else) to visit Paris' dens of iniquity, I took the delegation on a tour of the Pigalle with its sex shows and sex shops, striptease and massage parlors. The driver waited for us at the agreed place. I myself pass through this area maybe once every couple years: the noise, colors, advertising, dirt, and throngs of tourists are tiresome. I go there precisely on occasions like this--to show it to visiting friends and acquaintances. They, however, did not limit themselves to a passing look. In another seedy area of Paris, Saint-Denis, the talkative Vladimir Volfovich stopped several times and chatted with prostitutes, while other members of the delegation giggled shyly. I invited them all to a sex show. To a place where I thought the girls on the photos looked more tempting. We barged inside. The place turned out a bit of a dump and unpleasant, like a public laundry. Behind the counter was an oriental-looking young man, but the noise created by the delegation, and most of all by Zhirinovskiy (maybe he was so raucous out of shyness) brought out the owner, a short and unkempt type of undefinable oriental origin--Lebanese or something. The owner dropped tokens onto the counter, turned a handle, and left. A naked girl with a face showing that she had been around the block a few times appeared behind the glass and began making movements to the music. We sat there in the dark for quite a while; then another girl appeared; they petted each other in rhythm with the music, but no "sexual act" promised on the marquee ever materialized. The lights went out. We emerged from the booth. In the lobby Vladimir Volfovich demanded our money back, yelling that the owner was a crook. The noise brought out of the establishment's bowels a bow-legged woman in a shawl, carrying a cup of tea. She turned out to be Russian! "Vladimir Volfovich, the hell with them, let us go!" I said. "What do you mean, the hell with them? Let them refund our money, or at least half of it. Where is the act? They promised the act, and we did not see any act. Did you see the act, Zhebrovskiy?" Zhebrovskiy said that he did not. "So let them refund half the money, or I will hand them over to the police!"--"Vladimir Volfovich, this entire industry rests on deception. If you walk in here, you are already permitting yourself to be deceived. One way or another they will cheat you." I talked him into leaving. "Who is he?" asked the bow-legged woman. "Zhirinovskiy?" She watched us leave with her mouth agape. IZVESTIYA recently reprinted from BILD magazine a story that had allegedly taken place in Germany: Vladimir Volfovich and a Russian-born prostitute. Let this story remain on the conscience of BILD magazine. Such an incident could have taken place, but I consider its darkly sadistic interpretation improbable. Vladimir Volfovich is more of a grumbling trouble-maker, who wants to get the best possible service for his money. He is an aggressive Philistine, not a Dracula. You are a prostitute? I have paid you? Cheats! They did not give me a full serving!--this is more his style. Divorce The first time I saw Zhirinovskiy after Paris was on 24 October in the hall of the Parliament Center at 2 Tsvetnoy Boulevard. As usual, the communists-patriots would not let him in their games. He did manage to be admitted into the building, but certainly would not let him become a member of the National Salvation Front. Zhirinovskiy was willing to sign anything in order to be accepted. He was sitting in the audience, expecting to be given the floor. Zyuganov, who was increasingly gaining momentum then (he had already squeezed out Anpilov), promised everything to everyone, and to me, too: "We will make you a member of the political council," put me in the presidium and let me speak that evening. But the cunning syrupy communist has not kept his main promise. I want to dwell a little here on the National Salvation Front congress. When we speak of Zhirinovskiy, it is impossible to ignore the context in which he found himself in the fall. Here is what the political status of the opposition was by 24 October 1992: Anpilov was not included in the Front. Zhirinovskiy was not included; he did enter the building but left during the second half of the proceedings. On the other hand, 40 boyars in tall hats, ceremonial generals--most of them useless or of little use--were included in the National Council. At this juncture it should be explained that these boyars originated from the perestroyka elite of the Gorbachev period, and a considerable number even from the Brezhnev nomenklatura. Not a political class, they, sitting on the stage (I sat in the first row in the rightmost seat, but was the only one who was not a "former") resembled most of all precisely BOYARS--a social group that has done a lot of harm to Russia at all times. Selected by the voters (in the case of deputies) or by the authorities around 1990, mainly for being sympathetic to "reform"--then-fashionable among the voters--they were people from the country's past, who had an increasingly diminishing grasp of its present. They had been selected by rank, by the number of stars on their shoulder boards, loudness of voice, the weight of their name during the Brezhnev times, and the degree of frenzy in their anti-Stalin or antistagnation demagoguery. Their merit in 1990 was that they--people of the past--supported some vague "civilized" future. Such transitional groups inevitably appear during periods of social catastrophe, and it is normal that for the lack of a real political class they temporarily fulfill this function. I emphasize: TEMPORARILY. It is quite natural that these BOYARS, incapable of thinking ahead (political mentality), simply changed obediently together with the country and the population. And when the country screamed, unable to bear any longer the sadistic experiments it had been subjected to by "Yeltsin's team," and the people screamed, some of the BOYARS screamed and became outraged together with the people, too. The 40 up on the stage were mostly of this kind, mere conduits of the country's emotions, its fear and pain. There was another group--frankly unprincipled ones, far more unprincipled than the CPSU nomenklatura had ever been. This group of BOYARS is characterized by a complete lack of morals and responsibility, as well as disarming opportunism. Just as in the past the boyars, their coattails pulled up, ran to Dimitriy the Pretender and then back to the legitimate tsar--wherever they thought the best opportunity would present itself, quite a few such "runners" appeared in the FNS. Well, a majority, to be honest. During a break between sittings I happened upon a backroom, where all the members of the FNS organizational committee had gathered. They were dividing the leadership pie there, and quite unpleasantly at that. Unpleasantly in the sense of being quarrelsome and hypocritical. There was an obvious rivalry between Zyuganov and Konstantinov, which ended in Konstantinov's victory. Baburin, his cheeks flushed, upset over being elected only to the political council, was angrily saying something from the door. DEN editor Prokhanov--the man who united them all together with his communicative temperament and romantic imperialism, was silent. Nine cochairmen and a coordinator with two aides were elected. Konstantinov was elected coordinator. The communists in the leadership were clearly outnumbered by bearded defectors, "new patriots"--Astafyev among them. I do not like defectors and cannot stand those admitting "past errors." Therefore, the presence of some General Sterligov (he was the one who went to arrest the GKChP [State Committee on the State of Emergency] members) in the FNS was an unpleasant surprise for me. While I like writer Rasputin, I remember very well, however, that it was Gorbachev's State Council, of which Rasputin was a member, that on 6 September 1991 recognized the independence of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. I was not the only one disgusted with the backroom bickering over power. An organizing committee member--a gaunt man who appeared to be a blue-collar worker--got up, noisily pushed away his chair, and said angrily: "Some representatives! Now they will start dividing salaries!" And slammed the door behind him. The Kazakhstan representative tried to appeal to FNS leaders from the door: "What am I to say to my people? Kazakhstan's Russians are waiting for concrete guidance--`what to do,' and you are doing what!" During the second part of the congress, Zhirinovskiy was no longer in the audience. I think this congress pushed his patience beyond the limit. He could not know, of course, what was happening behind the scenes, but was guided by his instincts. He realized that he was not accepted, finally and irreversibly. And will not be in the future. (The reasons are not that important.) So he decided to look for allies in another camp. In order to do this, however, he had to change his behavior (albeit temporarily) and change the image of the party. There is no question that it was after the FNS congress that Zhirinovskiy decided to become a "centrist." Just as there is no doubt that it was then that he decided to take Jean-Marie Le Pen's advice and "purge" the LDP of "young people in leather who will pull his movement toward national-socialism."
