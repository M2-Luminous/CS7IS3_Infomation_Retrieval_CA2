The press joined the North's mud-slinging drive in earnest late last year when the workers' party prodded journalists to intensify propaganda against the South. "The press should step up propaganda campaigns in firm support of the struggles of the South Korean people, who are fighting for self-reliant and democratic unification," the party said. The party's instructions were contained in a congratulatory message sent to the seventh general meeting of the North Korean Journalists Union held last Nov. 17. As a show of their faithful adherence to the instructions, the Journalists Union pledged firm unity and loyalty to the great leader, Kim Il-song, and the party on March 10 at its 48th anniversary celebration. North Korean journalists abet subversion in the South because they fail to uphold freedom of the press -- that is, to satisfy the people's right to know -- in their own country, and because their main goal is to muster unswerving public support and loyalty for the great leader and his party. The regime's use of newspapers for its political purposes is not so strange given the party's press policy. A press guideline handed down by the party describes the press as "a medium of chuche" and "a revolutionary medium of Kim Il-songism." Of course, the North Korean Constitution does provide for "freedom of the press" in Article 67. But in interpreting this constitutional provision, the official history glossary of North Korea says, "we at no time can accord these freedoms and rights to the enemy of the fatherland and people." It is thus clear that "freedom of the press" as mentioned in the North means the "freedom" to demonstrate loyalty to the great leader and party. This is a "freedom" under which no criticism of the North Korean official ideology, system or state policies is tolerated. The "theory of the press," a North Korean textbook on journalism, sheds a brighter light on the nature of the Stalinist state's press. It explains that the press must perform the "function of propaganda and agitation, the function of organizer and the function of culture and indoctrinator." In other words, North Korea forces the press to serve as an "ideological tool for class struggle" and a "socio-political tool" designed to link the policies of the great leader and the party to the people. It is under this basic press policy that the North Korean media as a whole are required to place emphasis more on purpose than on reality in handling news. This is why such significant news items as the suspension of the '94 Team Spirit exercise and the decision to hold the third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks were reported by North Korean media only on March 6, three days after they had been announced. The media's anti-South programs are carefully orchestrated by the Choson (North Korean) Central News Agency, which is under the direct control of the Administration Council. The agency has a "South Korean News Bureau" and a "South Korean Research Department" that prepare news on the South and items related to unification programs for distribution to all print and broadcast media. Little wonder then, that the regime seems satisfied with the performance of the only North Korean News Agency. "The Choson Central News Agency has performed a great role in letting the South Korean people rise up in anti-U.S. and nation- saving struggles and in strengthening the international solidarity of revolution," said a report on the agency's 30th anniversary in December 1976. Among the broadcast media, Pyongyang Broadcasting Station specializes in programs covering the South and abroad. Its programs about the South are all designed to instill communist ideas in the minds of South Koreans and agitate them into staging a popular uprising. A typical example of such programs is the serialized "chuche thought is the true view of the world in the contemporary age and the most accurate guidance thought for campaigns for change in South Korea." There is also the "Minminjon Broadcasting Station," which the Workers' Party runs directly and which North Korea disguises as an underground radio operated somewhere in the South. The duty of the psychological warfare station is to spread slanderous propaganda and wild rumors among South Koreans to discredit the Seoul government. The specific organization that tightly controls all of the print media is the propaganda and agitation department of the Workers' Party. Individual journalists are not immune from party control, either. In the first place, all of them have to be ideologically screened by the Party's Central Committee before being recruited by the press.
