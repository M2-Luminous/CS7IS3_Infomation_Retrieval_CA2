It will probably be regretted that the European debate, opened by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, came a little late, because it would certainly have given some voters clarification about the European Union [EU]'s real problems, which were often only touched on during the campaign. On this subject, Jean Lipkowski (Rally for the Republic) regretted that the debate which had just taken place on the occasion of Sunday's [12 June] election was overly influenced by internal political considerations. Dilution and Paralysis At the heart of this debate there were two issues which are, moreover, interrelated: expansion and institutional reform. Alain Juppe defined the problem by asking whether the EU "has not condemned itself to dilution by expanding." This is the fundamental question asked by Alain Juppe, who wondered whether Europe's expansion should be continued. His answer is yes, on certain conditions. The negotiations with the new members have been well conducted both for Europe and for France. That leaves institutional reform which Alain Juppe admitted that it has not yet been implemented, adding that the June 1992 Lisbon summit had not made it compulsory. This being so, various risks exist, the minister admitted. First, "a dilution into a free trade area and the disappearance of the common policies which make up Europe's identity," and second, a risk of "paralysis in the decisionmaking process." The reform of European institutions must therefore be planned with care. The preparatory phase will take place in Corfu, with the establishment of a think tank. In order to ensure a "minimum" level of functioning of the EU machinery, Alain Juppe is suggesting a strengthening of the European Council; an increased role for the "general affairs" council; a change in the number of commissioners; and a better implementation of the subsidiarity principle, which will enable the institutions to operate more democratically, especially if the Commission's prerogatives and responsibilities are more clearly defined and if the national parliaments are more effectively involved in this approach. Moreover, this is what Philippe Seguin, as speaker of the National Assembly, is demanding. Valery Giscard d'Estaing devoted a large part of his speech to institutional reform. The chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee asked: "What if the EU failed, either through rejection or through becoming bogged down." According to the deputy for le Puy-de-Dome, "the European campaign gave the measure of the disenchantment," especially through the success of negative ideas on Europe. Institution reform must be "a vital precursor to any expansion. Without such reform, Europe will be powerless," he said, stressing his agreement with a number of the ideas developed by Alain Juppe. Valery Giscard d'Estaing invoked the dual spiritual inheritance of Robert Schuman and General de Gaulle in arguing his vision of Europe: An impotent Europe would have displeased the former, and a Europe disregarding France's rights would have angered the latter. We therefore had to wait until two days after the election to finally have the outline of what could have formed the framework of a united line by the two majority parties.
