A year or 18 months ago the working people hoped that the redistribution of property would, first, make it possible to obtain their due share of the socialist national pie and, second, be a boost to the development of production and a stimulus of a growth of production activity of both the owners of the means of production and the wage workers. But the practice of privatization under the leadership of the State Property Committee took a different route. A special edict of the president endowed the State Property Committee with the super-authority of a second government cabinet. More precisely, of the first, inasmuch as this decree itself took away, in fact, from all other ministers, the prime minister included, both the objects and levers of administration. A series of subsequent presidential decrees and government decisions farmed out the actual mechanism and procedure of privatization wholly to super-officials of the State Property Committee, who both in the center and locally became the exponents of the fullness of power: giving away plants worth many billions of rubles, appointing directors, dismissing employees, selling fixed capital, and so forth. Not without compensation for themselves, of course. It was here that real competition commenced both between the center and the local privatizers and within departments of the state property service as to who would "formalize" privatization facilities (that is, grant permits) more quickly and in greater volume (within the framework of the forced privatization program, one rate, in violation of the program, another, considerably higher). For additional "privileges" for this privatizing party or the other, special valuations. But we are not talking about this, about those who were admitted to the privatization pie (the government official and directors' nomenklatura, the new bourgeoisie). But about those who were not admitted to it, that is, all of us. The popular notion that privatization Chubays-style has created tens of millions of property owners is being foisted on people. Even if we allow for the paltriness of the share of property that may be obtained in the process of the formation of stock companies by the able-bodied citizens of our country and those unfit for work, I dare say that not only have they not obtained anything, they have lost something even. And a considerable amount at that. Popular wisdom says that you cannot, it would seem, lose what you do not have. On this basis citizens of our country in the socialist system truly not only did not have property, they were unable to have such. But in those illustrious times the state undertook on the one hand, in accordance with the socialist constitution, to provide everyone with accommodations, work, pay, and so forth and, on the other, distributed via centralized social consumption funds all life's necessary social "benefits" assuring for everyone (other than the nomenklatura) equal conditions of survival: health care and health improvement, education and schooling, and so forth. The inevitability of the demolition of a system to which we had become so accustomed was obvious to specialists from the moment of the market reforms. It was merely a question of how this would happen, with what economic and social losses and for whom. The incompatibility of the socialist rules of "social justice" with market conditions of management is graphically confirmed by the entire experience of Western countries also. Privatization was chosen as the workhorse implement for the rapid and total destruction of both the economic basis of our state--public property--and also its social base--general wage-leveling and the social consumption funds. The first stage of privatization was geared to this and achieved its purpose. It may already be said clearly and definitely at the completion of the first program of privatization who has obtained what and who has lost. I would distinguish three interested participants here: the state in the person of the organs of administration and the bureaucratic nomenklatura, the corps of directors as the economic nomenklatura, and all other citizens. Understandably, the corporate interest for government bureaucrats amounted to ridding themselves of the onerous concerns connected with administration of a rotting economy with the maximum personal advantage. For the corps of directors the interest amounted to changing from wage (albeit executive) labor into full masters of production. This was secured both by the appropriate privileges and the support of the state. The most numerous party to the privatization process was distributed as follows: --citizens unfit for work, who, aside from vouchers, obtained nothing (70-80 million retirees, handicapped children, and so forth); --able-bodied citizens employed at enterprises not subject to compulsory (forced) privatization (45-50 million persons): persons in publicly funded institutions, the military-industrial complex, the agro-industrial complex, the army, students, and so forth may be attributed to the preceding group, in the main; --employees of enterprises undergoing privatization (12-15 million persons). It is understandable that the first and second could merely sell their vouchers at a price nowhere near comparable either with the nominal share of public property or, even less, with that actually due to them, or invest them in roguish private investment funds. As last year's results showed, none of the 650 private investment funds produced any substantial profit on its shares. And if a comparison is made with the selling price of the voucher and following indexation, there is evidence of the direct losses of the shareholders even of the "honest" private investment funds. The majority of private investment funds, on the other hand, frankly cheated its clients either by distributing dividends with their own stock or by simply making off with the balance of the money. Aside from all else, the voucherization of society performed another, no less important, special assignment: It became an additional most powerful tool of the inflationary barrage of the end of 1992 and the start of 1993, which came crashing down on our economy in a R1.5 billion money issue. Inadequately controlled, what is more. But... was privatization to the benefit at least of the fortunate ones who work at a privatized enterprise and who thus became its shareholders and full owners? Truly, the majority of production enterprises were privatized (on the initiative of the directors) according to the second version, and the work force obtained, as people are attempting to explain to us, very many "undeserved privileges." In what are these privileges expressed? Is it not in the fact that the employee has obtained nominal title to part of the spindle from the machine tool at which he works (whereas certain directors obtained the real right to manage the activity of the enterprise)? I dare say that the "fortunate ones" acquired nothing other than an extra yoke in an increase in the power of both the directors and bureaucrats from the State Property Committee. Now, with the easily attainable compact of the latter, even the weakest guarantees of the labor rights of wage workers, to whom wages may not be paid for months on end, with whom a collective-bargaining agreement may not be signed, for whom social services are not provided, and for whom there need be no occupational safety, have disappeared. Finally, it is possible simply, in the absence of control, and with impunity to take away from the employee his job inasmuch as the manager of the enterprise is the real boss. New vistas of the privatization tyranny are being revealed in the activation of the second privatization program (post-voucher stage), in the course of which the last curtains of social interests and national goals--the stabilization of production and a revival of the economy--are being lifted from the process of the shareout of the remnants of national property. It is perfectly obvious that not only those unfit for work but also able-bodied citizens are no longer able even in fictitious form to join in the property-shareout process inasmuch as the continuing impoverishment of the populace and the devaluation of manpower which has occurred in recent months have conclusively undermined the possibility of employees with earned income participating in the property shareout. I would recall that one out of every 10 inhabitants of the country is, in fact, going hungry, one out of every five is below the line of the physiological subsistence level, and more than half are unable to provide for the survival (simple reproduction) of their families. Only 15-20 percent of citizens have wages above the minimum consumer budget. Thus only 5-7 percent of them can join in full in the process mapped out by the privatizers.... The view of the past and future of privatization that I have expressed says, obviously, nothing that is fundamentally new. The trade unions expressed their position and forecasts of the social consequences of privatization back on the threshold of voucherization. They have, unfortunately, exceeded the direst expectations in terms of scale of the violation of the citizens' labor rights, in terms of the exacerbation of social conflicts in the soil of privatization, and in terms of the orgy of corruption and malfeasance.
