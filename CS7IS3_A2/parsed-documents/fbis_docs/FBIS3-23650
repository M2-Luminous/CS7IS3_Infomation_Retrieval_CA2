Are they headed in the proper direction? What has been accomplished so far and what is planned for the near future? These questions have no simple answers. The questions were addressed at a press conference held by the Information and Press Directorate, RF MO [Russian Federation Ministry of Defense]. Participating in the conference were Colonel General V. Zhurbenko, first deputy chief of the General Staff, RF Armed Forces; Lieutenant General G. Ivanov, chief, Military Construction and Reform, RF MO; Lieutenant General G. Bochayev, first deputy chief, GOMU [Main Organization-Mobilization Directorate], GSh [General Staff]; and representatives of other directorates of the General Staff and RF Ministry of Defense. The press conference was held in response to a message entitled "Strengthening the Russian State" sent to the Federal Assembly by Russia's President. As reported, a part of the message deals with the analysis and evaluation of reforms in progress in the Army as well as the nature Russia's Armed Forces will assume in the future. "The Armed Forces are presently undergoing a most difficult phase of their development," pointed out Colonel General Zhurbenko. "At the same time, we must carry out measures for creating the Russian Army and for withdrawing the troops from Eastern Europe, Central Europe, and the Baltic countries as well." All the above factors cannot fail to affect to some degree or other the processes taking place in the Army. I believe that no other army in the world has had to deal with such large-scale and difficult tasks. And this in the short time since inception of the reforms. Construction of Russia's Armed Forces started on 7 May 1992, when the President issued a decree calling for the creation of the Russian Federation Armed Forces. In the ensuing period, we have seen the formation of the Ministry of Defense; conduct of an analysis of the actual state of the Armed Forces; development and presidential approval of a concept of their construction; writing of directives governing combat and mobilizational readiness and operational-strategic planning; and preparation of a number of legislative acts dealing with military issues. Nonetheless, as pointed out in the president's message, the tasks levied have been accomplished in the Armed Forces. The reforms are proceeding according to plan in the Armed Forces. And if they were backed up by the necessary financing, I believe that many problems would be resolved much more readily. In conclusion, one more fact: Since 7 May 1992, the manpower of the Armed Forces has been reduced by 457,000 men.
