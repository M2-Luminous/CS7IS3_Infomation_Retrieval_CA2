"As far as we are concerned, no changes have occurred," the PNTCD leader said. "We decided to answer favorably to the invitation addressed to us by Oliviu Gherman [chairman of the Social Democracy Party of Romania -- PDSR] to engage in a dialogue with the PDSR separately from the rest of the CDR [Democratic Convention of Romania], but we will not join the government without our allies within the CDR, and that could also happen only if Ion Iliescu renounces his monopoly over the country's authorities. We refuse the idea of setting up a national unity government and we will not cooperate with the extremist parties -- the PRM [Greater Romania Party], the PSM [Socialist Party of Labor], and the PUNR [National Romanian Unity Party]. As far as the UDMR [Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania] is concerned, our relations with them have not cooled down at all; they are the same as before. The UDMR remains our ally, despite our reserve regarding their program and the draft they elaborated for the ethnic minority bill."
