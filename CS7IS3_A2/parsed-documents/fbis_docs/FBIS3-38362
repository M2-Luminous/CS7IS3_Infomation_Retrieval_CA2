We have established that, recently the negotiations have been continuing successfully and intensively, that some open issues remain, especially regarding the protection of agriculture and the service industry, but that there are realistic chances for the resolution of these problems. Despite a tight schedule, Slovenia could still become one of the founding members of GATT, on the condition that this organization be formed, that is to say, starts working at the beginning of 1995. [Kos] As Dr. Drnovsek also said, the talks also concerned Slovenia's latest proposal for the new system of protection in agriculture. Mr. Sutherland promised his assistance here so that the answer to our proposal would be such that Slovenia could accept. This afternoon, the Slovene prime minister will also talk with the new president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which has promised us assistance in reconstruction and the development of our infrastructure.
