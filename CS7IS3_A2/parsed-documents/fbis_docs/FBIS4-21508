The Commission wishes to stress that the quantities of virgin substances for dispersive uses which may be imported into the Community remain in strict conformity with Council regulation (EEC) no. 549/91 as amended. The other imports allowed under the decision are only for either "feedstock" uses, which do not damage the ozone layer because they are permanently altered in the chemical process, or for used and recycled substances, which by providing an alternative to new production of CFC's and other controlled substances, have allowed ozone depleting substances to be phased-out more rapidly. Both types of imports are permitted and encouraged by the Montreal Protocol on ozone depleting substances. These imports have been authorized after full consultation with the ministries responsible for environmental protection of the member states in accordance with Council Regulation (EEC) no. 594/91. The Commission takes great care to distinguish between imports of used and recycled substances and those of virgin substances. All companies wishing to import used and recycled substances are vetted by the relevant ministries of the member states. Every cargo of controlled substances is only permitted into the Community if it is accompanied by a valid import licence, and if a company is found to have undertaken illegal imports, import licences are withheld and legal action may be instigated by the member states. In addition, since the beginning of this year, further information specifying the source and destination companies of used and recycled substances is required by the Commission before an import license is issued. The other imports do not add to the European Union's consumption of CFC's, or of any of the ozone depleting substances, because neither type of import is treated as consumption within the terms of the Montreal Protocol. The provisions under the protocol regarding production for "feedstock" uses and for the trade of used and recycled substances, also benefit European producers. They are permitted to produce unlimited quantities of CFC's and other substances provided these are for feedstock use, and they can also play an active role in the recycling of used substances. Commissioner Paleokrassas would like to take this opportunity to stress that the Union has taken a leading position in the fight against ozone depleting substances by anticipating the dates of phasing out of the ozone depleting substances agreed in the Montreal protocol.
