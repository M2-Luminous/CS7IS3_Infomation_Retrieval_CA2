FBIS4-11523 "drlat082_k_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-082 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 SOUTH AMERICA Argentina Senators, U.S. Officials Discuss Patents Bill Senators, U.S. Officials Discuss Patents Bill PY2604163894 Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS in Spanish 0022 GMT 26 Apr 94 PY2604163894 Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS Spanish BFN [All names and titles as received] [Text] Buenos Aires, 25 Apr (NA) -- Senators from the Justicialist [PJ] and Radical Civic Union Parties [UCR] were of one mind in pointing out to U.S. Government officials today that Argentina might only join NAFTA through Mercosur [Common Market of the South] or with the consent of its member countries. The senators, moreover, asserted that the upper chamber will pass a new law on patents for pharmaceutical products, although they anticipated that it will not totally match up to U.S. demands. These remarks by PJ and UCR senators were made during a meeting with John Heuneman, deputy assistant secretary for the Western Hemisphere at the U.S. Commerce Department; Sean Murphy, director of Southern Cone affairs at the U.S. State Department; and Peter Whitney, commercial attache at the U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires, in the Senate's Gray Hall this afternoon. PJ Senators Augusto Alasino, Mario Fadel, and Ricardo Branda; UCR Senators Jose Genoud, Ricardo Lafferriere, Jorge Cendoya, and Conrado Storani; and Corrientes Autonomist Party Senator Antonio Romero Feris also were at the meeting. Among the U.S. delegation members, Heuneman did most of the talking; he stressed that it would be most advisable for Argentina to pass a new patents bill, even though he neither mentioned deadlines nor made it a condition for Argentina to be able to join NAFTA. Heuneman stated the acknowledgement of inventors' rights will foster research development in our country. He added that international experience shows that patented medicines are not more expensive, as Argentine laboratories contend. Sen. Genoud, chairman of the Industry Committee, said his party will not approve a new patents law until Congress ratifies the recent GATT agreement establishing the World Trade Organization. Genoud pointed out to the Americans that the chapter on patents in the GATT agreement "establishes more flexible guidelines" than U.S. requirements in this area. He added that it would be a contradiction for Washington to have signed the Marrakech pact and yet claim conditions that go beyond what was established under that international agreement. Genoud explained that the Patents Bill is currently under discussion in Congress and that public hearings are being conducted to learn the parties' stance on this matter. He noted that this round of hearings will end on 19 or 26 May with a deposition by Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo. Alasino told the U.S. Government officials the Senate will pass a new patents law, although he made it clear that the upper chamber is analyzing the way of maintaining a balanced market and is trying to establish a deadline for the implementation of the patents law that will enable domestic laboratories to accommodate the new regulations. With regard to this, he conceded that the Senate is talking about a 10-year deadline to acknowledge intellectual property rights either by the payment of royalties [preceding word in English] or by the granting of a monopoly to the medicines' inventors.
