FBIS4-6144 "dreas074_n_94013" FBIS-EAS-94-074 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 Vietnam Vu Quang Interviewed on Relations With Vatican Vu Quang Interviewed on Relations With Vatican BK1804040594 Hanoi Voice of Vietnam in English 1000 GMT 15 Apr 94 BK1804040594 Hanoi Voice of Vietnam English BFN [From the 'Talk of the Week' feature] [Text] Public attention is being paid to relations between Vietnam and the Vatican, relations relating to Vietnamese Catholics, the [words indistinct] relations. Mr. Vu Quang, director of the government committee for religious affairs, in a recent interview with the Vietnamese weekly DAI DOAN KET (Great Solidarity) provided an outline on these issues. Mr. Vu Quang said that in the middle of last month, the Vatican sent a representative delegation headed by Deputy Foreign Minister Claudio Celli to Vietnam for a week to work on issues relating to Vietnamese Catholics and issues of mutual concern. That follows the 1990 visit of Cardinal (?Wilsur Heshgaray) to Vietnam. The cardinal and the Vietnamese Government agreed that the Vatican would inform the Vietnamese Government of all issues relating to Vietnamese Catholics, and only make a decision upon agreement reached with the Vietnamese Government. These issues include Vatican policy, the consecration of cardinals, bishops, and issues of mutual concern. When there are contradictory opinions, the two sides will meet for discussion. Up to now, the Vatican has sent four delegations to Vietnam, and Vietnam has also sent delegations to the Vatican. Eighteen bishops have been consecrated out of the approval of the Vietnamese Government upon office from the Vatican. During the last month visit to Vietnam, the Vatican reaffirmed the 1990 agreement. The Vatican delegation acknowledged that it was illogical to have a number of dioceses without bishops, as the Vatican delayed making a decision on personnel that the Vatican has proposed in the first place in which the Vietnamese Government has already approved. This time, both sides agreed to find a solution to the issue soon. The Vietnamese Government has agreed on the personnel proposed by the Vatican and to the bishops of Hanoi and Hue dioceses. As for the cases of Khanh Hoa and Thanh Hoa provinces, the Vietnamese Government will consider an answer to Vatican in the shortest period of time. In Ho Chi Minh City, both sides agreed to keep up Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh in his position with full responsibility and power. The Vietnamese Government will discuss with the Vatican the successor to the archbishop in the Ho Chi Minh City Diocese. Vietnam makes clear that the Vatican by asking Vietnamese Catholic priests not to join the Committee of United Vietnamese Catholics with the reason that the priests should not carry out political activities, the Vatican has [word indistinct] Vietnamese law, citizen rights, and human rights for the priests who have the rights to participate in social and patriotic activities. Vietnam makes clear that while the Vatican prevented Vietnamese Catholic priests from joining the Committee of United Vietnamese Catholics and other social organizations it lets some overseas Vietnamese Catholic priests carry out political activities, and the Vatican itself, slandering the situation of Vietnamese Catholics, and against the Vietnamese Government. It is a lack of goodwill attitude towards Vietnam, causing obstacles to normal relations between the Vatican and Vietnam. The head of the Vatican delegation will report to the responsible priesthood in the Vatican on discussion in Vietnam, to remove all obstacles to normalize relations between the Vatican and the Vietnamese Government.
