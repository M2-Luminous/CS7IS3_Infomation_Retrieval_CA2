Present at the meeting were National Assembly vice-chairmen; deputy prime ministers; the chief judge of the Supreme People's Court; the procurator of the Supreme People's Organ of Control; members of the National Assembly Standing Committee; and leading cadres of various relevant ministries, departments, and sectors. The meeting heard a report and exchanged views on the issue of practicing thrift and fighting wasteful spending, and on a question which was raised at a meeting held in April on how various cases of corruption and smuggling have been dealt with. As for efforts to discover various cases of corruption and smuggling and the orientations for continually dealing with various newly-discovered cases of corruption and smuggling, especially cases of car and motorcycle smuggling in a number of localities and units, and based on suggestions made at the meeting and given the need to scrupulously implement the National Assembly resolution in this domain, the chairman of the National Assembly and the prime minister drew conclusions on the following issues: 1. In compliance with the National Assembly resolution, together with the administration at all levels and relevant sectors, the government and law protection organs have in the past made great efforts and taken positive measures to discover and deal with cases of corruption and smuggling, thus helping overcome the slow legal process against various cases. However, what has been done so far are just initial efforts, and they are still not enough to stop these bad practices. In the period ahead, it is necessary to accelerate efforts to look into and take legal action against those serious cases still left in the backlog as well as those newly-discovered cases. To achieve this aim, we must devote more time to scrutinizing, supervising, and discovering such cases. We must promptly take legal action against those cases which are already evident, continue to try those cases whose legal procedures have not yet been completed, and urgently enforce court sentences on those cases already tried while paying appropriate attention to resolving complaints and denunciations of citizens in this domain. And there must be close cooperation between law enforcement organs themselves and between central and local organs. It is necessary to continue to study and come up with specific policies aimed at satisfactorily implementing the National Assembly resolution and other law stipulations and promptly reestablish order and discipline in state and social management. 3. [number as heard] The meeting hailed various localities and units for having drawn up and registered substantive plans to implement the policy on the practice of thrift. They have pledged to cut their total spending by at least 5 percent as envisaged by the National Assembly in its resolution on the 1994 state budget estimate. The meeting also asked various sectors, echelons, and units to work out specific plans to scrupulously implement the National Assembly resolution and effectively use the money they may save. 4. It is necessary to assign relevant organs the duty of helping the government prepare a report which will be presented before the National Assembly at its upcoming session on how the National Assembly resolution on practicing thrift and fighting wasteful spending, corruption, and smuggling has been carried out.
