They suspect that Washington might seek to remote-control Korea's opening its markets and industries wider by taking advantage of Seoul's planned move to become an OECD member in 1996. Some government officials said that the United States might have two game plans in connection with Korea's OECD membership. One strategy would be to suspend the current bilateral trade talks and encourage Korea to join the OECD. Once Korea joins the OECD, the United States will pressure the OECD members to have Korea further open its markets, they said. The other plan of the United States might be to intensify its pressure on Korea before its entry so that Seoul is forced to open its markets wider and wider. A government official who wished to remain anonymous, said, "Washington has already read the Kim Yong-sam administration's political will to join the OECD during Kim's tenure." It will intensify pressure on Seoul to meet the guidelines, practices and rules that OECD countries maintain, he speculated. But he said that public sentiment will be in disfavor of Seoul's OECD membership if the United States is portrayed as playing a "behind-the-scene role" in opening the Korean market. The National Assembly will become vocal if lawmakers are persuaded that Washington is seeking to take advantage of the nation's OECD membership as an excuse to open Seoul's markets wider, he said. The U.S. role will have a critical impact on the nation's view of the merits and demerits of joining the OECD, he said, adding that the best strategy for the United States would be "to take a wait and see attitude to Korea's membership negotiation with the Paris-based organization." It may be quite dangerous if the Korean people see the OECD membership as another Uruguay Round, he added. Many working-level officials are still having second thoughts about whether the nation should be in such a hurry to join the OECD but in public, they say, "Korea must join the OECD. It is the commitment of President Kim Yong-sam." The Ministry of Finance yesterday commissioned lawyers and economists to act as advisors on issues related to the nation's preparation to join. The MOF said Korea will initiate negotiations with the OECD in the latter half of next year for the nation's application for membership. Seoul hopes that Korea will be given a full grace period to meet OECD requirements even after becoming a member. But if the OECD, egged on by the United States, is rigid in demanding Korea open its markets wider, there is a risk that Korean may be forced to delay the membership application at the later stage, government officials said. They said, "It is a privilege for the OECD to have such fast-growing countries as Korea as its members." The OECD countries have lost their economic and political influence due to their slow economic growth, high inflation and uncontrollable trade deficits, they noted.
