FR941004-2-00077 FR941004-2-00050 II. Comments and Responses Thirty-eight comment letters were received in response to the notice of availability of the draft student handbook and EPA's intention to develop model State training and certification programs: twenty-three from utility companies, seven from industrial boiler facilities, six from trade or technical associations, and two from government agencies. The comments pertained to either specific items or statements in the draft student handbook, the need for the model State training and certification programs, or the coverage of these programs. The comments specific to the draft student handbook have been incorporated into the revised student handbook. The more significant issues raised by commenters relating to the overall model training and certification programs along with clarification of the EPA's intention for these model State programs are discussed below: 1. Draft Student Handbook A general comment on the draft student handbook was that it covers a wide range of facilities (i.e., fuel types, sizes and applications) and that even though the handbook is a relatively comprehensive treatment of basic combustion theory, technology and emission control, the level of understanding of each of these areas required by a plant operator will vary with the size, type and fuel requirements of a facility. The commenters suggested that a modular handbook be developed so training programs could reflect the specific equipment and fuel used at a facility. They further commented that emphasis on the specific areas of training to reflect the organizational structure of the facility should be allowed. In response, the training course developed by the EPA is modular in design. It is divided into 30 learning sessions. Each session covers a specific area of knowledge, such as, pulverized coal-fired boilers, NO X control technology, continuous emissions monitoring, etc *␣*␣*. The training course was designed in this manner so that it may fulfill requirements leading to boiler operator certification. The information presented in the training materials covers areas which may be addressed in a potential certification examination. Depending on the different classes/levels of certification available, the appropriate training sessions for that particular level of certification could be selected from the training materials to address the topics covered in that particular certification examination. 2. Requirement for Operator Training and Certification Based on the comments received, there appears to be a general misunderstanding that, in the October 6, 1993 Federal Register notice, the EPA was proposing to require the training and certification of operators of high capacity fossil fuel-fired plants. Some commenters stated that the October 6 Federal Register notice failed to clearly state that the draft training program being presented in the form of the draft student handbook was not being required for boiler operators under EPA regulations. For clarification purposes, section 129 (d) of the Act requires that the EPA develop a model State training and certification program for both operators of solid waste incineration units and high capacity fossil fuel-fired plant operators but mandates training only for operators of solid waste incineration units. This notice announces the availability of the model State programs for the training and certification of operators, as required by section 129 of the Act. This notice is not a rulemaking action to require anyone to implement any training program. The individual States may make determinations whether or not to require operator training and certification and may also decide whether the EPA's model training program or another training program is appropriate. 3. Need for Training and Certification Programs Both utility and industrial facility commenters questioned the need for training and certification requirements since their operators already undergo extensive site specific training programs that cover all of the topics listed as chapters in the draft student handbook. The utility industry commented that because of the high skill levels required for safe, efficient and reliable operation, extensive and comprehensive internal training programs have been implemented. Both groups commented that their training programs should be allowed to satisfy the obligation for training and that the EPA should allow any company to conduct a training course/program in lieu of the EPA or equivalent State program, provided it meets the fundamental EPA requirements. Also, the utility industry commented that utility facilities are subject to the Title V Operating Permit program under 40 CFR Part 70 and the Continuous Emission Monitoring rules under 40 CFR Part 75 and therefore the utility industry believes that compliance with these regulations encompasses all the objectives outlined by the EPA for training and certifying operators of high capacity fossil fuel-fired plants. They recommended that EPA include in its final model State program a provision for allowing compliance with the above regulations to be considered equivalent to meeting the requirements of an operator training and certification program and allowing the substitution of existing utility or industrial boiler training programs for the EPA model training program to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort.
