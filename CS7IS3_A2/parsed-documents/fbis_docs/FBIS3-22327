Such checks will be held in the very near future in a further nine regions. Basically where nuclear electric power stations are in operation. The conclusions of experts who spent two weeks making a detailed study of the situation are not reassuring. Over 500 violations were revealed in the oblast. The establishments which present a serious danger include the Saratov hydroelectric power station [GES] across which highways and railroads run. Recently numerous freight trains have been accumulating and standing idle for a long time in front of the giant dam. The manmade seas -- the Saratov and Volgograd reservoirs -- also contain an inexorable threat. Their banks are being eroded so rapidly that in a year or two water could descend on the highways, telegraph lines, and oil bases created here. The oil pipeline laid in the thirties has also become a time bomb in the Volga region capital. The Moscow experts also took a look at the underground gas storage station, the largest in Europe, at the Balakovo nculear electric power station, the "Nitron" and "Khimvolokno" production associations, and many other potentially dangerous establishments of which there are over 150 in Saratov Oblast. In connection with the change in the form of ownership, at many of these enterprises there has been a collapse of the engineering services which used to keep track of manufacturing discipline and were in charge of civil defense questions. The tendency toward an increase in accidents has been growing in recent years. Last year over 1,200 emergency situations were recorded in Russia. And we ourselves prepared most of the tragedies. According to Anatoliy Tkachev, chief of the inspectorate of the Russian Federation Ministry for Civil Defense, Emergency Situations, and the Elimination of the Consequences of Natural Disasters, the main reasons for all accidents are disregard for the requirements of industrial and ecological safety, extreme wear and tear on equipment, and insufficient strictness on the party of leaders and supervisory services. The life and peace of any large city is a hair's breadth away from disaster day and night. That is why a law on the protection of the population is essential in Russia today. And the absence of such a law can also without exaggeration be called the main emergency on a Russian scale.
