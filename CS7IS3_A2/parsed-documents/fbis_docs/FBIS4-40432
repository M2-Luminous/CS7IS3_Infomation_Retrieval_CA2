"Nobody in the world has ever survived a crisis without a strong authority," said Leonid Kuchma, Ukrainian presidential candidate, in a national radio broadcast on Wednesday. If I am elected Ukrainian president, I will be ready to assume full responsibility for the state of things in the country, Kuchma emphasized. "Ukraine needs to take a new political course which should be aimed at rejecting self-isolation, at restoring all mutually beneficial economic, spiritual and cultural ties with the former Soviet republics, and first of all with Russia," he said. "Ukraine should be open to cooperation with the rest of the world, and only then state-of-the-art Western technologies will come here -- and application of these technologies holds the country's future," he added. Kuchma, who is now a leader of the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, promised that his first move in the position of Ukrainian president would be "to form a united economic area with all the CIS countries." At that rate, he will also "strive for Ukraine's full membership in the economic union," declare for reaching an agreement on hard currency and customs regulations based on equal rights among the CIS countries and for an urgent elimination of fixed karbovanets-US dollar exchange rate. According to Kuchma, he will "strive for granting Russian an official status, while Ukrainian will retain its state-language status." "I have never and nowhere risen the issue of restoring the Soviet Union. But I will do my utmost to develop good neighbourly relations with all those countries with which we have traditional historic, economic and cultural ties. I have always opposed building an independent state based on anti-Russian sentiments," he said. In his opinion, land should not be sold or purchased, whereas public medical and education services should be free of charge. "I would like to realize the plans which they stopped me from realizing in 1993," he concluded.
