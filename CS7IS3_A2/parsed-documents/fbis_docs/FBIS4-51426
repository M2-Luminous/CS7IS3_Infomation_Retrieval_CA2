Tang and Danielle Yang] [Text] Brussels, May 26 (CNA) -- A Taiwan delegation composed of ten auto and motorcycle parts and component manufacturers is in Belgium to promote Taiwan products and seek cooperative opportunities. Manager of Sanyes Automotive Industrial Co. Huang Sheng-chih said during an interview with CNA that Belgium, an important production center for the European auto industry, has been targeted by Taiwan manufacturers because it does not produce its own car brands. Taiwan manufacturers can supply Belgium car assembly plants with parts and components and cooperate with Belgium OEM (original equipment manufacture) makers to tap the European and Asia-Pacific markets, Huang said. During the tour arranged by the Far East Trade Service Center in Brussels, the Taiwan OEM manufacturers visited car assembly plants for Opel and Volkswagen and met with their Belgium counterparts to discuss trade opportunities. Belgium imported some US$4.63 billion worth of car parts and components from abroad in 1993 with Taiwan supplying US$83 million, or just under 2 percent of the total imports, Huang said. There is ample room for development of the Belgium market, he added. After Belgium, the Taiwan delegation members will proceed to Germany and Britain to continue their European tour which also took them to Paris. Delegation members are scheduled to return to Taiwan on June 10.
