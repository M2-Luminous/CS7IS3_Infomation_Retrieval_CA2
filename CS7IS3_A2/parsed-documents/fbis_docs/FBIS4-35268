Speaking at the airport, Buwayz noted that before the events, Lebanon was the seat of ESCWA, which deals with economic development and construction. [passage omitted] Asked about the latest developments in the contacts to call a UN Security Council [UNSC] session on Lebanon's complaint against Israeli acts of aggression and piracy, Buwayz replied: The Lebanese decision, of course, is geared toward convening a Security Council session to discuss the Lebanese complaint that was filed last week. We summoned the ambassadors of the permanent Security Council members yesterday to inform them of this decision and to find out their positions toward it. He added: We know that the Security Council is facing some difficulties--let us call them difficulties. But in effect, we have to lay the responsibility on the shoulders of the Security Council, in any case. Minister Buwayz was then asked: What are these difficulties? He replied: You know that heavy pressure may prevent the Security Council from holding a session immediately and automatically, as should have happened when we filed the complaint last week and asked for a session so that an appropriate resolution can be adopted.
