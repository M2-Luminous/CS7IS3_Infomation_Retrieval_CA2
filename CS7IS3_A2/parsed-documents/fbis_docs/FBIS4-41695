At the same time, the Russian peace settlement plan envisioned more guarantees ensuring the mechanism for cease-fire than the one proposed by the CSCE, he said. Kazimiriov dismissed speculation that the CSCE and Russia had differences over the settlement issue. Russia should coordinate its efforts with the CSCE, he said. Work is going on to convert the Russian plan into a true agreement, a legal document which could be signed at a top level, rather than a schedule of immediate measures, he said. Kazimirov said the main priority of the Russian plan was to develop a mechanism to establish a cease-fire, which is essential for moving towards a Nagorno-Karabakh peace settlement. Kazimirov also met Armenian President Levon Ter- Petrosian. He told Interfax after the meeting that he was satisfied with its results. "Much has been clarified," he said.
