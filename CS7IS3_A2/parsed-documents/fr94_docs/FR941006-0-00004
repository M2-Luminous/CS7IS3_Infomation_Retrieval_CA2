FR941006-0-00004 FR941006-0-00003 FEDERAL RETIREMENT THRIFT INVESTMENT BOARD 5 CFR Part 1633 5 CFR Chapter LXXVI RIN 3209&hyph;AA15 Supplemental Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board AGENCY: Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (Board). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, with the concurrence of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE), is issuing regulations for employees of the Board that supplement the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch, as issued by OGE, with a requirement to obtain prior approval for outside employment. The Board also is repealing its remaining old conduct standards which were retained on an interim basis pending issuance of the Board's supplemental regulations and is inserting in their place a cross-reference to the new provisions. EFFECTIVE DATE: These regulations are effective October 6, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thomas L. Gray, Deputy Assistant General Counsel for Administration, (202) 942&hyph;1662, FAX (202) 942&hyph;1676. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On August 7, 1992, OGE published new Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch (standards). See 57 FR 35006&hyph;35067, as corrected at 57 FR 48557 and 57 FR 52583, with an additional grace period extension at 59 FR 4779&hyph;4780. Codified at 5 CFR part 2635, the new standards became effective on February 3, 1993. On June 2, 1993, the Board issued a final rule (58 FR 31332) which replaced all of the provisions of its prior standards of conduct regulations at 5 CFR part 1633 that had been superseded by part 2635, or by OGE's executive branch financial disclosure regulations at 5 CFR part 2634. The Board preserved only those provisions that were specifically grandfathered under the notes following 5 CFR 2635.403(a) and 2635.803. With the concurrence of OGE, 5 CFR 2635.105 authorizes agencies to publish agency-specific supplemental regulations that are necessary to implement their respective ethics programs. The Board, with OGE's concurrence, has determined that the following supplemental rules, being codified in new chapter LXXVI of 5 CFR, are necessary to the success of its ethics program. The Board is simultaneously repealing the remaining provisions of 5 CFR part 1633, which are superseded upon issuance of the Board's supplemental regulations, and is replacing those provisions with a single section that provides cross-references to 5 CFR parts 2634 and 2635, as well as to the Board's new supplemental regulations. II. Analysis of the Regulations Section 8601.101‚ê£General Section 8601.101 explains that these regulations supplement the executive branch-wide standards of ethical conduct and reminds Board employees, including Board members, that they are subject to these regulations and the executive branch-wide financial disclosure regulations. However, because Board members are special Government employees, the requirement for prior approval of outside employment in section 8601.102 does not apply to them.
