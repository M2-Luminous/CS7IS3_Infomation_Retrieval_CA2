FR940805-2-00046 FR940805-2-00031 Finally, the proposed order (Part I.E.) generally prohibits proposed respondents from misrepresenting the performance or efficacy of any smoking cessation or weight loss program. Efficacy The Commission's complaint further alleges that proposed respondents failed to possess a reasonable basis for a claim they made regarding the relative ability of their hypnosis program to lead consumers to quit smoking. AISC, Kenneth C. Grossman and Jane A. Grossman represented through their advertising that their single-session, group hypnosis seminar is more efficacious for smoking cessation than other stop-smoking methods. The Commission believes that this comparative efficacy claim for proposed respondents' hypnosis program is deceptive because proposed respondents at the time they made the claim did not possess adequate substantiation for the claim. To address this efficacy misrepresentation, the proposed order (Part I.B.) requires proposed respondents to possess and rely upon competent and reliable scientific evidence substantiating any representation about the relative (or absolute) performance or efficacy of any smoking cessation (or weight loss) program, before they make such a claim. The proposed order (Part I.E.) further generally prohibits proposed respondents from misrepresenting the performance or efficacy of any smoking cessation program (or weight loss program). The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order, and it is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order, or to modify in any way their terms.
