Jaksic: "The Blackmailing of Former JNA Officers"] [Text] Ljubljana 15 February -- It seems even officers of the former JNA [Yugoslav People's Army] have not been spared in the merciless showdowns between Slovene politicians, as eloquently indicated by the personal account in MLADINA of Ljubljana of Sefko Suljevic, a captain in the former JNA. He says that in Vienna, where he has applied for political asylum, he had a visit from officials of the Slovene Defense Ministry who asked him to supply them compromising material on Slovene President Milan Kucan and Slovene Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek, and in return they would provide him all the necessary Slovene documents to return to his wife and children in Slovenacka Ribnica, from whom he has been virtually separated for nearly three years now. Suljevic's story, however, is also of interest because of many other details indicative of the character of the brief war between the JNA and the Slovene militiamen and of the methods used at that time by Slovene paramilitary units in attacking garrisons or in unscrupulous showdowns even with those officers of the former JNA who wanted to join their ranks, as in fact was the case with Capt Suljevic, who was serving as counterintelligence officer in Ribnica. In spite of his "expressed loyalty to the Slovene state," then, Suljevic encountered the kind of violence and savagery he never expected to see even in his worst nightmare. Suljevic first recalls the altogether unprovoked attack of the Slovene militiamen on the garrison in Ribnica, although Lojze Cesarek, territorial defense representative, had promised on behalf of territorial defense that the garrison would not be attacked. After that Suljevic responded to the appeal of Slovene authorities that was sent to all officers of the JNA, he left the garrison and reported to Slovene territorial defense. He reported personally to Tone Krnovic, commander of the "Moris" Brigade, who incidentally is still the commanding officer of that unit, but in Ljubljana, where they took him, he experienced a real drama. As soon as he arrived in Ljubljana, he was for all practical purposes arrested and taken to Krkovic in handcuffs. "They interrogated and beat me for four hours, and then they took me to some basement where they stripped me naked and put me before a firing squad. They gave me 20 seconds to tell them the names of my collaborators, I waited, leaning against the wall, for them to shoot me, and then someone came and took me out of that basement." Suljevic's story then turns back upon itself, since after he was released from prison he went to Bar on a ship of the Yugoslav Navy, but again he decided to leave the JNA and to return to Slovenia, which again arranged a similar "welcome," until he ended up in Vienna, where he is still awaiting political asylum, but he is not giving up on his intention to return to Slovenia and join his family. The crowning touch is actually the sudden about-face in the behavior of the Slovene authorities towards him after the visit in Vienna by two men from the intelligence service of the Slovene Defense Ministry, who proposed that as a former counterintelligence officer he prepare material compromising Kucan and Drnovsek (that material, according to what he was told by those who visited him, is supposedly in Belgrade), and then the Defense Ministry would allow him to return to Slovenia. Suljevic wrote a letter about this to Kucan and Drnovsek in which he gave the details of that blackmail attempt as well as the information that one of the two blackmailers was well-known to him. The only question was whether Kucan and Drnovsek would get on the trail and use the Suljevic case in the hot showdown with Janez Jansa, Slovene defense minister.
