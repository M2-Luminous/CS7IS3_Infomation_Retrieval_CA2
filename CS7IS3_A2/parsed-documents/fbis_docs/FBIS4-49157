He also demanded that units of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) be further revolutionized, modernized and regularized so as to make new contributions to maintaining national defense and the country's socialist system. Zhang Zhen made these remarks during his review of troops stationed in the northern part of Jiangsu Province, east China, which began on April 22 and ended today. He said the fine traditions of the Chinese Armed Forces include the absolute leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, serving the people wholeheartedly, the powerful ideological and political work, strict rules of discipline, political, economic and military democracy at the company level, and the unity between the Armed Forces and the government and between the Armed Forces and the people. Zhang urged officers at all levels to take the lead in carrying forward the PLA's fine traditions, to pass on the cherished heritage of the people's Armed Forces from generation to generation. He particularly asked the soldiers and officers to carry forward the PLA's style of working hard and arduously in the present new circumstances. He pointed out that although the economy has been developed and the living standards raised, the tradition of hard work cannot be cast away. Building socialism with Chinese characteristics requires arduous efforts of generations of the people. Even after the country becomes strong and the people become rich, the spirit of working hard and arduously is still needed, Zhang stressed. During his stay in northern Jiangsu, Zhang made surveys of grassroots troops, military schools, logistics departments and some military subareas.
