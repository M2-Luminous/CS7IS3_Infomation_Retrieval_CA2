[POSCO] and Kolon Group, which are vying to take the majority stake in the consortium for the second mobile telephone project, FKI Vice Chairman Cho Kyu- ha said Thursday. Kim reportedly met with the two chairmen to hammer out an agreement between the uncompromising business groups in their fight for control of the lucrative business. FKI was authorized by the Communications Ministry late last year to form a single consortium for the second cellular phone network by this month. The cut-throat competition was narrowed down to consortiums led by POSCO and Kolon after FKI Chairman Choe Chong-hyon's Sunkyong Group dropped out of the race, aiming instead to become the major stockholder of Korea Mobile Telecom, a state-run monopoly that is to be privatized. FKI will conduct a final screening and comparative study before announcing the majority stockholder and participating local and foreign companies on Feb. 28, Cho said.
