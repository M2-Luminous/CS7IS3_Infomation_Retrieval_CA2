A total of 38 percent represent the opposite thesis. This is the result of an opinion poll carried out by the Market opinion research institute in April for the Europe Barometer of DER STANDARD. According to the poll, younger Austrians are particularly confident: A total of 65 percent of those under 30 believe that Austria's interests will be well looked after in the EU; the results are similar in the higher education and income groups. Even among declared followers of the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe], a 54-percent majority holds the view that Austria could solve its problems better within the EU. Among farmers, however, the opinion continues to predominate that Austria should not join the EU.
