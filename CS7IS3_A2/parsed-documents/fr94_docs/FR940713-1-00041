SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On February 22, 1994 (59 FR 8446), we published a proposed rule in the Federal Register , that would revise the list of mandatory functions included in agreements with Medicare fiscal intermediaries pursuant to section 1816 of the Social Security Act. We would require that the intermediary agreements include, as functions, the statutory requirements that intermediaries determine proper payment amounts and pay bills. All other functions would be optional. We proposed that all functions included in contracts with Medicare carriers be optional, since section 1842 of the Act does not list mandatory functions. These changes would provide us with the flexibility to transfer functions from one intermediary or carrier to another or to otherwise limit the functions an intermediary or carrier performs when we determine to do so would result in more effective and efficient program administration. The comment period for the February 22, 1994 proposed rule ended on April 25, 1994. We are extending the comment period and will consider comments if we receive them at the appropriate address, as provided in the February 22, 1994 proposed notice, by October 11, 1994. All comments received between April 26, 1994, and the date of publication of this notice will be accepted.
