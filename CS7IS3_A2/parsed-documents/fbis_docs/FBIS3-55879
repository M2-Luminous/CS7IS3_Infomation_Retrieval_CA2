There are four candidates -- Pyotr Romanov, director-general of a Krasnoyarsk production society, Eduard Rossel, former head of the Sverdlovsk Regional Administration and currently president of the association for the Ural Region's economic interaction, Aleksandr Titkin, former minister of industry and currently president of a financial-investment company, and Vladimir Shumeyko, first vice-premier of the Russian Government. The secret nomination of candidates, held the day before, showed that Shumeyko is an absolute leader. Seventy-eight out of the 161 deputies, who took part in the nomination, entered his name in the voting ballot. Thirteen deputies backed Romanov, 10 -- Rossel, and six -- Titkin. The number of nominated candidates reached seventeen, but the rest preferred to withdraw their candidatures. A secret vote to elect the speaker will be held today at the morning meeting, after the candidates take the floor and are discussed. According to the procedural rules of the first council session, adopted on Tuesday, "a candidate will be deemed elected, if he polls more than fifty per cent of the votes of elected members of the council as a result of a secret vote".
