In clashes this morning the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] dropped internationally forbidden bombs containing phosphine, a toxic product, in addition to napalm and phosphorus bombs. The shelling was backed by two PC-7 aircraft, which carried out 13 air raids. Firmino Lucamba reports: [Begin Lucamba recording] The fighting is continuing in the center of the city and it is so fierce it can be compared to the fighting during the Second World War. The MPLA-PT (?threw everything) [words indistinct] at this stage. What worries the local military command most is the fact that the MPLA-PT is underhandedly using internationally forbidden weapons such as napalm, toxic and phosphorus bombs, as well as (?other types) yet to be discovered. The use of those weapons has been affecting the people of N'dalatando at large, and pregnant women and children in particular.
