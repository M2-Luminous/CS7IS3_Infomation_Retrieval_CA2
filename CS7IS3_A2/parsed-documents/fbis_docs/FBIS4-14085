"We have never faced a civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It has been a blatant aggression, which continues to be waged against a member of the United Nations," Velayati told the Council, adding that, it was the duty of the Council to see to it that aggressors were repelled and punished. He blasted the United Nations for overseeing the confiscation of arms from defenseless Muslims in places such as Srebrenica while allowing the Serbs who had surrounded the city to keep their heavy weapons. Despite repeated declaration by the UN that it did not possess sufficient resources and man-power to defend the Bosnians, Velayati said, the UN failed to take advantage of the offer by some Muslim governments to send peace-keepers under the pretext that they were not neutral enough. "Yet troops from a well-known supporter of the Serbs were deployed in a most critical area around Sarajevo," he added. Velayati also criticized the Security Council for shirking its responsibilities in Bosnia-Herzegovina under the pretext of having a "balanced approach" and said that such approaches were responsible for creating the impression that "a strong bias against Muslims is prevalent in the Security Council." The perception, he said, leads to frustration amongs the Muslims who perceive the Security Council as biased and insensitive towards the plight of the Muslims. "This frustration has obvious consequences. And the responsibility will be borne by those who have so blatantly applied the double standards, and put their perceived strategic interests before the lives of hundreds of thousands of innocent human beings," he added.
