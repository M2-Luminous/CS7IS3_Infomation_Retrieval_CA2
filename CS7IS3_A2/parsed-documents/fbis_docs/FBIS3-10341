BCH President Hugo Noe Pino said the state had been buying 30 percent of the approximately $20 million entering the banking system each week but decided to reduce such purchases to 20 percent to leave more dollars at the disposal of banks and exchange offices to sell to the general public and to ensure a more stable exchange rate; this is a temporary measure, he added.
