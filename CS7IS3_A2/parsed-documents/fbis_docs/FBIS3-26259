The confiscated fake and imitation goods fall into more than 40 categories. These fake and imitation goods seized in Guangzhou range from capital goods to daily necessities and from general commodities to high-class consumer goods. Large quantities of commodities were confiscated last year, including color television sets, video recorders, lubricant, toiletry soaps, cement, agricultural chemicals, human leukocyte interferon [ren bai xi bao gan rao su 0086 4101 4798 5165 1626 2371 4790], garments, cigarettes, alcoholic drinks, low-voltage electric appliances, and cosmetics. Reports have indicated that fake and imitation goods manufacturers in Guangzhou are now expanding from small partnerships into collectively owned enterprises. In some areas, they have even been operating on a fairly large scale. They mostly fabricate goods to imitate quality foreign and local brand-name products, and their skill in copying is so perfect that the imitation goods can hardly be distinguished from the genuine ones. Last year, Guangzhou City's industrial and commercial administration focused its attention on fighting the illegal manufacture and sale of fake and imitation goods. With clues reported by local residents, the industrial and commercial administrative bureau of Baiyun district discovered and searched an illegal processing workshop producing fake high-grade lubricant bearing the "Mobil" brand name and confiscated more than 1,900 cans of the lubricant as well as some empty cartons and cans.
