The Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, who left here this morning for Bonn was highly satisfied with the response of international corporate leaders. Some of them called on him personally and told him that India was on their priority list for foreign direct investments. The most noteworthy feature is that this change in perception about India among global business leaders has been brought about without the assurance of any further concessions. Both the Prime Minister and the commerce minister, Mr Pranab Mukherjee, who spearheaded the discussions on India made it clear that India would welcome investments, particularly in the infrastructural sector, but it must be on India's terms. The Prime Minister elaborated this at the closing plenary session. Responding to Prof. Schwab, the founder of World Economic Forum (WEF), who welcomed Mr Rao as a "philosopher and statesman" and the man behind the process of transformation in India. He said he owed the success of reforms to Nehru who had introduced the concept of mixed economy. He said the concept of market economy in the unipolar world was fast becoming a dogma but India would not accept a ready-made formula prescribed from thousand miles away. Reforms had to be a programme of change with the human face. The government had no right to throw out of job 10 million people because somebody suggested it. The obvious reference was to the developed world's prescription for restructuring the public sector through privatisation, without caring for the consequences. But the government had to take such a contingency into account and make full allowances before launching the scheme of change, Mr Rao explained. The strategy of the Indian side in the panel discussion on India was to explain why foreign investors should invest India and leave it at that. Replying to a question on drug pricing, Mr Mukherjee said while the policy would be reviewed, the government would also have to keep in mind the objective of health policy. As for drug price equalisation scheme, he would not comment as the issue was subjudice. Reacting to strong reservations on intellectual property rights expressed by FMC Corporation of the United States, Mr Mukherjee said India would go only to the extent of changing patent laws as committed under the GATT agreement. To a question if the government would change labour laws to promote foreign direct investment, Mr Mukherjee's reply was that in the Indian situation no unlimited power of hiring and firing could be given. The Prime Minister who intervened towards the end, said that he came to Davos "with an infinitely deeper sense of confidence" than two years ago, about the course of reforms. The government was considering what more could be done. But no step could be taken without carefully assessing the possible results of such a step. "We do not want to jump and break our legs," he said. A number of chief executives of global companies called on Mr Rao and told him that they would like to step up their investments in India. Among them was Mr Charles Cilmour, vice-chairman of Ford Motors, who said that India might be made a source for auto-parts and components to begin with to be followed by a production base for Ford trucks and cars. Others who met Rao were Mr Kenneth Ley, chairman of Enron, Mr Hezeltor, chairman of Dow Corning, a U.S. glass company planning to invest in India, Mr Martin Liang of a large U.K.-based construction company interested in building roads, highways and hospitals, and Mr Charles Piggo of the U.S.-based Paccaor which is manufacturing heavy trucks, and drilling equipment. The Prime Minister's growing confidence was evident in the manner in which he added a big rider to his overall statement that reforms would continue. "We shall not do what we do not consider necessary. We have to see the results and if more changes are needed, we shall not hesitate to reorient the policies," he said. On the key question of foreign investment in India, Mr Rao said he was satisfied. But wanted more foreign investment in the infrastructure areas. The Prime Minister had clearly begun to pick and choose the kind of investments he would like in future. This was a privilege which he never enjoyed in the past two years or he could not do so for India had not till then become a credible option for foreign investors. Delivering final address at the WEF annual meeting, Mr Rao reiterated that India wanted to pursue its own model of economic reforms, by striking a balance. "We do not like to follow policies framed two thousand miles away and dictated to us," he said. That was an assertion which Mr Rao never made in the past and is a result of a growing confidence in the economic reforms pursued by his government and the impact these have made on the people and foreign investors. The new found confidence was also evident from the manner in which he strongly defended the bureaucracy against the charge that it was delaying implementation of economic reforms. His peremptory dismissal of a question on whether Hindu-Muslim tensions affected investment in India is a clear sign that Mr Rao will invite foreign investment, but without kneeling down or bowing to pressures of unreasonable demands. "We are a pluralistic society and Hindu and Muslims would continue to live together for years to come. If there are clashes, we should bother, not you," he snapped. Even, Mr Pranab Mukherjee, showed such confidence while recounting the various economic reform measures taken by the government. "Our policy changes are not by accident. These began from the eighties and as such are based on the bedrock of experience," he said. But when it came to reforming the labour market or introducing an exit policy for workers, Mr Mukherjee firmly ruled it out on the ground that the government would like to stay away from the policy of hire and fire.
