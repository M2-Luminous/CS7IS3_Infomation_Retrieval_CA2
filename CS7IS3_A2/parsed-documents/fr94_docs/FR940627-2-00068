FR940627-2-00068 FR940627-2-00027 Local Planning Group (LPG) is defined as a team of individuals drawn from community-based organizations, State and local health departments, and a local college or university. The LPG would collaborate in the design, implementation, and evaluation of the proposed VAW prevention program. A female victim of intimate violence should be included as an additional team member. The LPG team participants will serve as advisors and consultants on the practical and scientific aspects of the proposed intervention and evaluation activities. Each member or group represented on the LPG must have its proposed activities, responsibilities, and contributions to the success of the project clearly defined in the ``Application Content'' section of the application. Applicants should also see the ``Program Requirements'' section. Full working partners are defined as any of the organizations or institutions that are collaborating in the VAW prevention project either through participation on the local planning group or in some other substantive way. It is essential that full working partners' duties, responsibilities, and contributions to the success of the project are clearly defined in the ``Application Content'' section of the application. Applicants should also see the ``Program Requirements'' section. For example, a full working partner may have access to the community (target population) that the applicant does not possess. Because the full working partner is substantially involved in the project, the applicant can state that the project as a whole has community access. Primary prevention is defined as the reduction or control of causative factors for a health problem and includes reducing risk factors and environmental exposures, and includes health-service interventions. Purpose The purposes of this program are to: 1. Identify or develop potentially effective intervention strategies for delivering VAW primary prevention at the community level. 2. Design and implement multifaceted community-based VAW primary prevention programs based on these interventions. 3. Evaluate the extent to which the multifaceted community programs reduce rates of violent behavior, injury, and death among intimates. 4. Develop formal replication guidelines from successful programs for disseminating model VAW prevention programs. Although a number of existing interventions and/or programs to prevent VAW are perceived as useful, little is actually known about their effectiveness, their impact on women, and their ability to be replicated in a variety of settings. Evaluation will help identify those programs that demonstrate the greatest promise for primary prevention. Model programs should be able to address a particularly important type of VAW or address violence in special settings. Comprehensive, multifaceted, and innovative efforts to address VAW may include, but are not limited to, the following strategies: 1. Public awareness campaigns to dispel misconceptions about VAW as well as change knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs pertaining to VAW. This could include school-based curricula, college- and university-based efforts, and work-site education programs (non-Federal); 2. Coordination among the criminal justice system, family and intimate violence programs, substance abuse programs, mental health centers, and the medical community for referral, intervention, shelter, and case management. This could include: (a) Victim identification and referral protocols in hospital emergency rooms, community clinics, and other health care settings, (b) expansion of emergency shelter and support services for victims, and (c) worksite programs (non-Federal) including identification and referral for victims through employee assistance programs and worksite (non-Federal) promotional campaigns; 3. Expansion of court-ordered treatment programs for abusers which would include intensive counseling and behavior modification treatment; or 4. Training and education programs for professionals in health care, legal, and social service fields who deal with potential victims and abusers or who are involved in the planning and implementation of prevention programs.
