The social and economic development for 1993 and the reforms were discussed during it. Sergiu Certan, minister of national economy, presented a report in which he stated that social and economic situation is "quite serious," and that it is determined by "very unfavourable internal and external factors." Although a stabilizing trend is observed in economy from June 1993, the people's living level keeps falling. Certan pointed out that from the first month of 1994, the production in many fields started to fall again under the existing political divergences. President Snegur said that industrial production decreased in January 1994 in comparison with the same period of 1993 by 20 percent. Snegur said that nevertheless "warehouses are full of goods." The president blamed the audience of inconsequence in promoting the reforms and demanded them to add to the adopted decisions facts, terms and concrete responsible people because the proposed project contains nothing but slogans.
