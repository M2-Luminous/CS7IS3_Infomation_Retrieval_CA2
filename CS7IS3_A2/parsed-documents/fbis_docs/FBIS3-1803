The DPRK's acceptance of nuclear inspections is prompted by its desire to improve relations with the United States. It might also face international economic sanctions if it continues to refuse entry to international delegates to carry out inspections. The DPRK's economy is going through a very difficult time. Continued isolation from the international community could aggravate the domestic political and economic situation, which is already grim. Following the DPRK's acceptance of international nuclear inspections, annual ROK-U.S. military exercises will be called off, and a third round of talks between high-ranking officials from the DPRK and the United States has been scheduled for the second half of March -- both will help the DPRK break its international isolation. For the United States, the biggest worry in the Korean peninsula security question is its suspicion about the DPRK's development of nuclear weapons, especially when the DPRK announced on 12 March last year that it was withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to free itself from restraints on its independent development of nuclear arms. Does Pyongyang Really Have Nuclear Weapons? Does Pyongyang really have nuclear weapons? This is a concern for the United States and its neighbors, such as the ROK, Japan, and China. The long-term closed-door policy of the Pyongyang authorities has made it next to impossible for the outside world to know anything about the DPRK's national defense, let its alone nuclear development. Japan is extremely concerned about possible nuclear developments in the DPRK. Around the world, four countries are suspected to be developing nuclear warheads: Israel, South Africa, Iraq, and Pakistan. Unlike those four, the DPRK's geographical location means that it can launch two or three nuclear warheads against Japan. But the DPRK has consistently denied it is developing nuclear weapons and says that its nuclear technology only serves the construction of nuclear power plants. The DPRK used to have close ties with the former Soviet Union, and it is entirely possible that Soviet nuclear and missile experts have helped Pyongyang with its nuclear development. Japan believes that if the DPRK has nuclear weapons, Japan should also be making them. The United States says that it would not be unusual for the DPRK to have more than 10 kg of plutonium by now, and that the DPRK has been secretly developing nuclear warheads and carrier rockets for two years and experimenting with detonators for three years. Another expert view holds that the DPRK is incapable of developing nuclear weapons. It is true that Pyongyang badly wants to study and develop them, but it does not have the economic strength and suffers acutely from electricity shortages; the development of a nuclear industry requires enormous electricity supplies. Pyongyang Develops Relations With ASEAN The DPRK's economic situation also precludes it from developing costly nuclear weapons. Last year, it completed its third seven-year economic construction plan without achieving the planned target of a 10-percent industrial growth rate -- officials said it was only 5.6 percent. The government has designated the next three years as a period of economic restructuring with the focus on developing food and light industry and foreign trade. Such a move is bound to slow down nuclear developments. The greatest disadvantages for the DRPK are insufficient energy and food shortages. Its trade with China has grown rapidly over the last two years from around $500 or $600 million to $900 million last year, mostly energy and food imports from China. The view of the United States, Japan, and the ROK is that the DPRK wants to develop nuclear weapons very much but has shelved the project because of practical difficulties. It remains to see whether the international investigative team can get full cooperation from the DPRK and can conduct its work smoothly there. However, the DPRK has realized that Asia is the center of economic development and hopes to strengthen its economic ties with the Asia- Pacific region with requests to participate in the ASEAN economic conference. All of this signals a policy change toward embracing the international community. Opening the country to nuclear inspections is part of that change.
