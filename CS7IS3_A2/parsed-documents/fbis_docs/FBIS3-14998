He is a candidate of economic sciences, full member of the Russian Information Science Academy and of the Russian Academy of Social Sciences. He is 47, was born and grew up in Yalta [Crimea]. In a conversation with journalists, he said that he has his own "team," but is not yet going to change the people in the present Crimean government -- he will first look closely at them. He said that there would be no miracle: The Crimea cannot become happy over two days on such a basis as two inflating currencies and severed economic ties. As regards the introduction into circulation of the Russian ruble, an economic union with Russia, Ukraine, and other no less important matters, Ye. Saburov was very cautious in his statements and gave to understand that he does not want any tension in the relations between these states and is going to act exclusively proceeding from interstate agreements.
