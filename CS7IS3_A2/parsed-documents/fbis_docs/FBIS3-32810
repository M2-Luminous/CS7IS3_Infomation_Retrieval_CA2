He decided to react against some of the topics defined by the party, and will designate Sao Paulo federal Deputy Aloizio Mercadante to introduce the changes he considers essential in the text. The orthodox majority ruling the party has been hostile to Mercadante. For example, Lula does not agree with a moratorium being included in the party program, not even as a possibility. He believes a moratorium is a unilateral measure. He advocates "political renegotiation" with the governments of creditor countries. If the principle of "default" is admitted in an official document of his candidacy, Lula says, it will be ridiculous to advocate renegotiation. Lula also disagrees with the emphasis the preliminary document attached to privatization. First, because he fears that it will be almost impossible to reverse some of the privatizations, something that almost all PT groups have demanded. Second, because he believes the so-called "strategic areas" in which the party will not agree to private control will be questioned by the revisionist Congress, which will be an appropriate forum for maintaining, for example, the petroleum and telecommunications monopolies. Lula also disliked the chapter dealing with land reform. He wants a section on a farm policy especially favoring the owners of small farms. Lula also disagreed with the emphasis the party attached to the debates on the military. While he does not want to overemphasize the importance of the military in the document, the party is turning the subject into a central issue of the debates. Another restriction that Lula marked on the draft program is the inclusion, even if "shameful," of socialist prospects. Lula does not want references to socialism in the text because he believes the program cannot be a strictly partisan document, because this will make it impossible for the party to make alliances. Lula and Mercadante held a long phone talk on 9 February, and they had a meeting scheduled for the evening. In the morning, Lula told the deputy that the public considered him his main economic adviser, and that it was time for Mercadante to participate in the internal debate. Mercadante said he will participate in the debates on the program. He will outline a critical view of what has been done so far. "The program lacks targets, objectives, and quantification," he said. The deputy's opinion on the functioning of Lula's campaign is shared by a great majority of those close to Lula. "Wherever Lula goes, things work. The part that depends on the party is not operating properly," he said. Mercadante will attend a PT executive board meeting on 17 February, at which attempts will be made to introduce changes into the program. PT Vice President Rui Falcao, who leads the faction that opposes Mercadante within the PT, has labelled his rival's joining the debates as "positive."
