Berisha discussed this question with the Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev during his stay in Sofia last month, when he thanked Zhelev for turning down the invitation to take part in the meeting. "President Zhelev's standpoint against this meeting is very important. If Zhelev had accepted at the time the events would have taken a completely different course," Berisha said. Asked by the reporters at the Vienna airport whether the meeting could have led to the eruption of a new conflict on the Balkans, Berisha said: "Macedonia would have absolutely faced enormous difficulties." Berisha also stated that the former Greek Prime Minister Mitsotakis had invited Zhelev and the Serbian President Milosevic to attend a secret meeting in Athens in order to discuss Macedonia [passage indistinct] where numerous ethnic Albanian population resides. The meeting was supposed to begin around the time of the dissolution of the Yugoslav Federation and the first signs of a war between Croatia and the rebel Serbs. Further on, Berisha stated that the creation of a Greek-Serbian-Bulgarian axis was planned at the meeting, which would review Macedonia's fate and could have brought about the division of the Republic among the three Balkan neighbors. "Milosevic accepted to take part in the meeting, but Zhelev refused to participate in this trilateral meeting." "Zhelev said," Berisha added, "no, I will not come without Macedonia being present," Berisha said in Vienna.
