More than 50 percent of 20,372 hectares of the crop have been completely damaged due to low temperatures (16-18 decree Celsius) caused by a cold spell and prolonged bad weather in March this year. The weather was especially damaging as the rice were about to grow ears and has resulted in total crop failure. According to a preliminary survey, the province has a shortfall of 30,000 tonnes of paddy and 20,000 tonnes of subsidiary food crops. The province has thus far produced only 32,000 tonnes of rice or 48.4 percent of the set target. Nearly 200 agricultural cooperatives have experienced a sharp decline in rice production. On the average, they have produced only 15 quintals per hectare or 48.09 percent of the expected yield. With the exemption of Huong Hoa District where there was little damage to its 600 hectares, more than 50 percent of the crops were damaged in the rice growing districts such as Trieu Phong, Hai Lang, and Vinh Linh. As a result, 30 percent of households in the delta and 39,000 ethnic minorities in Van Kieu and Tra Oi villages, where most of them are under social welfare, are facing serious hunger. Quang Tri has not experienced such abnormal weather for the past several decades. The drought in 1993 destroyed 30,000-40,000 tonnes of summer-fall rice, while the winter-spring rice this year has been a total failure. This has adversely affected production, threatened the livelihood of people, and put up severe obstacles to the restoration of production. In face of this, the provincial party and people's committees and the people's council have instructed various sectors and echelons to mobilize the people to collect whatever paddy they can from the remaining winter-spring ricefields. The people have also been instructed to strengthen unity, and be thrifty in order to overcome numerous difficulties, while waiting for the 1994 summer-fall rice crop. As an immediate measure, the provincial people's committee has spent one billion dong buying rice varieties, and corn and green beans for distribution to peasants. The province has also strived to improve water conservancy projects, and provided more loans to two seed producing stations to increase output for the next winter-spring crop. It has also instructed the local agricultural service and agencies concerned to coordinate with localities to provide sufficient seeds and essential materials for the summer-fall crop, and to exploit the capabilities of various districts and towns to urgently serve production. The province has also asked for 50 tonnes of seeds as a loan from Quang Nam-Da Nang and Nghe An provinces. It has also radically changed the summer-fall crop pattern to suit its unique conditions, prepared for the next winter-spring crop, and determined the number of households facing serious hunger for prompt assistance.
