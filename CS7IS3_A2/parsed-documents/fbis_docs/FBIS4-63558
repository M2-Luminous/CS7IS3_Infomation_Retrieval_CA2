The statement was made to the press in Kishinev by President Mircea Snegur. He said the Tiraspol side stands for making Moldova a federal state or confederation, which is unacceptable for Kishinev. As for the special legal status of Tiraspol Snegur said one can judge about its form only when the first version of the draft law is available. So far one can only say that it is a question of decentralizing executive power, surrendering the functions of local self-government to Tiraspol in the framework of a common state with a common constitution, foreign policy, armed forces, and law enforcement bodies. Snegur spoke with satisfaction that concrete steps are taken to restore the common economic space of Moldova. The president said that the withdrawal of the 14th Russian Army from Moldova should not be linked with the special legal status of the area. Meanwhile, according to the secretary of state of the self-proclaimed Transdniester Republic Valeriy Litskay the joint statement of the leaders of Kishinev and Tiraspol has not been duly applied in practice and negotiations have actually stopped. Litskay said that at the moment the sides are actively preparing for the resumption of the talks but it is too early to speak of concrete proposals. According to him, groups of experts dealing with economic problems and the settlement of mutual debts are the most active. As for defining the status of the river valley, the work in this direction has practically stopped, Litskay said. Tiraspol is linking the absence of the progress at the talks with the fact that Kishinev wants to resolve the problem of the Gagauzi ethnic minority and then use the solution as a pattern for defining the status of Tiraspol. It wants to win the support of international organizations in that.
