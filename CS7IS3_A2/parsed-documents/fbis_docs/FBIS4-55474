[passage omitted] I interviewed the party chairman in his capacity as prime minister soon after the results of the first round of the Hungarian elections were disclosed. In reply to the question of how he assessed Hungary's situation in light of the results, Jozef Moravcik said the following: [Moravcik] It was not a big surprise to me, but I am reluctant to assess the result of the Hungarian elections. That is how the voters decided, and we accept this as a fact. Of course, I have the advantage of knowing the views of the two parties that came out on top [the Hungarian Socialist Party and the Alliance of Free Democrats]. Remembering the discussions I recently held with them, I am optimistic. [Nagy] What do you think the first steps of the future Hungarian Government will be vis-a-vis the neighbors? And how will the Slovak side react to what can be expected to be a positive gesture? [Moravcik] If both of the aforementioned party chairmen had the opportunity to be in the government, it could be beneficial for us to be able to continue the dialogue already under way. Then we would have to waste less time on waiting. [Nagy] The Slovak Government has recently made some remarkable decisions--for example, on amending the law on the use of names or on permitting bilingual placename signs. Have any of your Hungarian partners taken notice of this? [Moravcik] I consider it absolutely natural, and there is nothing special in this. It complies with our political line inasmuch as we promised the Council of Europe that we would observe its recommendations. All we are doing now is fulfilling this. In my view, we acted in a manner that is entirely customary in a democracy when we amended these two laws in a way that also satisfies those they concern.
