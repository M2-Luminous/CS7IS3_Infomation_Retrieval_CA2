Aznar stated that, as long as Felipe Gonzalez remains in charge of the government, "instability in Spain is guaranteed, with all the negative consequences that that entails." The opposition leader reiterated that "Gonzalez' only decent solution is for him to relinquish his post." In Aznar's opinion, "it is impossible" to believe that Gonzalez, who is responsible for the current atmosphere of political crisis, can champion the struggle against corruption. People's Party Chairman Jose Maria Aznar began his statement as follows: "You all recall the state of the nation debate that we held in the Congress of Deputies 19 April. Some 15 days have elapsed since the debate, during which the deterioration of the situation has increased and worsened, and the public's tension and anxiety have grown. And the social alarm in the country at the political situation existing in the country right now has also increased. And you all also recall that in that debate I offered Mr. Gonzalez a decent solution, which was that he tender his resignation as head of government and that another member of his party take over the office of prime minister and try to tackle the country's situation. You also all know that that proposal was rejected, and what has happened during this time and the consequences of that rejection should be recalled today -- 15 days later." "Well, during those 15 days," Aznar continued, "Roldan, a former Civil Guard director general, has fled, has appeared before the news media, and has threatened the government. Interior Minister Asuncion has had to tender his resignation as a result of Mr. Roldan's escape, after stating that he was under surveillance. Agriculture Minister Albero has had to resign as a result of irregularities that also concerned him personally. Former Bank of Spain Governor Rubio has gone to prison, and Mr. Solchaga, the former economy minister and chairman of the Socialist group in the Congress of Deputies, has had to tender his resignation; Mr. Solchaga's predecessor, Mr. Boyer, also a former economy minister, has been charged in the Ibercorp affair, and former Interior Minister Mr. Corcuera has also had to relinquish his political posts and his seat. I believe that you will agree with me that this is not bad for 15 days. Despite this, Mr. Gonzalez was asserting only yesterday that the country's stability and governability are fully guaranteed. ``But I believe that the truth is that as long as Mr. Gonzalez remains in the government, instability in Spain is guaranteed, with all the negative consequences that this entails. I repeat that the only decent and most honorable solution -- the only one that Mr. Gonzalez has -- is to relinquish his post. The key to the situation and to surmounting the situation lies precisely in Mr. Gonzalez' resignation. ``I also wish to point out that following the prime minister's appearance yesterday, there could be some citizens who think otherwise. I wish to point out that I did not appoint Roldan, Mr. Gonzalez did; that I did not appoint Asuncion, Mr. Gonzalez did; that I did not appoint Albero, Mr. Gonzalez did; that I did not appoint Solchaga, Mr. Gonzalez did; that I did not appoint Rubio, Mr. Gonzalez did; that I did not appoint Boyer, Mr. Gonzalez did; and that I did not appoint Corcuera, Mr. Gonzalez did. To seek to present himself to the public as the champion of the struggle against corruption in Spain is an absolutely incredible aim. To believe that the man responsible for creating a political and moral atmosphere that has led us to the extremely grave situation of political crisis that is very gravely affecting Spain's prestige abroad and is affecting our institutions' dignity can champion the struggle against corruption is essentially, as I say, impossible. If I may say so, it is as if a man burning down the woods somewhere in Spain were to claim to be the chief fireman. But I will say more; namely, that, in my opinion, there is no will, nor can there be any will, to combat corruption. It should be recalled that the Filesa affair, which was discussed in the state of the nation debate, is alive and present, and it should be recalled especially that the Socialist group voted against setting up a committee of inquiry into the Filesa affair. Only yesterday, the Socialist parliamentary group, following instructions from its top leader, Felipe Gonzalez, prevented Deputy Prime Minister Serra from appearing before the committee of inquiry into the Roldan affair. It may be asked here, what is feared from Mr. Serra's appearance? Is there something to be feared, or does the appearance before the committee of inquiry into the Roldan affair of one of the people jointly responsible for Mr. Roldan's appointment show me a desire to clarify matters? I wish to recall that Mr. Roldan's appointment was undoubtedly furthered, when he was nominated, by the then interior minister and by the current deputy prime minister, who was defense minister at that time. Why is that appearance being prevented? So there is no credibility, nor can there be, nor will the incredible claim to champion the struggle against corruption exist. Without Authority ``Mr. Gonzalez looks right now like a hostage in the Moncloa Palace, at the mercy of events that he is unable to control and, in my opinion, without any authority to surmount the country's situation right now. His decision to entrench himself, his decision to resist at whatever cost, and his well-established aim to set his personal interests above the interests of Spanish democracy and of Spain represent a heavy cost for our country, from which it will take us some time to recover and that will require an extraordinary effort by the whole of Spanish society. Mr. Gonzalez' stance right now of entrenching himself, as I say, in the Moncloa Palace, at the mercy of events or as the hostage of any kind of pressure does not seem to me a stance that shows even a little magnanimity or the minimum sense of the state to be expected. I do not believe that Spain and the Spanish people deserve to pay that very high price and that very high cost that is being paid in terms of credibility and in terms of future prospects for our country. ``In any event, I wish to conclude by saying in this introduction that there is an opportunity for Spanish citizens 12 June, and I hope and wish that for the good of our democracy, whose institutions we have a duty to safeguard, preserve, and strengthen, and especially for the sake of Spain's national interest -- which is, at least for myself and for my party, and for many millions of Spanish people what concerns us most -- that Spanish citizens will take the opportunity to react and begin a new course in Spain's modern and contemporary history. Many thanks; I am now at your disposal.'' He "Did Not Tell Truth" [ABC] I would like to ask you two questions. The first is what is your political opinion of Felipe Gonzalez' constant allusions to social alarm, which is the refrain that we have been hearing from Socialist spokesmen for days? What do you understand by social alarm? The second is whether you believe that the stance of [Catalan president] Mr. Pujol and [Basque Nationalist Party Chairman] Mr. Arzalluz of propping up Felipe Gonzalez in the government in return for perquisites concerning autonomy endangers Spain's general interests. [Aznar] Let us take it step-by-step. In the first place, I would have liked to be in the Congress of Deputies yesterday. I believe that there should have been a debate in the Congress. That was what the People's Party demanded. I say this because it seems to me a sound rule in any democracy to appear in parliament when you hold responsibility for the prime ministership. To state that you are appearing before the news media because there is a situation of social alarm, at the same time as stating that you are not appearing in the Congress of Deputies because that appearance would create social alarm, is really odd from the democratic viewpoint. I would have liked that debate to have been held in the Congress of Deputies. I say this in order to add that yesterday Mr. Gonzalez did not tell the truth, lied when he said that the People's Party opposed his appearance. It has not opposed Mr. Gonzalez' appearance next Wednesday [11 May]; what we wanted was for him to appear yesterday, since we democratically believed that it is his responsibility. Mr. Gonzalez has gravely jeopardized Spain's prestige abroad and the democratic institutions' very dignity. It is that essential responsibility for creating that atmosphere of debasement and deterioration that must be substantiated right now, and in our opinion, it is to be substantiated by Mr. Gonzalez' relinquishment of the prime ministership. I believe that Gonzalez is not clearly in control of his situation and that he is a hostage to any kind of pressure that he may suffer, whether it be statements by fugitives such as Roldan or any other action that could take place within Spain in political terms. Second, you ask me about some nationalist parties' stance. I have the impression that there is an increasing number of nationalist voters in Catalonia or the Basque Country -- mainly voters for Convergence and Union (CiU), which is maintaining the situation -- who are wondering why that stance is being maintained, why the support for the current government is being maintained in such a really debased and grave situation. I feel very close to those voters who can find no justification for maintaining that stance, who can find no justification for the presumed call for governability and stability resulting in the history of Spain over the past 15 days that I have given you. [ABC] Since it has been confirmed that the nationalists are continuing to support Mr. Gonzalez for the present, do you not believe that the time has come to set aside any other kind of interests and submit a censure motion now, even if it is lost? [Aznar] Mr. Pujol, Mr. Arzalluz, and [United Left Coordinator General] Mr. Anguita have explicitly stated that they are not prepared to support a censure motion. I am not here in order to make any empty gestures or to have a good time. I am here to help resolve Spanish citizens' problems, and a censure motion that will not be supported would solve no problem but could give many of them, who wish to change the situation, a feeling of frustration. The country is no mood for pointless exercises. It is clearly in favor of accepting responsibilities and of taking decisions that will guarantee that we regain international prestige, that our economy does not suffer, as it has been suffering alarmingly over the past few days, from Mr. Gonzalez' staying in the government, and, of course, that the institutions and their strength are able to offer a reasonable solution to the current crisis. And a censure motion will not give this right now. If you ask me whether I rule it out, I will say "no," but my duty is to seek solutions to the country's situation. [ABC] The prime minister stated yesterday that he does not rule out a confidence motion. He also made an allusion to yourself, to the effect that there is no longer the harmony of some months ago. It is certainly apparent from your words that there is reciprocity. Could there be a rapprochement between the two of you again? Confidence Motion [Aznar] On the submitting of a confidence motion, it is a responsibility that rests with the government. In Spain's recent history, there was one in 1990. So it is the government that must assess whether or not a confidence motion will be submitted. Taking up again a previous reply, I have the impression that if the government's greatest source of support is not interested in a confidence motion, the government will not have much interest in it, either. So I do not expect much from that, or rather, anything. I emphasize again that the only decent and honorable solution right now would be for Gonzalez to tender his resignation. What I do wish to say is that what was stated by Mr. Gonzalez yesterday is clear frivolity, because to say that confidence motions are submitted when there is no confidence is a sign that it is not true. That is constitutionally inaccurate and politically dull. Confidence motions are submitted in order to secure a parliamentary relegitimization. Now if Mr. Gonzalez believes that he does not need parliamentary relegitimization because he has a relegitimization by telephone, then I emphasize again that these are odd methods of democratic understanding. But, I repeat, it is not for me to make that decision. It is for the government and Mr. Gonzalez. The second question was about channels of communication. I will tell you quite frankly that there are always channels of communication. There is a permanent formal channel of communication that is parliament, and there are others that, if they serve for having relegitimizations by telephone, serve for establishing channels of communication. Mr. Gonzalez' channel of communication with me is as simple as picking up the telephone and phoning. And whenever he has done so, he has obtained a positive response. I will tell you more; I will tell you a short story, and, generous, they tell lies like the rest of us breathe. [sentence as published] You know that I recently visited Morocco. I discussed that visit with Gonzalez on several occasions. One my return, one of the phone calls that I made was to Mr. Gonzalez: I have had these political talks; when you deem it opportune, I am at your disposal to give you my impressions and the contents of those talks. I am still waiting. Channel of communication? [ABC] You have spoken of channels of communication with the government and of institutions that we must safeguard. Is it possible that that channel of communication that is as simple as picking up the telephone will make it possible for the the talks on the famous democratic impetus to be resumed and for there to be agreement on the ombudsman and other institutions? [Aznar] With respect to the first question, I will say that I do not know. All that I do know is that right now, if the People's Party had accepted the formula proposed by the government for parliamentary committees of inquiry, there would have been no committee of inquiry into the Roldan affair, just as there is no appearance by Deputy Prime Minister Mr. Serra, just as there is no committee of inquiry into the Filesa affair, just as after two years in the Ibercorp affair, we find that there could also be a large majority of Spanish people who are cheerfully prepared to accept that the jailings of some people over the past few days is a coincidence. They coincided one day exactly before Gonzalez' appearance at a news conference. By chance. I can tell you that the People's Party's intention right now, however many the difficulties may be, remains the same one with which we began those talks, which are something that concerns us right now, bearing in mind the objective harm that Mr. Gonzalez' staying in the government is doing to our country's political and institutional credibility. To transform a personal leadership crisis into a national political crisis is an extremely grave responsibility. And to cling to power, rejecting any solution, seems to me another extremely grave responsibility that should be clearly taken up again. And I hope that it will be taken up again. Second, the matter of the political responsibilities. I said in the state of the nation debate that we are acting very vigorously, from calling for committees of inquiry to demanding certain people's dismissal or resignation. And here it is not so much a matter of the responsibility for the appointment of one or two people. It is a matter of the general state of debasement of Spanish life. It is a matter of the responsibility for creating the most politically and morally debased atmosphere that Spain has had in many years. That is the responsibility that Mr. Gonzalez cannot evade. I have said it before. The man who is responsible for sheltering and tolerating that atmosphere of corruption cannot champion the struggle against corruption, and his staying on is a mistake. [ABC] I would like to know why the People's Party believes that having a Socialist other than Gonzalez as prime minister would provide greater stability or resolve the crisis. I would also like to know whose hostage Felipe Gonzalez is in the Moncloa Palace and whether you have spoken recently with the Generalitat president or with the Basque Nationalist Party chairman. [Aznar] I have spoken with neither this week. To demand the prime minister's resignation, especially because of his responsibility for creating this atmosphere of political and institutional corruption, is not exactly something pleasant. The only thing for which you can hope is that there will be sufficient magnanimity to be able to set Spanish democracy and Spain's interests above personal interests. Of course, we all agree that Mr. Gonzalez is not attached to his post -- we are convinced of that -- but since he is not attached to his post, he should show it a little. And if Mr. Gonzalez has a doubt, it is quite simple; he can call an election when he pleases. Not now, because it is not legally possible, but as soon as it is legally possible, he can call it, and he will see how the public interprets his spurious appeals in these matters. Offer of Change [ABC] Do you not believe that you are in danger of becoming ineffective through repeating so often the demand for Gonzalez' resignation? Are you not also in danger of giving the impression that that the only thing that is being done is to wait for the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] to die of sheer scandal? [Aznar] My problem is to offer the public a solution. What is the best right now? The best is Mr. Gonzalez' resignation. I would greatly like to change Spain's situation tomorrow, but I wish to point out that 10 months ago there was an election in which the PSOE won the majority, and I also wish to point out that those who could support a censure motion do not wish to do so. The solutions to the country's situation are those that we offer. If Gonzalez says: "I will not resign, and there will be no confidence motion and no election," that is his affair, but I do not believe that that is to give the country a solution. [ABC] What is your interpretation of Congress Speaker Felix Pons' analysis, in which he asserts that the easiest solution for you is to demand the prime minister's resignation and thus lay bare the Socialist election poster? [Aznar] I ask you to hold me responsible for what I am -- not what I am not. Pujol -- not I -- makes his decisions, and Mr. Arzalluz makes his decisions. I tackle this situation in the way that I deem most advisable for the country.
