This was reported during the meeting between French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin a short while ago in Jerusalem. Rabin thanked the French minister for approving the European mandate for negotiations on updating the economic agreement between the EC and Israel. Rabin also thanked Juppe for canceling the need for entry visas for Israelis visiting France. Our political correspondent Udi Segal reports that Rabin and the French foreign minister discussed developments in the peace talks, and Mr. Juppe disclosed that France is trying to promote the establishment of a television station in the territories. Rabin said that Israel would agree to the establishment of a Palestinian television station only within the context of a full agreement with the Palestinians on Gaza-Jericho First.
