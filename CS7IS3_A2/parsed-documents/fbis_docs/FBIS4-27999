My recent visit to the country revealed that Ne Win's socialist revolution is over. Karl Marx is out; Gautam Buddha is in. Since early 1992 Slorc [State Law and Restoration Council], led by a new generation of officer corps, has been reversing the negative and ruinous policies of the now-defunct Burma Socialist Party Programme (BSPP) that ruled Burma with an iron fist for 26 years. Under the Marxist-oriented socialist dictatorship, there was told repression: [as published] politically, economically and socially. Today, the degree of personal though not political freedom has expanded enormously in Burma. Social Changes: It's ironic but true that the people are much freer today than they were under the one-party socialist dictatorship. The powerful neighbourhood People's Councils, which spied on the people for the party, have been dismantled and replaced by citizens at the grassroots level. Burmese no longer need 14-day permits for internal travel. Once-forbidden border zones are now open to traders. Burmese embassies now issue "visit visas" to former Burmese citizens; decades-old suspended and expired passports are now being renewed without any questions. Former Burmese nationals now have the right of citizenship. Even dissidents have been allowed to visit the country. Former Prime Minister U Nu's daughter and her family were the latest visitors. Than Than Nu and her husband, Ko Nyein, vocal critics of the regime, were given back their passports. During the revolution, those who left Burma were branded as "traitors to the socialist cause" and were denied entry to the country -- for nearly three decades. The exception was Aung San Suu Kyi. She had unrestricted entry to Burma during the "dark Burmese days." After all, the Burmese way to socialism was declared the continuation of her father, Gen Aung San's dream. People have gotten back religion. There is more freedom of worship today. A Buddhist revival has spread throughout the land. Monks have been relegated to their former supreme position in society. It's a bit of a shock to see the young generals prostrating before the Sayadaws (senior monks) in public. No one recalls seeing military or party officials bowing to the monks during the socialist era. To the party ideologues, the clergy were "meddlesome" and treated as "parasites." (Ironically, the monks were the first to accuse the BSPP of being communist.) The Burmese Muslims are again free to use loudspeakers from the minarets. Visiting foreign pastors can now address their congregations in churches. Pilgrimages to Mecca and the Vatican are no longer a problem. The revolution of the mind has begun. The Economy: From the very beginning of independence in 1948, Burmese leaders, both civilian and military, have been steadfast in building a socialist economy, with little or no room for capitalist institutions. This was in line with Aung San's thinking. The legendary Burmese independence hero was the founding member of the Burma Communist Party. U Nu and Gen. Ne Win were his comrades. Under British rule, they were all leftists and "because capitalism had worked to their disadvantage, they mistrusted capital. And because capital is derived from profit they mistrusted profit as an incentive to industry. And they associated capitalism with foreign rule." The civilian government of U Nu (1948-1962) preferred Western democratic socialism to communism. On the other extreme, the BSPP chose Marxist socialism, which led to formal adoption of the Sino- Soviet model of development and to a total denial of the role of private enterprise. Slorc's switch from command to market economy has done some good for the country: life has returned to normal. Food and consumer goods have filled up the once-bare shelves. The people eat and dress better. The markets and bazaars are bustling. The sidewalks are full of hawkers selling goods from Thailand, China and India. The department stores are stocked with electronics from Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore. The shops in Rangoon and Mandalay -- nationalised and shuttered for 26 years -- have opened with a zest and proudly display their signboards. The military have turned into entrepreneurs, too: Tatmadaw [defense services]-owned department stores are now competing in Mandalay and other cities. The kon-the (trading) class is once again respectable after being shunned, imprisoned and impoverished by the previous socialist regime. Today they count their profits and losses in dollars, baht and rupees. Under socialism, foreign exchange dealings were illegal and "economic saboteurs" faced the death penalty. There are two currencies circulating in Burma today. One is the overvalued kyat and the other is the Foreign Exchange Unit or the "Burmese dollar" as the locals call it. The dollar coupons signify a de facto devaluation of the kyat. The coupons fetch slightly less than the US dollar, (the official rate is 6 kyat to the dollar). Burmese can open foreign exchange bank accounts with the coupons and facilitate import and export. Burma today has turned into a giant re-export centre, tapping the two-billion-people market of China and India. To sum it up: it is no longer a crime to make a living in Burma. The Burmese way to socialism turned from a Utopian dream into a nightmare. More people went to jail for "economic crimes" (black marketing) than for political dissent during the revolution. The people aptly nicknamed the infamous Insein Jail "Moscow." The Burmese say, in the Soviet Union criminals are sent to Siberia -- in Burma they send you to Moscow. The socialist regime made up of fellow-travellers in the army and radical leftwing politicians -- brutalised a nation. In order to create "a new socialist society of affluence," people had their properties confiscated (nationalised), their money cancelled (demonetised). The private sector was dealt a death blow in 1964 when the entire economy was nationalised. These disastrous moves levelled the society, forcing the fiercely proud Burmese to beg, borrow and steal. Overnight, Burma became a nation of black- marketeers. The "Young Turks": From all indications General Ne Win and his generation of nationalist army officers are fading away into history. Taking over the command are the younger generation of military officers. The "Young Turks" -- in their forties and early fifties -- have now moved into important posts replacing the half-educated veterans of the Burmese nationalist struggle for independence. Graduates of the Maymyo military Academy and the Officers Training Corps, the new commanders in the past never saw eye-to-eye with the old guard. In July 1976, young army officers attempted to overthrow the socialist regime. The plot was discovered and the coup leader, Capt Ohn Kyaw Myint, was executed. Although unsuccessful, the coup plotters had denounced the socialist system. Since the removal of Gen Saw Maung, pragmatic changes have taken place: the economy has been unshackled, there is a thriving middle- class, fratricidal civil war is coming to an end, economic and social freedoms have been restored. Today, the military is devoid of ideology. Marxist jargon used by politicians, intellectuals and the military over the past half-century has been abandoned. The draft constitution: The Burmese military is under fire for demanding a constitutional role -- like in Turkey -- that will fortify civilian rule. Most Burmese want stability and expect trouble once power is transferred to the political parties. Violence has been part of the political culture in Burma, mainly because of factionalism. It's bizarre but true, that the military takeovers in 1958 and 1962 were generally welcomed by even the most articulate Burmese. It should not come as a surprise to observers if the military steps in again when the civilians take power and a violent power struggle erupts. To many Burmese, the most important laws enshrined in the draft constitution are: the State shall not nationalise economic enterprises, and the State shall not make legal tender illegal (demonetisation) -- the twin evils that pauperised the nation. Both the democratic and Socialist constitutions of 1947 and 1974 call for the nationalisation of "capitalist" enterprises. NLD vs the Tatmadaw: The military is locked in a power struggle with the former BSPP members who now control the NLD [National League for Democracy]. Ex-members of the BSPP politburo now serve on the Central Executive Committee of the NLD. More than 80 per cent of those elected under the NLD banner are former BSPP members and purged military officers. Slorc claims that Suu Kyi has been "hijacked" by the leftists. Some of these allegations are not totally baseless. It is no secret that one of her top advisers is a former communist, Thakin Tin Mya, an ex-member of BSPP Central Committee. He was arrested along with other hardcore ex-BSPP members. Not surprisingly, Slorc has cracked down hard on the NLD while other moderate parties have been left alone. There are many disturbing questions facing Suu Kyi today which may resurface in the future to haunt her. Like, where was Suu Kyi when the thousands of fleeing Burmese lost everything during the socialist revolution: money, property, friends, a whole way of life, a country. And the West and Japan must be held responsible for rewarding and supporting a brutal socialist regime for 26 years -- the most repressive in modern Burmese history. The kneejerk reaction today by the West to the situation in Burma is too little, too late. Plus, they are barking up the wrong tree.
