This high-risk strategy, which will see the Prime Minister touring the country, will make defeat a personal humiliation for him. But it in part reflects Tory strategists' belief that the elections will not be quite as bad for the party as pundits have predicted. At a press conference to launch the Tories' campaign in England, Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, said Mr Major would be touring all the main target regions, especially London and the West Midlands. "You will find him in the areas where the action is," said Sir Norman. Mr Major and other ministers would be out on the stump "in a way that is unprecedented outside a general election." Speaking on the day that large tax rises came into effect; Sir Norman said: "What the Conservative Party wants to do is get behind John Major and put an end to this fruitless and silly talk about the leadership." Mr John Gummer, the Environment Secretary, said: "One of the joys of John Major is that once he gets out many people recognise the kind of greatness of leadership which he gives us." Mr Gummer said that contact with the voters was one of Mr Major's greatest strengths. "The more he is about, the more people talk to him, the more people see him, the more they understand what he said that, whether people are for him or against him, he will do what is right for the country." Sir Norman and Mr Gummer said the Conservatives would concentrate on local issues. Mr Gummer refused to be drawn into speculating about the places where the party might gain seats. Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, has forecast that Labour could lose 200 seats and that it could not realistically hope to take Wandsworth or Westminster from the Tories or Tower Hamlets from the Liberal Democrats. Yesterday Mr Straw ridiculed Tory expectations for the elections pointing out that three weeks ago ministers had openly predicted victory in Birmingham. Since then they have lost a council by-election in a stronghold ward. While the Conservatives did badly outside London in 1990 when the seats were last fought Sir Norman said that they had their best result since 1982 in the capital. This means that they have more to lose, including control, or leadership, of a number of London boroughs including Brent, Croydon, Ealing, Enfield, Kingston, Redbridge and Harrow. They could also be under pressure in Barnet, Bexley and Bromley. All seats are at stake in the 32 London boroughs and the Scottish regional and island councils. A third of the seats will be contested in the 36 metropolitan districts, 114 shire and four Welsh districts. According to a System Three poll for THE HERALD in Glasgow today, Tory support in Scotland is still at rock bottom -- 13 per cent. The party is now in fourth place behind the Liberal Democrats, who remain on 14 per cent for a fifth consecutive month. Labour has dipped a point to 46 per cent to remain easily the dominant party, with the SNP [Scotish National Party] closing slightly from 25 to 26 per cent.
