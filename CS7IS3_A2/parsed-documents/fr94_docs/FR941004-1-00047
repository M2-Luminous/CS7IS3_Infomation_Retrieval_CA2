FR941004-1-00047 FR941004-1-00015 Federal government actions on these 10 plants began as a result of section 12 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1533), which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to prepare a report on those plants considered to be endangered, threatened, or extinct in the United States. This report, designated as House Document No. 94&hyph;51, was presented to Congress on January 9, 1975, and included Brodiaea pallida and Navarretia setiloba as endangered and Fritillaria striata and Lupinus citrinus var. deflexus as threatened. The Service published a notice in the July 1, 1975, Federal Register (40 FR 27823) of its acceptance of the report of the Smithsonian Institution as a petition within the context of section 4(c)(2) (petition provisions are now found in section 4(b)(3) of the Act) and its intention thereby to review the status of the plant taxa named therein. The above four taxa were included in the July 1, 1975, notice. On June 16, 1976, the Service published a proposal in the Federal Register (41 FR 24523) to determine approximately 1,700 vascular plant species to be endangered species pursuant to section 4 of the Act. The list of 1,700 plant taxa was assembled on the basis of comments and data received by the Smithsonian Institution and the Service in response to House Document No. 94&hyph;51 and the July 1, 1975, Federal Register publication. Brodiaea pallida, Calyptridium pulchellum, and Navarretia setiloba were included as endangered in the June 16, 1976, Federal Register document. General comments received in relation to the 1976 proposal were summarized in an April 26, 1978, Federal Register publication (43 FR 17909). The Endangered Species Act amendments of 1978 required that all proposals over 2 years old be withdrawn. A 1-year grace period was given to those proposals already more than 2 years old. In the December 10, 1979, Federal Register (44 FR 70796), the Service published a notice of withdrawal of the June 16, 1976, proposal, along with four other proposals that had expired. The Service published an updated notice of review for plants on December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82480). The notice included Allium tuolumnense (as Allium sanbornii var. tuolumnense ), Brodiaea pallida, Calyptridium pulchellum, Clarkia springvillensis, Fritillaria striata, Lupinus citrinus var. deflexus (as Lupinus deflexus ), Navarretia setiloba, and Verbena californica as category 1 candidates and Carpenteria californica as a category 2 candidate for Federal listing. Category 1 species are those for which the Service has on file substantial information on biological vulnerability and threats to support preparation of listing proposals. Category 2 species are those for which data in the Service's possession indicate listing is possibly appropriate, but for which substantial data on biological vulnerability and threats are not currently known or on file to support rules. On November 28, 1983, the Service published in the Federal Register a supplement to the notice of review (48 FR 53640). This supplement contained Allium sanbornii var. tuolumnense, Brodiaea pallida, and Verbena californica as category 1 candidates for Federal listing. This supplement also elevated Carpenteria californica to a category 1 candidate and reclassified Clarkia springvillensis, Calyptridium pulchellum, Fritillaria striata, Lupinus citrinus var. deflexus, and Navarretia setiloba to category 2. This supplement also added Mimulus sp./sp. nov. ined. (Kern County) and Mimulus sp./sp. nov. ined. (Tulare County) as a category 2 species. This species is now known as Mimulus shevockii. The plant notice was revised on September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39526). The status of these 10 plants remained unchanged from the 1983 supplement. In the February 21, 1990 (55 FR 6184) notice, Clarkia springvillensis, Navarretia setiloba, and Mimulus shevockii were elevated to category 1 status. The status of the other seven taxa remained unchanged. In the September 30, 1993, plant notice of review (58 FR 51144), Calyptridium pulchellum was included as a category 2 species and the remaining nine taxa were included as category 1 species. Since publication of the 1990 notice and based on additional information received from botanists knowledgeable about the status of Calyptridium pulchellum, Fritillaria striata, and Lupinus citrinus var. deflexus, these species were placed in category 1 by the Director's approval. Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to make certain findings on pending petitions within 12 months of their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 amendments further requires that all petitions pending on October 13, 1983, be treated as having been newly submitted on that date. This was the case for Brodiaea pallida, Fritillaria striata, Lupinus citrinus var. deflexus, and Navarretia setiloba because the 1975 Smithsonian report had been accepted as a petition. On October 13, 1983, the Service found that the petitioned listing of these species was warranted but was precluded by other pending listing actions in accordance with section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act; notification of this finding was published on January 20, 1984 (49 FR 2485). Such a finding requires the petition to be recycled, pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act. The finding was reviewed in October of 1983 through 1993. Publication of this proposal constitutes the final finding for the petitioned action. Summary of Factors Affecting the Species
