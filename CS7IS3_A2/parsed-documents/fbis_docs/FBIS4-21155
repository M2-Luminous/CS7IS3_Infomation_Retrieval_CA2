Not surprisingly, Iran is included in the list, and according to U.S. sources, will not be eligible for receiving "U.S. aid" or U.S. support in obtaining loans from the World Bank. Iran is using its own resources to fight drug producers and smugglers, and the effort is costing the Islamic Republic heavily, both in monetary and in human terms. Dozens of Iranian security forces members are killed or injured by drug smugglers every week, and the country is overstretching its financial resources in trying to cut the flow of drugs through its territories. This is no easy task since the border between Iran and Afghanistan, where most of the contraband is cultivated and transported to the U.S. and the European markets, stretches for hundreds of miles, and due to its remoteness, is extremely difficult to control. Despite U.S. antagonism and Iran's own financial and technological limitations, the Islamic Republic continues to do its best to combat drug smuggling through its territory. Iran's Interior, Minister Mohamad Besharati, today announced the completion of a 30 Kilometer trench along Iran's eastern border where most of the illegal drugs enter Iranian territory. The most important aspect of this issue is the fact that according to Western beliefs regarding the free market principle of supply and demand, supply will dwindle and vanish if demand is eliminated. The voracious appetite of Americans for all kinds of drugs is a well known fact. Some U.S. administrations have made superficial attempts to curtail the use of drugs, but all government efforts have been cosmetic and were initiated as political ploys for attracting votes just before elections were due to be held. The most ludicrous and useless of these anti-drug campaigns was launched by the former U.S. first lady, Nancy Reagan, who coined the phrase "Just say no" in the naive belief that school children will be able to overcome peer pressure just by uttering a few meaningless words. Illegal drug cultivation will continue so long as the United States and Europe provide such lucrative markets for its distribution, and the successful distribution of contraband drugs are only possible through the collusion and cooperation of the governments of drug consuming nations with drug distributors. Under these circumstances, it is hard to believe the sincerity and conviction of U.S. and other governments of drug consuming nations regarding their antidrug projects. The annual revenue generated by the illegal drug trade in the West amounts to tens of billions of dollars and it seems implausible that the U.S. and other drug-using nations will allow this trade to continue without getting a share of its income. Also, the social fabric of these societies are conducive to the propagation of the drug culture. The United States with its enormous wealth and its specialized anti-drug task forces is unable to stem the flow of drugs into its territories, and has repeatedly stated that it cannot control its borders effectively. If this statement is to be believed, then how can the same country expect others who lack its sophisticated technology and monetary resources to succeed in this campaign without financial and material help from world organizations charged with eradicating this dehumanizing trade. It seems that the U.S. is, as usual, using any old excuse to single out the countries that are opposed to its policies for chastisement. On the one hand the United States insists that drugs must be eradicated and drug distributors must be punished. But on the other hand, through several international organizations which it finances, the U.S. condemns countries such as the Islamic Republic for executing convicted drug lords in accordance with the law of the land. Before the United States passes judgment on other nations and societies, it will do well to take a look at its own society and start to implement social changes that will help its people find contentment and satisfaction in the everyday activities of the nucleus family rather than by using drugs.
