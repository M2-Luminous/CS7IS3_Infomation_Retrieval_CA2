Seated in the back of a VIP van, Dr. Stolpe, prime minister pf Brandenburg, says jokingly: "I have just completed a two-year anniversary." During that time, not a week went by without new accusations being revealed about his work as the highest lawyer of the East German Evangelical Church. He supposedly had "betrayed" people, had received expensive presents, money, and an honorary distinction from the Stasi. There is no conclusive evidence. The sources are mostly former Stasi officers who sold their information to the tabloids, or to serious newspapers and TV stations for hard German marks. In February, an investigative parliamentary committee published its final report on this affair. Stolpe, who defended his Stasi contacts by pointing out that he had been acting on behalf of the church, has some prominent allies. Former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, for example, is speaking of a witch hunt. [Vaessen] Mr. Stolpe, you have bene attacked for two years. How do you put up with it? [Stolpe] I am constantly under attack. You only can take this if you have a clear conscience, if you know that the population is behind you. My faith also gives me strength. [passage omitted] [Vaessen] This week Herbert Wehner, the one-time legendary leader of the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany], was accused of spying and treason. Will the Stasi ghost play a role in the campaigns of this super election year, in which the citizens have to go to the polls 19 times? [Stolpe] Count on it. You could say that the attack on Wehner is the start of such a campaign. The aim is clear: The social democrats in western Germany, who are in a good position, have to be discredited. In the western part of the country, ghost stories about the Stasi and the KGB undoubtedly make an impression on voters. In the eastern part of the country, an opposite effect can be observed. On the other hand, I am also anticipating revelations about the Christian Democrats and Liberals who are still bearing political responsibility at the moment. For example, on the way in which they collaborated with Eastern Europe. Let it be clear that credibility in politics will be lost. [Vaessen] Do you suspect that Chancellor Kohl's CDU [Christian Democratic Union] is behind the attack on Wehner? [Stolpe] I suspect a quite evident political interest on the part of people who fear the SPD might become too strong. They hope to succeed in damaging the party by slandering the SPD patriarch. [Vaessen] The former communists, united in the PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism], are gaining votes in the former GDR. The extreme right also believes it can benefit. How dangerous is the present situation in eastern Germany? [Stolpe] It is not dangerous, but it is a political problem. The PDS is swiping our issues before the election campaign, and is working in a highly populist manner. They promise everyone work, but they do not say how they will finance this. The danger is that the former communists could become rabble rousers, striking a cord in people regarding their deepest desires, in the same way Chancellor Kohl succeeded in the 1990 parliamentary elections by promising prosperity for all. [Vaessen] There is much talk of the colonial mentality among West Germans. In your party, the roles are not distributed very differently. The West German members of the SPD are determining what happens, while the East Germans have nothing to say? [Stolpe] I am against any settlement that automatically attributes us executive positions merely because we are East Germans. It is quite different from the situation in 1989 (the year in which the Wall came down -- ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD editor's note), when East Germans were carried to the podium. In terms of membership numbers, we are small; but there are a relatively large number of SPD voters in the east. That should give us self-confidence. And we must not be too timid. We must make our voice heard. [Vaessen] Do West German politicians have sufficient knowledge and understanding for East German problems, such as high unemployment, low incomes, poor housing? It is a fact that only a few politicians are taking the trouble to acquaint themselves on the spot with the situation in the east. [Stolpe] We could say there is a lack of understanding on both sides. In the east, people are too quick to claim "they do not understand us." We must beware of tearful narcissism, and dismal self-pity. We must be frank with our West German political allies, and tell each other the hard truth. [passage omitted]
