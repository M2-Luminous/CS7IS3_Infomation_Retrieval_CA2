In attendance at the meeting were Ruan Chongwu, secretary of the provincial party committee, governor, and director of the provincial leading group for two-support work;, Chen Suhou, vice governor and deputy director of the leading group;, Zhou Chuantong, political commissar of the Hainan Provincial Military District and deputy director of the leading group; and Wu Fenglong, deputy political commissar of the military district and deputy director of the leading group. As for two-support work in 1994, the meeting discussed such issues as further enhancing understanding and offering better leadership to two-support work, holding a meeting to name provincial-level model cities and counties in two-support work, and recommending national-level model cities and counties in two-support work. The meeting stressed that party committees and governments at all levels must attach importance to two-support work from the heights of safeguarding political and social stability, and must place it on the agenda. They must genuinely ensure that they will take up the work personally, personally solve difficult problems with the work, personally examine and approve documents concerning the work, and try their best to attend major activities involving Army and local concerns. They must give wider publicity to the work and do a good job in propaganda and education in the work using multiple forms and channels. The meeting pointed out that this year's two-support work must face the grass-roots units, lay stress on practical results, open up more fields of endeavor, and enrich the contents of the work so that it will become institutionalized, standardized, and socialized. Ruan Chongwu spoke at the meeting. He affirmed the achievements scored last year in such areas of the province's two-support work such as the Army, the police, and the people taking an active part in joint defense, safeguarding social stability, protecting military facilities, and rectifying traffic order. He hoped that in the days to come, a good job in the work regarding these aspects would continue to be done, that practical results would be stressed, that more solid work would be done, and that the province's two-support work would be carried out in a down-to-earth manner. In the course of its discussions, the meeting adopted suggestions for Hainan Province's implementation of management methods for naming model two-support cities and counties, and for setting out the Hainan Province's standards for model cities, counties, and districts in supporting the Army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers, as well as supporting the government and cherishing the people. It also held a by-election for a deputy director and a member of the provincial leading group for two- support work. The person in charge of the two-support work office reported to the meeting on the spirit of the national work meeting of two- support work office directors at the provincial level.
