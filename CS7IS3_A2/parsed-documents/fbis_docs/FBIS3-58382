The Americans want the air strikes which Europe is rejecting. The Europeans are demanding an American presence on the ground, which Washington is rejecting. When and how can we break out of this paralysis? [Leotard] First, I would like to reject the word paralysis. It seems unfair to me to say that the UN forces are paralyzed when, under very difficult conditions, they are fulfilling their mission as defined by the United Nations: in other words the escorting of humanitarian convoys. Our soldiers in particular, by their self-denial, their behavior, their courage, are bringing honor to our country and its finest traditions. It is only thanks to their actions that more than 2 million people in Bosnia are being fed. Similarly, I dispute the statement that Europe is rejecting air strikes: Instead, it was France which, during the vote on Resolution No. 836 establishing protected areas, ensured that there was a provision that the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] could resort to air strikes in the framework of its mission. In a more general way, France has constantly stepped up its diplomatic or military initiatives and advocated a firmer stance toward the warring sides. It strengthened its contingent, when asked to do so following a European Council meeting in June 1993. It must be noted that our allies did not follow our example. At the NATO summit, France again gave the international community a lead in the direction of a firmer stance toward the aggressor, including the use of air strikes. And I note that our lead was followed, because the summit's final declaration takes up the French idea of opening Tuzla airport, by force if necessary, and also relieving the Canadian contingent isolated by the Serbs in Srebrenica. This is how the UNPROFOR, and hence the international community, will restore its credibility. [Lambroschini] On the pretext that the political deadlock must be noted and the Blue Helmets withdrawn accordingly, are the French and the Europeans not accepting the fait accompli? In other words Serbian expansionism? [Leotard] In the present situation, France does not intend to withdraw its blue helmets from Bosnia. If the UNPROFOR left, Sarajevo would fall tomorrow, the whole of Bosnia would be engulfed in flames, humanitarian aid would end, and the conflict would be likely to spread to the Balkans. That would be to abandon our responsibilities. However, we will not remain in Bosnia indefinitely. That is common sense. We must now make every effort to encourage the signing of an agreement which establishes the existence of a Bosnian state, probably of the confederal type. That is our priority. There is no truly military solution to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. If we failed to end this atrocious war, everything we have tried to build since 1945 which would be undermined. We are defending a certain concept of man and his dignity over there. Our army is not just defending national territory, but also an immaterial territory of justice and law, a concept of our place in the world, a heritage of values. [Lambroschini] If the withdrawal of the blue helmets is being envisaged, ought we not at least to have the courage to lift the arms embargo, as the Muslims are demanding? [Leotard] As long as there are men, blue helmets, on the ground, the lifting of the arms embargo is the wrong solution. Before the Muslims could take advantage of their arms, the Serbs, who already have the military means, will have plenty of time to defeat their enemy and our positions would be untenable.... Let us not forget that it is thanks to the UNPROFOR that Sarajevo is still standing. The lifting of the arms embargo would therefore, paradoxically, mean first, an intensification of the fighting with the resulting civilian casualties, and second, a probable victory for the Serbs. We may be forced to that point, but, I repeat, it would be the sign of the international community's abdication, a desperate solution.
