FBIS4-10494 "drlat071_o_94007" FBIS-LAT-94-071 Daily Report 26 Mar 1994 Colombia Disagreement Between Pastrana Aide, Caracol Disagreement Between Pastrana Aide, Caracol 94P20637 Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO 26 Mar 94 p 8A 94P20637 Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO 26 Mar 94 p 8A CSO [Text] Another incident between Caracol and the presidential campaign of Andres Pastrana occurred yesterday. Ricardo Alarcon, president of the [Caracol] radio station, said that Luis Alberto Moreno, Pastrana's campaign director, had publicly threatened to declare "war" on him and had done so in the presence of the presidential candidate. Alarcon sent a letter to Moreno yesterday asking for an explanation and telling him many people are thinking that with this kind of behavior he is driving more people away from Pastrana than he is attracting. There has been no response from Moreno who, at the close of this edition, had still not seen the contents of the letter. The circumstances surrounding the incident have to do with the alleged censuring, by the station, of the Tunja news director's interview with the candidate and his wife which was to be aired on the "Personality of the Week" program. On 14 March Moreno sent a letter to Alarcon in which he protested the decision by Caracol--which has not yet been explained--not to air the interview. Relations between the campaign and the radio station have been tense since Andres Pastrana decided not to accept contributions from the Santo Domingo Group, which owns the station. Alarcon's letter to Moreno states the following: "The fact that I have been abroad for the past few days has prevented me from responding to your letter of 14 March. "I deeply regret that, once again, you have misunderstood Caracol's position with regard to the presidential candidates. "With respect to news information, our policy has been, and will always be the same: to defend the right of our listeners to be well informed. This is a reality which we are able to substantiate and which you are aware of as a cabinet minister and now as director of Dr. Andres Pastrana Arango's campaign. "I cannot refrain from referring to the incident which transpired on 16 March in the El Campin stadium at the Colombia-Sao Paulo match. At that time and in the presence of a group of people, among whom was Dr. Andres Pastrana, you threatened me with a `war.' "Of course, I would not hesitate to let the angry incident pass, or forget your angry and disconcerting reaction, understandable perhaps in the light of certain political facts and realities, but there is a lingering doubt. I don't know whether I should take your defiant threat, `if you want a war, you will have a war,' as intended for Caracol, or for the entire Santo Domingo Group. "If the above is serious, you should let us know beforehand what this war involves and what the arena will be. If, on the other hand, it was brought on by a fit of temper or was the result of a difficult moment, we would like to have an explanation of the incident. "Many people think, ourselves among them, that you are driving more people away from Dr. Pastrana Arango than you might think you are attracting."
