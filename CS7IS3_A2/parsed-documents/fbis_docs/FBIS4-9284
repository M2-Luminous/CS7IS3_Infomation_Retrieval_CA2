On the other hand, Mr. Vladislav Jovanovic declared that the cease-fire agreement in Gorazde, which was reached yesterday in Belgrade, represents an appropriate way to find a solution to the crisis and that the Belgrade leadership insists on the immediate cessation of hostilities. Apart from the Bosnian conflict, discussions between the two foreign ministers also focused on bilateral relations. The sides agreed that Romanian and Yugoslav experts will soon meet in order to finalize the text of the basic political treaty between the two states, our correspondent Eugen Baboi informed us.
