During the assembly of the motor of one of the main cooling pumps, which was taken apart for examination purposes, the instrument was probably left between the casing and the winding, the director of the power plant, Klaus Distler, announced today. "We believe that the matter has now been settled," he stated. Preparations for a startup of the plant, which has been idle for about three months, will continue. Currently, a spare motor is being prepared for installation. For the assembly, however, the approval of the Environment Ministry in Hesse is required. Hesse's Environment Minister Joschka Fischer (Greens) viewed the fire as confirmation of his concerns regarding the safety of the nuclear power plant, which was built 20 years ago. He asked Environment Minister Toepfer to withdraw his approval for the renewed operation of the reactor. Toepfer's ministry announced that it wants to wait for the report by the Hesse Nuclear Supervisory Board.
