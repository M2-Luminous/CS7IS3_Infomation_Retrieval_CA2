Krishnamoorthy] [Excerpts] Kuala Lumpur, Wed -- Britain will be asked to clarify the statement by its Trade Minister Richard Needham that pressure would grow on his government to retaliate if Malaysia continues with its policy of not awarding government contracts to British firms. Acting Foreign Affairs Minister Datuk Abu Hassan Omar said today Wisma Putra [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] had been directed to check with the British Government as soon as possible. Abu Hassan said the clarification was necessary because Needham had led a trade delegation with an interest to invest in and trade with Malaysia. "I do not think Needham came here with the intention of seeking to lift the ban on contracts to British firms. "I think he was here to promote British trade and investment with Malaysia," Abu Hassan said after being briefed by a Wisma Putra official. When asked if the Malaysian Government was considering lifting the ban, he said that the matter would have to be studied in the light of recent developments . We need to see their sincerity of wanting to do business with us and at the same time monitor the British media and its reports on Malaysia." The issue of lifting the ban, he said, was being studied by the government. "Malaysia welcomes British businessmen's interest to invest in the country. It is a step in the right direction. "The Government also is happy to have British companies invest in joint ventures with Malaysian companies and at the same time we welcome the transfer of technology from Britain," he added. Needham flew into Kuala Lumpur for the second time in two weeks last Saturday. He was here on May 23 for the Pacific Basin Economic Council (PBEC) meeting during which he delivered a letter from British Prime Minister John Major to Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed. [passage omitted on Needham speaking to REUTERS] During his visit, Needham, who met Dr. Mahathir and several other cabinet ministers with a British trade delegation, had repeatedly said there were no indications that the ban would be lifted and that the issue was not discussed. Needham had said the issue of the ban on government contracts for British firms was also not brought up by the British businessmen in their discussion with Dr. Mahathir as their priority was seeking more investment opportunities in Malaysia. But in an about-turn yesterday, he told REUTERS that he expected the ban to be lifted, possibly within the next six weeks. "They've said in principle they're going to take it off. If I kept asking when, it won't progress anything. If I had to guess, I'd say between one week and six weeks," REUTERS quoted him as saying. When asked if it was true that the ban would be lifted within six weeks Abu Hassan said: It's Needham's views." [passage omitted] Dr. Mahathir had said last month that the Government was reviewing the ban following the removal of Andrew Neil, editor of London's SUNDAY TIMES, which was in the forefront of the attack against the [Pergau Dam] deal.
