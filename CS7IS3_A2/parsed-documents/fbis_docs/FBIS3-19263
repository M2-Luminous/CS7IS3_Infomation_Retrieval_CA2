One may disagree on this issue. In fact, the U.S. Administration is once again using the club in trade policy. President Bill Clinton has reenacted the Super 301 clause of the U.S. trade law. It makes possible sanctions against the import of goods from countries that close their markets to U.S. goods and services. Thus, the U.S. Administration can impose high punitive tariffs on these imports. Yet a certain procedure has to be followed. It ensures that no rash decisions are made, and that there is enough time for negotiations and compromises. Still, the threatening gesture has a certain impact -- as can be seen in connection with the radio telephone issue. Yet this behavior is not exactly a fair procedure in trade policies; it does not follow the principle that the international community has been trying to implement so long -- opening up markets on the basis of multilateral rules, not with the help of multilateral retaliatory strikes. After all, it took seven years to adopt successfully new GATT rules for fair trade among the states. The results of the eighth GATT round -- the Uruguay Round -- that were achieved with difficulty are to be signed by the governments in Marrakesh in mid-April and to be ratified by the participants afterward. The agreement is based on the principle of multilaterality, which also applies to conflicts between two countries. Washington simply ignores this rule. The agreement restricts U.S. leeway for unilateral sanctions. In fact, it has not yet entered into force and the United States is not yet obliged to observe it. However, it would be wise for the largest trade power to respect the spirit of the GATT agreement already at this point instead of violating it in such an obvious manner and of undermining it before it is signed. Moreover, this affects U.S. credibility as a power that strongly advocates free trade. It is important for the United States to strengthen its credibility because it is not exactly a shining example as far as fending off undesirable import competition at home is concerned. Japan, too, is not enthusiastic about opening up its markets for free trade. Yet the United States is threatening the government in Tokyo in such a way that one has the impression that stubborn Japan is barricading itself against the goods that the United States wants to export, with high protective tariffs, quotas, import bans, and other classical protectionist measures. Yet this is not true at all (with the exception of rice, which, however, is not an issue at present). The goods reach Japan unimpeded, but it is difficult or impossible to sell them there. One reason for that is restraint of competition in the Japanese market, partly carried out by the state and partly by private enterprises. The restrictions by the state include vague regulations, complicated provisions governing aliens' registration, the preferential treatment of Japanese enterprises in public invitations to bid, arbitrariness on the part of the authorities, additional examination of products, delayed permits, other technical requirements, and similar things. Some of these barriers naturally result from the realities in Japan, which exist everywhere, including the United States, and which are not aimed at impeding import competition. Yet they have this effect. Some measures, however, are designed to serve this goal. It is clear and quite understandable that Washington is trying to urge the Japanese Government to remove these barriers. This also applies to restrictions in the private sector, including cartels aimed at allocating market shares and regulations that partly or completely deny importers access to the market. However, Japanese "newcomers" also suffer from these rules. A stricter policy on competition by the state is required in this respect. Another reason that makes it difficult for exporters to sell their goods in the Japanese market is naturally foreign peculiarities which have to be handled by foreign suppliers everywhere. They include the Japanese mentality, the behavior and regulations prevailing there, the foreign language and characters, the complicated trade and sales network, developed personal relationships, exclusive contracts between subsuppliers and the production industry, old habits, different industrial structures, and the different tastes of consumers. All these and many other things make it extraordinarily difficult for foreigners to carry out business. In other words: These are advantages that domestic competitors always enjoy at home and which are not condemnable at all. The United States, however, behaves as though the Japanese Government should also eliminate these natural peculiarities because they limit "fair competition." What it does not say is that the Japanese are facing similar difficulties in the United States, but that the Japanese apparently find it much easier to adapt. Another aspect that the United States ignores is that there are foreign companies that have succeeded in gaining a foothold in Japan, despite the fact that they were confronted with the same problems. Thus, they must be more skillful in offering their products and in their behavior, which means that they must be more competitive. Clearing the path forcibly for U.S. enterprises which are not capable of adapting to the situation by means of official U.S. pressure on Japan, by urging fixed import quotas and market shares does not correspond to the spirit and meaning of free trade. Washington believes that it is right in its dispute with Japan, which is partly justified, but it is trying to manipulate trade, resorting to club-law. Both sides are exaggerating. The Japanese Government is wriggling like an eel. The truth is that the market in Japan is much less closed than Washington claims.
