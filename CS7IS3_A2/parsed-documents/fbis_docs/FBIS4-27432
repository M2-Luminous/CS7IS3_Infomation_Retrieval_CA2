He said, "The ruling parties believe that holding elections under the multiseat constituencies system means a sabotage of political reform. This is aimed at creating confusion inside the LDP and the Social Democratic Party of Japan. It is possible for all party heads to gather and decide on certain necessary measures." This indicated that Mori believes that if all parties agree to introduce the "heiritsu" system of combining single-seat constituencies and proportional representation in the election after the next one, it is also possible to hold the next election under the multiseat system.
