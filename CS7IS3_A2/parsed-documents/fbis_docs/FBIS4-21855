[Begin Urbina recording] He was riding a motorcycle along the highway between the municipal capital of Puerto LLeras and Loma Linda, where the Summer Linguistic Institute operates. During the trip he was intercepted by individuals we believe are--or we are certain are--members of the 43d Front of the FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]. They violently took him away. We had certain information about where they initially took him, but we learned later they had moved. We have been unable to recontact them. [end recording] Urbina also said there is no information on the whereabouts of the two U.S. missionaries Steve Welch and Timothy Vandyck, whom FARC guerrillas also kidnapped in the hamlet of San Jose, near Villavicencio, on 16 January.
