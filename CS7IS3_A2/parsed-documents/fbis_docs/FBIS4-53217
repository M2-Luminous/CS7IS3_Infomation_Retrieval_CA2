"The ministry is positively considering improving current regulations," said a ministry official, hinting that the government would move to partially accept U.S. demands. The trade dispute was ignited March 22 when the Health-Social Affairs Ministry decided to reclassify U.S.-produced sausages, virtually banning their import. The ministry said that Korean importers had brought into the country heat-treated chilled sausages after making a false declaration to authorities that they were importing non-heat treated frozen sausages in order to lengthen their shelf life. The regulatory shelf life of non-heat treated frozen sausage is 90 days while that of heat-treated chilled sausage is 30 days. Meanwhile, the United States raised the sausage issue at a recent GATT session, threatening to "review all options available and appropriate," a remark which has been used just before threatening to impose Super 301 trade sanctions. The U.S. side claimed that the Seoul government slapped the import ban without any prior notice and any scientific evidence to determine that the sausages are hazardous to the public health. An American sausage producers association has already asked the U.S. Government to designate Korea as a priority foreign country (PFC) in accordance with the Super 301 trade act. So far, the Health-Social Affairs Ministry is showing no signs of yielding to the U.S. demand, asserting that it took due measures within legal boundaries. "In consideration of public health, the ministry has no alternative but to ban the circulation of the sausage," said a health ministry official said. The ministry has already taken punitive actions against officials in charge of the sausage import for neglecting their duties, which gives the ministry little maneuvering room in dealing with the issue. In support of the ministry's decision, domestic consumers groups are preparing to launch a large-scale campaign against the import of American sausages, calling the U.S. threat "unacceptable." The Citizens' Alliance for Consumer Protection of Korea already issued a statement last month, saying that it would boycott U.S. products if Washington doesn't drop its trade pressure. In contrast with the health ministry's stand, the Foreign Ministry is considering adopting new measures to minimize trade frictions. Currently, 37 container loads of U.S. sausage, worth $1.3 million, have been sitting at the southern port of Pusan since mid- February. The Foreign Ministry seems to think that there is no way to save the sausage in Pusan because its shelf life has almost expired. It takes about one month to ship sausage from the United States to Korea and almost two months have passed since the ban was imposed. "Even though the $1.3 million worth of sausage is relatively small in view of trade volume between the two countries, it could have a serious impact on the bilateral trade relationship," an official said. The ministry is expected to hold another consultation session with the Health-Social Affairs Ministry to upgrade the current food regulation laws. The domestic market share of U.S. sausages amounts to 15 percent and large department stores and supermarkets have sold them to Korean consumers at relatively low prices compared with locally produced sausages, the health ministry said.
