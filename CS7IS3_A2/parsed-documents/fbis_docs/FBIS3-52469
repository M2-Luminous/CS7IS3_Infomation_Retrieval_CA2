Defence lawyer 'Umar Damrah, reading a 150-page summation, argued that the confessions were extracted under torture and as such could not be admitted as evidence. He demanded that the court return an innocent verdict and release the defendants. The State Security Court, a three-man military tribunal, will hold a "final review" of the case Jan. 9 and set a date for issuing the verdict, prosecution sources said. Under standing orders of the court, the defendants and witnesses could not be identified by name in media reports. Two of the accused are being tried in absentia. Five military cadets, a member of a guard unit of King Husayn and four others, including the two fugitives, are charged with plotting to assassinate the Monarch and pave the way for a take-over of power by the illegal Hizb al-Tahrir group. Hizb al-Tahrir, a puritan group established in the early 50's, does not recognise any of the existing Arab governments and calls for the establishment of an Islamic caliphate. The prosecution charges that the five cadets, students at Mu'ta University, a military college in south Jordan, were enlisted by Hizb al-Tahrir to open fire at the King during a guard of honour at a Mu'ta graduation ceremony on June 26. The students were told that as soon as the King was killed, pre-positioned Hizb al-Tahrir members were to take over radio and television stations and seize power, according to prosector Muhammad Hijazi, an army major. Mr. Damrah and other defence lawyers who addressed the court last week summed up that the accused were subject to "severe physical torture and psychological duress" to force them into signing the confessions. The statements, given by the eight accused during three months of detention at the intelligence department, are one of the pillars of the prosecution's case. All the defendants in court retracted the confessions and entered innocent pleas at the outset of the trial, which began in September. The defence has also argued that Hizb al-Tahrir did not espouse violence as a means to achieve its objective, and as such the prosecution charges based on the group's ideology were invalid. Prosecution witnesses have testified that the five cadets were devout Muslims who resented the pro-western "un-Islamic" policies of the government. They also told the court that the five were ardent admirers of Lieutnant Khalid al-Islambuli, who assassinated Egyptian president Anwar al-Sadat Husni Mubarak [name as published] during a Cairo military parade in October 1981.
