Comrade Deng Xiaoping's earnest exhortation to the people of Shanghai, in particular, has become one of the key topics of discussion among Shanghai's deputies to the National People's Congress during their deliberation of the government work report. Comrade Xiaoping made seven inspection trips to Shanghai to provide guidance over its work, devoting great energies to Shanghai's reform, opening up, and economic development. While spending this year's Spring Festival in Shanghai, Comrade Xiaoping said: "Shanghai has carried out its work very well; it has a unique quality and style. Shanghai is fully capable of moving at a faster pace." Deputy Huang Ju, mayor of Shanghai, was exultant when he told the reporter about this statement. In his words, "Shanghai's more than 14 million people were greatly inspired and felt more keenly their unprecedented historical responsibilities." The pressures were never as great before; however, when these pressures are converted into a motive force, the results will be unprecedented. Deputy Huang Ju told the reporter excitedly: On the basis of market regulation, quality, and efficiency, Shanghai's total output of goods and services increased 14.9 percent last year, reaching 151 billion yuan and pulling ahead of the rest of the nation. Local financial revenue rose by as much as 30 percent, topping 24 billion yuan and outstripping, for the first time, the increase in the total output of goods and services. [passage omitted] Deputy Wu Bangguo, Shanghai Municipal Party Committee secretary, told the reporter: "This year is decisive for Shanghai's goal of achieving significant changes in three years' time. The burden is heavy and the road is long." This remark can be described as an embodiment of the Shanghai people's common aspirations. "Shanghai is now full of opportunities and enjoys geographical advantages and public support. What is important is to work in a down-to-earth manner. Only by exerting maximum efforts to make maximum contributions can we justify the expectations of the party Central Committee and the State Council, the full support of people across the country, and Comrade Xiaoping's earnest and great trust."
