FBIS4-61232 "drsov087_c_94001" FBIS-SOV-94-087 Daily Report 5 May 1994 Federal Assembly Committee Chief on Duma's Present, Future Role Committee Chief on Duma's Present, Future Role MK0405120794 Moscow ROSSIYA in Russian No. 17, 4-10 May 94 (Signed to press 3 May) p 2 MK0405120794 Moscow ROSSIYA Russian BFN [Interview with Vladimir Bauer, chairman of the Duma Organizing Committee, by Yuriy Serov: "On 11 May the Duma Will Sit in a New Building" -- place, date not given] [Text] [Serov] Vladimir Anatolyevich, what does your committee engage in? [Bauer] The Duma is not an industrial enterprise and the Duma chairman is not an enterprise director. It is not only inconvenient but partly unethical to engage in organizational and economic matters. The committee created specially for these purposes and consisting of deputies from various factions is another matter. It is quite able to assess objectively the professionalism of key officials in the State Duma apparatus. The committee is working out proposals on standing orders and the law on the status of deputies. [Serov] Nonetheless, the media criticize the State Duma: Too many of the public funds go to maintain it and the people's choices have great appetites.... [Bauer] There is a government decree signed by Chernomyrdin a few days ago that says in black and white: To ensure within 10 days the movement of the State Duma without renovating the building. This will allow us to sue those who are distorting the truth in print. I think that such articles are inspired by people who are not very happy with the fact that the Duma will occupy the building at Okhotnyy Ryad, 1. As for perks and benefits, whether we want this or not, in mass consciousness the State Duma is the legal successor to the former Supreme Soviet. The shadow of the former confrontation between the "power branches" is falling on the Duma, as it were, with all the ensuing consequences: talk about perks, and so forth. State Duma deputies have none. Moreover, the conditions in which the deputies have to work are humiliating. [Serov] When will the movement take place? [Bauer] On 11 May we are planning to hold a plenary session in the new location. The movement will apparently be complete by the end of May. [Serov] How long will it take the Duma to readjust? [Bauer] As is known, one relocation is equal to two fires. I suppose several months will pass before everything gets back to normal. Work efficiency is bound to rise, although the building on Okhotnyy Ryad is certainly not the Parliament Center or the White House. The compound on Okhotnyy Ryad is a ministerial complex built in the thirties. The fact that the Duma has acquired a place of its own is an indisputable success of parliamentarianism in Russia. [Serov] Many deputies believe that the State Duma apparatus is pulling -- and quite successfully -- the blanket of power over itself. Has the Duma acquired financial independence? [Bauer] We are still financed from presidential administration accounts: We have no account of our own and no legal entity status in spending. This surely complicates the solution of certain questions. But I think that soon the situation will change. As for relations with the apparatus, this must be clear: The apparatus exists for the deputies, not the deputies for the apparatus. The apparatus and the deputies are two parallel worlds, but the danger that the apparatus will pull the blanket of power over itself does exist. Our committee guards the deputies' interests. We confirm appointments to all key posts in the apparatus. Normative documents also pass through the committee. We see to it that the deputies' interests are not infringed. Our committee seeks to unite the efforts of the deputies and the apparatus for the good of the common cause. [Serov] What is the committee doing at present in the legislative sphere? [Bauer] In addition to what I have already mentioned, it participates in working on the budget and the pension law. There are lawyers in the committee who are preparing amendments to the Criminal Code and the law on corruption. We intend to devote the next few months to organizing the State Duma's activity and helping accommodate the deputies in a new place. [Serov] How do you see the future of the State Duma? [Bauer] The level of the new deputy corps is relatively high. Former deputies were elected to the Supreme Soviet primarily riding a tide of populism. As a matter of fact, some former deputies too have entered the Duma. However we might treat them, this ensures a certain level of continuity. I dare say that party affiliation as an element of the Duma's internal organization is a factor enhancing the State Duma's effectiveness. Yes, sometimes one bill or another may be voted down thanks to a consolidated discipline. But if there is an agreement at the level of factions, laws tend to be adopted. Let us take, for instance, the election of committees and commissions. Within half a day the Duma has done what took the Supreme Soviet several months to accomplish. The Duma is a fairly hard-working body. This may sound paradoxical, but the State Duma is more inclined to cooperate with the president and the government than the Federation Council. (A different point of view is in Vladimir Shumeyko article, ROSSIYA, No. 16 -- Yu. S.). Once the consideration of the budget begins, they will immediately start lobbying, pursuing their own, utterly parochial interests. There is nothing of the kind in the Duma. As for my opinion on the document about accord, I think that it is the State Duma elected by the people that should be the guarantor of its implementation. The president should put up with it, come closer to the Duma, and recognize its rights. Then laws passing through the State Duma will acquire the nature of national accord. At the same time, personally I am dissatisfied with the lack of provisions in the document specifying the responsibility of the central authorities for their adherence or failure to adhere to the principles of national accord.
