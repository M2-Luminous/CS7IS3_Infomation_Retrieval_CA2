FR940919-0-00126 FR940919-0-00016 (c) *␣*␣* (2) The lab pack does not contain any of the wastes listed in Appendix IV to part 268. * * * * * (d) Radioactive hazardous mixed wastes are subject to the treatment standards in §268.40. Where treatment standards are specified for radioactive mixed wastes in the Table of Treatment Standards, those treatment standards will govern. Where there is no specific treatment standard for radioactive mixed waste, the treatment standard for the hazardous waste (as designated by EPA waste code) applies. Hazardous debris containing radioactive waste is subject to the treatment standards specified in §268.45. 28. Section 268.43 is revised to read as follows: §268.43 Treatment standards expressed as waste concentrations. For the requirements previously found in this section and for treatment standards in Table CCW_Constituent Concentrations in Wastes, refer to §268.40. 29. Section 268.45(b)(2) is revised to read as follows: §268.45 Treatment standards for hazardous debris. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (2) Debris contaminated with listed waste. The contaminants subject to treatment for debris that is contaminated with a prohibited listed hazardous waste are those constituents or wastes for which treatment standards are established for the waste under §268.40. 30. Section 268.46 is revised to read as follows: §268.46 Alternative treatment standards based on HTMR. For the treatment standards previously found in this section, refer to §268.40. 31. In Subpart D, §268.48 is added to read as follows: §268.48 Universal Treatment Standards (a) Table UTS identifies the hazardous constituents, along with the nonwastewater and wastewater treatment standard levels, that are used to regulate most prohibited hazardous wastes with numerical limits. For determining compliance with treatment standards for underlying hazardous constituents as defined in §268.2(i), these treatment standards may not be exceeded. Compliance with these treatment standards is measured by an analysis of grab samples, unless otherwise noted in the following Table UTS.
