They said police, acting on a tipoff that the Georgians who came to Turkey about a week ago were looking for a market to sell the uranium, contacted them as potential buyers. When police tried to detain the Georgians, a brief clash broke out and the sellers were wounded and arrested. The Georgians were asking $150,000 for one kg of uranium. It was not immediately clear how the Georgians acquired the uranium but after the collapse of the former Soviet Union there have been widespread reports of stolen nuclear materials. The seized uranium was sent to Turkey's Atomic Energy Institute for further research.
