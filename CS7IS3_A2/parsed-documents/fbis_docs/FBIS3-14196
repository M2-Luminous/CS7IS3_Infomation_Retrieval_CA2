The four nations made unfounded allegations in an open attempt to justify maintaining the irregular status quo in northern Iraq. It is universally recognized that conditions in al-Sulaymaniyah, Irbil, and Dahuk Governorates are the making of the allied nations of aggression that have facilitated the commission of murders, thefts, lootings, and the destruction of what Iraq has built over the years for the well-being of our Kurdish and Arab peoples alike. The allied nations' brute force brought about a state of lawlessness in the north and in the no-fly zone, thereby encouraging rebellious gangs to wreak havoc in the region. These nations are directly responsible for the irregular conditions. They are meddling in the internal affairs of a founding member of the United Nations, whose laws and conventions the allied nations boast about upholding. Shuffling the cards will not do. There is no reason why we should overlook the fact that the U.S. Administration and some of the allied nations are seeking to clothe their interference in Iraq's internal affairs in humanitarian garb. They are aware that their interference is unjustifiable and has a devastating impact on regional security and stability. Any attempt to undermine Iraq is in nobody's interest; indeed the last quarter century has shown it to be unavailing. Turkey's assistant foreign minister Ozdom Sinberk's [name as published] remarks at the end of the four nations' session point to a chaotic meeting, where the double standard approach was obvious. The representatives of these nations advance justifications for their continued support of the rebellious forces in the north, retention of the no-fly zone, and the continued deployment of their troops on Turkish territory, and, in the same breath, contend they stand for Iraq's unity and territorial integrity. Concern for Iraq's unity and territorial integrity should translate into the hostile allied nations avoiding meddling in its internal affairs. Throughout history, Iraq has proved it can hold together and survive. Its people -- both Arabs and Kurds -- have shown that, when their brotherhood and sense of responsibility are brought to bear, they can sort out their problems for themselves. Outside interference is illegitimate, and it can only bring with it woes and devastation, and jeopardize security and peace in the region. Watching the session's proceedings, we are dismayed by Turkey's double-standard approach. How can Ankara note the need to lift the unfair embargo on Iraq on account of the enormous damage it has done to Turkey's and Iraq's national interests, while, at the same time, its representative notes the need, to quote the unsavory press release, for extending the presence of the multinational force stationed in Turkey to keep a close watch on developments in northern Iraq? As a neighboring state with which Iraq has close bonds, one would expect Turkey to remember that its participation in illegitimate and illegal actions pursued by the Americans and their allies in northern Iraq goes against good neighborliness, the UN Charter, international law, and the 1926 Iraq-Turkey border treaty. The Turks know only too well that only through effective cooperation with Iraq and reckoning with its national interests can they advance their national interests. Regional security and stability are hardly served by the aircraft and guns of one nation or another. They will only bring further outside interference in the region's affairs. The Turks also realize that the aggressive Americans harbor hostile intentions against the entire region, including Turkey itself. Any minute the Zionist advisers at the White House see fit to resurrect the human rights issue in Turkey, they will do so.
