Y. Tsapoyas: "What Is Hidden Behind Clinton's Recovery"] [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton confirmed the predictions of those who had said that as governor of Arkansas he made significant mistakes at first but later corrected them and erased the negative picture he created. A year after he took over the Presidency and saw his popularity fall to the lowest point experienced by any U.S. President in his first year, Clinton yesterday reached the other end of the scale, with the most successful--even his opponents described it thus-- State of the Union address. Even former Vice President Dan Quayle predicted that Clinton would be U.S. President for a second four-year term. It was not Clinton's effort that caused the popular view to change. It was the visible improvement of the economy, which did not stem from Clinton's own actions. But Clinton managed to disengage himself from his destructive involvement in issues like Somalia, Yugoslavia, and Haiti. Recently, and for the first time, Washington appeared to have acquired an organized policy for the post-Cold War period, something that can be seen in the results of Clinton's recent European tour. During the tour, he avoided emphasizing foreign policy issues, knowing that the Americans are only interested (usually negatively) when their compatriots are involved. In his address yesterday, Clinton was careful to give international policy the position it deserves (according to the U.S. popular view). It simply gave an assurance that a good quality of life must be secured for Americans. Clinton's choosing to emphasize the restructuring of healthcare and combating crime was no accident; it proved to be extremely successful. A day before his address, 39 percent of Americans said they believed the White House priority should be to combat crime, 35 percent asked that healthcare be restructured, 14 percent asked that the budget deficit be limited, and 11 percent wanted the social security system to be restructured.
