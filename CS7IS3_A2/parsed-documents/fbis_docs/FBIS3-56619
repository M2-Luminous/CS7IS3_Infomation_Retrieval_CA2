Azerbaijan's military forces counterattacked and forced the enemy units to retreat to their positions, after suffering several casualties. According to the information received from the occupied areas, the Armenian military command has involved the militia units in the fighting to achieve its occupationist objectives in Khankendi [formerly Stepanakert] and the other occupied areas in Azerbaijan. Meanwhile, helicopters continue to urgently transfer reinforcements and military equipment from Armenia to Daghlyk Karabakh. They transfer the wounded Armenians back to Armenia after unloading their cargo. The dead bodies of Armenian conscripts from Armenia are transferred in trucks from Daghlyk Karabakh to that Republic through the Lachin corridor every day. More than 1,000 enemy troops have been killed in the recent clashes. That has been concealed from the Armenian people. It seems that the dissemination of such reports will not be in the interest of Armenia's leading circles and those who wage the bloody war.
