In late April, Li signed an agreement with Shantou Municipal Government on a housing project with a total floor space of 1.2 million square meters. The project will be completed by the end of 2000 and is expected to accommodate 70,000 residents.

As early as in 1982, Li donated funds for a university in Shantou. His donations to the university have added up to 887 million HK dollars.
