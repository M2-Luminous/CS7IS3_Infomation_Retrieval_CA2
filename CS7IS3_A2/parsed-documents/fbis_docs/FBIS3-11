Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-07MAR94-CHINA-RUSSIA Beijing, Moscow Diverge Over Pace of Improving Ties SUMMARY Apparently responding to domestic pressures to demonstrate more balance in the country's foreign policy, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev used his late January visit to China to press Beijing to greatly expand and deepen the Sino-Russian relationship and forge a "constructive partnership" between the two countries. For its part, Beijing, concerned about the unsettled Russian political situation, appeared reluctant to embrace Kozyrev's initiative, suggesting instead a more modest expansion of bilateral ties. END SUMMARY Visiting China from 26 to 29 January, Kozyrev--the first high- ranking Russian visitor to Beijing since the mid-December elections in Russia--not only reaffirmed Moscow's intention to maintain its relationship with Beijing but also called for significantly expanding those ties and creating what he called a "constructive partnership" between the two countries. Introducing this initiative at a press conference on 26 January, Kozyrev said a "constructive partnership" between the two countries would mean a "qualitatively higher-level" of bilateral ties (ITAR-TASS, 26 January). Expanding on this theme in a speech the following day to China's People's Institute of Diplomacy, the Russian foreign minister portrayed the new relationship as a multifaceted one (ITAR-TASS, 27 January). Beijing and Moscow, he indicated, should cooperate in solving the "new problems" in Asia, focusing on the "danger" from the proliferation of nuclear weapons and missile technologies, the question of access to the resources of the Pacific Ocean, and the problems caused by an "upswing of religious nationalism" in Afghanistan and Tajikistan. Kozyrev went on to underscore the importance of cooperation in these areas, saying that the failure to make "joint efforts" to resolve these problems would result in a "very explosive" situation. In addition to cooperation on regional problems, Kozyrev suggested that his constructive partnership would lead to greater Sino-Russian cooperation in the international arena, particularly in the UN Security Council on problems such as peacekeeping operations in Tajikistan and nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula. Economic Relations and High-Level Visits Kozyrev also pressed his Chinese hosts to raise the level of economic relations between the two countries, saying, in a press conference on 28 January, that the constructive partnership "presupposes" a transition to a "higher level and more stable" forms of economic cooperation (ITAR-TASS, 28 January). In particular, he pointed to the need to change the "form" of cross- border contacts from "petty commercial dealings to large joint projects." Elaborating on the economic aspect of his constructive partnership, Kozyrev, in remarks aired by Moscow's Mayak radio on 31 January, said that Russia would "cOunt on" Chinese support in getting Russia "included" in plans for regional economic cooperation. In addition, he noted that Russia was "very interested" in participating in modernizing those Chinese industrial enterprises which were originally set up by Moscow and was "ready" to participate in major economic development projects like the Three Gorges hydroelectric project. Finally, Kozyrev suggested that his constructive partnership proposal demands increasing the number of high-level contacts between Moscow and Beijing. At his 28 January press conference, he claimed that this aspect of his initiative had already been accepted, saying that his visit had "mapped out a program" of exchanges which would be capped by a visit to Moscow by PRC President and Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin. Moscow's Positive Assessment Moscow was upbeat in assessing the results of Kozyrev's visit. Commenting on Kozyrev's 27 January meeting with PRC Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, for example, Galina Sidorova, Kozyrev's political adviser, claimed that the two ministers had agreed to continue a "progressive and constant exchange of views and visits at summit and high-levels" (ITAR-TASS, 27 January). She noted that Jiang Zemin would visit Moscow in the "third quarter" and that his visit would be preceded by trips to Beijing by Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin and to Moscow by Foreign Minister Qian. She noted that the two sides had indicated their "readiness" to continue negotiating their border problems and had "decided" to maintain the "status quo" on the border after it had been demarcated. She also claimed that the two foreign ministers had expressed their "mutual interest" in further developing "constructive cooperation" in the military-technical sphere. A 29 January ITAR-TASS report on the visit was even more positive in assessing the results of the Kozyrev-Qian talks. It said that the foreign ministers had "confirmed their mutual desire" for the development of political, trade, economic, and military cooperation and pointed to the need to raise the level of Sino- Russian relations. According to ITAR-TASS on the 31st, Kozyrev was also upbeat in assessing the results of the visit in remarks while made on route to Moscow. He claimed that with the visit China and Russia had established "new relations characterized by normal cooperation" and that the relationship now contained "elements of geostrategic mutual understanding." He also portrayed Beijing as receptive to his proposal for a constructive partnership, claiming that Chinese leaders had been "very balanced and positive in principle" in their response to his initiative. Cautious Chinese Reaction Reflecting China's longstanding wariness about dealings with Moscow as well as its concern about the unpredictable political situation in Russia, Beijing was considerably more circumspect in its treatment of Kozyrev's visit and his suggestion that the two countries rapidly expand their relationship. Reflecting Beijing's desire for a slower pace of development of bilateral relations, Qian, according to a 27 January Xinhua account of his meeting with Kozyrev that day, underscored the importance of "maintaining and developing long-term, good neighborly, friendly, mutually beneficial, and cooperative relations" between the two countries, but did not repeat Kozyrev's optimistic predictions of a rapid expansion of ties. While Qian, in response to Kozyrev's call for "summit" meeting between the leaders of the two countries "this year," said that China attaches "importance" to maintaining "dialogue and contacts" between the leaders of the two countries, he seemed to dismiss the idea, pointedly noting that documents signed during Russian President Boris Yeltsin's 1992 visit to China as still being carried out "step by step." Judging by Xinhua accounts of their 28 January meetings with Kozyrev, Li Peng and Jiang Zemin also counselled a more moderate approach to developing bilateral ties (28 January). Li, for example, was reported by Xinhua as telling Kozyrev that the "correct" policies agreed to during Yeltsin's 1992 visit should be "adhered to for a long period." Turning to economic matters, he suggested that the two sides need to "proceed from reality" and "explore new ways" of bilateral cooperation. Jiang similarly seemed to advocate a more cautious approach, telling Kozyrev that bilateral relations are "developing steadily" and noting that China's "firm and unwavering" policy is to "maintain and develop long-term and steady good neighborly and friendly" relations with Russia. Like Qian, Jiang also expressed reservations about Kozyrev's proposal for a summit meeting this year. According to Xinhua, Jiang, in response to Yeltsin's invitation to visit Russia, merely "expressed the hope" that the visit "can be materialized at an appropriate time." However, the Xinhua report on Li Peng's meeting with Kozyrev did indicate that Beijing would accept a visit to Beijing by Chernomyrdin, noting that Li "invited" the Russian premier to visit China. Further underscoring Beijing's more circumspect approach to the relationship, Chinese media reporting on the visit gave short shrift to Kozyrev's proposal for a constructive partnership, failing to report his 27 January speech to the People's Institute of Diplomacy outlining the initiative. In addition, Xinhua accounts of Kozyrev's meetings with Qian on 27 January and with Jiang Zemin the following day did not indicate that Kozyrev had presented his proposal to them during the talks (27, 28 January). While the 28 January Xinhua report on Kozyrev's meeting with Li said that the Russian foreign minister had stated that in today's "turbulent world" the "constructive partnership" between the two sides should be "enhanced and reach new heights," it did not indicate that Li made any response to Kozyrev's initiative. Prospects Despite Chinese concerns about the Russian political situation, Beijing and Moscow are likely to continue expanding their relationship. However, Beijing, anxious to avoid any entanglements or fallout from the unsettled political situation in Russia, will remain cautious as it proceeds in developing those ties. Beijing will continue respond positively to Moscow's desire for greater economic cooperation. In addition, the inclusion of Deputy Defense Minister General Boris Gromov as a member of Kozyrev's delegation suggests that military cooperation will remain a key part of the Sino-Russian relationship.
