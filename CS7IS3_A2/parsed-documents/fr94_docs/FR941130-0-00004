FR941130-0-00004 FR941130-0-00002 II. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Board hereby certifies that the final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ). Therefore, the provisions of that Act regarding an initial and final regulatory flexibility analysis ( Id. at 603 & 604) do not apply here. III. The Proposed Rule and Other Recent FDIC Regulatory Initiatives on Mutual-to-Stock Conversions 1. The Proposed Rule In June 1994 the FDIC issued a proposed rule to add specific substantive requirements to its mutual-to-stock conversion regulations (Proposed Rule) (59 FR 30316 (June 13, l994)). The requirements were similar to the interim final regulations issued by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) the prior month (59 FR 22725 (May 3, l994)) (OTS Interim Final Rule). The OTS, with whom the FDIC has coordinated on the substantive provisions of the final rule, has informed the FDIC that it intends to finalize the OTS Interim Final Rule (OTS Final Rule) at or about the same time as the FDIC publishes this final rule. The OTS Interim Final Rule and OTS Final Rule are referred to herein collectively as the ``OTS Revisions''. The Proposed Rule would have: Required the submission of a full appraisal report, including a complete and detailed description of the elements that make up an appraisal report, justification for the methodology employed and sufficient support for the conclusions reached therein; required a depositor vote on all mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings Banks and prohibited management's use of previously executed (or ``running'') proxies to satisfy depositor voting requirements; for one year following the date of the conversion, among other things, required that any management recognition plans (MRPs) or stock option plans be implemented only after shareholder approval is received, required that stock options (if any) be granted at no lower than the market price at which the stock is trading at the time of grant and prohibited MRPs funded by conversion proceeds; required that the record date for determining depositors eligible to receive rights to participate in the subscription offering of the conversion stock not be less than one year prior to the date of adoption of the plan of conversions by the converting bank's board of trustees; required that the subscription offering provide a preference to eligible depositors and others in the bank's ``local community'' (as defined in the proposed rule) or within 100 miles of the bank's home office or branch(es); required that employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) not have a priority over subscription rights of ``eligible depositors'' (as defined in the proposed rule); required the submission of a business plan, including, among other things, a detailed discussion of how management intends to deploy the capital raised through the sale of stock in the conversion; prohibited stock repurchases within one year following the conversion. 2. The Proposed Policy Statement and Interim Final Rule The FDIC had taken other regulatory actions in this area prior to the issuance of the Proposed Rule. Because of concerns about prior and potential abuses in the conversion process, in February l994, the FDIC issued a proposed policy statement on the conversions of State Savings Banks from mutual to stock ownership (Proposed Policy Statement). 59 FR 4712 (Feb. 1, l994). The general purpose of the Proposed Policy Statement was to solicit public comment on the issues involved in mutual-to-stock conversions and whether and how the FDIC should regulate this activity. Subsequent to the issuance of the Proposed Policy Statement the Board of Directors of the FDIC (Board) determined that, during the pendency of the Proposed Policy Statement, it was necessary for the FDIC to review applications filed by State Savings Banks with their respective state banking regulator and any other applicable state and federal banking and/or securities regulators to determine whether the proposed conversions contain any safety and soundness issues and/or issues of insider abuse that reflect negatively on the integrity and competence of the management of the converting institution. The Board's concerns had been caused by several mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings Banks that gave rise to questions related to management abuse and excessive enrichment of insiders, fairness to depositors and general safety and soundness concerns. Those conversions had been the subject of Congressional hearings and numerous news articles and reports. The FDIC also had received direct complaints from depositors of State Savings Banks about unfair treatment and insider abuse in mutual-to-stock conversions.
