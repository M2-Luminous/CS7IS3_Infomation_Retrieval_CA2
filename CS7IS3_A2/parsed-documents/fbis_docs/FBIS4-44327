Foreign Minister Durao Barroso addressed the meeting a few moments ago. Walter Medeiros reports. [Medeiros] Barroso's speech started with strong praise for Lucas Pires. Then he praised Europe and Portugal's role within it. Durao Barroso stressed that Portugal is European, without ambiguity, and that it joined the European Community not for economically driven and merely financical reasons, but with clearly political objectives. Then came a warning: Durao Barroso said the enlargement -- of course -- but also the mechanisms that depend on the transition of this enlargement, must not jeopardize the effectiveness of the European Union [EU]. [Begin Barroso recording] We believe that the adaptation of the Union's institutions and decisionmaking mechanisms to the needs of the enlargement to other European states must not mean a loss of effectiveness within the European Union, or, as many wish, it must not contribute to turning the European Union into an extended area of free exchange [as heard]. [end recording] [Medeiros] The future is unknown, but there is a safe port called Europe, Durao Barroso said. It is necessary to defend safe values such as Europe, and it would be a mistake not to do so, he added.
