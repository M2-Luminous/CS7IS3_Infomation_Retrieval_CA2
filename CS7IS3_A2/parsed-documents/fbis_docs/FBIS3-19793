The report, which the European Union [EU] executive is slated to examine Wednesday [23 March], came also on the eve of Monday's meeting of the EU Finance Council, at which the ministers will discuss budget reform and fines against Italy for having surpassed its assigned milk quotas, the amount of which could create new hurdles in Rome's attempts to right its accounts. The report for the European Commission stated how Italy had made marked progress in improving its primary surplus, assets net of deficit interest costs, and underscored how the withdrawal of the Italian lira from the European Monetary System (EMS) had permitted interest rates to come down sharply and thus contributed to keeping the global debt in line with programmed objectives. Even though interest rates are expected to remain low, the report continued, "the persistence of a risk premium towards another European Union Member State makes it necessary to speed up the process of reducing the deficit and thus avoid a trend reversal for the factors needed to correct finance." After stressing how the progress made so far to correct finances but continue in 1994 and beyond, the report underscored how last year represented a turning point for the initiation of the long-awaited privatization program which was now producing concrete results. The income from the privatization operations were calculated in the report at 5 percent of the gross domestic product but, the report added, a significant portion will be absorbed by the necessary operations to restructure and thus the total impact of privatization for the reduction of the deficit will be very small. Other important achievements made by Italy and cited in the report included the reduction of inflation, to 4.2 percent in 1993, and the reduction in labor costs of half a percentage point which, together with the devaluation of the lira, allowed Italian enterprises to become more competitive. The report from the European Commission went on to observe how the full application of structural reforms for public employment, health care and local finances will allow the Italian economy to rest on more solid foundations towards European convergence. Suggestions and guidelines were also made in the report for the future and included rigorously sticking to the process to right public finance in order to thus stabilize and then reduce the pressure of the deficit on the GDP. Inflation, the report added, must continue to decline and the gap must be reduced between Italy's inflation rate and that of the average of the European Union, now around 2.5 percent. In the context of a healthy recovery with growth for the economy and employment, the report concluded, aside from progress towards convergence, there must also be not only a wage policy which keeps inflation in check and a budget policy aimed at righting finance, but also a monetary policy which ensures exchange stability.
