He will have to reconsider this statement. His 1994 budget, which was already cut by 630 million francs [Fr] in March, may be reduced by another Fr2.5 billion. In a statement to the Assembly's Finance Commission, Budget Minister Nicolas Sarkozy announced that this amount would be frozen. Jacques Boyon, the RPR [Rally for the Republic] chairman of the defense committee, was quite upset about this yesterday and wrote a letter to [Prime Minister] Eduard Balladur seeking "guarantees for the gradual release of these frozen funds so that deadlines with regard to weapons programs can be adhered to." If the Fr2.5 billion cut is approved, which is highly probable, it will come from the Armed Forces arms budget. The issue comes at an inconvenient moment for Francois Leotard, who is defending the 1995-2000 Military Programming Law before the Senate today. This law provides for an annual 0.5-percent budget increase, which is an exception, in theory and in the name of the national defense effort, to the five-year law on the limiting public spending.
