As Interfax has learned, the surgery was performed on recommendations by the German specialists who examined Chernomyrdin at the Mainz University Clinic last week. The operation is reported to have gone well, and doctors say it will take the patient a few days to recuperate. A government spokesman has reported that Chernomyrdin is due to be back at work from a short leave on June 16. As has been reported the premier is scheduled to travel to the U.S. later this month to attend a session of the Russian-American commission which he co-chairs with U.S. Vice President Albert Gore. On his way to the U.S., Chernomyrdin plans to stop over in Italy. He underwent a similarly successful operation at a clinic last autumn. However, surgeons recommended that he be examined at a specialized clinic abroad. It was after that examination that repeated surgery was recommended.
