There are no restrictions on the photographs which were obtained for a relatively low price. The up-to-date and high-resolution photographs were taken by intelligence satellites used by Russia, mainly for military purposes. To promote sales, Militerm Technologies received from the Russians photographs of targets in Arab countries such as Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, etc. As far as is known, the Russian firm also owns similar photographs of locations in Israel and is in contact with Arab elements. The Russian firm sells photographs taken by two types of satellites outfitted with high-resolution analog cameras: one satellite has a TK-350 topographic camera with a resolution of 10 meters and a maximum range of 200 x 300 km. The second satellite is equipped with a precision KVR-1000 camera which takes photographs with a resolution of only 2 meters and has a range of 40 x 40 km. The price tag for a photograph ranges from $1,250 for a printed photograph to $10,000 for a negative of a higher quality three- dimensional air photograph. Enclosed with the photographs are full information about the date the photograph was taken and the cloud cover over the area at the time. It should be noted that the KVR-1000 satellite can take target photographs with a resolution of 25 centimeters, which is the precision required by military intelligence satellites. However, the Russians decided to downgrade the quality of the photographs for sale in the open market, and are at this point selling photographs with a resolution of 2 meters. Photography experts argue that this level of resolution enables excellent identification of military targets and locations. Militerm Technologies believes that within a few months it will be able to sell photographs with a resolution better than 2 meters.
