FR941003-0-00062 FR941003-0-00013 FDA disagrees with the assertion that the definition of ``active moiety'' should not exclude chelates, clathrates, and other noncovalent derivatives. As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, exclusivity is intended to provide incentives for innovation (see 54 FR 28872 at 28898 and 28899). The addition of a chelate, clathrate, or other noncovalent derivative generally does not affect the active moiety of a drug product. The agency, therefore, does not believe that providing exclusivity for chelates, clathrates, and other noncovalent derivatives of a previously approved active moiety would be consistent with the statutory intent. 98. FDA received a number of comments regarding the term ``substantial support'' in the definition of ``conducted or sponsored by the applicant'' in proposed §314.108(a). The proposed rule stated, ``Ordinarily, substantial support will mean providing 50 percent or more of the cost of conducting the study'' (see 54 FR 28872 at 28930). The comments said the 50 percent figure was unrealistic, unnecessary, or unauthorized by law and argued that cost should not be a controlling factor in determining new drug exclusivity. Other comments said the rule should permit firms to buy studies because there is no basis to grant exclusivity to a firm that purchases an NDA and to deny exclusivity to a firm that purchases a study. One comment asked how FDA would treat a publicly funded study. The 50-percent contribution requirement reflects a reasonable interpretation of section 505 (j)(4)(D)(iii) and (j)(4)(D)(iv) of the act. A study can be conducted by or for only one applicant. Exclusivity based on less than 50-percent funding would allow multiple parties to claim exclusivity against ANDA applicants as well as each other. Moreover, the legislative history indicates that Congress created 3-year exclusivity to protect products whose development required a significant time commitment and ``an investment of some magnitude'' (see 130 Congressional Record S10504 (August 10, 1984) (statement of Senator Hatch); 130 Congressional Record H9124&hyph;H9125 (September 6, 1984) (statement of Representative Waxman)). Obviously, if a sponsor provided 50 percent or more funding to a study, its investment represents a substantial portion of the study's funding. FDA acknowledges that there may be some rare circumstance in which less than 50-percent funding could constitute ``substantial support'' and merit exclusivity. FDA has, therefore, revised the rule to require: (1) A certified statement from a Certified Public Accountant that the applicant provided 50 percent or more of the cost of conducting the study; or (2) an explanation from the applicant why FDA should consider the applicant to have conducted or sponsored the study if the applicant's financial contribution to the study is less than 50 percent if the applicant did not sponsor the investigational new drug application. The agency has made a corresponding change to §314.50(j)(4)(iii). With regard to studies that the applicant has purchased and publicly funded studies, FDA agrees that an applicant who has purchased exclusive rights to a study should be able to obtain new drug exclusivity. FDA, therefore, has revised the definition of ``conducted or sponsored by the applicant'' to state that the purchase of nonexclusive rights to an investigation does not satisfy the definition. FDA emphasizes that the applicant must have exclusive rights to the purchased study in order to be deemed to have sponsored a study. The purchase of nonexclusive rights by different parties could result in multiple claims of exclusivity for the same study. For these reasons, FDA also believes that most, if not all, publicly funded studies will not qualify for exclusivity. These studies are usually publicly available, so FDA will not give one applicant exclusive rights based on a study that, by virtue of its funding, belongs to the general public and is publicly available. 99. The agency, on its own initiative, has amended the definition of ``date of approval'' to note that the date of approval ``refers only to a final approval and not to a tentative approval that may become effective at a later date.'' This change reflects FDA's position that drug products with delayed effective dates of approval are not listed drugs and that an ``approval with a delayed effective date is tentative and does not become final until the effective date'' (see 57 FR 17950 at 17953). 100. One comment said proposed §314.108(a) failed to correspond to proposed §314.50(j)(4)(i), which states that §314.108(a) defines ``new'' and ``clinical investigations.'' Proposed §314.50(j)(4)(i) contained an error. The proposed rule does not contain separate definitions for ``new'' and ``clinical investigations''; it does, however, define ``new clinical investigations'' at §314.108(a). FDA has corrected §314.50(j)(4)(i) accordingly. 101. One comment objected to the last sentence in the definition of ``new clinical investigation.'' The comment claimed that the definition would ``unnecessarily, and contrary to the Statute, ``expand and award an exclusivity for a previously submitted study; and it unjustifiably distinguishes between safety and effectiveness.''
