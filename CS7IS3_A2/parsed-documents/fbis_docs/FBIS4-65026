It also asks those who are planning to travel to Algeria to refrain from doing so because of the violence unleashed against foreigners. A spokesperson for the Diplomatic Information Office said that after the last attacks on foreigners in Algeria, this ministry recommends that Spaniards residing in Algeria leave the country if their presence there is not essential. The approximately 300 Spanish residents in Algeria, however, should contact the Spanish Embassy in Algiers if they have not done so yet. The Diplomatic Information Office added that due to the repeated acts of violence against foreigners the advice recommending that people not travel to Algeria is still valid specially if they have no pressing reason for going there.
