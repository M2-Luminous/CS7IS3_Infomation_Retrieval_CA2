FBIS3-47880 "dreas014__a94024" FBIS-EAS-94-014-A Document Type:Daily Report 21 January 1994 ANNEX Japan * Power Structure of Coalition Viewed 942B0034A Tokyo SEIKAI SHINJU in Japanese Nov 93 pp 36-41--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942B0034A Tokyo SEIKAI SHINJU Language: Japanese Article Type:CSO [Article by Tomoo Yamaguchi, political commentator] [Text] Unclear Where Coalition Government Is Headed Prime Minister [Morihiro] Hosokawa admits he is "fuzzy" [on details], but he seems to be off to a popular start, generally earning voter support ratings of 70 percent or so in every major mass media poll. Though debates during the special Diet session failed to flesh out the real image of the Hosokawa coalition government, during press conferences, Hosokawa, his eyes on approval ratings, shows himself to be a very competent and skilled performer. Introducing a White House style to his very first press conference soon after taking office, Hosokawa startled those present while also creating a fresh, new impression by pointing his pen at reporters, indicating whose questions he would take next. When he was ready to announce his economic emergency measures, though short on particulars, he sat himself down before a panel of questioners, explaining and assessing the measures himself, clearly viewing the occasion not so much as a press conference as a way into the nation's living rooms via the television. The substance of these economic measures--a package of deregulatory measures and proposed government spending amounting to about 6.2 trillion yen to stimulate the economy and help businesses recoup profits lost by the high yen exchange rate--were not enough to satisfy domestic industries or United States demands, but coming just before the new administration's inauguration, perhaps they were about as much as could be expected. The new government is a coalition of eight parties. It is probably like the saying, "to expect a lot, in the end, is to cry for the moon." But even granting the unusualness of an eight-party coalition, voters are not going to give the new administration an indefinite period of grace. The most important job for the new administration at this point, as far as the voters are concerned, is stimulating the economy. Closely related to this, too, are the economic talks between the United States and Japan. Even if political reform is put through, there is no guarantee that voters will be seeing a turn for the better in their standard of living. Nor, supposing that we have an electoral system combining single-seat constituencies with proportional representation, can we assume that necessarily means an improvement in government or better politicians. When all is said and done, we still haven't a clear idea of where the Hosokawa coalition government is headed. Even Prime Minister Hosokawa's leadership ability is an unknown quantity. Moreover, even without these questions, the new government is said to have a "dual power structure." The person drawing a great deal of attention is Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] secretary general Ichiro Ozawa, one of the key figures in the formation of the coalition. Takemura the Best Choice as Chief Cabinet Secretary It is not an exaggeration to say Shinseito has a monopoly on the new administration's key posts with Tsutomu Hata as deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Hirohisa Fujii as finance minister, Hiroshi Kumagai as head of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], Eijiro Hata as agriculture, forestry, and fisheries minister, and Keisuke Nakanishi as general director of the Defense Agency. Ozawa, for his part, heads the ruling coalition's highest coordinating body, the Representatives Forum [daihyosha kaigi], which is made up of the secretary generals and general secretaries [and their equivalents from the coalition parties]. With Komeito secretary general Yuichi Ichikawa and Democratic Socialist Party general secretary Takeshi Yonezawa teamed together to form a scrummage, the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], no matter how hard it tries, finds itself outnumbered. Young SDPJ general-secretary Hirotaka Akamatsu has had more than he can handle. Clearly, a dual power structure exists. But, ironically, because of the new coalition's fragility, this dual structure has not come prominently to the fore. Keeping in mind that no one stands to gain if the coalition breaks apart, the parties are exercising restraint to avoid that danger. Still speaking in general terms, the coalition came safely out of the special Diet session. However, specifics will be argued when parties meet for the extraordinary session of the Diet. Naturally, frictions and contradictions in the dual power structure will be unavoidable. Hosokawa has surrounded the Official Residence with members of the Sakigake [Harbinger]. For its part, the Shinseito wanted Kumagai to fill the post of chief cabinet secretary and Toshihiro Nikai, the post of deputy cabinet secretary. The chief cabinet secretary's function is that of cabinet coordinator and spokesperson, a role that comes from his serving as the prime minister's right-hand man and in a capacity similar to head clerk, or banto, for members of the cabinet. Traditionally, as probably only natural, prime ministers have chosen only those whom they could place their greatest trust in for the post. Since all information to and from the Official Residence goes through his hands, his political importance is without comparison to other members of the cabinet. If Kumagai had become chief cabinet secretary, because he belongs to Ozawa's innermost circle of associates, Prime Minister Hosokawa might have been labeled an Ozawa puppet. The best choice, and the one Hosokawa finally settled on, was Sakigake president Masayoshi Takemura. Close friends since their days as governor, Takemura and Hosokawa helped each other out during the recent lower house election, and the Sakigake is soon to merge with Hosokawa's Japan New Party. Rengo [Japanese Trade Union Confederation] chairman Akira Yamagishi, said to have been one of the leading actors in the formation of the new coalition government, met separately with Hosokawa and Takemura prior to the Cabinet's inauguration. Relating his impressions of both politicians, he says: "It's hard to tell whether Hosokawa has any content. I guess you could say he's `fuzzy.' Takemura, on the other hand, has a philosophy, and because he expresses himself frankly, he's persuasive." In fact, Takemura seems to have made the better impression of the two. During their meeting, Takemura sought Yamagishi's understanding of his position. "I've worked with the labor unions (as governor)," he said, "so I understand the situation of Rengo (and the labor unions). But aside from me, members of Sakigake haven't had any experience with labor unions other than in what you might call an adversarial relationship. Eventually, I can get them to understand, but it'll take a while, so I need time." Yamagishi said he understood. It was probably this kind of exchange that left him with his favorable impression of Takamura. Shift in the Official Residence Toward Sakigake Hosokawa eventually chose Yukio Hatoyama to serve as his deputy cabinet secretary. The decision was so sudden it even took Hatoyama by surprise. Having ceded the chief cabinet secretary's post to Takemura, Shinseito put up a fight, unwilling to relinquish the deputy cabinet secretary post. Acting as a coordinator and informational liaison to the ruling coalition party, the deputy cabinet secretary can be likened to an "official residence affairs committee chairman." Without a doubt, it was a post Ozawa wanted for Shinseito. Before a decision was made, the party leaked a story to the press, saying Toshihiro Nikai's appointment had been firmed up. This "appointment by the press" is probably a good indication of just how determined the party was. Another Sakigake appointee was Hideyuki Tanaka for the newly created post of special assistant to the prime minister. The line around the prime minister was closed with the appointment of this Sakigake trio, forming what we imagine when we hear of a troop lineup that is so tight as to be virtually "leak proof." Nor was this the end of it. A shakeup occurred less than a month after Norihiko Narita took up his duties as senior (private) secretary to the prime minister. Constantly at the side of prime minister, the senior secretary has to work with him as though one in body and spirit. Various types have filled the position in the past. If there have been "bigwigs" in the position who made suggestions and pointed out problems with regard to policy matters, there have also been others who acted as liaisons to the mass media and still others who were in charge of carrying out the prime minister's personal errands. The very nature of the job requires someone whom the prime minister can trust. Most often it is a relative or a reporter who has been assigned to cover his career over the years and has been in constant contact with him. Narita, however, had had almost no face-to-face contact with Hosokawa before taking the job. The political conference section head of the National Diet Library, Narita was known as an authority on research concerning electoral systems. One of Ozawa's "brains" when it came to questions about the electoral system, Narita apparently received his appointment through Ozawa's recommendation. Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura explains Narita's transfer less than a month after taking up his post, saying, "Since the ruling coalition party had completed work on its political reform bill, Narita's duties were finished." No one in Nagata-cho, however, is inclined to accept this explanation at face value. According to an Official Residence reporter, "Even after becoming the Prime Minister's secretary, Narita was going in and out of Ozawa's place. He was probably leaking Official Residence information to Ozawa, wasn't he? Because of that, the Sakigake trio--Takemura, Hatoyama, and Tanaka--had kept him at a respectful distance." Generally, one never hears of the prime minister's head secretary being in charge of the formulation of a specific bill. That would just never be part of a secretary's job description. If he was being sought for his abilities as a specialist on election systems, there ought to have been a better, more suitable place for him than in the secretary's office. In fact, there is talk that Narita will be one of Shinseito's candidates for the next lower house election. Being senior secretary to the prime minister, even for a short while, sounds much better in running for an office than being a section head at the National Diet Library, so perhaps Narita didn't lose out after all. Thus, the shift toward Sakigake that has been going on in the Official Residence has been completed. Ozawa, Master Designer and Planner Takemura appears now to be the Official Residence's designated "guardsman" and can cross swords on an equal footing with people like Ozawa, Shinseito's "strongman behind the scenes." Takemura definitely seems to have become a presence for Ozawa that touches on his nerves. True, compared to Ozawa, who has been reelected to the Diet now for his ninth term, Takemura has only been elected to his third term. Ozawa also has the experience of having wielded the scepter of secretary general for the powerful Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. Though Takemura can claim experience as governor, in what counts most for the LDP--number of reelected terms--a large gap still exists between Ozawa and Takemura. For Ozawa, Takemura must seem like a political "greenhorn." Takemura probably wouldn't agree. Though he may not have been reelected to as many terms as Ozawa, he has served his home state as governor and, being eight years Ozawa's senior, is in no way his inferior, Takemura would probably say, when it comes to life experience. Being what might be called "tenaciousness," Takemura is tough and skilled at persuasion and the art of negotiating from his experiences heading local government. Still a graduate student at Nihon University, Ozawa hastily entered politics as his father's successor upon the latter's death, and has no experience in the real world outside of politics. Moreover, always in the political mainstream, first as a member of the Tanaka faction and then the Takeshita faction, Ozawa might be likened to a greenhouse plant. Used to having political authority on his side, he can be tough but is also often criticized for his arrogance. Even those who know him well from their days together in the Kobuchi faction agree that Ozawa is a man of strong likes and dislikes who is known for acting arbitrarily on his own authority. During his LDP days, an "Ozawa containment" net was setup, probably the result of opposition to his methods. Without having to refer to his recent book, Blueprint for Building a New Japan," we know Ozawa is a master designer, able to lay out a blueprint for himself based on a world view and national vision. Foresight, philosophy, vision--these are all things that are indispensable to politicians, and to the degree that these qualities are missing in politicians these days, Ozawa's presence looms up all the more prominently in our impressions. But he is also self-conceited and has made enemies and created rivals. Takemura, Single-Minded Attention to Political Reform Takemura is Ozawa's opposite. When he founded and took on the chairmanship of the Utopia Political Study Group, a forerunner to the present Sakigake Party, he was still a freshman in the Diet. The impetus to form the group was the Recruit scandal. The group started from the desire to study the relationship between money and politics. The group gathered information and later released its findings (though the latter was not part of its initial plan) on the amount of funds each of its 20 members spent on an annual basis for political activities. Even for first year Diet members, about 116 million yen on average was found to be needed, and when these finding were released, they caused quite a stir, leading to a ban on political gifts for ceremonial occasions by Diet members in their local election districts. In the end, Takemura concluded that the only effective way to reform the political system was to change the electoral system, and he was seen running around during the [Toshiki] Kaifu administration putting together a proposal for combining single-seat constituencies with proportional representation. The director of LDP's Political Reform Promotion Headquarters was Masayoshi Ito. Its chairman was Masaharu Gotoda. Takemura became the reform headquarter's secretary general, a post which he kept until he left the party. The relationship between Takemura and Gotoda goes back to when Takemura, after graduating from Tokyo University, went to the Ministry of Home Affairs for a [job] interview. It was Gotoda who was on the hiring line as chief secretary to the minister. Takemura is said to have taken part in the student movement, but Gotoda stood up for the young applicant, asserting, "The Home Affairs Ministry needs that kind of energy." Core members of Takemura's Utopia Study Group became key figures in the formation of the Young Dietmen's Forum To Promote Political Reform (sponsors, Shigeru Ishiba and Susumu Yanase). The group came into existence following the Kaifu administration's aborted attempt to get a political reform bill passed. Takemura turned his energies toward effecting political reform, working in conjunction with this group of young Diet members, but around March of this year, all but a few had given up any hope of realizing their hopes for reform. At about this time, Yukio Hatoyama, Kenichiro Sato, Takeshi Iwaya, and others had already resigned themselves to leaving the LDP. The 10 who eventually bolted the party to join Sakigake were all members of this young Dietmen's group. Ozawa, on the other hand, stayed with the party even after the split-up of the Takeshita faction following Shin Kanemaru's resignation from the Diet. To the very end, steps were being taken to have Ozawa designated Kanemaru's successor as party chairman. After the split, Ozawa and Hata joined hands to form their own faction, hesitating until the eleventh hour to secede from the party. Advocating electoral reform, the two played a brilliant hand in transforming themselves into the "party of reform." But if we look back over the road Ozawa has traveled, it is hard to rid ourselves completely of the suspicion that his reform arguments are just rhetoric being used in a struggle for political power. Coalition's Ability To Govern Questioned Although it is true that, only being in his third term, Takemura was hardly in the position to participate in power struggles within the LDP or within its factions, still, his motives for advocating political reform, in contrast to Ozawa's, strike us as being pure. After all, isn't of the reasons that the Sakigake people want to draw the line between themselves and the Shinseito their opposition to Ozawa and his tendency to engage in power struggles? Even if Sakigake joins up with the Japan New Party, it is unthinkable that it will get ever together with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] to form still another new party. It is not certain that the election reform bill will be passed, but attention is sure to be focused on the tug-of-war between the Shinseito-Komeito camp, which is aiming for a two-party system, and the Sakigake-Japan New Party, as well as the future direction of the Hosokawa coalition government. As long as the Hosokawa coalition stays in power, however, no decisive confrontation is likely to occur between Ozawa and Takemura. For they know, if they were to cause the collapse of the coalition government, they would only be bringing trouble on themselves. The Hosokawa coalition is often said to be like a fine piece of glasswork. Certainly, an eight party coalition government has no precedent in Europe, where most governments are formed through coalitions. Nor has there ever been a past case where the head of the fifth-ranking party becomes prime minister. But it is a truism that applies not only to governments: an object that looks fragile ends up staying intact. That is because it is handled with special care so it doesn't break. Of course, there are seemingly unbreakable objects which may have an internal flaw that causes it to splinter. The ability of the Hosokawa coalition government is certain to come under scrutiny and questioned, but one thing seems certain: for the time being, ruling coalition members are not expected to fight, nor can they afford to. The question is Ozawa, the politician. He is a strategist and the type of politician who shows formidable skills on the offensive. How long will he be able to endure the vague misgivings of those on watch [around Hosokawa]? Will there be reminders of events two years ago, when his high-handed attempts to force the candidacy of Hisanori Isomura for the Tokyo gubernatorial race failed? Probably, Takemura will take an unhurried stance, allowing himself time to grasp the political situation around him. In point of flexibility, he is Ozawa's superior. If these two very different men can skillfully mesh gears, the Hosokawa coalition government may be able to enjoy an unexpected sense of security and well-being. The key to its future is held by these two men.
