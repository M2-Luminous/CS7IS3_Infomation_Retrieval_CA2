FR940831-0-00020 FR940831-0-00009 The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of Hartzell Propeller Inc. Service Bulletin (SB) No. 165E, dated January 21, 1994, that describes procedures for visual inspections, and ECI or fluorescent penetrant inspection (FPI), for cracks in the area of the grease fitting holes on the side of the propeller hub. In addition, this SB describes an interim alternative method of compliance that involves chamfering the inside and outside surfaces of the propeller hub arm by the grease fitting holes. This modification allows the propeller to operate for 400 hours TIS, or 36 months after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first, before requiring, for propellers installed on certain aircraft, hub replacement with a new post-1983 configuration propeller hub. This modification was created to provide relief to certain aircraft that would have difficulty in complying with the stringent repetitive inspection intervals and could not obtain propeller hub replacement in the near term. This modification was approved by the FAA as an alternative method of compliance to AD 93&hyph;16&hyph;14, and has been added to this proposed AD as a interim compliance option. Operators that have accomplished this modification in accordance with Hartzell Propeller Inc. SB No. 165E will be given 400 hours TIS, or 36 calendar months after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first, prior to mandating hub replacement for propellers installed on certain aircraft. For propellers installed on other aircraft, this modification extends the repetitive inspection interval to 400 hours TIS. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other propellers of this same type design, this AD supersedes AD 93&hyph;16&hyph;14 to reduce the repetitive inspection interval from 25 hours TIS to 10 hours TIS for propellers installed on certain aircraft. The proposed AD would also require for these propellers a mandatory terminating action by June 1995, or for those propellers that have been modified by chamfering, at 400 hours TIS, or 36 calendar months after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first, by requiring replacement of the existing pre-1983 configuration hubs with a new post-1983 hub configuration. For affected propellers installed on other aircraft, the chamfering modification extends the repetitive inspection interval to 400 hours TIS, and the replacement of hubs as a terminating action is optional. In addition, the FAA has restricted the special flight permit paragraph to only allow ferry flights to a point where the inspections can be performed, but to disallow ferry flights when a crack is known or suspected. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days. Comments Invited Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption ADDRESSES . All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would be needed. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;19.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing Amendment 39&hyph;8704 (58 FR 67307, December 21, 1993), and by adding a new airworthiness directive, Amendment 39&hyph;9008, to read as follows: 94&hyph;17&hyph;13 Hartzell Propeller Inc.: Docket No. 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;19. Supersedes AD 93&hyph;16&hyph;14, Amendment 39&hyph;8704.
