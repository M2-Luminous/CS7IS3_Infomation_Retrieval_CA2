Boris Yeltsin was twice treated for back pain by a medical team from that hospital -- first at the Barcelona Hospital and later in Moscow. Dr. Humet stated that he does not deem it necessary for Yeltsin to be given a medical checkup in Barcelona, "since the doctors treating him in Moscow are sufficiently competent." Humet added that "we know that he is coming to Barcelona, but there are no plans for him to have a medical checkup. He has not requested this, and we do not believe that it is necessary. Moreover, it makes no sense to plan a visit so far in advance." The doctor stressed: "We have been denying this (the checkup) for days. Now is not the time to start speculating whether or not he will come." The Barcelona Hospital medical director added that Boris Yeltsin has asked to see personally some of the doctors who treated him, but not for medical reasons -- just out of friendship. With respect to the reports published about the possibility that Yeltsin is suffering from cirrhosis of the liver, Humet said that "we have no evidence that he has cirrhosis. At least, the last time we visited him (in September 1993), he did not have cirrhosis." Humet added that if Boris Yeltsin had any problem with his back or liver, "he would not wish to be treated in Barcelona, because greater publicity would be given to the matter here, and everybody would know about it. Moreover, he can be treated in Moscow with the same guarantees." The first time that Boris Yeltsin was treated at the Barcelona Hospital was around three years ago, during a visit by the Russian president to Barcelona. Yeltsin felt unwell, and was taken to that hospital, where he underwent an operation for a slipped disk. The second occasion was in Moscow at the beginning of September 1993, when Yeltsin again felt discomfort and pain in the lumbar region, and was treated by the same medical team, which went to the Russian capital, although this time an operation was not necessary. In addition, the Russian Consulate in Barcelona has neither confirmed nor denied the possibility that Boris Yeltsin will undergo a medical checkup in Barcelona.
