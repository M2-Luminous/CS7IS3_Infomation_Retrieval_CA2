The DPRK responded by rejecting the Security Council's call, saying that it is totally unacceptable and unjustified. Pyongyang said in its announcement that the IAEA's evaluation of the DPRK nuclear issue is based on an erroneous assessment and is wholly improper. The DPRK's tough position immediately intensified the dispute on the peninsula. The DPRK is continuing the fuel rod removal and refusing inspection by international nuclear experts, causing dissatisfaction among the United States, the ROK, Japan, and other countries. If the DPRK continues to replace those fuel rods, the IAEA will not be able to find out whether the DPRK has been secretly making nuclear bombs. The IAEA pointed out that the DPRK's continuing removal of fuel rods is very serious and can be seen as a proof by default that it is indeed developing nuclear bombs. The Security Council's call was softer in tone and did not sound like an ultimatum, possibly as a result of China's influence. China is calling on the United States, the DPRK, the ROK, and concerned parties to sit down for frank consultations on the "suspicion about nuclear weapons," and to refrain from resorting abruptly to actions to isolate the DPRK, although it is also stressing its opposition to nuclear armaments on the Korean peninsula and its demand that the DPRK accept international nuclear inspection. Japan Says the DPRK Is About To Launch a Guided Missile Test The problem right now is that the DPRK's hardened position has made the United States, the ROK, and Japan look at it as a very serious matter; and the report acquired by Japan that the DPRK might test-fire a large guided missile into the Sea of Japan within this week only heated up the media. Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa said on 1 June at the House of Representatives Budget Committee that if the United Nations still fails to come up with a decisive resolution, Japan will be prepared to move toward a three-country joint effort to address the issue with the United States and the ROK, on the argument that the ROK's and Japan's security has a direct bearing on the U.S.-Japanese Security Pact. The United Nations will impose a naval blockade to cut off ship transport to the DPRK in the case of economic sanctions. Pyongyang is very nervous about such a move and has declared that the deployment of U.S. warships to block off the DPRK may trigger war. In fact both the DPRK and the ROK have put their countries on emergency mobilization footings and readied contingency plans in anticipation of war. The DPRK Cannot Afford the Cost of War Have developments on the peninsula reached an explosion point? I do not believe that the matter can be this simple. The DPRK simply cannot take it if hit by full-scale economic sanctions. Once the sanctions are in force, remittances by Koreans residing in Japan will be cut off, and so will grain and oil [qi you 3086 3111] from China, and commodities obtained through border trade. Under an economic blockade, very grave situations may occur, one of which may be a massive outflow of Korean people into first the ROK, and then China and Japan; neighboring countries will all be worried. Under economic sanctions, will the DPRK, with its "back to the wall," go to war with the ROK? The answer is no. The DPRK is worn out economically and, once war begins, it is absolutely incapable of sustaining the enormous war expenditure; its domestic economy will become a bigger concern. ROK President Kim Yong-sam is visiting Russia, talking with Yeltsin on how to solve the DPRK nuclear issue. Once war breaks out on the peninsula, Russia will not support the DPRK. The Russo-DPRK Friendship Treaty is to due to expire in two years and is not something to count on. For the DPRK, the best option is to accept inspection and thus dispel international suspicions about its nuclear program. This will benefit its relations with the United States, Japan, and the ROK and may usher in cooperation and exchange helping it to open up to the outside world. For the United States, the ROK, and Japan, it is better to pursue peaceful consultations with the DPRK and not to resort to sanctions at every turn.
