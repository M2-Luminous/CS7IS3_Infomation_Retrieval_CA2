The translated version will soon be distributed to government offices in charge of diplomacy toward Japan. It is quite exceptional for the U.S. Government to translate the full text of a book published in Japan, and in such a short time. In recent years The Japan That Can Say `No', which was co-authored by Akio Morita and Shintaro Ishihara, has been the only Japanese book translated by Washington. It is said the United States is interested in Ozawa's book because it considers him a behind-the-scenes strong man in the present Japanese coalition government, and thus is closely observing him. However, the actual opinion of Ozawa by U.S. Government officials seems to be a mixture of praise and apprehension, or trust and suspicion. The Clinton administration is paying close attention to Ozawa. His book "Blueprint for Building a New Japan was published in May. Since then, it has been on the best-sellers list. The translation was undertaken by the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS), an organization related to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). FBIS's main tasks include monitoring radio broadcasts of foreign countries, picking up news reports and comments concerning the United States, and translating them. Because of its superior capability in foreign languages, FBIS is sometimes asked to do emergency translations, as in the case with Ozawa's book. The translation of the book into English is reportedly finished. In December, the translated version will be published as a monograph and distributed as an FBIS publication intended for U.S. Government use by officials of those departments and offices dealing with Japan, as well as to concerned members of Congress. A copy of the English version obtained by SANKEI SHIMBUN recently shows that the entire 258 pages of the original, from the "Foreword" to the very last word of the text, were translated in full in 118 pages of English text. The English translation is marked "For Official Use Only," indicating this is only to be used as internal reference material by the U.S. Government, apparently a move to avoid any copyright violations. The Japan That Can Say No was also translated in full in 1989. In the book Ishihara discussed "the export of high-technology products which can be converted to military use in the USSR." This drew the Department of Defense's attention, which commissioned a private specialist organization to do the English translation. However, this time a CIA-affiliated organization is directly involved in the translation. On 29 November a U.S. Government source explained the reason for this unusual procedure. He stated: "This shows that the U.S. Government believes that knowing the role played by Ozawa, and being acquainted with his thinking, is most important to projecting on Japanese politics, which presently are in a crucial phase of transition." Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has published three books in Japanese. So far the United States has not reacted in a similar manner. Another U.S. Government source who has been involved in the Japan policy of a number of U.S. administrations said: "From the time Ozawa was deputy secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party, his personal ability and positive attitude toward relations with the United States, plus his connections with Kanemaru and Takeshita, led to a tendency on the part of the United States to count on him for alleviating Japan-U.S. friction. Such expectations remain unchanged." It is true that people inside the U.S. Government have a highly favorable opinion of Ozawa for successfully concluding the very difficult negotiations with then U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills during the 1989 Japan-U.S. telecommunication talks. Those who actually participated in the negotiations say that "his thinking and logic is sharp, and he has great implementation ability." They add that "he holds a vision which designates maintaining strong relations with the United States as the cornerstone of Japanese foreign policy." U.S. public opinion of Ozawa remains favorable. However, some people express concern that Ozawa "plans to introduce an independent line for Japan's long-term security; he will eventually oppose the U.S. line." They feel that "one needs to be careful about his role as a power broker, his involvement in money politics, and his nationalistic aspect." This is also regarded by some as one reason for undertaking a full translation of his book.
