Consider "back to basics" abroad. "You are risking a third world war," said the Russian demagogue Vladimir Zhirinovskiy of this week's NATO summit. Are we? If so, we should be told. The seeds of appeasement are sown in every vague communique. President Clinton's exasperated speech in Brussels on Monday [10 January] was understandable. Stripped of diplomacy it said: you Europeans twitter on about collective security, yet you do nothing about Bosnia. You want us to give you guarantees of intervention when things go wrong, but you do nothing to keep them right. You are all over the shop. You want us to push the NATO border farther east. Then you want us to deter Russian neo-imperialism. Well too bad. We are more interested in Japan and China. We shall deal with Russia our way. You can comfort the small fry. At this point, blood drains from Europe's cheeks. Douglas Hurd mutters that he might drop a little bomb on Bosnia to show his machismo. But beggars can't be choosers. The rock on which NATO rests is the old American willingness to fight anybody who threatens to tear Europe apart. The willingness was activated twice this century, against Germany. It was activated a third time when NATO was set up, to defend West Europe against Russia. It has now been requested by the former communist countries of East Europe against the same threat. As a Polish ambassador said on Monday, "We are lost in a grey zone. We have no allies, no guarantees." Let us go back to an argument in Washington 45 years ago. It was between the drafters of the NATO treaty and the Senate foreign relations committee. It was blunt. Europe wanted the Americans to promise to go to war again if any NATO member was attacked. The American response was, "Er, um, perhaps, if..." Only Congress could declare war. Why not offer "measures" rather than "military action." The Europeans, led by the British ambassador, Sir Oliver Franks, said this was not good enough. A less than wholehearted commitment might satisfy the allies, but it would signal disastrous weakness to the Russians. NATO security should mean what it said, and say what it meant. The outcome was the famous Franks-Acheson Article five of the NATO treaty. An attack on one member of NATO "shall be considered an armed attack against them all." In the event of such attack, each member will "forthwith" take action to resist it. This pledge was backed with American troops on the ground and with often hysterical American demonology of Russians. The American people had to accept the catastrophic implication of the pledge, even where there was no threat to American soil. At the formal signing of the NATO treaty, a marine band played "It ain't necessarily so." Yet who can doubt that article five did more than anything to keep the Cold War cool? A year ago, the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrey Kozyrev, made what was treated as a satirical speech. He warned the West not to take Russian liberalism for granted. Just imagine, he said with a smile, if Boris Yeltsin were hamstrung by reactionaries in Parliament. Imagine a surge of Russian nationalism under a demagogue. Imagine a movement to push the Russian frontier back to that of the old Soviet Union and even beyond. Imagine a huge and disaffected Russian army summoned to support all Slavs against oppression. He said this in December 1992. We laughed. I wonder how history will see that speech, which has all but come true within 12 months. If I were a Lithuanian or a Ukrainian, a Pole or a Slovak, I would be more than jittery at the rise of Mr Zhirinovskiy and the ambivalence of the Russian generals. I would look urgently for a powerful ally. Hence the request to join NATO. Some NATO members have sympathised. America has not. Washington's Realpolitik, led by the Deputy Secretary of State, Strobe Talbott, will do nothing that might undermine President Yeltsin. Any advance of the NATO guarantee near to, even up to, the Russian border would, we are told, strengthen opposition to Mr Yeltsin. More ominous, it would be dishonest. The American people would not accept their troops confronting a Russian Blitzkrieg through Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine or Moldova. They would not do so even if the tanks rolled on into Poland or Slovakia. Nothing has changed since 1956 or 1968. Americans might be upset, as they were over Afghanistan. But upset Americans do not stop tanks. Military strategists are now realising that the unthinkability of nuclear weapons has made limited conventional war more plausible. Europeans are killing each other with bayonets and hand grenades. The deterrent is losing its bite. A battle to stop a Russian army advancing into the Baltics or Poland would at first be conventional and extremely messy. It would require huge numbers of soldiers with logistical support. It might ultimately require tactical nuclear deterrence. Without America, such conflict would be vulnerable to every 20th-century horror: Russian victory, German expansion, the spread of Balkan atrocities, the rise of dictatorship, mass migration of refugees. America is deaf to such alarmism. It is led by a neo- Orientalist president, a partly isolationist Congress and a pathological fear of military casualties overseas. Hence the formula put together in Washington to fob off the new applicants: a Partnership for Peace with no security guarantee. Hence the stalling ideas of new applicants "proving their democratic credentials," of NATO becoming a united services club for military co-operation and bonhomie, embracing even Russia. This is like saying to a sinking ship that it can have a lifeboat only if it makes it first to port. This is not the NATO that Lithuania wants to join. It want NATO's territorial guarantee at its shoulder now. What is happening is a rerun of the old argument between Franks, Dean Acheson and the Senate in 1949. Then a young senator, Tom Connally, taunted the Europeans that their demand was to "Do anything you want to do, you need not worry; as soon as anything happens we will come over and fight your quarrel for you." The Europeans won that argument. They persuaded America that if it said yes to a NATO guarantee, Europe's quarrels would never come to a fight. Throughout the Cold War they were right. Now we have a fight in the former Yugoslavia. Europe refuses, in my view rightly, to see Bosnia as a matter of collective security. It does not regard Serbia or Croatia as comparable to the threat that Russia might pose to democracy in East Europe. NATO might have a role as "moral mercenary" in what was Yugoslavia, but that has no bearing on its central role. America disagrees. It sees Bosnia as a real test of Europe's ability to act together to sort out a quarrel before running across the Atlantic to nanny. Hence the endless bickering about air strikes. I am with Europe. Article five was a commitment by America to defend Western democracies (and some dictatorships) against external attack. Such was its success that the number of the democracies has increased. So why not increase the boundary of the commitment? The answer is that America's initial hesitancy about committing itself to a European conflict has revived at just the moment when such a conflict has once again become remotely conceivable. Washington shudders at the thought, as Britain shuddered in 1938. So Russia must be appeased. Russians must not be subjected to further psychological bruising. This might be counterproductive. The grey zone countries may be vulnerable, but invasion has always been their fate. Ask Tolstoy. Ask Chamberlain. If war breaks out around Russia's borders, blame history. Perhaps the Americans are right. Perhaps the Russian threat is not enough to risk inflaming the isolationism of Congress. Perhaps the moment when a new line needs to be drawn across Europe has not arrived, and we can comfort ourselves with Santayana's well-founded belief that in the depths of every American heart lies goodwill to the world. But in diplomacy, timing is all. Europe is bad at timing. So remember Mr Kozyrev's speech.
