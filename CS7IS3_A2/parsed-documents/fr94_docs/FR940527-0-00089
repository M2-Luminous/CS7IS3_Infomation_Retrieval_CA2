FR940527-0-00089 FR940527-0-00027 The NPRM preceding the April 1993 final rule explained the significance of a built-in restraint manufacturer's specifying the vehicle models and seating positions that are suitable for its restraints. Such specification has important implications and advantages for manufacturers of built-in restraints that do not also manufacture the vehicle in which the restraint is installed. The NPRM stated: The instructions would establish the assumptions that the [built-in restraint] manufacturer had about the vehicle interior that form the basis for the [restraint's] certification. The instructions specify attributes about the vehicle interior that are compatible or incompatible with the restraint. For example, the instructions could state that the restraint must not be installed within a specified distance from any rigid interior structures. The instructions would help ensure that a built-in restraint performs as intended in the real world. NHTSA also believes that the installation instructions would help facilitate compliance testing. If the instructions were specific as to the vehicle types suitable for the restraint, the agency could determine the configuration of the ``specific vehicle shell or the specific vehicle'' (S6.1.1.1(a)) for testing the restraint. The agency would install the restraint pursuant to the manufacturer's instructions. The restraint's performance in the test would be representative of its performance in the vehicle. 57 FR 870, 872 (January 9, 1992). In other words, built-in restraint manufacturers are responsible for the compliance of their systems in vehicles and seating positions in which they anticipate that their restraints will be installed. They can control where the restraints are installed by specifying limits in the installation instructions accompanying the restraint. (These instructions are typically provided to professionals, not the public, because installing a built-in restraint into the vehicle as a permanent structure requires more technical ability than that of the average consumer.) The built-in restraint manufacturer can avoid a noncompliance resulting from use of its restraint in a particular vehicle or seating position by identifying those vehicles and seating positions that are appropriate for its restraint. Hassel Free said it was economically unfeasible to test its restraint with each van interior to assess the ability of the restraint to comply with Standard 213. Testing the restraint with the interior of each van, regardless of limitations in the manufacturer's instructions, is not required by NHTSA. Further, it is not even necessary to test the restraint in each model of van which the manufacturer specifies as being suitable for the restraint. A manufacturer that tests its restraint for certification purposes could limit its testing by deciding to test only a ``worst case'' scenario, i.e., testing under the most austere or unfavorable conditions and circumstances specified in the standard. Relying on worst case testing as a basis for a manufacturer's certification is commonplace among manufacturers. For example, Standard 208, ``Occupant Crash Protection,'' requires injury criteria to be met with the test vehicle traveling forward at any speed ``up to and including 30 mph'' into a fixed barrier ``that is perpendicular to the line of travel of the vehicle, or at any angle up to 30 degrees in either direction from the perpendicular'' (S5.1). Manufacturers typically test a vehicle at 30 mph into a perpendicular barrier since that is the worst case test. The manufacturers believe that if the vehicle passes that worst case test, it is reasonable to conclude it will pass less severe tests (e.g., at lower speeds into angled barriers). Some elements that should be considered in selecting a worst case test for a built-in restraint manufacturer would be the interior dimensions of the vehicle into which the built-in seat is installed, the characteristics of the vehicle seat into which the seat is fabricated, the attachment of the vehicle seat to the vehicle, the integrity of the restraint's belt system, and the proximity of structures that could be impacted by the dummy's head in a crash. Incorporating these elements into the test assembly is not cost significant. Hassel Free could test its restraint on the modified test assembly only for the worst case scenario and without undue economic burden. Hassel Free argued that van converters will not want to install the petitioner's built-in child restraint in a vehicle when they are faced with the responsibility to certify the vehicle to Standard 213. NHTSA believes that any decision not to install a built-in child seat will stem from reasons other than the certification responsibility. NHTSA's certification regulations (49 CFR part 567) require van converters to ensure that the alteration they make to a previously-certified vehicle, or the work done to finish an unfinished vehicle, is in conformance with all applicable FMVSS's. Any device covered by an FMVSS that is installed on a new vehicle must be certified as complying with that standard. A van converter that installs any seat (with or without a built-in child seat) in the van, or any item of glazing, or any lighting equipment or brake hose or safety belt, must certify the compliance, and thus the safety of, that item and installation. Van converters can certify the compliance of a built-in seat without conducting a vehicle or shell test. The compliance test procedures described in the FMVSS's prescribe the procedures that the agency must use to test a vehicle or item of equipment for compliance with the standard. Manufacturers are not required to use those procedures. In the case of Standard 213, they may certify the compliance of their vehicles or child restraints to Standard 213 using any information they choose. 2 Hassel Free's vehicle converter has the option of deciding it is reasonable to depend on the assurances of Hassel Free that the built-in child seat will meet Standard 213 (e.g., based on worst case testing) in making its certification. In addition to Hassel Free's worst case testing, the vehicle converter has the option of satisfying its certification responsibilities by conducting a vehicle or shell test, or performing engineering analyses such as computer simulations of the item's performance in a particular vehicle. 2 If the manufacturer's product fails NHTSA's compliance test, the manufacturer must show the basis for its certification. If a manufacturer did not exercise due care in certifying its products, it will be subject to civil penalties in addition to the recall responsibilities associated with all noncompliances. In deciding whether and the degree to which to test, the vehicle converter determines the validity and merits of the supplier's assurances. This process of weighing the validity of the supplier's assurances is the same whether it is a built-in child seat that the converter is installing, or any other supplied item of equipment (e.g., vehicle seat, safety belt, glazing or lighting equipment). Petitioner's claims that van converters will not install built-in child restraints in their vehicles because of the requirement to certify to Standard 213's dynamic requirements are unpersuasive. For the reasons provided above, the agency is denying Hassel Free's petition. Issued on May 23, 1994. Barry Felrice Associate Administrator for Rulemaking.
