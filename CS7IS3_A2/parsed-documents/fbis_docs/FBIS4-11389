These were, and continue to be, my objectives and I will continue to battle for them throughout my tenure. ``I was aware that I was the first civilian president in many decades. I therefore sought to govern with the deepest respect for all individual and political liberties and to enhance the freedom of the press as an essential channel for democracy. Likewise, I was conscious of the great responsibility I assumed before my fellow-countrymen, especially those who did not vote for me but who also contributed toward the democracy that we at present enjoy. We must consolidate our democratic system if we are to derive the benefits we admire in countries that embarked on this path before us. ``In compliance with this line of action, I have favored dialogue and negotiation as a way to definitely overcome conflicts and problems. This is why I hold daily talks with all social, economic, and political sectors in our country. This is why I frequently travel the length and breath of our country -- to be in direct contact with my fellow-countrymen, to understand their needs, and to explain the restrictions imposed by our reality. ``I believe the great majority of our government officials and the people at large share this spirit with us. Sometimes our temperament, our grievances, our culture, and our anxiety play nasty tricks on us and we go against those purposes. It is then that we lose our patience and engage in verbal battles in which we try to discredit each other. This contributes to bring things to a head. It encourages drastic solutions, unilateral positions, and a pessimistic outlook on the future which is not in keeping with our reality and which, to a certain extent, takes us back to the past; a past that we want to overcome but which binds us to an authoritarian culture in which we believe -- either individually or as a group -- that we are absolutely right and are entitled to every single right. Therefore, we need not heed those who think differently. ``Under a dictatorial regime, disagreements like this do not prosper for the simple reason that nobody can voice his/her opinion. Everyone can speak in democracy, but if we do so in an authoritarian way we cause unending disputes and irreconcilable stances which lead to impasse and frustration. Handled incorrectly we could end up in a state of anarchy, against which we must fight with the same vigor we exhibited when we overthrew the dictatorship. ``Within this framework of learning how to move from tyranny to republican participation, I would like to make some reflections on the planned 2 May strike. The right to strike is enshrined in our Constitution and will be scrupulously respected and zealously protected. The right to strike is one thing but it is quite another thing to analyze whether or not it is timely. ``To obtain higher wages and create more jobs in our country -- which was isolated from the rest of the world and whose best-known industry was, sad to say, corruption -- we must build a level of credibility that will help us obtain the investments required to support the better pay and employment levels I have just mentioned. We must reduce inflation and thus avoid the painful learning process experienced by our neighbors, who were forced to coexist for decades with rampant inflation, which like any addiction, undermines social efforts and generates the worst injustices to the humblest strata of society, eating into their salaries every month as it reduces their purchasing power. ``Inflation leaves no room to build a truly better future. I want to be very clear on this point, as long as I am president of all Paraguayans, I will never propound demagogic measures that will compromise and mortgage the future of our country. For these reasons I believe the announced strike will not help us, Paraguayans, to better our situation. We also believe the direct action methodology of this struggle is incorrect, seeking to oil the wheels of a sometimes difficult social coexistence because direct action damages bonds that exist between those who will have to negotiate at a future date. This happens simply because there is no other way of reaching agreement. ``In my capacity as president and as a Paraguayan, I want to sit at the negotiating table to discuss things, to rationally meet our priority needs, and to reach consensus on some of our expectations and on our outlook on reality. If we do not do this, we will continue with this tug of war from our respective positions and will not attain our objectives, less still in the short term. Errors bring about damage, but they usually are a most precious source of learning. ``I am convinced this strike is a mistake. I am sure it is a grave mistake. Yet if it helps Paraguay to learn, it is worth a try. I am sure it will be more beneficial for all concerned if we continue our talks before the strike. ``If we cannot do that, as far as I am concerned, the negotiating table and the offer to talk continue open after the strike. I will do my best and I promise the best effort by the government to continue to build, with anyone who wants to participate, the best Paraguay possible. I wish you the best.''
