FBIS4-55014 "dreeu089aa_94001" FBIS-EEU-94-089 Daily Report 6 May 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Yugoslavia's Simic Meets Officials in Geneva Yugoslavia's Simic Meets Officials in Geneva LD0605211594 Belgrade TANJUG in English 2035 GMT 6 May 94 LD0605211594 Belgrade TANJUG English BFN ["Pool" item] [Text] Geneva, May 6 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Zeljko Simic said on Friday U.N. special envoy for former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi had confirmed his principled stand that only peace for all of Bosnia-Herzegovina could provide a sound foundation for a sensible and lasting political settlement. In a statement to TANJUG, Simic said Akashi had told him on the telephone he would continue to insist on neutrality in the Bosnian civil war and non-use of force in dealing with the problem. Simic, who attended the sixth session of the working group for economic issues of the Geneva-based international conference on the former Yugoslavia, on Friday met with conference co-chairman Thorvald Stoltenberg, Akashi's closest aides, several influential international figures and representatives of international institutions. Among others he met with the director of the International Migration Service, with whom he had what he described as a cordial and constructive meeting which focused on a draft agreement on regulating the status of the organization's Belgrade office. During the meeting, Simic spoke of the intention of some West European countries to launch a coordinated action of repatriation of Yugoslavs, mostly ethnic Albanians from the Serbian province of Kosovo-Metohija. The Yugoslav official also met with Croatian ambassador in Geneva Miomir Zuzula, with whom he discussed normalization of bilateral relations. Simic described the sixth session of the economic group as unsuccessful and dismissed as unfeasible a proposal put forth by chairman Jean Durrieu for reviving and reconstructing the economic space of former Yugoslavia. This goal is unattainable for as long as the civil war in Bosnia rages on and sanctions against Yugoslavia are in force, he explained. Later on Friday, Simic is due to meet with the other co-chairman of the international conference on the former Yugoslavia, Lord Owen, and the president of the World Health Organization. He may also meet with U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali before returning to Yugoslavia later tonight.
