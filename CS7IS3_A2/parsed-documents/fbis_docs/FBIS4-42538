Asked to imagine the future and develop a few prospects for the 21st century, the prime minister above all transposed his policy into the future, thus giving the broad outlines of a presidential program. "The march toward a different society has started." Without wishing to reopen the debate on change, Edouard Balladur is taking advantage of all his public speeches to show that his arrival at the Hotel Matignon [office of the prime minister] marked a break with the "old-fashioned" society he inherited after the March 1993 parliamentary elections. These statements have an increasingly presidential tone which certainly irritates the friends of Jacques Chirac, the mayor of Paris. Last summer, this projection into the future of the prime minister's action caused a strong reaction among Chirac's supporters. Jean-Louis Debre, deputy secretary general of the RPR [Rally for the Republic], and Bernard Pons, president of the RPR caucus in the National Assembly, had no hesitation in bringing out the big guns and firing point blank at this government chief who was simply placed in the Matignon to run everyday business until the presidential election. "The real change," they maintained with anger, "can only come after the crucial election." In other words, in their thinking, once Jacques Chirac has been installed within the Elysee. "Wrong," the Matignon retorted. "The real change came in March 1993 with the French people's choice of a different majority and a different society." The debate then became bogged down, with nobody standing to gain from provoking a sudden split in the majority. However, each camp was on the alert, keeping one eye permanently on the fluctuations in the opinion polls. To calm things down, Edouard Balladur firmly urged his ministers to respect a strict duty of restraint: There was no question of publicly discussing the presidential election before the end of 1994. "The French people have other concerns and expect something different from you," he stressed. Trial Run And yet it is he who for several weeks now has launched into the trial run of a possible presidential candidate. First, by little comments, tackling the subject of the "new society" which was quickly turned (to avoid being reminiscent of Jacques Chaban-Delmas' campaign) into a "different society." Yesterday, speaking to the "RPR elite" assembled to celebrate the bicentenary of the Polytechnic School, he clearly took a further step. Increasingly specific in his statements, he outlined the "different society" he is now establishing in order to open the doors to the next century. Who but he could be at the helm to continue this trajectory? "Globalization is a challenge to the state and I want to explain how I conceive of the state's necessary evolution faced with this challenge," he said. "In a world which has changed everything, the state can no longer have the same goals, nor can it centralize all the powers and make all the decisions. Its mission is to structure a different society which makes it possible for all to progress, and which makes possible the solidarity and defense of the nation. This is a huge task." First, there is peacekeeping. "Immigration, separatism, ethnic and religious conflicts are undermining national unity on all sides and call democracy into question." It is therefore necessary to establish an "trade organization which ensures respect for the rules of international competition, and does not give too prominent a role to the countries which are least concerned with social justice. That is why it is necessary to set up a stable international monetary system.... This is why I took the initiative of the pact for stability in Europe." What about employment and social protection? "We must invent a different society which is not a reproduction of past models. We must renew the social contract of the Age of Enlightenment by inventing new forms of solidarity." This is the whole meaning of regional development policy, urban policy, and social policy. "Guaranteeing solidarity depends on a social policy which reverses the current demographic trend, by more effective social security, but one which is better organized and whose costs are better controlled in terms of retirement and health care. French society must be able to benefit from medical advances without the social security system being threatened. Work must be better organized, more effectively distributed, for instance by easing administrative constraints." It is therefore a whole long-term program which Edouard Balladur set out. He did so in the name of the government and the whole majority which supports him. His outlook is the year 2010. Although he still denies -- but increasingly weakly -- that he is officially a presidential candidate, he is nonetheless taking every opportunity to show himself to be one.
