Relations between China and Mongolia are on the surface good, following a visit to Mongolia in April by Chinese Premier Li Peng to sign a new Sino-Mongolian friendship pact. But the document warns that China should move to head off the development of a Pan-Mongolian ideology because it could threaten China's territorial integrity. The document was published in October by a public research institute specializing in Northeast Asian affairs in China's Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region. Mongolia is home to some 2.1 million Mongols, but the autonomous region has 4.8 million, while a further 300,000 are in Russia. The document cites as symptomatic of the problem the first world conference of Mongolian peoples, held in the Mongolian capital of Ulaanbaatar in September last year. It says the conference strengthened Pan-Mongolianism and says that "this fundamental problem which is related to the partitioning of China cannot be ignored." Noting that organizers of the conference visited the U.S. prior to the forum, the document said "the U.S. is extending its evil influence into the Mongolian plateau and is trying in the background to stab China with a sword it calls democracy." The document also says Mongolian unification has supporters in Japan. It suggests that China should prepare for a lengthy struggle and warns of the growth of ethnic movements in the former Soviet Union.
