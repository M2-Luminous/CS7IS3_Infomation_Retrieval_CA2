He said that the detentions were made "in the course of the continuous daily efforts of the Lebanese security organs which have recently succeeded in capturing an Israeli sabotage ring run by elements spread between Beirut and the occupied border strip." The source emphasized to AL-HAYAH that the work of the Lebanese security organs "is not linked to any particular date, time, or place. Their task is to maintain security and ward off any threat to internal security, and it covers all security violations." [passage omitted] He said that the pursuit and storming operations "have, contrary to the claims made by some, not been targeting any particular group. We tackle security issues on the sole basis of security and we let justice take its course and pronounce the verdict. The proof is that the security authorities have in recent weeks carried out a number of operations not restricted to any particular area but covering most Lebanese provinces." [passage omitted] He said that the position recently taken by the Lebanese Forces' Central Information Bureau regarding the detentions and maintaining that they undermined national accord and the law "came after the security authorities detained some individuals who divulged some information in connection with the explosion targeting the Lebanese Army camp in Rumiyah years ago. Some admitted that they had been instructed by certain security officials to gather information regarding the movements of state officials, foremost among them President Ilyas al-Hirawi." The source asked: "Are we the department which decides whether the general amnesty law should cover these people or should justice take its course and determine their fate, particularly as some of them have confessed that they were instructed by a special security organ to gather information for we know not whom?" [passage omitted] He referred to the ring which worked for Israel, most of its members having been arrested before the end of last month. They used to gather information and move between Beirut and the security belt. He asked: "Are the security organs not supposed to interrogate those people or refer them to the military investigating magistrate, bearing in mind that some of them made clear and frank confessions?" The source urged all parties "not to pass haphazard judgements and to wait for the truth to come out before taking stands harmful to themselves and before requesting dismissal of the charges, release of the detainees, and discontinuation of the pursuit of wanted persons." He said that any charge made against any detainee "should not be taken as a charge against the party he belongs to." [passage omitted]
