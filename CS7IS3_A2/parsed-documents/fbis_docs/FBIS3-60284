Ovezgeldyyev, the author of the concept of a long-term program of research into the problems of the Caspian and well-known Turkmen academician, declares: "Unless an international center coordinating the actions of the Caspian countries to save the Caspian is formed in the very near future and unless these countries pool their scientific, economic, and legal forces to this end, we will simply lose it, like we lost the Aral." Having become a sump of industrial enterprises' toxic waste, the Caspian is today essentially suffocating from phenols, acids, alkalis, and organic substances. Scientists believe the overall volume of harmful effluent long since exceeded the annual flow of such rivers as the Ural, Terek, Kura, and Samur put together. Added to the grim ecological situation is concern that the constant rise in the sea level since 1978 continues. In the current situation immediate coordinated actions of the five states with an outlet to hoary Khazar--Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Russia, Azerbaijan, and Iran--are required. We had become so accustomed to and comfortable with the practice of the wasteful use of natural resources that in unthinkingly and unhesitatingly having closed off by a sealed dike the Kara-Bogaz Bay and having thereby interrupted the natural process of accumulation of hydro-mineral raw material in the bay it did not even occur to us that we were thereby ruining a renewable source, most unique on a world scale, of chemical resources. With the closing off of the bay the natural balance in the region was disturbed for it was not just something but Kara-Bogaz-Gol, as the thermal regulator of the Caspian, which mainly stabilized the level of the sea. "Had Turkmenistan been able to comprehensively assimilate the unlost Kara-Bogaz-Gol," Academician O. Ovezgeldyyev says, "this would have been sufficient for putting together a fully balanced state budget. And no oil or gas would have been needed here since types of raw material that are much more efficient than hydrocarbons could have been recovered from the bay. Look, the Japanese are spending immense resources to recover minerals from the ocean. We in Kara-Bogaz-Gol, on the other hand, could get them practically free of charge...." Another well known scientist, A. Khodzhamamedov, president of the Academy of Sciences of Turkmenistan and head of the Institute of Chemistry of the republic's Academy of Sciences, is insistently recommending to the leadership of his country today that the Caspian be plugged into the economic and mineral-raw material base of Turkmenistan. But he warns here that it will be very, very dangerous if each Caspian country begins to view the Caspian and its possibilities individually, without coordinated actions. The predatory catch of fish, the barbaric production of oil on the shelves, and the nonstop discharge of industrial effluent into the rivers feeding Khazar, as the Caspian was called in ancient times, would begin in this case. Agreed ecological norms and an international center for study of the problems of the Caspian are needed to prevent this. There is, strictly speaking, none of this as yet. No Caspian state has yet embarked in earnest on a monitoring of the level of the sea or a geological inspection of its depths, not to mention the elaboration of scientifically substantiated ecological norms.
