Speaking at a reception hosted by (Murray Horn), secretary general of the New Zealand Finance Ministry, Li Tieying said: Doing so "not only serves the fundamental interests of the Chinese people but also conforms to the common aspirations and fundamental interests of the people in the rest of the world." He said: "Over the past 15 years, guided by Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, China made remarkable achievements in reform, opening up, and modernization. Its economic structure and operational mechanisms underwent profound changes." He added: A situation has taken initial shape in China in which the publicly owned economic sector constitutes the mainstay while the state-owned, collective, individual, private, and foreign-funded economic sectors develop simultaneously, compete on an equal footing, and develop together. China has made unceasing efforts to extend the scale of reform in state-owned enterprises and explore practical ways to establish a modern enterprise system. China is cultivating a market system, accelerating price reform, and continuing strengthening the role of market mechanisms. Instead of trying to directly control enterprises by giving them administrative orders, the state mainly uses economic and legislative means to indirectly regulate and control enterprises. China has set up a distribution system in which remuneration according to one's work as the principal mode of distribution and various other means of distribution serve as supplements. A new social security system has also been established. The household contract responsibility system, with remuneration linked to output, is extensively carried out in China's rural areas. This and the adjustment of agricultural produce prices and procurement systems have motivated peasants to work harder. Li Tieying said: "China's commitment to a market-oriented economy in its reform and opening up is correct. Our cause is extensively and wholeheartedly supported by our people. Chinese people are marching toward the goal of establishing a new system and accomplishing modernization." He added: In 1988, China doubled its gross national product [GNP] of 1980 ahead of time, basically realizing the first stage of its strategic target of improving the people's living standards. We may foresee that our GNP will probably be doubled again by the end of the century. By that time, we may achieve the second stage of the strategic target of improving the people's living standards in advance. China's current major task is to promote sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development by establishing a socialist market economic structure so as to ensure the realization of the third stage of the strategic target. That is, China hopes to catch up with or surpass the present standards of moderately developed countries by the middle of the 21st century. Li Tieying said: Developing and strengthening our economic relations and cooperation with countries and regions in the Asia-Pacific region constitutes an integral part of China's overall opening up policy. China is willing to actively expand its cooperation with New Zealand in the political, economic, scientific, technological, and cultural fields through various channels under the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and efficiency. The China economic structure investigation delegation, headed by Li Tieying, arrived in New Zealand on 18 June.
