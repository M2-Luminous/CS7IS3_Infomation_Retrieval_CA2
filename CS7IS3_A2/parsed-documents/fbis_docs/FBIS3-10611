FENASEP Secretary Felix Hernandez asserted that his organization, which includes approximately 40,000 public employees, cannot accept the increase offered by the economic cabinet because it does not fulfill the people's expectations. FENASEP does not support the strikes' being held by 180,000 public employees and has directly negotiated wage adjustments with the government. However, Hernandez reiterated today that they have not managed to reach any agreement with the ministers. "We cannot accept" the increase offered by the president not only because it does not satisfy the needs of the workers but because merchants would take advantage of such an increase and hike product prices by more than the increase, he stated. Hernandez, who has been charged with being a "traitor" by his striking union colleagues, said that this Tuesday FENASEP will announce the measures it will take and did not reject the call to strike if the government does not improve its offer, which also includes a yearly bonus of 260 quetzales ($44.80). Meanwhile, the State Workers Unitary Organization (UITE) [Instancia Unitaria de Trabajadores del Estado] that has semiparalyzed public administration as a pressure mechanism to get a 40-percent wage hike, asserted that the labor strike initiated five weeks ago will continue. The UITE and the National Federation of State Workers Unions (FENASTEG) have also rejected the increase, although they admit that their demand for a 40-percent increase is negotiable.
