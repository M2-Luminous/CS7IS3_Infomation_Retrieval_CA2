The Communist Party of the Russian Federation held an all-Union party conference, the Working Russia movement, a congress, and the National Salvation Front, a session of the National Council. While having unanimously rejected the Social Accord Treaty offered by Boris Yeltsin, the opposition parties and movements were unable to achieve unity concerning a possible candidate at the future presidential elections. The most likely candidate of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation for the office of president will be, by all accounts, its present chairman Gennadiy Zyuganov. Zyuganov was successful at the conference in warding off all attacks of the intra-party opposition demanding that the leadership of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation adopt a stricter dogmatic position. The delegates supported by a huge majority the party's program propositions offered by Gennadiy Zyuganov, which were sustained in a statist style, which will undoubtedly improve relations between the communists and the patriots. A far more complex problem for the Communist Party of the Russian Federation are relations with other parties and movements cleaving to positions of dogmatic communism. Addressing the congress of the Working Russia movement, its leader, Viktor Anpilov, accused Zyuganov of class collaboration with the "Yeltsin regime" and declared that the present leader of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation is "an even bigger traitor than Gorbachev." The orthodox named as their possible candidates for the office of president Vasiliy Starodubtsev, Oleg Shein, Sazha Umalatova, Aman Tuleyev, and Viktor Anpilov. The delegates were of the unanimous opinion here that the main task of a president they elected should be abolition of the presidency and the restoration of Soviet power in full. Only Ilya Konstantinov, leader of the National Salvation Front, intends as yet, it would seem, to support Aleksandr Rutskoy, the former opposition president. But such support is hardly likely to increase Rutskoy's chances of success at the future presidential elections. As the session of the National Salvation Front National Council showed, this opposition organization has now virtually ceased to exist and unites only a few political chiefs. A large part of the regional organizations, on the other hand, has joined Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's party.
