In a signed commentary on the South Korean puppet defence minister's trip to Japan, the paper says: During the Japan trip of the puppet defence minister of South Korea, the first of its kind ever, measures for "regional security" to cope with the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK were discussed. If Japan is truly concerned for "regional security" it must take issue with the United States which poses a grave threat to peace and security on the Korean peninsula with a large number of nuclear weapons while laying artificial obstacles to the settlement of the nuclear issue, as well as its servants the South Korean puppets. The Japanese reactionaries plan to inveigle South Korea and countries in the Asia-Pacific region in their "comprehensive security sphere," because it is expected that their "security" by the United States cannot be guaranteed in "case of emergency." Their recent military confab with the South Korean puppets was within this framework. The tightening of the military tieup between the Japanese reactionaries and the South Korean puppets is a threat to peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region. That is why the Asian peoples are heightening vigilance over the intensified military collusion between Japan and South Korea. The Japanese reactionaries and the South Korean puppets must not act rashly.
