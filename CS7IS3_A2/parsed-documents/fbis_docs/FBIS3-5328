The three-pronged assault was launched Saturday by hundreds of troops backed by tanks and heavy weapons on the gem mining center in northeast Cambodia on the border with Thailand, the government official said. The fighting was said to be fierce and casualties were expected to be heavy, in part because the area is known to be heavily mined, he said. "We cannot escape a lot of casualties. We know that a lot of our soldiers will be killed or wounded," the official said. "But we must do this for the defense of Cambodia. There is no other way to end the war with the Khmer Rouge except fighting," he added. "We know the Khmer Rouge very well. They talk this and they do that." Government forces were attacking Pailin from the north, south and east, he said, while an elite unit of some 200 paratroopers had been strategicly stationed west of Pailin to cut off the guerrillas possible retreat into Thailand. Pailin is about 10 kilometers (six miles) from the border with Thailand. General Ke Kimyan, the army's chief of staff, was personally directing the assault force, the official said. "We will take Pailin very soon," he said. He did not specify the size of the assault force, but said it was larger than the contingent that had taken the Khmer Rouge stronghold of nearby Anlung Veng last month. Government troops attacking from the north had earlier taken control of Sala Krau, 10 kilometers (six miles) from Pailin and were using that as a springboard to hit the main target, he said. Similarly, the force advancing from the south had earlier captured Samlot, 20 kilometers (12 miles) away and were using that as their base, he said. The third force was advancing from the east along Road 10, the official said. No casualty figures from the Pailin fighting had reached the capital yet, the official said. But he said more than 200 government soldiers had died in the battle for Anlung Veng. The government has denied reports that Anlung Veng has been recaptured by the Khmer Rouge, saying they had made a strategic withdrawal because of shelling and that the guerrillas had not actually moved back into the city. Anlung Veng is some 230 kilometers (140 miles) to the northeast of Pailin, and is unlikely to affect the fighting there. [passage omitted]
