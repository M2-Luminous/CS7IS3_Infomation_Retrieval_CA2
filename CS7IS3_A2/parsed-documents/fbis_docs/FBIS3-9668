[passage omitted] Perisic said in a statement: "Despite the economic blockade of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] and numerous pressures, society's scientific research and military-industrial complex is doing its utmost to contribute to the maintenance of the necessary level of the Yugoslav Army's combat readiness. In conditions of the existence of objective difficulties and the lack of financial resources, it is thanks to the self-sacrificing involvement of scientific personnel and the consolidation of the military industry that we are succeeding in following contemporary achievements in the world in the field of armaments and military equipment. In keeping with this, the army's existing combat systems -- which to the greatest extent are the result of our own research and technological-technical potential, together with the rational use of military resources -- are making possible the successful defense of the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the FRY. "In the context of the further modernization of the Yugoslav Army, we are devoting particular attention to the air force and air defense, as well as to increasing the efficiency of artillery and armored facilities. The perfection of missile systems is developing in terms of increasing their range and military effectiveness, as well as in improving their guidance systems. As a result of all this, the Yugoslav Army, inspired by great patriotism, is in a position to confront any potential aggressor and inflict intolerable losses on him."
