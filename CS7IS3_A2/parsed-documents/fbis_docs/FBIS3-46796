In addition, it is an undeniable fact that human rights have been ensured and improved. For the Vietnamese people, the rights to live in independence and freedom are the biggest, a lesson drawn from the country's reality over the past half century. However, all the Vietnamese people are fully aware that independence and freedom will have no significance if they live in poverty, ignorance, and a minimally developed society. An independent and free country should closely links with ideas of prosperous people and a mighty nation [sentence as heard]. That is why the renovation process has been fully responded by the people. The people's rights to live, first of all, is the right to do business. It is safe to say that never before the Vietnamese people are doing business as dynamically as today. They have engaged in diversified jobs in different branches. Life of the people in different quarters is better. However, a part of the people still lead a difficult life for they cannot adapt to the mechanism of market economy. To be fair, the people's rights to do business have been strongly assisted by a number of state encouraged policies. Democracy has worked in many fields and it showed that human rights have been respected. National Assembly deputies and relevant government officials have been directly and frankly questioned about the standstill and negative practices in their branches or ministries. The Minister of Education and Training openly talked with students about issues of their concern. Mass media has disclosed cases of corruption and smuggling in different ministries and branches, including senior officials and so forth. Perhaps never before the Vietnamese people have followed closely the mass media as today, because they not only need information but also want to know the implementation of human rights and the national renovation process. Last year, the Vietnamese state continued to issue policies and guidelines in order to substantially ensuring the citizen's rights. Now, the number of Vietnamese people going to foreign countries as tourists is on the increase. They not only go to regional countries but also to far away countries such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, U.S.A., Canada, and Australia where in the part were considered forbidden land. An ordinance on the marriage of Vietnamese citizens with foreigners has been issued. Freedom of belief has been written in the Constitution. It is complemented by mamy concrete resolutions. Worthy of note was the movement on eradicating hunger and eliminating poverty which has been largely deployed in the whole country. Many efforts have been made to help poor farmers develop production and to assist supportless aged people, war invalids, disable people, and orphans. However, the Vietnamese state acknowledged that it does not complete the task in fully implementing its policies for the people. There remain many social evils, even serious ones. But it can be affirmed that the Vietnamese state has strived to remove difficulties for every people, every family, and increase their joy and confidence. That is why the people share the same view to build and establish a democratic society because it ensures human rights.
