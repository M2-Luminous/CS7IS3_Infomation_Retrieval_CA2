In his speech, Shu Shengyou first briefed the participants on the current economic situation and the main economic tasks to be carried out this year. He said: 1993 is a year in which the people of this province carried out in depth the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, deepened the ongoing reform, sped up development, and achieved great success in economic and other social undertakings. Last year saw the widest margin of increase in major economic indexes ever achieved by the province since the beginning of reform and opening up. What is more, such growth was achieved on the basis of the high growth registered over the past consecutive years. The year 1994 will be an important year in which this province is to maintain the momentum of sustained, rapid, and healthy development as well as a crucial year in which we are to expedite reform aimed at establishing a socialist market economy. This year, the guiding philosophy of economic work in the province is to uphold Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as the guide; to conscientiously implement the guidelines laid by the 14th CPC National Congress, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and the ninth plenary session of the ninth provincial party committee; to comprehensively expedite all the major reforms finalized by the central authorities; to appropriately handle the relationship between reform, development, and social stability; and to thus ensure a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the province's economy while vigorously improving economic returns and optimizing the production structure and strive for general progress in all social undertakings. Shu Shengyou pointed out: We must strive for progress on all fronts while seeking breakthroughs in certain key aspects, and we must make up our minds to achieve victory in the most difficult aspects of reform. He said: This year, our main tasks in reform are to speed up the establishment of a modern enterprise system, with a focus on the program to start pilot projects in one aspect and to strive for development in two others. With the reform of the national financial and taxation, banking, planning, and investment systems as a starting point, we are to push forward the reform of the macroeconomic regulation and control system and to expedite the transformation of government functions. We are to vigorously develop a market of production elements, further nurture the market network, appropriately introduce all the supporting reforms -- in particular step up the reform of the social security system -- actively develop the individual and private economic sector, modify the ownership structure, do a good job in the reform of foreign exchange and foreign trade systems according to the state's centralized plan, further expand the process of opening up to the outside world, carry out in depth the reform of the rural economic structure, and establish a rural market economic operational mechanism full of vigor and vitality, among others. [passage omitted] Shu Shengyou said: It is necessary to vigorously explore the urban and rural markets and make special efforts to develop and perfect the market system. It is necessary to speed up reform of circulation structure, invigorate the state-owned commodity circulation sector, give rein to the individual and private economic sector in the area of commodity circulation, and, in particular, encourage peasants to play a part in commodity circulation. Shu Shengyou noted that it is necessary to do a really good job in finance and taxation, make every effort to increase financial revenue, pay attention to exploring new sources of taxes, further intensify control over tax collection, keep financial expenditures under strict control, improve budgetary management, and intensify the regulatory function of budgets. Shu Shengyou demanded that the relations between reform, development, and stability be properly handled and that appropriate arrangements be made to keep up the people's standard of living. It is necessary to carefully and meticulously map out a plan before introducing measures regarding price reform and to make every effort to keep the margin of price increases below the level as set in the plan. Governments at all levels and departments concerned must properly keep the prices of rice, foodstuffs, and fuel under control, with a view to pacifying the public and maintaining social stability.
