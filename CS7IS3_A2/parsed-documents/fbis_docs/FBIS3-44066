This was in spite of the moratorium declared by its parent body, the Pan Africanist Congress [PAC], last week, to which APLA and its high command had complied. "It has been and it remains the PAC position that this issue is a matter that must be settled between APLA and the South African security forces, mainly the SA Defence Force and Police," said a statement. "We wish to warn that failure to reach an agreement on a mutual cessation of hostilities could automatically mean a total collapse of the moratorium. "However, as long as the moratorium remains in place any statement to the media challenging it will not be representative of the APLA position."
