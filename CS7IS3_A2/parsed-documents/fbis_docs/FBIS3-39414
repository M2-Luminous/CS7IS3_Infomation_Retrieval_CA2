But privately military officials confirm that the Belgian F-16's are not sufficiently well equipped -- especially with electronic countermeasures, designed to locate and perhaps jam antiaircaft defense mechanisms such as those used by the Serbs around Sarajevo -- to be used in an operation of this kind. "Belgium has received no request for air power from NATO," declared a spokesman from the defense minister's office, Mr. Leo Delcroix. NATO's air and combined air and sea forces deployed in Italy and the Adriatic consist of some 220 aircraft, including more than 150 fighter planes supplied by the United States, France, the Netherlands, Turkey, and Great Britain. But no Belgian plane is included in this force, known as "deny flight" and charged since 12 April 1992 with preventing any military flights in the Bosnian airspace. A senior air force official recently admitted that without any electronic countermeasures (ECM) it would be difficult for the Belgian F-16's to take to the sky over Bosnia without jeopardizing the lives of the pilots. The Bosnian Serb Army is equipped with numerous antiaircraft systems, often similar to those used by the former Warsaw pact countries. The F-16's, which are used in Belgium for both air combat and ground attack missions, are to be fitted from the beginning of next year -- two years behind the initially scheduled date -- with their first "carapace" ECM systems, designed by the French electronics company Serge Dassault (ESD). Military sources report that four prototypes of the carapace system have already been built by ESD following a lengthy development phase which was completed in December 1992. Two such systems have been fitted to planes which left for the United States in April last year for twelve months of tests at the Eglin test polygon (Florida). Mr. Delcroix' office reports that production of the first systems should begin in March. Delivery of the first planes equipped with the ECM system is scheduled for early 1995, the same source indicated. The carapace system -- developed exclusively for Belgium -- is a purely passive system, which means it can detect an enemy radar and inform the pilot. Ideally, it should be supplemented by an active system able to jam radar systems. It does, however, have the advantage of being fitted inside the aircraft, thus leaving all arms attachment points free and not causing any extra drag. Observers recall that the lack of any ECM's on the F-16's was one of the reasons why mirage fighters had been preferred to American fighters when Belgian planes were sent to Turkey just before the outbreak of the Gulf war, in January 1991. The Dutch and Turkish F-16's stationed in Italy and which make daily flights over Bosnia are equipped with electronic countermeasures. The Dutch Air Force has acquired a number of ECM pods which can be attached to a wing or the fuselage. The Turkish F-16's have internal ECM's.
