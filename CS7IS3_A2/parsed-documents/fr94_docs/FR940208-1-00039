FR940208-1-00039 FR940208-1-00011 Records required under the proposed standards must be kept at the facility for 5 years. These include records of tank truck and railcar vapor tightness test certifications, as well as monitoring data from the vapor processor and from the vacuum assist system at new bulk gasoline terminals. Records from the LDAR program and storage vessel inspections, and records of startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions of the vapor processor are required to ensure that the controls in place are continuing to be effective. IV. Summary of Environmental, Energy, and Economic Impacts of the Proposed Standards A. Number and Type of Affected Sources or Facilities In 1998, the base year of the analysis, it is estimated that there will be approximately 403,600 facilities in the entire gasoline distribution network. However, only two subcategories within the network (pipeline breakout stations and bulk gasoline terminals), comprising a total of 1,300 facilities, are being addressed by this rulemaking. Of this total, it is estimated that about 20 pipeline breakout stations and about 280 bulk gasoline terminals qualify as major sources and therefore would be subject to today's proposed standards. For the purpose of the analysis conducted in connection with these standards, all facilities built or reconstructed between today's proposal and the 1998 base year are considered ``new'' facilities in the base year analysis (see proposed General Provisions, subpart A of 40 CFR part 63). All other facilities prior to proposal were considered to be ``existing'' sources in this analysis. The estimated impacts of the levels of control specified by the proposed regulation within each subcategory are discussed below. 1. Existing Facilities The base year population of existing pipeline breakout stations is estimated to be about 245 facilities (18 major source sites, 227 area source sites). Sources of emissions at these facilities arise from gasoline storage and various equipment components in the process line piping. Under the proposed regulation, each existing major source pipeline breakout station would be required to implement a quarterly LDAR program for leaks from pumps and valves. Additionally, the 18 major source facilities would be required to retrofit external floating roof tanks with primary and secondary seals and install internal floating roofs with primary seals on fixed-roof tanks. It is estimated that 35 external floating roof storage tanks and 11 fixed-roof storage tanks at these major source sites would need to be upgraded to meet these equipment standards. It is estimated that in 1998, there will be 737 bulk gasoline terminals that qualify as ``existing'' sources. It is further estimated that nearly 200, or 27 percent, will qualify as major sources. Under the proposed standards, existing major sources would be required to meet a 10 mg TOC/liter of gasoline loaded limit on their loading rack emissions. It is estimated that 33 percent of the loading racks at existing bulk gasoline terminals will already be meeting this level of control. Therefore, 134 of these facilities (the remaining 67 percent) would need to newly install, replace, or otherwise upgrade their control devices to meet this proposed standard. It is estimated that there are approximately 1,600 storage tanks at existing major source bulk gasoline terminals. Furthermore, it is estimated that 400 external floating roof tanks and 500 fixed-roof tanks already have controls that satisfy the proposed standards (i.e., primary and secondary seals on external floating roof tanks and internal floating roofs with primary seals installed in all fixed-roof tanks). Consequently, it is estimated that approximately 470 external floating roof tanks and 210 fixed-roof tanks would need to improve their control level to meet the proposed standards. There are an estimated 31,600 tank trucks and approximately 400 railcars that load at existing bulk gasoline terminals. It is estimated that 22,400 tank trucks are already subject to annual vapor tightness testing and nearly all of the remaining 9,200 are not tested. The proposed regulation would require all tank trucks and railcars loading at major source facilities to be vapor tightness tested annually using Method 27. Essentially no terminals have been determined to routinely use an instrument to detect leaks from equipment (pumps and valves). Under the proposed standards, all existing major source bulk gasoline terminals would be required to implement the quarterly LDAR program for pumps and valves discussed previously for pipeline breakout stations.
