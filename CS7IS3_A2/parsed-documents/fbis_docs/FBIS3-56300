The new ambassador will be 65-year-old Yuliy Vorontsov, currently Russia's permanent representative at the United Nations. It is expected that the presidential edict confirming him in the position will be signed soon after Bill Clinton's Moscow visit ends. The candidate for the new head of mission at the United Nations has not yet been decided, but people on Smolensk Square are convinced that it will be a career diplomat. Andrey Kolosovskiy, who has been mentioned as the possible number two contender for the embassy, will not be going to New York, since he will soon be getting another assignment. The minister-counsellor position will be taken by Vladimir Chkhikvishvili, deputy director of the Foreign Ministry's North America Department. As is well known, another ambassadorial post -- London -- is also vacant. The conviction is being expressed in diplomatic circles that Britain should no longer be seen as a posting for honorable exile (L. Zamyatin, B. Pankin). "The posting to the British capital should go to a professional diplomat who is dynamic and self-confident," a well-informed Foreign Ministry source noted in this connection. "Candidates are being selected at the ministry." But, as our contact put it, it is still very likely that London will go to a political appointee -- perhaps somebody losing a ministerial portfolio.
