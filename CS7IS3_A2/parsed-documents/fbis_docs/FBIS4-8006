FBIS4-8006 "dreeu068_i_94012" FBIS-EEU-94-068 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Sarajevo, Gorazde Attacked Sarajevo, Gorazde Attacked AU0804095394 AU0804095394 BFN [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 8 April carries in its regular 8-minute newscast several reports on the continued fighting in the republic. Correspondent Sead Custovic from the 1st Corps Information Service, says that "by [word indistinct] shelling the urban areas of Sarajevo the Chetniks have only added to the long list of violations of the cease-fire agreed upon in this area some (?50) days ago. The population of Kosevo, Kosevsko Brdo, Breka, Pionirska Dolina, and Blekin Potok had a sleepless night as Tromblon grenades and rockets from portable launchers showered these districts. It was a return to the grimmest days of the war and confirmed that Karadzic's rabble -- who have violated every single peace agreement -- do indeed belong in the hall of fame of criminals. The everyday provocations from all types of weaponry, which often result in the wounding of citizens, clearly indicates what the aims and desires of the (?aggressor) are. The anemic reactions of the UN Protection Force in the face of civilian casualties and the shelling of residential areas encourages the aggressor to increase and intensify his activities and expand his arsenal. The cease-fire agreement reached yesterday has not deterred the criminals' artillery and snipers, who are doggedly beating a path straight to the international Court of Justice in The Hague. The morning is deceptively calm, and that is why caution should be exercised when moving around the city." Gorazde correspondent Enes Musovic reports that "in the course of the alleged cease-fire between us and the aggressor side, the Chetniks have continued their bloody march toward the encircled Gorazde. They have never before perpetrated such fierce and deadly attacks on the innocent population and refugees. The result of this rampage is five killed and nine gravely wounded people. Therefore, Gorazde is paying an extremely high price for its number one spot on the international media listings. In addition to the chemical agents used yesterday in the village of Vitkovici, the Chetniks also attempted to break through the defense lines in several places with combined artillery and infantry attacks. The situation was also extremely grave overnight on the right bank of the Drina River. From Nisan to Uhodici [words indistinct] heavy Chetnik artillery. The aggressor also attempted to infiltrate a terrorist group [passage indistinct], taking out their fury on (?local) women and old people. This was particularly pronounced in Ogleceva and in the villages of Zamedjedi, Gojcevici, and Surovik situated in the wider region of Ustipraca. The population of these villages is fleeing in panic toward the town." Reporting from Bihac, correspondent Mirza Sadikovic says that "[words indistinct] in the Bihac commune, where the victims continue to be mostly civilians. In the past 24 hours, six people have been killed, while 33 were slightly or severely wounded. Karadzic's terrorists continued to destroy buildings and communication links in Bihac and the Cazin outskirts. The intensity of the [Serb] attacks abated somewhat overnight, but the paramilitary forces of the so-called Kladusa autonomy intensified their attacks on all the demarcation lines. Artillery and infantry attacks were carried out in and around Krivaja and Gajici in the Cazin commune, and [name indistinct] in the Velika Kladusa commune. After midnight, the areas of (?Kosovo) and (?Pecingrad) were relentlessly shelled." An unidentified correspondent from the 4th Corps Press Center reports that "the main characteristic of the day [7 April] in the 4th Corps' theater of operations [in the Mostar area] was the mutual observance of the cease-fire between the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army on all fronts. However, the forces of the Serbian aggressor were active in Sector North. The past 24 hours on the defense lines of the Bosnia- Herzegovina Army and in residential areas in regions in and around (?Zdjelinic) and Glavaticevo were marked by Chetnik small arms' and antiaircraft machine gun provocations. The evacuation of bodies of the HVO and Bosnia-Herzegovina Army did not go ahead as planned, but was postponed for today [8 April] at 1500. The announced visit of General Rose to the 4th Corps has also been postponed, most probably owing to the critical situation and the continuing Serb aggression on Gorazde."
