REUTERS quoted Akashi as saying he had tried to mediate and effect a total and immediate ceasefire, but that vast differences existed between the conditions made by the two confronted sides. He regretted that no agreement had resulted at this time, but refused to attribute responsibility to either side. The Japanese diplomat added that the biggest obstacle to an agreement was the Moslems' insistence that the Serbs withdraw their artillery from positions around Sarajevo and place it under U.N. control. Akashi and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic had drafted a truce agreement at their meeting earlier in the day. The truce, subject to Moslem approval on Sunday evening, was to take effect at 10 A.M. local time (09:00 G.M.T.) on Monday, February 7.
