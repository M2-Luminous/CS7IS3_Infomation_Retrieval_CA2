FR940323-1-00020 FR940323-1-00005 We propose to amend §§435.520 and 436.520 to require State agencies to extend Medicaid eligibility to a low- income infant or child described in section 1902(1) of the Act and a qualified child described in section 1905(n)(2) of the Act who are receiving covered inpatient services on the date they attain the maximum age for Medicaid eligibility under the State plan until the end of the inpatient stay if the infant or child remains eligible except for attainment of the maximum age; and make conforming changes to §§435.500 and 436.500. F. Low-Income Aged and Disabled Individuals Section 9402 of OBRA '86 amended the Social Security Act by adding new sections 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(X) and 1902(m) to establish an optional categorically needy eligibility group of aged and disabled individuals with incomes at or below the Federal poverty income level. Section 1902(m) of the Act, as added by OBRA '86 and amended by section 4118(p)(8) of OBRA '87 and section 301(e) of MCCA, describes individuals in this group as those who are 65 years of age or older or are disabled as determined under SSI, whose income does not exceed a standard established by the State that is set at a percentage (at or below 100 percent) of the Federal poverty income level, and whose resources do not exceed the maximum amount of resources allowed under SSI. If a State has a medically needy program with a more generous resource level, section 1902(m)(2)(B) allows a State to elect to use the medically needy resource level instead of the SSI resource level. Between July 1, 1987 and June 30, 1989, States were permitted to provide eligibility to this optional group of low-income aged and disabled individuals only if they also provided Medicaid eligibility to the low-income group of pregnant women and infants under the provisions of section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX) as added by section 9401 of OBRA '86 discussed earlier. Section 301(e)(2)(D) of MCCA removed the condition for providing eligibility to both groups, effective July 1, 1989. Income eligibility for this optional group of aged and disabled individuals is based on a standard established at a level that is at or below 100 percent of the Federal poverty income guidelines for a family of the size involved. The term ``family of the size involved,'' as used in section 1902(m)(2)(A), is not specifically defined in the statute. However, for this optional group of aged and disabled we believe that it would be appropriate to adopt for individuals and couples who seek eligibility under section 1902(m) of the Act the SSI program's distinction between eligible individuals and eligible couples, depending on whether the individual alone is eligible or both members of the couple are eligible under section 1902(m). Since the statute requires that income be determined using the principles of section 1612, which are SSI program rules, using SSI's individual and couple distinction as well as SSI's deeming rules enables States to have a clear understanding of the baseline for determining eligibility for members of this poverty level-related group. It also avoids potential conflicts with section 1902(a)(17)(D) of the Act, which could result if eligibility for this group were determined by pooling family income (if the family included individuals other than a husband and wife). The SSI program determines eligibility for couples, or for individuals. If the SSI definition of a couple (i.e., the couple is married and they qualify for SSI benefits as an eligible couple) is not met, eligibility is determined on an individual basis. We propose to apply this principle to determine eligibility for the optional Medicaid aged and disabled group. If two individuals are married and are both eligible under section 1902(m), both spouses will be considered a couple even if only one spouse applied for medical assistance and their income will be compared to the Federal poverty level for a family of two. If both individuals in a family are not eligible as a couple under section 1902(m), their eligibility will be determined as individuals, with their incomes being compared to the poverty level for an individual, and deeming of income and resources from responsible family members using SSI deeming methodologies.
