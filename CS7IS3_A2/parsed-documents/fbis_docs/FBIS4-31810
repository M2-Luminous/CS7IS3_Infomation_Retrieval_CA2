Weather permitting, we are now facing a big harvest, so it seems, which will contribute to a better supply of our market, a stabilization of prices, and increased earnings. There are another two or three elements. Regarding one element that has been discussed extensively in the press, our farmers can rest assured that the value of the dinar will remain fixed and that there will be no deviations or compromises on this issue. Therefore, what they will get in June will be the same as what they will get in September, October, and so forth. Therefore, there is no reason to fear depreciation. This is the first thing. Second, the salaries in nonproductive branches have increased considerably, especially in the higher wage categories. These salaries are stabilizing and we believe that for three months the salaries in the higher categories do not need to change. However, at the same time we must increase the salaries in the lower wage categories. Because we will maintain stability in this balance and equilibrium in the higher strata of salaries, the overall production and increase in production will contribute that all this will hold up, balance itself out, and that the increased spending power in the low income groups will be compensated for by the increase in production. [Petrovic] How can we overcome the current deadlock in the relations between banks and the economy? [Avramovic] This problem must be resolved. I believe that we will encounter a further expansion of our monetary system. At the same time we must take care of our foreign currency balance sheet. These are new issues that are coming our way. I believe that we will successfully overcome the problems that are appearing now and that the satisfaction of the economy's needs for credits will be at a high level of realization and at a satisfactory level of equilibrium in the balance of payments. [Petrovic] Are there any grounds to fear the reappearance of the [currency] dealers' cuts? [Avramovic] I do not think so. Namely, the fourth series of dealers' cuts that we first encountered in January and then in March, April and now, has so far been lower that any earlier cuts. I do not know why we have dealers' cuts now. (?It should not have been a big one). One of the factors is that we have assumed that we are nevertheless an island in Europe and we are rather susceptible to these influences despite the blockade, that is, influences in the circulation of capital, you know, that is a problem [sentence as heard]. However, I believe that problem will be easily resolved. [end recording]
