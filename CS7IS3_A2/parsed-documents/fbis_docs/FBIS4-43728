That is how Scharping has responded to continued demands to that effect from the party's left, which expressed these demands in a resolution passed at the SPD district congress for South Hesse at the weekend. The congress, which reelected party Deputy Chairman Wieczorek-Zeul as district chairman (with, of course, only 69.5 percent compared to 82 percent at the previous election) came out in favor of a statement on a red-green coalition at the federal level. Scharping, on the other hand, warned against an "uncritical" attitude on the part of the SPD vis- a-vis the Greens that signaled a lack of confidence. [passage omitted] In a whole series of conversations, SPD Deputy Chairman Thierse said that the SPD would not pursue a "coalition election campaign." People who want a change of government have to vote for the SPD. Everything else will be determined by negotiations and closeness on political matters. Thierse did, however, make it clear that the Greens were closer to the SPD than the FDP. He also warned against holding a discussion about Scharping's leadership. "That would lead to political suicide." Speaking to the WELT AM SONNTAG, Parliamentary Manager Struck of the SPD Bundestag Group and a member of Scharping's closest team of advisers said: "The SPD should not and will not conduct a coalition election campaign. The party's goal must be to prevent the formation of an opposing government." Speaking at the party congress in South Hesse, Federal Party Manager Verheugen sought to win support for his proposal that Scharping should present his shadow cabinet before the end of July. The delegates responded with applause. Verheugen said that the SPD must quickly show that the SPD can provide a "wealth" of politicians who can get things done, in contrast to the Federal Government. Until now, Scharping has said that he will make a decision by the end of August at the latest. According to reliable sources, Scharping was not pleased about his federal manager's excessive haste. At a meeting of the "Seeheim Kreis," which is close to the trade union movement, SPD Bundestag Group Chairman Klose said he regretted that SPD statements on foreign policy made it easy for the Federal Government "to strike a pose of being solid on foreign policy and push us into the corner in terms of foreign policy." The SPD must comprehend that the concept of defense covers more than national and Alliance defense and "that, at any rate, is the way that our Alliance partners see things." If the party insists on maintaining its current standpoint, it will make things difficult for itself. The SPD has unnecessarily placed itself "in a corner" and thus given the Federal Government a chance to divert attention from its own lack of ideas. Klose also criticized the fact that the SPD has based its election campaign strategy on a prolonged economic crisis for too long. "We cast ourselves in the role of killjoys of our own making if we deny that the economy is picking up and only peddle bad news." This makes it easy for the Federal Government to "paint a rosier picture of reality from its point of view." Lower Saxon Minister-President Schroeder also said that "there is no doubt at all that we are experiencing an upturn."
