How Will It Be Satisfied?''] [Text] Today the only way higher educational institutions [VUZs] cannot train personnel for industry and science at the level of world requirements is by using the information resources that are accessible to higher education in developed countries, which is to say by working in a computer network system whose service is maximally adapted to meet scientists' and teachers' needs. In Russia, computer networks have also been actively developed in the past few years. Unfortunately, most of these networks are commercial networks (for example, Relcom, IASNET, Sprint) where the price per amount of information sent (i.e., the price for traffic) is rather high and the amount of information sent by science and higher education is traditionally large. The use of noncommercial networks, where traffic is free of charge, would therefore be far more valuable for the development of higher education. The inter-higher educational institution [intervuz] information infrastructure of the Russian Federation State Committee on Higher Education, which could be closely tied to already existing international scientific research and educational noncommercial networks, could become such a network. In view of the formation of the United National Center for Coordination (NIIC SUEARN/FREEnet/UNICOM-RUSSIA) of the respective programs of development of telecommunications of the Russian Academy of Sciences and Russian Federation State Committee on Higher Education, the creation in Russia of a research and education network with its own higher education information resources (a project to develop higher educational institution data bases, knowledge networks, library telecommunication networks, and other resources along the line of UNICOM-RUSSIA) and virtually unlimited access to all resources of international academic and scientific networks (the Academy of Sciences project SUEARN/FREEnet) has become a real possibility. There are a number of prerequisites permitting rather rapid creation of a well-developed electronic infrastructure for intervuz information exchange in Yaroslavl and the northwestern region based on the computer system of Yaroslavl State University. The university has a data processing center with affiliates in the following: the biology, mathematics, and economics departments; the information science laboratory of the information science and computer engineering department of the new information technologies center; computer support group of and the political research center of the social sciences department. The existing segment of the heterogeneous education and research network was created on the basis of the Yaroslavl State University Data Processing Center, which includes computer systems of different levels ranging from personal computers of the IBM PC/386 and 486 (OS UNIX, MS DOS, Windows) class and computers of the YeS 1061 (OS VM/SP RSCS) mainframe type to modern network servers of the SPARC Classic (OS Solaris) type. Systems have been developed for interaction of a segment of a network with a central computer cluster in the NICC SUEARN/FREEnet/UNICOM-RUSSIA at the Organic Chemistry Institute imeni N.D. Zelinski of the Russian Academy of Sciences by using a multiprotocol technology that makes it possible to implement up to four logical channels based on one physical channel (in our case, the protocols NYE, TCP/IO, and X.25 are implemented simultaneously). This process was used in a system of noncommercial open networks for the first time in the Russian Federation. Operation along switched telephone lines for users at other higher educational institutions in accordance with the UUCP protocol is supported. Operation of a bridge-radio channel connecting the data processing center's central local area network with its segment in the mathematics department (a distance of up to 6 km) has been started up and is being supported. Network software that is part of the standard for mathematics software of the international nodes of university computer centers, i.e., NETSERV, LISTSERV, NETNEWS, Internet Gopher (in server and client versions), and ASTRA, has been installed at the research and education network's hosts, (at)SUYARS.BITNET, (at)UNIV.YARS.free.net, (at)ICN.YARS.free.net, and (at)CLASSIC.YARS.free.net. A whole series of programs are in the development stage: formation of departmental local area networks with plans to combine them into a single university local area network and to then integrate them into the EARN/BITNET/Internet global international networks; a university data processing center; and organizatio of a full-scale regional center of the research and education network. Training of scientific and teaching personnel and students at higher educational institutions in the principles of working in open-type global international networks has begun. New software supporting the teaching process based on the use of international teleconference materials and remote information resources (including the conduct of teleconferences on LISTSERV(at)SUYARS.BITNET) are being assimilated. The computer center at Yaroslavl State University is conducting enterprising research in the development of an optimal scheme for using computer resources at the oblast's scientific research institutes and higher educational institution for scientific research and educational purposes. This scheme is based on Internet-type technologies and makes it possible to integrate mainframe-type high-efficiency computers at multiple-access computer centers and local area networks of personal computers. The first phase of experimental computer data bases on instructional process quality control systems (specialization: chemistry, biology, ecology) with interactive and E-mail teleaccess is being prepared and installed. A systems analysis of teleconference information flows on international list servers and different file servers is being conducted, and systematic information service of a number of scientific directions at the departments of Yaroslavl State University has begun. Satisfactory results have been obtained in working in a remote terminal mode with a catalogue of electronic libraries of very large universities in the United States and Europe, including the U.S. Library of Congress. Overall coordination of the development of the network's materials and equipment and software base was conducted at Yaroslavl State University's Data Processing Center within the framework of cooperation with the National United Center of International Projects RAN/SUEARN/FREEnet and the Russian Federation State Committee on Higher Education (University Communications UNICOM-RUSSIA). Work related to using the information resources of international computer networks in the instructional process (the data processing center's affiliate at Yaroslavl State University's biology department) was conducted during the course of the implementation of a number of directions of the Universities of Russia program. To date, nodes of EARN/BITNET and FREEnet/Yaroslavl State University have been registered in international routing tables, including in the largest U.S. networks. Plans for the future include work in four directions involving implementation of ideas developed in the past 15 months, provided that sufficient financing is available. In essence, this is that fragment of the federal plan that was developed at the national coordination center FREEnet/SUERN/UNICOM (Organic Chemistry Institute imeni N.D. Zelinskiy, Russian Academy of Sciences). Our experience in developing computer networks indicates that it is, for all practical purposes, possible to develop segments of a unified research and educational network in the Russian Federation based on data processing centers at the universities and institutes of the Russian Federation State Committee on Higher Education with implementation of a program of reoutfitting already operating computer centers and equipping them with both personal computers and workstations and multiple-access computers.
