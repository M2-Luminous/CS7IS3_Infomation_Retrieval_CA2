FR940526-0-00037 FR940526-0-00016 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement 30 CFR Part 917 Kentucky Regulatory Program Amendment AGENCY: Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM), Interior. ACTION: Final rule; approval of amendment. SUMMARY: OSM is announcing the approval, with an exception, of a proposed program amendment to the Kentucky regulatory program (hereinafter referred to as the Kentucky program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The amendment consists of proposed modifications to Kentucky Administrative Regulations (KAR) relating to surface and underground coal mining permits, and fish and wildlife resources, and replaces two earlier proposed program amendments submitted on June 28, 1991 (Administrative Record No. KY&hyph;1059), and March 13, 1992 (Administrative Record No. KY&hyph;1119). EFFECTIVE DATE: May 26, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William J. Kovacic, Director, Lexington Field Office, Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, 2675 Regency Road, Lexington, Kentucky 40503, Telephone (606) 233&hyph;2896. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background on the Kentucky Program. II. Submission of the Proposed Amendment. III. Director's Findings. IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments. V. Director's Decision. VI. Procedural Determinations. I. Background on the Kentucky Program On May 18, 1982, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Kentucky program. Background information on the Kentucky program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of approval can be found in May 18, 1992, Federal Register (47 FR 21404&hyph;21435). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 917.11, 917.13, 917.15, 917.16 and 917.17. II. Submission of the Proposed Amendments By letter of July 21, 1992 (Administrative Record No. KY&hyph;1167), Kentucky resubmitted a proposed program amendment that completed the Kentucky promulgation process under the Kentucky Revised Statutes (KRS) Chapter 13A. This proposed amendment replaces two earlier proposed program amendments dated March 13, 1992 (Administrative Record No. KY&hyph;1119), and June 28, 1991 (Administrative Record No. KY&hyph;1059). The July 21, 1992, resubmission contains revisions to 405 KAR 8:030 (Surface coal mining permits), 405 KAR 8:040 (Underground coal mining permits), and 405 KAR 16:180/18:180 (Protection of fish, wildlife, and related environmental values). The proposed revisions pertaining to fish and wildlife resources as set forth at 405 KAR 8:030 and 8:040 sections 20 and 36, and 405 KAR 16:180 and 18:180 sections 1, 2, and 3, were previously considered by OSM, and the Director's decision on those provisions are discussed in the final rule dated December 9, 1992 (57 FR 58139&hyph;58144). However, OSM inadvertently failed to finalize the portion of the amendment dealing with non-fish and wildlife resource revisions to 405 KAR 8:030/8:040 contained in Kentucky's submissions dated June 28, 1991, March 13, 1992, and July 21, 1992. In order to insure that appropriate opportunity for comment on the revisions has been provided, OSM reopened the public comment period in the October 27, 1993, Federal Register (58 FR 57767), and in the same notice, provided opportunity for a public hearing on the adequacy of the proposed amendments to 405 KAR 8:030/8:040, other than the revisions to fish and wildlife resources. III. Director's Findings Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 ad 732.17 are the Director's findings concerning the proposed amendments. Revisions not specifically discussed below concern nonsubstantive wording changes, or revised cross-references and paragraph notations to reflect organizational changes resulting from this amendment. 1. 405 KAR 8:030/8:040 Section 1
