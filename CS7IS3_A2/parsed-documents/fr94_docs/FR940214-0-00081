FR940214-0-00081 FR940214-0-00012 The commenters expressed conflicting views about the nature of diaphragm failures. On the one hand, ITI reiterated its view that diaphragm failures begin small and develop very slowly because the diaphragms use a rip stop nylon fabric. This led ITI to conclude that long before a hole becomes large enough to affect parking capabilities, it is no longer possible to release the parking brakes. ITI accordingly requested that diaphragms be excluded from failure testing. On the other hand, the spring brake manufacturers (Midland-Grau, MGM Brakes, Neway Anchorlok, Allied Signal, MEMA, and Ferodo) stated that diaphragms can and do experience rapid massive failure in addition to the gradual failure discussed by ITI. The spring brake manufacturers alleged that there were several catastrophic failure modes, including: (1) The piston plate wearing a hole through the diaphragm, (2) air permeating between the rubber or neoprene compound causing it to balloon out and then blow, (3) the effects of exposing the diaphragm to oil which causes the compound to delaminate from the fabric, (4) broken springs or piston plates cutting into the diaphragm, (5) and manufacturing defects in the nylon fabric. Neway Anchorlok believed that because these catastrophic failure modes can occur between parking brake applications, they may significantly and suddenly impair the service brake's capabilities. The potential for catastrophic failures led the spring brake manufacturers to recommend that the agency retain the ``any leakage'' requirements. After reviewing the conflicting comments, NHTSA decided to examine further the failure modes experienced by diaphragms. To this end, the agency visually inspected failed diaphragms submitted by Bendix, Ferodo, and MGM. In addition, the agency contacted diaphragm manufacturers. In its examination of diaphragms submitted by various manufacturers, NHTSA found no evidence of catastrophic failure; rather, the agency found that failures typically involved slow deterioration through extended use. The only time the agency found a catastrophic failure was when there was a rapid air loss resulting from a spring puncture or a pull-out from the clamp band area. Spring puncture failures are not relevant to the present rulemaking about air-applied, mechanically held systems which do not have springs. With respect to possible pull-out, ITI has stated that if, in servicing its units, the diaphragm is installed improperly, the brakes cannot be released upon air-up of the system. The agency has placed the findings of its inspection of failed diaphragms in the docket. In response to agency inquiries, Longwood Elastomers and Goodyear, two large diaphragm manufacturers, stated that diaphragms do not fail catastrophically. While they acknowledge that some failure modes mentioned by the spring brake manufacturers do occur (e.g., spring puncture, plate chaff, unseating, flex cracking in the bead area, accelerated degradation caused by exposure to oil), they contended that such failures either happen so infrequently that they do not raise safety concerns or would not happen with an air-applied, mechanically held brake system (e.g., a single diaphragm brake system has no heavy spring brake that can pierce the diaphragm after failing from fatigue). With respect to failure rates, one diaphragm manufacturer informed the agency that it had returns of about 20 units from an annual production of between 2,000,000 to 2,500,000 units. This failure rate translates to a reliability of about 99.999 percent. These reliability figures are for the useful lifecycle before wearout begins. All diaphragms would eventually wear out. Therefore, diaphragms in air-applied, mechanically held systems and in the service side of spring brake systems are typically replaced after between four and five years of service. The diaphragm manufacturers further stated that they have never encountered a catastrophic failure during cycle testing of their production runs.
