FR940527-1-00133 FR940527-1-00014 We have refined our proposed budget neutrality and exceptions reduction factors for FY 1995 on the basis of the best available data. We have not retroactively adjusted the Federal rate for FY 1994 in determining the rate for FY 1995. 7. Special Rate for Puerto Rico Hospitals For FY 1994, the special rate for Puerto Rico hospitals was $291.03. With the changes we are proposing to the factors used to determine the rate, we are proposing that the FY 1995 special rate for Puerto Rico will be $272.20. B. Determination of Hospital-Specific Rate Update Section 412.328(e) of the regulations provides that the hospital-specific rate for FY 1995 be determined by adjusting the FY 1994 hospital-specific rate by the following factors: 1. Hospital-Specific Rate Update Factor The hospital-specific rate is updated in accordance with the update factor for the standard Federal rate determined under ยง412.308(c)(1). For FY 1995, we are proposing that the hospital-specific rate be updated by a factor of 1.0222. 2. Exceptions Payment Adjustment Factor For FY 1992 through FY 2001, the updated hospital-specific rate is multiplied by an adjustment factor equal to the estimated additional payments for capital-related costs for exceptions under ยง412.348, determined as a proportion of the total amount of payments under the hospital-specific rate and the Federal rate. For FY 1995, we estimate that exceptions payments will be 2.03 percent of aggregate payments based on the Federal rate and the hospital-specific rate. We therefore propose that the updated hospital-specific rate be reduced by a factor of 0.9797. The exceptions reductions factors are not built permanently into the rates; that is, the factors are not applied cumulatively in determining the hospital-specific rate. The net adjustment to the FY 1995 hospital-specific rate is therefore .9797/.9485, or 1.0329. 3. Budget Neutrality Adjustment Factor For FY 1992 through FY 1995, the updated hospital-specific rate is adjusted by a budget neutrality adjustment factor determined under ยง412.352, so that estimated aggregate payments under the capital prospective payment system will equal 90 percent of what would have been payable on a reasonable cost basis. (The budget neutrality adjustment for changes in the DRG relative weights and in the geographic adjustment factor is not applied to the hospital-specific rate.) For FY 1995, we are proposing a budget neutrality factor of 0.7986. The budget neutrality factor is not built permanently into the rates; that is, the factor is not applied cumulatively in determining the hospital-specific rate. The net adjustment to the FY 1995 hospital-specific rate is therefore .7986/.8947, or 0.8926. 4. Net Change to Hospital-Specific Rate We are providing a chart below to show the proposed net change to the hospital-specific rate. The chart shows the factors for FY 1994 and FY 1995 and the net adjustment for each factor. It also shows that the proposed cumulative net adjustment from FY 1994 to FY 1995 is 0.9424, which represents a decrease of 5.76 percent to the hospital-specific rate. The proposed FY 1995 hospital-specific rate for each hospital is determined by multiplying the FY 1994 hospital-specific rate by the cumulative net adjustment of 0.9424.
