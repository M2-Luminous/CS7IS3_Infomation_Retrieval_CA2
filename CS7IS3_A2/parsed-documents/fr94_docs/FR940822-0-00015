SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History FAA Order 7400.9A, Airspace Designations and Reporting Points, dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, listed Class A, Class B, Class C, Class D, Class E airspace areas and reporting points. Due to the large number and frequent revision of these descriptions, the FAA requested approval from the Office of the Federal Register to incorporate the material by reference in Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) §71.1 (14 CFR 71.1). The Director of the Federal Register approved the incorporation by reference of FAA Order 7400.9A in §71.1 effective September 16, 1993, through September 15, 1994. During the incorporation by reference period, the FAA processed all proposed changes of the airspace listings in FAA Order 7400.9A in full text as proposed rule documents in the Federal Register . Likewise, all amendments of these listings were published in full text as final rules in the Federal Register . This rule reflects the periodic integration of these final rule amendments into a revised edition of Airspace Designations and Reporting Points, Order 7400.9B. The Director of the Federal Register has approved the incorporation by reference of FAA Order 7400.9B in §71.1 as of September 16, 1994, through September 15, 1995. This rule also explains the procedures FAA will use to amend the airspace designations incorporated by reference in part 71. §§ 71.5, 71.31, 71.33, 71.41, 71.51, 71.61, 71.71, 71.79, and 71.901 are also updated to reflect the incorporation by reference of FAA Order 7400.9B. The Rule This action amends part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to reflect the approval by the Director of the Federal Register of the incorporation by reference of FAA Order 7400.9B effective September 16, 1994, through September 15, 1995. During the incorporation by reference period, the FAA will continue to process all proposed changes of the airspace listings in FAA Order 7400.9B in full text as proposed rule documents in the Federal Register . Likewise, all amendments of these listings will be published in full text as final rules in the Federal Register . The FAA will periodically integrate all final rule amendments into a revised edition of the Order, and submit the revised edition to the Director of the Federal Register for approval for incorporation by reference in §71.1. The FAA has determined that this action: (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. This action neither places any new restrictions or requirements on the public, nor changes the dimensions or operating requirements of the airspace listings incorporated by reference in part 71. Consequently, notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are unnecessary. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71 Airspace, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (air).
