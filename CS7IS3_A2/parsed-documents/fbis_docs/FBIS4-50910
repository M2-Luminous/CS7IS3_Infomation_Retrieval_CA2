During this period, he also inspected the production, purchase, and sale of grain and cotton in Hubei and Henan. Zhu Rongji said emphatically: To consolidate and develop the current good economic situation and to maintain social stability, leading comrades at all levels should focus their economic work on improving agricultural production and state-owned enterprises. At present, this is the key to correctly handling the relations between reform, development, and stability. It is necessary to conscientiously carry out various agricultural policies put forward by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, fully arouse the peasants' enthusiasm for growing grain and cotton, and strive for bumper harvests of both grain and cotton to lay a solid material foundation for effectively bringing prices under control. It is imperative to make thorough surveys of the conditions of enterprises, help them solve their problems, further deepen the reform of state-owned enterprises, transform their operational mechanism, and make the experiment in establishing a modern enterprise system successful. Zhu Rongji carefully heard the briefings on current economic work in these provinces. Responsible comrades from relevant departments under the State Council gave a brief introduction to the current national macroeconomic situation and a plan for reforming the system of grain purchase and sale. Leading comrades from Hubei and six other provinces, including Jia Zhijie, Chen Bangzhu, Fu Xishou, Wu Guanzheng, Ye Liansong, Zhao Zhihao, and Li Changchun, as well as responsible comrades from relevant economic departments, attended the meeting. Zhu Rongji fully affirmed the achievements made by Hubei and other six provinces in deepening the reform, opening wider to the outside world, promoting development, and maintaining stability. He said: At present, the national economic situation is very good and reforms in various fields are proceeding smoothly and are being constantly improved. The new systems have gradually become situated on the right track. Practice has proved that the series of decisions on strengthening and improving macroeconomic control and further deepening the reform to restructure the economy made by the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core is fully correct and has won support from the broad masses of the people and is highly regarded by the world. The party committees and governments at all levels have achieved marked results in conscientiously carrying out the policies of the central authorities. Zhu Rongji repeatedly stressed the importance of promoting agriculture. He pointed out: In the first four months of this year, the tendency toward excessive increases in investment in fixed assets has been brought under control, the prices of capital goods have started to fall again, and the supply of industrial consumer goods is plentiful and the prices tend to be stable. Therefore, the major tasks in bringing inflation under control and maintaining social stability are to further implement the spirit of the National Conference on Rural Work and to promote the production of grain, cotton, edible oil, and vegetables. If we achieve good result in this work, the market will become stable and the prices will drop. At present, all localities should try in every possible way to complete the purchase of the summer crop's grain and oil- bearing farm produce. They should strengthen the management of grain and oil-bearing farm produce market, maintain normal purchase order, and provide enough funds for purchasing grain and oil-bearing farm produce. They should insist on the principle of not issuing any IOU's. Zhu Rongji said: At present, the tendency of the reform and development of state-owned enterprises is good. Calculated in terms of comparable items, the profits of the enterprises in the first four months of this year did not drop but increased and the percentage of enterprises with general debility decreased rather than rising. This situation has become a major trend. A few state- owned enterprises, mainly small and medium-sized ones, are indeed faced with under-capacity operation or even shut-downs. Judging from a recent investigation conducted by the State Economic and Trade Commission and other relevant departments in Beijing and 10 other provinces and municipalities, as well as from the current investigation of some enterprises in Wuhan and Huangshi, those enterprises which are shut down or operate under capacity are indeed faced with the problem of not having enough circulation funds. But the major problems lie in the fact that some enterprises have over-large production capacity and poor management, turn out products without a ready market, that the funds used for finished products increase, and that the default of payment among enterprises has become serious. All these problems cannot be solved by relaxing money supply or increasing loans. Leading comrades at all levels and responsible persons of enterprises should pay more attention to the changes in the market, strengthen technological renovation, readjust product mix, improve management, and resolutely carry out the principle of "limiting production, reducing stockpiles, and promoting sales." Zhu Rongji said emphatically: The fundamental solution to the problems faced by the state-owned enterprises lies in deepening the enterprise reform, changing the management mechanism, and establishing a modern enterprise system which meets the requirements of the market economy and in which the property rights, as well as the rights and responsibilities of enterprises, are clearly defined, government administration and enterprise management are separated, and scientific management is established. Regarding the shortage of circulation funds for enterprises as reflected by all quarters, principal responsible persons of economic departments and banks at all levels should take the lead in going deep into the grass-roots units to make surveys. Banks should render full support to enterprises whose products have a ready market, whose product payments are retrieval, and whose economic performances are good. Banks also should provide loans to those enterprises that begin to experience losses so as to help them make up deficits. As to those state-owned enterprises which are shut down and have problems paying wages to workers, both banks and local governments should, in the light of maintaining social stability, work together to help them resume production and get out of these predicaments. As for those enterprises which have recorded losses for a long period and have no hope to make up deficits should declare bankruptcy according to the law after making good preparations. Such practice should be experimented in some areas first and then expanded to others. This will be our way to promote the modern enterprise system. During his stay in Hubei, Zhu Rongji, accompanied by Comrade Jia Zhijie and other responsible comrades of the Hubei Provincial CPC Committee and Government, inspected Hanchuan county in the central part of the Jianghan Plain. He visited peasants who were working or spraying insecticide in the farmlands in Hongtang Village and Chenguang Village. He conducted a study in Liuge Township on grain's selling price and the management of the grain control office. During his stay in Henan, Zhu Rongji, accompanied by Comrade Li Changchun and other comrades of the Henan Provincial CPC Committee and Government, inspected the production and sale of grain and cotton and the technique of growing vegetables inside the plastic film sheds. He also went to the Hubei provincial branch of the People's Bank of China and the Henan provincial branch of the People's Bank of China to see cadres and workers there. Responsible comrades of relevant departments under the State Council, including Han Shubin, Yao Zhenyan, Wang Chunzheng, Chen Qingtai, Liu Zhifeng, Xiang Huaicheng, Wu Yixia, Bai Meiqing, Liu Shanzai, Zhu Xiaohua, Ma Yongwei, Wang Xuebing, and Wang Zhishan who were on the inspection team, also attended the meeting.
