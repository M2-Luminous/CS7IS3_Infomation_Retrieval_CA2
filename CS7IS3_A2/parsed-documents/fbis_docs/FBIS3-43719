The station will probably be known as Radio Vryheid [Radio Freedom]. The foundations for the radio mast were laid this morning by workers supervised by Mr. Manie Malan of the Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front]. This will be the second right-wing station in the [Orange] Free State. Radio Pretoria has already been operating for a while from Donkerhoek, and Radio Koppies [small hills) began transmitting about a month ago. Radio Freedom will be received as far afield as Warrington in the northern Cape, Welkom in the northern Free State, and Edenburg in the southern Free State. Meanwhile, the chairman of the management committee of Radio Pretoria, the Reverend Mossie van den Berg, has said that there is no direct link between Radio Pretoria, Radio Vryheid and Radio Koppies. He denied reports that Radio Pretoria was broadcasting from another transmitter on the West Rand.
