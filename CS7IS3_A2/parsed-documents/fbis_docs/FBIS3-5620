He will also support China's bid to become a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the officials said. Hosokawa will voice the support in a series of talks with Chinese leaders, including Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and Qiao Shi, chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, they said. He will also talk about Japan's yen loans to China, they said. When Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata visited China in January, Japan and China agreed to divide Japan's loan periods from five years to three-year and two-year periods beginning with the 1996 fiscal year. Hosokawa and Chinese leaders will also discuss boosting Japanese investment and cooperation between the two nations on environmental preservation, they said. They will also exchange views on international affairs such as cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and North Korea's alleged nuclear weapons development program, they said. Hosokawa is scheduled to arrive in Beijing on March 19 and visit Shanghai on March 21 before returning to Tokyo. The last visit to China by a Japanese prime minister was in 1991 when then Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu visited China and Mongolia.
