The consequences of such an air operation would have to be considered beforehand, Voigt said today on the radio station Radio Brandenburg. Artillery positions around Sarajevo could certainly be hit in an attack. However, civilian casualties might also be expected, the SPD politician said. Following a possible successful operation in Sarajevo, there would also be demands for the same to be done in other encircled towns in Bosnia. This might lead to an escalation, the consequences of which would be incalculable, Voigt stated. SPD defense expert Manfred Opel has also criticized NATO and UN plans to intervene in the Bosnian war using air strikes. Speaking on Norddeutscher Rundfunk today, Opel described these ideas as "political actionism." It is to be feared that the war in the Balkans will escalate if such attacks go ahead. NATO would become a belligerent, but not one which could intervene decisively, he asserted. [passage omitted]
