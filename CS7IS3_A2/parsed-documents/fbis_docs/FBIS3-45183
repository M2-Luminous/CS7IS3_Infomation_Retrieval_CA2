Named the "three-xi project", it aims to turn Shanxi, Shaanxi and western (or in Chinese, "xi") Inner Mongolia into China's coal bases by the end of this century. "These bases will be comprehensive ones covering concerned projects such as coal mines, electric power plants, railway transportation, gasworks and concrete plants," said a high-ranking official of the Ministry of Coal Industry. According to the ongoing work conference on the coal industry, the plan will be worked out later this year, and the project will be approved at that time. Statistics show that the proven coal deposits in those areas account for 63 percent of China's total. By the year 2000, about 370 million tons of coal there are expected to be allocated to other areas of China. China is rich in coal reserves and coal accounts for about 75 percent of its primary energy consumption. In 1993, China's coal output reached 1.14 billion tons, and it is expected to top 1.4 billion tons by the end of this century. According to experts, China can be divided into three parts in terms of coal distribution. The resources in 19 provinces lying east of the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway are short of demands. The "three-xi" areas are rich in coal deposits and will supply coal to other areas, while deposits of coal in western China meet the region's own demands. The official said that consequently, in the coal producing areas with large deposits and high efficiency, a batch of large energy bases combining transportation of coal and electric power will be set up to support China's national economy. To promote the sustained, fast and healthy development of the coal industry, the official said, in 1994, no efforts will be spared to set up 20 comprehensive development bases with major state-owned coal mines as the foundation. Meanwhile, more attention will be paid to the construction of 15 commodity coal mining areas and 100 key coal-producing counties with state-owned, locally-run coal mines and township coal-mines as their respective mainstays.
