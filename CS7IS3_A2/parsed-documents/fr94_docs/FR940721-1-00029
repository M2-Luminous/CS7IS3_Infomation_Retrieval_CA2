FR940721-1-00029 FR940721-1-00009 The USEPA finds that the five contingency measures provided in the State submittal meet the requirements of section 175A(d) of the Act since they would promptly correct any violation of the ozone NAAQS. E. Subsequent Maintenance Plan Revisions In accordance with section 175A(b) of the Act, the State has agreed to submit a revised maintenance SIP 8 years after the area is redesignated to attainment. Such revised SIP will provide for maintenance for an additional 10 years. IV. Proposed Action The USEPA proposes to approve the Detroit-Ann Arbor ozone maintenance plan as a SIP revision meeting the requirements of section 175A if there is full and final approval of the outstanding VOC RACT requirements previously discussed, 1990 base year emission inventory, basic I/M (meeting the criteria of the June 28, 1994 proposed I/M Redesignation Rule), and the section 182(f) NO X exemption petition. In addition, the USEPA is proposing approval of the redesignation request for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area, subject to final approval of the maintenance plan, because the State has demonstrated compliance with the requirements of section 107(d)(3)(E) for redesignation pending full approval of the SIP elements listed above. (In the alternative, if ambient air quality violations occur before USEPA takes final action on the proposed redesignation or if the USEPA does not fully approve any of the SIP revisions listed above, the USEPA proposes to disapprove this redesignation request.) Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Ozone SIPs are designed to satisfy the requirements of part D of the Act and to provide for attainment and maintenance of the ozone NAAQS. This proposed redesignation should not be interpreted as authorizing the State to delete, alter, or rescind any of the VOC or NO X emission limitations and restrictions contained in the approved ozone SIP. Changes to ozone SIP VOC regulations rendering them less stringent than those contained in the USEPA approved plan cannot be made unless a revised plan for attainment and maintenance is submitted to and approved by USEPA. Unauthorized relaxations, deletions, and changes could result in both a finding of nonimplementation [section 173(b) of the Act] and in a SIP deficiency call made pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the Act. D. Procedural Background This action has been classified as a Table 2 Action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). A revision to the SIP processing review tables was approved by the Acting Assistant Administrator for Office of Air and Radiation on October 4, 1993 (Michael Shapiro's memorandum to Regional Administrators). A future action will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of 2 years (54 FR 2222). The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continued in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive order 12291 on September 30, 1993. E. Regulatory Process Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. section 600 et seq., the USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. section 603 and 604. Alternatively, the USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. The SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Act forbids USEPA to base its actions concerning SIP's on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.S.E.P.A. , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. section 7410(a)(2). Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by September 19, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such a rule. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (section 307(b)(2).)
