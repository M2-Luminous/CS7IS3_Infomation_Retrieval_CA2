This has made the situation even more complicated, and it also shows that the United States is taking a keen interest in this issue. The question is, why? However, the first question is: Is China really occupying a part of Kashmir? Both Pakistan and China have declared that China has not taken over any part of Kashmir. The Americans say that Pakistan had given this part of Kashmir to China according to an agreement between the two countries. Although, there was an agreement over border between Pakistan and China, it is not clear if Pakistan did ([word missing]). Then what do these words of the U.S. spokesman mean? There is no proof of Gilgit and Hunza being part of Kashmir for the last 100 years. One thing, however, is clear. The United States is increasingly interested in the Kashmir issue. Does it: 1. Want to complicate the issue or is it increasing pressure on China to make this issue a defense topic? 2. Talk about the third option or Kashmir's independence so that it can control this region later [for the following reasons]? i. it can keep eyes on Pakistan, China and India. It can, at least, control India and Pakistan this way. ii. it wants to establish its control over this beautiful region so it can be used as a "recreation" and "rest" area in Asia for the Americans. iii. perhaps it wants to keep its eyes on Central Asia and Russia and add the northern region presently under Pakistan to it. The borders of Pakistan and China meet here and the Americans have mentioned it. iv. it is possible that there are special minerals in this region and only the United States knows about it and wants to mine them. v. As the only superpower in the world, it wants to control the Himalayas, the greatest mountain range in the world, and has the control of the roof of the world, Siachen. vi. There might be another reason which we do not know. Kashmir is definitely beautiful and is known as the heaven on earth. There are many other regions and areas in the world which are unique in their beauty, but one cannot take over all the beautiful regions. Its beauty is an additional asset. The most important issue could be its strategic location. It can become a central place to control Pakistan, India, China, Russia, Central Asia, Afghanistan, and Iran or at least can be used to keep an eye on all these countries. Pakistan had, after all, allowed the United States to establish its military base at Badpir in this region which the United States used to keep an eye on Russia and China. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, it has got some time to make preparations before Russia is ready again. God has given the United States this opportunity to become the only superpower in the world. It will use it to scare other countries, especially Pakistan, and also convince India since it is sure of its success. Additionally, the United States is very interested in China and Japan. Japan, because of its economic growth, poses a challenge to the United States and it is trying to end its "economic superpower" status. It appears that the United States is implementing its plans now. It is possible that, at a time when it has no danger from anywhere and is not very busy, it will freeze Japanese assets to make it helpless or take Japanese economic affairs in its own hands. Similarly, China is also on its list because it has not submitted to it like Russia did. At present it is making China go through the same phase as Pakistan and is providing it American equipment, weapons, computers, and loans among other things. The United States has put it, just like Pakistan, in the favored nation clause, and is pressuring it over the human rights issue. It appears to be ready to close its options ([blank]) and curtail its rights. In the past when China was behind the Iron Curtain, or the United States was after China or it was busy in the war between North and South Korea and China was surrounded from all sides, Pakistan was the only route that China could use to contact other countries in the world. Pakistan has started the PIA [Pakistan International Airlines] flights between Beijing and Islamabad or Karachi and introduced China to the United States. Pakistan had to face great pressure and problems in this effort. China has always stood by Pakistan in difficult times. That is why the friendship between China and Pakistan is still very strong. All kinds of conspiracies are afoot to weaken it. The construction of the Silk Highway between Pakistan and China has connected the two countries and made ground travel between them possible in all seasons. It has been commonly argued in Pakistan that the United States considers this connection by ground a block in its efforts and wants to remove it. Now that the State Department spokesman has involved China in the Kashmir issue, it is definite that the United States wants to break up this ground connection between China and Pakistan, and wants to separate these two countries. Many other efforts are also being made in this connection. For example, Chinese engineers working in Pakistan were abducted many times. There was a lot of unrest in Xianjiang over religious awakening there, and efforts were made to blame Pakistan for this unrest. The Chinese were told that the Kashmiri freedom struggle will affect the Muslim-majority province of Xianjiang. There are also proofs of U.S. efforts encouraging the Kashmiris to form a separate country. In 1989, Robert Oakley, then U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, asked Kashmir Premier Mumtaz Rathore why a third option on Kashmir was considered. Similarly, the French ambassador talked about it to Nawabzada Nasruallah Khan. These days, CNN and other news media are airing news about Kashmir prominently, which is good because it would attract world attention to atrocities being committed in Kashmir, and would leave India alone. However, this does not seem to be happening. The situation is moving in another direction. Fears have increased now that the United States has started to mention China in the context of Kashmir. In addition, we can assume that the United States is interested in either Kashmir's strategic location or resources, for example, there are plenty of minerals which the nature had given to Kashmir for centuries. The reason for this fear is that it has happened in the past. Africa was ravaged in the 19th century because of minerals there. The white people made the black natives their slaves and took, and still are taking, the minerals from there. It is not of the past but a fact of yesterday when they made elaborate plans to control the oil wells in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and to make Japan depend on them. It had Iran and Iraq fight, and later encouraged Iraq to invade Kuwait. Then it quickly sent troops there and established its control over the oil wells in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and other Arab nations under the pretext of defending Saudi Arabia. Before that they tried to get Pakistan's support to control these oil wells by letting the United States establish military bases here so it could control oil routes in the Arabian Sea. Pakistan managed to keep itself out of it. The United States benefitted from the Iraq war in one way. Smaller nations find themselves helpless against modern U.S. weapons. They have accepted defeat without fighting and have knelt down in front of the United States. We used to praise the United States, the open mindedness of its people, and its help to free world nations. We considered it to be a nation of high caliber and champion of the free world nations. The situation has changed now and fear has replaced the feeling of respect which is not good for the Americans themselves. The United States is losing good friends. I would like to request that the United States be admonished about it and that history be explained to it. It must be told that its attitude is not correct. It has not seen the destructiveness of war on its land for centuries. We know that it is moving toward a major crisis. That is why I presented the idea that we protect ourselves while the United States is focused on other issues. I want to say now that we should organize a nongovernment movement which can play a role in the future when something happens that we do not want. We must express official reaction to it and not bow our head down totally.
