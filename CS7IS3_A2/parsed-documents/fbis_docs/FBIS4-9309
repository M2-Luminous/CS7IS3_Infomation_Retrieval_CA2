Several hundred Serbian civilians from Donja Potkozara, Gornja Potkozara, Zupcici, Lug, Visevica, and other villages have returned to their homes after almost two years spent as refugees. They decided to return after UN representatives offered them guarantees that they would be secure. On their return the Serbian civilians found utter devastation in their villages because the Muslims had razed and burned to the ground all houses and other buildings. However, they hope that they will receive aid in rebuilding their razed homes and that UNPROFOR representatives will be a true guarantee that the Muslims will not massacre them in their villages again.
