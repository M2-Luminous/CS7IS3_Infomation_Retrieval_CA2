The volk now demands its leaders to spell out to it how Afrikaner self-determination can be achieved so that the volk can tread the chosen path to freedom with typical Afrikaner/Boer passion. Our leaders have already openly admitted that it would have been better to achieve self-determination peacefully and without bloodshed, but added that freedom would be grabbed by force if there was no other way out. At ground level is an unprecedented anger spreading among patriots as it becomes clearer that the de Klerk government is selling them out "constitutionally" -- in the most atrocious way imaginable -- to black heathen communists. The de Klerk government, through withholding truths and through blatant lies, and through misleading voters in several elections and in the referendum, has virtually lied -- politically speaking -- the Afrikaner/Boer nation into a communist revolution. The awarding of the Philadelphia and the Nobel Prizes makes up part of the international conspiracy to dress the two political conspirators, de Klerk and Mandela, in a false cloak of peace. South Africa is the one place in the free world where there is no peace and--in the event of a communist unitary government after 27 April without the recognition and the realization of the aspirations of self-determination of the Afrikaner/Boer nation--peace will not be reached in this country in the next 40 years. According to de Klerk's alleged opinion polls, the Conservative Party [CP] and the Inkatha Freedom Party collectively only make up 10 percent of potential voters, which will mean that the ANC [African National Congress]-SACP [South African Communist Party] will, in the eyes of the entire world, get 90 percent of the votes, which, in an international context, will be a "free and fair election" [preceding four words in English]. With this type of propaganda de Klerk is trying to force the Afrikaner/Boer nation behind the already crumbling multiracial NP [National Party]. He still wants every white in the democratic election to honestly lose, with him and the NP, the struggle for the retention of an Afrikaner/Boer country. The entire Afrikaner/Boer nation will fall in behind the CP leadership once it has spelled out the way to Afrikaner/Boer self-determination. But if the CP leaders hesitate to spell out the way and the method, the man in the street will -- and they are already busy doing it -- act without the leaders. PATRIOT believes that the right decision will be made at the right time, and we hope that those who write the constitution will have good judgment so that they will include in the constitution an Afrikaner/Boer volkstaat [homeland], a Zulu state, and a Tswana state as a God-given right and a reality. It will be an easy recipe for a peaceful settlement and will help to avert a looming civil war.
