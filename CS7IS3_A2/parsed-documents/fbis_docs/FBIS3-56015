As he said, Ukraine's pledge to remove nuclear weapons from its soil and Russia's willingness to pay "an appropriate" compensation will be stipulated at Friday's meeting between the presidents of Russia, Ukraine and the U.S.A. in Moscow. "The size of such a compensation is yet to be fixed. Groups of experts will deal with this," he noted. When determining the size of compensation the experts will take into account fuel supplies for Ukrainian nuclear-power plants from Russia. "Participants in the trilateral Russian- Ukrainian-American consultations conducted in Washington worked out a plan, under which the nuclear arms withdrawn from Ukraine to Russia would be dismantled and their highly concentrated uranium be deconcentrated to serve as fuel for nuclear-power plants. This fuel will be partly left in Russia for its own needs, partly supplied to Ukraine, and partly sold to the Americans," he said. According to the diplomat, the question of writing off some of Ukraine's debts to Russia may arise only if the cost of the fuel for nuclear-power plants Ukraine will get from Russia proves to be lower than the value of the enriched uranium from the nuclear arms to be withdrawn from Ukraine to Russia. "The possible "difference" is not likely to be great, since the price of the fuel will include the cost of transporting the nuclear arms, storing, dismantling and deconcentrating them. These complicated operations cost a lot of money," he concluded.
