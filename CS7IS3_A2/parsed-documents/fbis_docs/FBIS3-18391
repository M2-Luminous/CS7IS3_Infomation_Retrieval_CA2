Support for the Center Party was affected marginally, while the Social Democratic Party [SDP] lost a small amount. This is shown by the latest SVENSKA DAGBLADET/SIFO [Swedish Institute for Public Opinion Polls] voter barometer. According to the January poll, New Democracy is continuing to lose ground. The party now has only 4 percent of the potential vote and is therefore in danger of losing its seats in the Riksdag. "This poll was concerned primarily with the Oresund Bridge. The Moderates were rewarded because Prime Minister Carl Bildt was able to hold the government together," says Alf Sjostrom, who is in charge of SIFO's poll. Up 3 Percent After the coalition parties reached agreement on the bridge at the cabinet meeting on 13 January, public opinion's support for the Moderates rose 3 percentage points (from 19 to 22 percent) in less than a week. The voter barometer as a whole represents the weighted result of three separate polls. The full impact of the rise in public support for the Moderates immediately after the agreement on the bridge therefore does not show up in the combined voter barometer. The SVENSKA DAGBLADET/SIFO voter barometer as a whole is based on 2,839 interviews conducted between 10 and 27 January. The interviewees, who were selected at random, answered the question: "Which party would you vote for if elections were being held today?" The voter barometer for January looks like this (with December figures shown in parentheses): Social Democrats: 49.8 percent (48.9); Left Party: 3.9 (3.9); Moderates: 20.6 (20.3); Center Party: 6.9 (6.4); Liberal Party: 6.3 (7.5); Christian Democrats: 4.9 (4.6); Green Party: 2.9 (3.2); New Democracy: 4.0 (5.0); and others: 0.7 (0.2). The number of voters who would cast blank ballots or could not name a party came to 14.2 percent (13.2 percent in December). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |SIFO poll for January 1994: "Which party would you vote for if elections wer-| |e being held today?" | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Party |Percent |Change Since December | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Left Party |3.9 |0.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Social Democrats |49.8 |+ 0.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Green Party |2.9 |- 0.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Center Party |6.9 |+ 0.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Liberal Party |6.3 |- 1.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Moderate Party |20.6 |+ 0.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Christian Democrats |4.9 |+ 0.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |New Democracy |4.0 |- 1.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Other |0.7 |+ 0.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bridge Most Important Issue The most important political event during the poll period was the government's talks regarding the Oresund Bridge. The result of the agreement that was reached on 13 January following two weeks of tough and sometimes dramatic negotiations is that the Center Party is remaining in the coalition and the Oresund Bridge will probably be built. "Taking a cynical view of the result, the Center Party's behavior meant that the party obtained a slight delay in construction of the bridge and remained in the coalition. But the Center Party was unable to halt the bridge," says Sjostrom. The three separate polls forming the basis of the January voter barometer consisted of about 1,000 interviews each. Those three polls reflect the shifts in public opinion throughout the period. The first poll was conducted between 10 and 13 January -- that is, before the government reached agreement on the bridge issue. During that period, the Moderates received 19 percent, the Center Party 6.5 percent, and the Social Democrats 51 percent of the potential vote. Change Makes Itself Felt The second poll took place between 17 and 20 January. That was when the change in public opinion made itself felt: after the bridge decision. The Moderates now had 22 percent of the potential vote, compared to 7 percent for the Center Party and 49 percent for the Social Democrats. The third poll, conducted between 24 and 27 January, shows that public opinion has stabilized somewhat. The Moderates have 21 percent, the Center Party 7 percent, and the Social Democrats 49 percent. "Once the government made its decision, support rose for the Moderates and fell for the Social Democrats," says Sjostrom. Support for the Center Party was affected only marginally. This should be interpreted as meaning that the voters do not want a government crisis, he says. "At least not over that issue. Instead, what they are rewarding is stability in political work, and the increased support for the Moderates is probably due to Prime Minister Carl Bildt's way of handling the bridge issue within the coalition." The combined voter barometer for January shows that the Social Democrats are keeping their hold on the voters. New Democracy is continuing its decline and now stands at the 4-percent threshold required for representation in the Riksdag. "That is a trend which has been accentuated since last fall, when New Democracy reached agreement with the government on economic policy," says Sjostrom. "New Democracy is losing voters primarily to the Moderates and the Social Democrats. Those are the parties from which it got most of its voters to start with." Social Democratic Budget in Next Poll The Social Democratic Party's shadow budget was presented this week and therefore had no effect on this voter barometer, according to Sjostrom. "Voter reaction to presentation of the Social Democratic Party's alternative to the economic policy will show up in the next voter barometer," he said.
