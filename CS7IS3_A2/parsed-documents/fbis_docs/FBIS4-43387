Korea has ordered 12 billion francs worth of rolling stock and equipment. However, only half this amount will flow to GEC-Alsthom, as the deal provides for 34 out of the 46 trains to be built by Korean manufacturers. In other words, there is a significant technology transfer component which, by the end of the decade, will allow Korea to build and export a high-speed train similar to the "TGV Atlantique" developed in the early eighties and operated in France since 1988. For Korea, this is a decisive first step toward becoming a manufacturer of high-speed trains. Nevertheless, GEC-Alsthom is trying to reassure those who fear that Korea might have obtained what it needs to surpass the Europeans within 20 or 30 years in this high-tech field, as has been the case for shipbuilding. Heavy Investment Beside its technological lead, which it is vowing to maintain, the group indicated that it expects this transfer of technology, which is being paid for through license fees, to lead to cooperation, not competition, beyond 2000. "We hope to be able to establish mutually beneficial ties," GEC-Alsthom says, "as has already been the case with other license holders, for instance Canada's Bombardier, which is now a partner." Unlike car manufacturing, or even shipbuilding, the world market for high-speed trains is very limited: In 13 years, GEC-Alsthom has prevailed in all calls for bids, but those were not all that numerous: Spain, Texas, Northern Europe, and the Paris-London link via the Chunnel. Of late, only two countries have been considering building a high-speed link: Canada and Taiwan. Whatever the future of train transport may be, one can reasonably consider that demand will remain modest at the beginning of the next century. In such a context, says GEC-Alsthom, one cannot see another country joining the already bloated club of manufacturers, all the more since doing so would require investing very heavily with no guarantee of future profitability. It seems more likely that Korea insisted on technology transfer because it saw it as a way to improve its own techniques, such as welding, in order to apply them to other industrial sectors. Let us wish for GEC-Alsthom's sake that it is so.
