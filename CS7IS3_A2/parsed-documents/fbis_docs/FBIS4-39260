The vice prime minister has left the Supreme Council for the umpteenth time without yet being able to get his cabinet of ministers ratified at a session. Why? [Saburov] The deputies simply had a poor grasp of the situation. Clan mentality is very developed in the Crimea. A battle is under way. New people have come to power in parliament who are hungry and have an interest in ensuring that ministerial portfolios go to their men. They are guided not by the interests of their voters, but by short-term considerations. [Ryabushev] How is this reflected? [Saburov] First and foremost I have proposed a minimal cabinet -- eight ministers. Three of them are Muscovites -- Agriculture Minister Sergey Nikolskiy, Finance Minister Lyudmila Zaytseva, and Economics Minister Andrey Chernyavskiy -- the rest are Crimeans. But this breakdown did not suit parliament -- it wants to ratify its own overblown cabinet of ministers which will not be subject to my confirmation. They want it to include a Ministry of Health, a Ministry of Education, and a Ministry of Mountains and Beaches. On the one hand, you can understand them -- after all, most of the new members of parliament are teachers and doctors. But I need primarily economists and specialists who understand that there are as yet no funds to pay for ministers in the social and cultural sphere. That money needs to be earned. That is why I propose to create ministries which will be able to do so. Ministers must, above all, be professionals, not officials. They must be able to earn their pay. [Ryabushev] Incidentally, what are you paid? [Saburov] Believe it or not, I am the cheapest vice prime minister; my current pay is 1.5 million karbovantsy -- or $30 at the market rate. The president earns $40. My acting ministers earn $25. [Ryabushev] Is it worth feeling like a Muscovite hostage for money like that? After all, you earned 15 times more in Moscow. [Saburov] I have come here to sincerely help to develop the Crimean economy. My friend Yuriy Meshkov invited me. After all, I am a Crimean -- I was born in Yalta -- so I do not feel like an outsider here and I intend to continue to try to persuade parliament to ratify my version of the cabinet of ministers. [Ryabushev] You met with Max Van Der Stoel, CSCE high commissioner for ethnic minorities, 2 June. What did you talk about? [Saburov] I outlined the situation in the Crimea for him, and suggested that he provide help in ensuring European training for our parliamentary deputies. I talked about what we need to do in order to find a way out of the Crimean impasse. [Ryabushev] And what does need to be done? [Saburov] We need to hold talks, rule out the use of force, develop the economy, and harmonize Ukrainian and Crimean legislation [privesti v normu zakonodatelstva Ukrainy i Kryma], removing laws that contradict each other. Incidentally, the CSCE high commissioner and UN expert Vladimir Butkevich, who currently heads the Ukrainian Supreme Council working group at the talks with the Crimean Supreme Council commission, agree with this. [Ryabushev] How do you see the future of the Crimea? [Saburov] First and foremost, within Ukraine, and with transparent borders. Dual citizenship along the lines of European standards. Well organized social and cultural links with Russia. Private international capital. Recreation and an elite agricultural sector. Transport arteries, airfields, ports, and a bridge of friendship between East and West.
