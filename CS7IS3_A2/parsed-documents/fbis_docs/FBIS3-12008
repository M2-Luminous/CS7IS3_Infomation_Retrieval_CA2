There is no need for preambles or introductions. We wish to thank Lt. Col. Chavez for this exclusive interview with the 24 Hours program. My first question is: What have you learned as a result of the 4 February and 27 November movements? [Chavez] Thank you, Carlos. We thank you for inviting us here and allowing us to continue in our effort to contact the Venezuelan and Latin American people. The media play a very important role in this. What did we learn? Let us talk about priorities. Now that I am here, now that I have seen the people gathered outside the Athenaeum -- this is something that truly encourages a person to strive to further identify oneself with Venezuela -- I would say that this is the most important thing I have learned. I told my fellow countrymen who have gathered out there that there are people who stood up, flag in hand, for their dream of a nation in the future. I believe that is the most important thing I have learned about this historic time in which we are living. [Fernandez] Do you believe all of them know what you fought for during the 4 February and 27 November movements? It is said, and very few will deny this, that after the 4 February and 27 November movements an important change occurred within the democratic structure of our country. However, I seem to sense that Hugo Chavez Frias has his doubts. What does Hugo Chavez think? What will he do? [Chavez] I do not believe the traditional Venezuelan politician understands what has happened in Venezuela since 4 February 1992. We see this in the National Congress. It continues to be a redoubt for groups and the party inner circles who reach agreements behind the backs of the people and against the interests and hopes of the people. [Fernandez] However, you have seen that important changes did take place after 4 February. The historic sum is tremendous. In some way the Venezuelan democratic structure was moved. I would say that the results we saw on 5 December 1993 are, in some way, the result of something that began with the 4 February movement and ended with the 27 November movement. [Chavez] There have been some changes. I must admit that there have been some changes in the country. However, as I said earlier, Carlos, and I reiterate it to all the Venezuelan people who are watching at this moment, the changes are only superficial. The Venezuelan crisis is so deep that it calls for deep solutions. We must go very deep to find solutions. The economic structures and the political structures remain unchanged. They were shaken, they were cracked, but they are still there. I believe that one of the biggest responsibilities the new sectors have is to continue digging the graves for those structures. They must be crushed and new economic and social structures built if we want to see real changes. If the structures are not changed, then there can be no real change in the situation. We must not let ourselves be fooled, fellow country. [Fernandez] Do you know how strong you are? Are you aware of your political responsibility? [Chavez] We are trying to gauge this. [Fernandez] It is not easy. [Chavez] No, no, no, this is not easy. Remember that.... [Fernandez, interrupting] You are very strong. [Chavez] Yes Carlos, and it truly commits us. I wish you could have visited us while we were in jail so that we could have talked to the people. After more than two years in jail, after our shaken nation experienced four governments, we are now seeing the faces of the children and the people. We can now see what is happening. We can talk to you freely, and we can listen to the people and tell them about our ideas. Now is when we are truly beginning to gauge the results of our actions in every sense. [Fernandez] You have said that the political factors remain unchanged. However, since 5 December there has been a readjustment of forces within the National Congress, as well as a readjustment of the people's awareness. This is very important. This is why I insist on asking whether you are sure of the path you are undertaking. Are you sure of the ground you are stepping on? Are you aware of the obstacles, barriers, and enemies you are confronting? [Chavez] Let us say that we are not totally clear on that because there is a terrible, tremendous darkness surrounding us. Since you have insisted, I will tell you that I do not believe important changes have occurred in the composition of the political forces. Some progress has been made among the so-called different sectors, but, for example, what kind of decisions has the National Congress made in these past two months? What decisions has it made to show us that it wants to change the current situation? What we are seeing are things that did not exist before. We are seeing assemblies during which the party inner circles reach agreements to remove governors. We are headed for national anarchy; this is even more worrisome. [Fernandez] There are those who say that Caldera's victory rides on the 4 February and 27 November movements and that the readjustment of forces seen within the National Congress and the support the Radical Cause Party got during the elections also ride on these movements. What do you think of that? [Chavez] That is a good description of the changes, but the changes are still superficial. However, we have to admit that changes have been made and that the people's awareness has also changed. The people are aware that we are in a labyrinth and that we must find a way out. A sector, a minority sector, tried to do this, but just look at what a fraud the elections were. They were a mortal blow to the people's hopes of finding solutions along that path. [Fernandez] [Words indistinct] a big fraud? [Chavez] Yes, they were. We still have a Supreme Electoral Council in the hands of the traditional parties, from the highest office to the lowliest organization in the most distant municipality. If the system and the leaders do not understand that this must be changed, then social unrest will continue in the country. I hope this will not occur. [Fernandez] Why not? Because of the violence? [Chavez] Not necessarily. I will only say I hope this will not occur. We have been sending out a message and I wish to repeat it. We believe that one of the few ways to attain peace is a Constituent Assembly, not one handled by the political parties. Please. It should not be a Constituent Assembly handled by the traditional parties, but one handled by people outside the framework of political parties and the traditional sectors. [Fernandez] Do you not feel that political tension in our country has somewhat lessened following the 5 December elections? Do you not believe there is more trust among the people and that the people have placed their hopes on the new government? [Chavez] Listen: Generally, when a government begins there are many hopes, regardless of its legitimacy or the number of votes received. The legitimacy of the current government is there, but it is very low. This must be recognized; we must not deceive ourselves. Regardless of the government's legitimacy or political support, normally when a government begins the people have a great deal of expectation. Carlos, five years ago I was working at Miraflores Palace when Perez came to power. I did not serve in the military detachment there but as an aide for the Defense and Security Secretariat. I witnessed the people's joy when Perez won in Caracas. I remember that a truck packed with Perez supporters crashed into the gate of Miraflores Palace and there was a serious problem. I was there that evening. In other words, there was a great deal of expectation over Perez' victory, but look at what happened in less than a month. All the expectations collapsed. [Fernandez] Do you not think Perez' proposal was perhaps deceiving? proposed to break with the IMF, and a month later, in the most hypocritical and shameless manner, an agreement with the IMF was announced that established fuel increases, etc. We all know that story. [Fernandez] Now, on the position that you are going to assume as a political movement with Caldera's government: How are you going to organize yourselves. What is your opinion of Caldera's government? Do you believe that the first steps being taken could serve as a point of reference to attempt to correct the nation's crisis? [Chavez] It may be possible for Caldera's government to take an important step toward a road for significant changes. Up until now I personally have not seen any strong decision to lead the nation on that road. Nevertheless, look here, the president.... [Fernandez, interrupting] He did not even have an economic plan set out.... [Chavez, interrupting] I was just going to make reference to precisely that. All of us know about the Sosa Plan, but there is no strategic plan to recover the nation from this dramatic economic situation. A plan is fundamental to being able to recover from and end this [word indistinct] chaos. To sum it up, it will depend on the Caldera government's political actions. I must say it; I must confess it; I am concerned, because up until now we have not seen this. We have not perceived this in a little over a month -- which is a short but decisive time. Remember the 100-day factor. [words indistinct] [Fernandez] These [first 100 days] are crucial for a government's development. [Chavez] I think that is true, because after that time the government loses some of its motivation, the people's support, and initiative. It then falls into inactivity. In my opinion, Caldera's government has remained in a state of exasperating inertia. I invite the government to leave behind that state of inertia. [Fernandez] An important initiative has been presented by a [word indistinct] political party which is the Special Powers Law that could serve as a support. This could be political parliamentary support for the government to start making decisions. Commander Chavez, do you think that this Special Powers Law could be used to take emergency or special measures in the financial and economic sectors? [Chavez] This could be, but no one can guarantee that the Special Powers Law will assure that the most appropriate measures will be taken. We must recall that a Special Powers Law was available to Carlos Andres Perez, and all he did with it was cut off all of Venezuela's chances -- despite all the resources available to him -- to be led into a true national project. Subsequently, what was implemented was the Great Venezuela plan, which led us to the most tragic chapter in Venezuelan history. [Fernandez] Commander Chavez, I would like to talk about the ideological inspiration of the Bolivarian movement. Obviously, great national inspiration permeates from the thoughts of Bolivar and other heroes, but is there, in any way, an international inspiration to the Bolivarian movement? [Chavez] Well....[pauses] [Fernandez] I am asking you this because at some time, around 4 February, a series of speculations and conjectures arose. Namely, Bolivar was compared to Argentina's Painted Faces and other military movements all over Latin America. You did respond to those speculations, but there are some who still believe that there is somewhat of an international inspiration involved. [Chavez] Yes, unavoidably, there are people who believe and will continue to believe that. We have been linked to extreme rightist sectors -- that is where I believe the Argentine Painted Faces came up -- and we have also been linked with extreme leftist sectors such as the [words indistinct], the Third Path, and Cuba's Castroism. In other words, this association depends on who is making the associations, their ideologies, and the interests involved in establishing links between us and other movements. We have talked about the reemergence of an ideology, which indeed has international undertones, or, as I prefer to say, it has international repercussions. At this moment, I believe that the ideological weight represented by the Mayan Indians in Mexico.... [Fernandez, interrupting] [Words indistinct] of the Zapatist National Liberation Army? [Chavez] That is right. There is a relation there that we would have to take apart carefully and analyze with documents regarding the proclamations and the demands behind the discourse of the Zapatists. However, my instinct tells me that an ideological connection exists there, without the existence of a previous agreement. Now, I want to reiterate the essence of our national project. Currently, what we have is a national [word indistinct] Bolivar-Zamora-Rodriguez. This is not about us putting a hundred -- just to give a figure -- national heroes in a box and deciding to pick three out of it. No, no, no. We in the Army conducted a study on the political, social, and pedagogical ideas of these three Venezuelan heroes. Simon Rodriguez represented an original path for Latin America. Rodriguez urged Venezuelans and Latin Americans to finish the political revolution Bolivar started with, for instance, an economic revolution. He had designed a thorough plan for popular education, which conveyed the idea that Latin America must follow original models, plans, and governments. Back in 1842, Rodriguez warned Latin Americans to avoid deceptions and argued that there were no republics in America because there were no peoples, and the former could not exist without the latter. This shows the ideological weight that existed back then. Bolivar called Rodriguez the Socrates from Caracas. Rodriguez joined forces with Bolivar, who presented two constitutional drafts and proposed the idea of a moral and electoral power. It was also Bolivar that claimed that the people were sovereign and ordered the military to take up their swords to defend social guarantees. He was the one who joined Rodriguez, his mentor, and Ezequiel Zamora, the general of the sovereign people who instilled a high social content in the Bolivarian project. [Fernandez] Is that what marks the difference between the Bolivarian movement and the remainder of the political organizations of our country? [Chavez] I believe that is one of the basic factors that makes it different. Why? Because I believe none of the political organizations in Venezuela have a clear ideological banner. If you make a distinction between Democratic Action and COPEI [Social Action Party].... [Fernandez, interrupting] Could we then say that you had some international inspiration in the socialist movement, in the Bolshevik movement of the early century? In other words, we could then look back into all of that and reach some conclusion to that effect. Could we also point out that the Bolivarian movement will be an autochthonous movement in the political movement from now on? [Chavez] Yes, I believe it is autochthonous. Nonetheless, through reading, experience [two-second break in transmission] premilitary if you wish, in military youth, in contacts with other countries, we could say it is seeking, it is attaining ideological impact from an individual point of view. However, as a group our creation in the National Army now offers the country and -- why not -- Latin America an autochthonous ideological project. [Fernandez] Friends, that was an interview with Commander Hugo Chavez Frias. We thank Commander Chavez Frias for allowing us this interview, this contact, this exclusive dialogue for "24 Hours."
