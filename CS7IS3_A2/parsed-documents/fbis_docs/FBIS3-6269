The bulletin in an editorial titled "New Prospect for Solution of Nuclear Issue on the Korean Peninsula" says an agreement reached between the DPRK and the U.S. in New York on Feb. 25 entirely conforms to the spirit of the joint statement issued between the both sides last year, which clarifies the principles to be maintained in solving the Korean question including the nuclear issue as a whole. It is owing to the United States that the joint statement has not yet been implemented and the tensions still remain on the Korean peninsula, the bulletin points out, and goes on: The most important question at the present juncture is to put international pressure upon the United States so that it may honor its promise. The bulletin calls upon the world peaceloving forces to more vigorously conduct the international solidarity movement for supporting the just struggle of the Korean people for the independent, peaceful reunification of the country. It edits news about the solidarity movement for supporting Korea's reunification held in different countries of the world.
