Rumors of transactions of up to 40 million rands [R] came to light here in an urgent bail hearing for a white medicine man who claimed to have involved with these syndicates as a member of the AWB. David Julius Myburg (30) of Myl Avenue, Wildernishoogte, the herbal medicine doctor, was taken into custody Friday in connection with a fraud case involving R2.7 million from the sale of the Gold Reef City Hotel. The court was told that the money was illegally transferred last year from the account of Liberty Life at the First National Bank in the Braamfontein suburb of Johannesburg. In the urgent hearing that lasted until late Friday night in Magistrate H. Buhr's court, bail in the amount of R20,000 was granted to Myburg, who last week opened a practice and store here on Sandkraal Road, Thembalethu. Myburg's passport was seized, and the case remanded to the Johannesburg District Court and scheduled for 18 February. Myburg, a married man with two daughters, testified that until about eight months ago he had been engaged in obtaining money for the AWB from Gold Reef City. The former owner of the hotel, who sold it last month, had paid all of his expenses while he was acting as an intermediary among the various fraud syndicates and had no income. He testified that he accompanied a Gerhard Anderson, who had been responsible for the transactions because the AWB did not trust him. Anderson had allegedly claimed that the sale and transfer of the hotel was an authorized transaction, but he subsequently fled. Myburg received a commission of R150,000 from the owner of the hotel for his part in its sale as well as for the sale of another hotel. According to him, the bank stopped payment on a second check for the same amount and some of those involved fled with the money. Because things went awry and he was being held responsible for the missing money, he fled here. He called up John Vorster Square [police headquarters] about the conspiracy to defraud. "We were convinced that the money was coming from leftists but we only discovered where the money was coming from after the banks stopped payment on the checks," he maintained, referring to the electronic transfer of funds from Liberty Life's account. "There was a long list of transactions involving money transfers that I knew about. Up to R40 million were supposedly transferred from the ANC's account. This went on after I had already left. I am now giving second-hand information," he said in response to questioning. Since he and his family established themselves here, Myburg has been making money from Thembalethu's people by "telling their fortune." Previously, he had earned as much as R60,000 per month as a medicine man at The Wheel in Durban. His inventory consists of, among other things, ivory valued at R40,000.
