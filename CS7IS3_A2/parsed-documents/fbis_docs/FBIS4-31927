Still, this is the fourth government and the third parliament to be deliberating the issue. As usual, the problem of who to return property to and in what form is a bone of contention. A draft reprivatization law coming from some Sejm deputies was submitted to the Sejm in December; it satisfies former owners but does not suit the government. Under the government's auspices, a counterproposal was prepared by the Ownership Transformations Ministry, but the former owners say it is unacceptable. According to Deputy Ownership Transformations Minister Andrzej Zebrowski, the state cannot afford the kind of wide-sweeping reprivatization that is being suggested by the Sejm deputies. "Our assessment is that claims by former owners amount to about 350 trillion zlotys [Z]," Zebrowski says. "To meet the claims, companies subject to privatization must devote 5 percent of their shares to this every year. That means that, this year, the former owners could expect Z400 billion worth of shares." "But we want the property to be returned to us in its natural form," reply those harmed. "Only in cases where that would be impossible,could the state offer substitute property or securities. Then, reprivatization would not have a damaging effect on the state budget." "To return property in its natural form? That would create conflicts," counters Deputy Minister Zebrowski. "Take the ill-fated Warsaw apartment houses, for instance. About 4,500 former owners or heirs are seeking to have the houses returned to them. If we were to do that, the current residents of the houses would object." So the government proposes reprivatization coupons [bony reprywatyzacyjne], with which one could buy real estate being sold by the State Treasury or by gminas [small administrative units]. But only those people whose property was seized illegally by the state in the 1944-58 period would receive the coupons. This would decrease the amount of claims from Z350 trillion to Z150 trillion, but that is still too much. Those harmed would not receive as much as their real estate is worth--they would receive 63-percent less. The former owners do not understand the need for the new law because they can seek judicial remedies even now. "The government wants to legalize the barbarian laws of the Polish People's Republic," they say. "But the decrees through which the state took the property away from the people were contrary to the constitutional order." Those harmed do not want the coupons, which may turn out to be just a pile of worthless paper if gminas are not obliged to sell real estate to people holding the coupons. Their view is that the coupons will be a way to get rich for those who will buy them very cheaply, and then, through personal connections with the gmina authorities, they will be buying real estate with the coupons.
