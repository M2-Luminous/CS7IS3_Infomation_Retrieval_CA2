Specifically, an emulsion of perfluoroctylbromide [PFOB] emulsion that was initially proposed as an x-ray contract medium is now being considered as the basis of a promising universal blood substitute. PFOB was incorporated as a component in a gas-transport emulsion and injected intraperitoneally into female Wistar rats (weighing 180-220 g each) in a dose of 10 ml/kg for 3 days. Phenobarbital was analogously injected in a dose of 80 mg/kg. The microsomes of the murine livers were isolated by differential centrifugation, and the content of total cytochrome P-450 in the microsomes was measured based on their CO spectra. When the fluorocarbon emulsion was added to the microsomal membranes, an enzyme-substrate complex, i.e., fully fluorinated organic compound-cytochrome P-450, was observed to form. The spectral characteristics of the PFOB-cytochrome P-450 complex were similar to that of the complex perfluorodecalin-cytochrome P-450. Injection of the PFOB emulsion into the rats resulted in a 20 percent decrease in the amount of cytochrome P-450 in their hepatic microsomes. An analysis of the kinetics of the formation of Br[.sup]-[/] when reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate [NADPH] is added to the murine microsomes in the presence of a PFOB emulsion established that the concentration of free Br[.sup]-[/] in the study specimens is 1-2 ï¿½M higher than in control specimens. These findings were taken as unequivocal confirmation of the possibility of NADPH-dependent liberation of Br[.sup]-[/] from PFOB in the presence of microsomal membranes. The experiments on induction of microsomal monoxygenase were interpreted as confirmation of the fact that PFOB is a much weaker inducer of the ``phenobarbital'' isoforms of cytochrome P-450 II B[.sup]1[/]/B[.sub]2[/] than the classic fluorocarbon inducer of cytochrome P-450 (i.e., perfluorodecalin) is. It was hypothesized that the anomalous cytochrome P-450-inducing properties of PFOB may be linked to its ability to be metabolized by hepatic microsomal monoxygenase. For this reason it was concluded that the generally accepted opinion regarding the inertness and invariance in the body of organoperfluoro compounds containing both heteroatoms (N, O, H, etc.) and double bonds needs additional verification. This study was said to be the first successful demonstration of the fact that enzyme systems of a living organism are capable of causing the destruction of fully fluorinated organic compounds.
