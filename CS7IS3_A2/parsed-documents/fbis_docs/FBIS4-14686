It is a matter precisely of items of military equipment and not of a list of Russian-made armaments, as reported by the Japanese ASAHI newspaper. Contrary to that newspaper's claims, the embassy staff members were not arrested, since they enjoy diplomatic immunity. As far as the essence of the incident is concerned, a statement is expected on the matter within the next few days from the public relations center of the Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service.
