The trawlers were fishing illegally in the Argentine exclusive economic zone, without the appropriate authorization. The Coast Guard cutter "Mantilla" yesterday discovered a foreign trawler fishing near the port of Quequen. Upon boarding the trawler, Coast Guard personnel confirmed the existence of 79 metric tons of squid, hake, and codfish in the trawler's hold and processing line. Shortly thereafter, the same Coast Guard cutter discovered another trawler that had already caught 146 metric tons of squid and rays. Both trawlers were captured for violating the National Fishing Law, and were escorted to the port of Quequen where the appropriate proceedings were conducted.
