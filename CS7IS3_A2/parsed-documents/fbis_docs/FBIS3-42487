There is so much behind these words! The fleet has rich traditions, and a heroic past. The whole world knows of the heroism of Black Sea Fleet seamen in the difficult war years. But today the fleet is going through difficult times. The ships are growing old, and there are no new ones to replace them. The seamen take fewer long cruises. The hopes and dreams of those who decided long ago, in childhood, to tie their life to the sea are vanishing. Many officers who see no future in the service are retiring into the reserves. Often with heavy hearts, in anger. The delays in dividing up the fleet and the political squabbles around it have had a negative effect on the skills of Black Sea Fleet seamen. What are Black Sea Fleet seamen doing in this complex situation? It's not an idle question--many are asking it. Getting ahead of ourselves a little, we should note that in the last training year the Black Sea Fleet seamen successfully endured some difficult trials. They have something to be proud about. They have created a good foundation in their training. When compared with the Northern, Pacific and Baltic fleets, the Black Sea Fleet is among the best in terms of the results of its combat training. Black Sea Fleet seamen have won six prizes in contests of naval championship. [Chumak] Petr Grigoryevich, does this mean that there are grounds for optimism? Judging from last year's training results and from the way the new stage in the combat training system has begun, it might be said that personnel of the fleet's ships and units are ready to carry out the most complex missions. I would like to know your opinion in this regard. [Svyatashov] I'm pleased that winter training basically began in organized fashion in the fleet. Commanders, staffs, staff and division specialists, and instructors gave some thought to their work ahead of time, and creatively planned the training. They took account of the situation and the general training level of their students. Instructors thoughtfully utilized experience accumulated last year in their practical training. Trainers and mockups are being used to teach the seamen. Lessons are also conducted at duty stations. Rather than playing the role of testers, officers who attend the lessons provide practical assistance to the young instructors. Training in classrooms and offices has become more active. This is an indication that many students are striving to become rated specialists. There has been a noticeable improvement in the training of young seamen as well. They are striving to make it to sea aboard warships faster. This fast start in winter training will doubtlessly have an effect on the skills of all specialists. Our hope is that this year ships will go to sea more often, and carry out planned missions. But for now let's return to the training results for the past training year. The fleet took second place in the navy. The tasks imposed on the ship crews and unit personnel were completed in full. Practice missile, artillery and torpedo firings at sea were successful. Commanders sought the initiative and avoided stereotypy in fluid, dynamic combat. The main goal was to make the people proficient, to prepare for them for action in novel situations. In this regard I would like to make special mention of the crews of the BPK [large ASW ship] "Kerch", the SKR [guided missile cruiser] "Razitelnyy" and the SKR "Ladnyy", which participated in an exercise in the Mediterranean Sea in a KPUG [ship hunter-killer group]. ASW seamen displayed a high class of work in their hunt. Black Sea Fleet seamen worked quite competently in their hunting efforts during a joint exercise with an American ship as well. They obtained good combat experience in the Mediterranean Sea, and gained confidence. Mention should be made of the crews of other warships, as well as of vessels of the auxiliary fleet, which carried out their tasks. [Chumak] In addition to planned training measures, the fleet also carried out special missions. For example, evacuation of refugees from the Caucasus. On some occasions the Black Sea Fleet seamen risked their own lives to rescue children, casualties and the families of servicemen. Setting off aboard their ships to the Georgian coast, to Poti, the seamen knew that anything could happen. Were there any who displayed cowardice, who refused to go to sea? [Svyatashov] No. The seamen knew that many people in the Caucasus were in difficulty, and they went to the region of misfortune to help them. The crews of BDK-69, the BDK [large amphibious warfare ship] "Konstantin Olshanskiy", and of other warships and auxiliary vessels in the fleet displayed real heroism and courage in rescuing the peaceful inhabitants. During these operations the forces were competently led by Rear-Admiral N. Mikhalchenko, Captain 1st Rank V. Maksimov and other experienced commanders. The fleet's assault forces accumulated rich experience in "hot spots." This experience is being analyzed and generalized. It would be nice if this kind of thing didn't happen again. But if difficulties once again arise in some region, Black Sea Fleet seamen will always be ready to render peaceful assistance. [Chumak] Comrade Vice-Admiral, which military collectives especially pleased the fleet command with high indicators in combat training despite the complexities of last year? [Svyatashov] There are many such combined units, units and ships. Our submariners distinguished themselves: Participating in the naval championships, a KPUG consisting of the BPK "Kerch", the SKR "Ladnyy" and the SKR "Skoryy" won a prize in missile launching. We were also pleased with submariners under combined unit commander Rear-Admiral F. Pogorelov. They had it rough in their training and their cruises. Captain 2d Rank K. Vasiltsev's crew distinguished itself. The submariners won the navy's perpetual prize for the second time in succession. As always, the offshore defense unit performed at its best. Crews of minesweepers, particularly of the MTShch "Signalshik", the MTShch "Zenitchik" and the MTShch "Dizelist", confirmed their high class rating in their qualifying exercises. And an honorary prize was deservedly presented to the best ships in the beginning of the new training year. Captain 2d Rank M. Spalek and captains 3d rank O. Vatin and S. Pyatnichuk competently organized the training process, and displayed creativity and initiative in exercises. They earned their training results. The collectives in which rear-admirals A. Tsubin, A. Aladkin and A. Grinko, captains 1st rank N. Martynov, Yu. Kostyrko, N. Mikheyev, S. Umnov and V. Krikunov, Captain 2d Rank V. Belenko and Lieutenant Colonel A. Smolyak serve faced very important missions. Despite everything, these leaders competently organized the people in complex conditions to carry out their assigned missions. Good organization of service, exactingness, and control over execution promoted this success. By the way, submariners, ASW specialists, boatmen, signalmen and other fleet specialists have also begun the winter training period aggressively. [Chumak] How did the fleet's Rear Services do last year? [Svyatashov] Rear-Admiral Bogdanov and his aides approached their work competently and creatively. Potatoes and vegetables were procured and delivered to fleet storage depots in time. Suppliers had to work a great deal in fall in order to procure everything planned for the seamen. The storage depots contain more than enough, and that's gratifying. This is the result of the fact that the fleet's rear services oriented themselves promptly in the complex situation, and correctly organized their work. Seamen have high quality food, and warrant officers and officers will receive their food rations, which is important these days. [Chumak] Petr Grigoryevich, many difficulties arose in the course of training and during work on planned missions, constraining the people's initiative and sometimes slowing progress down. What troubled Black Sea Fleet seamen the most? [Svyatashov] First of all, the uncertainty. People were perpetually keyed up, in anticipation of changes. But politicians are in no hurry. As for what awaits Black Sea Fleet seamen tomorrow, no one can clearly say. However, we firmly believe that the fleet problem will be resolved reasonably. Last year there were cases in which training measures had to be postponed at the fault of certain executives. And there was stereotypy in some practice firings as well. Another troubling thing is that certain subunit commanders, especially junior officers, have lost interest in service, and consequently they've left seaman training to its own devices. As a result the number of highly qualified specialists decreased aboard a number of ships. Poor training of seamen and petty officers led in turn to breakdown of equipment and weapons. The shortcomings were especially great in this regard in the combined unit under Read Admiral O. Sviridov. Nor can we condone cases of poor organization of alert duty and watches, or the absence of proper order. Things like this led to disciplinary violations, and to improper mutual relations, with serious consequences. This training year, like the last, will not be easy for Black Sea Fleet seamen. Many unsolved problems are getting worse. But we always need to remember that we are military people. And our most important objective is to become masters of our work, to be prepared, if necessary, to carry out any mission. Therefore we need to improve the quality of special training. And this quality will depend in many ways on the training provided to instructors. However, as the first inspections showed, there are many passive officers among them, who have stopped improving themselves. What could they teach subordinates? Nothing. Staff workers need to keep questions of this kind under special scrutiny. Their demandingness and their interested assistance will help to upgrade the quality of training in the Black Sea Fleet. We can't allow seamen to be taken away from their training, or to waste their time. Much in the course of planned measures depends on commanders. Where they continually raise the level of technical training, display aggressiveness and strive for novelty and initiative, order will necessarily be better and organization and performance will be higher. But these are precisely the qualities that some executives lack. They promise many things, but their results are meager. This is why, as an example, repair training of specialists has declined. Commanders and staff officers need to keep a constant eye on issues like accident-free ship navigation, damage control, injuries, fire and explosion safety, the physical fitness of seamen and other problems in the course of winter training. I would like to make special mention of deputy commanders for personnel. They unite the collectives, and do much to help young seamen mature and to maintain glorious fleet traditions. Many fabulous educators who enjoy respect among the people serve aboard ships. They are the ones who are sought out for help and advice. Discipline has risen and order has become firmer aboard ships owing to many of them. The crews are living in friendship. The seamen are happy to serve. However, it would be wrong to assert that things are like this everywhere. Some educators were put in their important positions by accident. They don't know how to work with people, and they don't understand their needs. Such educators can only do harm to the collectives. Educational work is especially poorly organized in the combined unit in which Captain 1st Rank G. Chernokhlebov serves, and aboard the PSK "Apsheron". [Chumak] There have been complaints that some officers, warrant officers and civilian employees of the fleet have not received their pay and wages for November, December and January. How are these people to live? And why did this happen? [Svyatashov] I know that the Russian Ministry of Defense has transferred funds to the fleet. But the fact is that not all Ukrainian banks are working efficiently. That's were the holdup in pay is. But I think that his matter will soon be resolved. [Chumak] Petr Grigoryevich, what would you wish Black Sea Fleet seamen in conclusion? [Svyatashov] That they gather up their endurance, and do their work honorably. It is the hope of all of us that this year the fate of the Black Sea Fleet will finally be resolved. And then all of us would see that we have a future. Officers, warrant officers and seamen will be able to serve in peace. And one other thing--we all need to live in peace and friendship. There are some people who are trying to start fights between our Slavic peoples. But this cannot be. Black Sea Fleet seamen have stood, and will continue to stand guard over the southern borders of CIS countries. [Chumak] Thank you for the interview.
