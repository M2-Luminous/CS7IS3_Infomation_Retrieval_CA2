FR940110-1-00025 FR940110-1-00004 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Introduction The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) of the Department of Justice (DOJ) is required by law to charge fees to the users of its services. Such fees presently comprise about 36 percent of the INS budget. There are four fee accounts, and the fees which are collected in each account are used to fund specific services. The four fee accounts are the Immigration Examinations Fee Account, the Immigration User Fee Account, the Land Border Inspection Fee Account, and the Legalization Fee Account. Because the fees in each of these accounts are designed to recover the costs which are incurred to provide specific services, they must be reviewed regularly and adjusted as costs change or more precise cost determination processes become available. This rule proposes to modify the examinations fee schedule. The Immigration Examinations Fee Account (Examinations Fee Account) provides funds for immigration adjudication and naturalization services. It is funded by a total of 32 separate fees for processing the various applications used by INS. Examples include applications for permanent resident status, petitions for relatives, employment authorization applications, reentry permits, and extensions of temporary stay. The separate fees currently range from $30 to $140. To cover the costs of providing adjudication and naturalization services, it has been determined that a fee increase of 7.5 percent is needed. This increase reflects inflation since the last general fee increase in April 1991, the assignment of certain additional costs to the Examinations Fee Account for services that support adjudications and naturalization functions, and the costs of investments to improve services to users. This proposed rule would adjust the current fee schedule by 7.5 percent. A. Refining the Fee Development Process INS has initiated a process of continuous improvement in the management of the finances of the fee accounts and the development of fee schedules. Areas that are being addressed over a projected multi-year time horizon include: Identifying the INS resources consumed in providing services to our customers which by law must be recovered through fee revenues; refining definitions of direct and indirect costs; and refining cost measurement systems, in concert with wider Department of Justice initiatives to improve financial management information systems. Of necessity, to ensure the availability of necessary funds for maintaining operations, the first phase of this effort has been identification of INS resource use that must be recovered through fees. Prior to 1992, INS had not analyzed rigorously the full extent of its costs related to fee-supported services. In 1992, INS undertook a comprehensive review of the work that should properly be charged to fee accounts in order to meet statutory requirements. Extensive information gathering and analysis were performed as part of this effort. The aggregate cost of the work in support of the Examinations Fee Account was computed based on the budget for fiscal year 1993 and the estimated budget for fiscal year 1994. This information was used to compute the percentage revenue increase required to cover the costs, and that percentage, with limited exceptions, was applied to the existing fee schedule that has been in place since 1991 to arrive at the proposed fees, through the steps explained in this proposed rule. Instead of using the existing fee schedule as a base for the percentage increases, INS also considered whether it would have been feasible to base the proposed fees on 1992 cost measurements. INS rejected this approach because of problems with 1992 data caused by the transition to a more automated system of productivity measurement. Future fee adjustments will reflect efforts to refine direct and indirect cost definitions and measurements, and will address alternative approaches to the allocation of indirect costs among applicants for services. At this time, however, the current fee schedule, with the adjustments specifically identified below, reflects the best available comprehensive data on service costs, and was therefore judged to be the soundest foundation for computing the proposed fee schedules for fiscal year 1994. II. Directives and Guidelines INS's examinations fees have been designed in accordance with legislation, guidance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department, and accepted principles of ratemaking in regulated public and commercial enterprises. The overall principle employed is one of cost causation, which means the fees are designed to cover the costs associated with providing the services funded through the Examinations Fee Account.
