"From the point of view of Hong Kong people, it's better for Deng to go earlier than later," said Edward Chen, who sits on the 15-member Executive Council, Hong Kong's cabinet. Speaking at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan, Chen likened Deng's last years to the final period of a dynasty, with government decisions paralyzed due to the unclear outcome from an anticipated power change. "Nobody will dare make major decisions, because if you did something wrong, it will be disastrous and nobody will want to take this responsibility," Chen said. He dismissed scenarios predicting an outbreak of violence or the country's disintegration should the mastermind of China's opening policy and market reforms die. Deng, who will be 90 in August, has frequently been rumored seriously ill or dead and seemed frail during his last televised public appearance during the Chinese new year festival in February. "Power struggle is inevitable, but I don't think there will be huge bloodshed after Deng," he said. With the purging of second-generation politicians such as reformer Zhao Ziyang, and the current leading trio of President Jiang Zemin, Prime Minister Li Peng and economic czar Zhu Rongji being "too old," China's old guard will eventually be succeeded by leaders emerging from the fourth generation, Chen predicted. These leaders in their 50s can be trusted because they have lived through the "bitter experience" of the Cultural Revolution, but have also experienced 15 years of opening policy, he said. Chen, who is also a professor of economics, painted a bright picture for China's future, saying there is no doubt the country will become an engine for growth for the world economy, overtaking the United States in terms of gross national product in 2010. The "rising star" among China's booming regions is the Yangze River [Chang Jiang] valley, stretching from western Sichuan Province to Shanghai on the coast, because it offers "tremendous investment opportunities" with its concentration of heavy and military industries, he said. He urged foreign investors to look into the service sector, which will further open up in line with Beijing's bid for reentry into the GATT world trade system, he said. With a population of 1.2 billion and an increasingly well-off middle class, China constitutes a "gold mine" for the financial and insurance business, he said. Japanese investors should also be aware that China is no longer a market for cheap mass products. "You have to aim at the top end of the market," Chen said. China is a large investor abroad and a major recipient of foreign investment, which reached 90 billion to 130 billion Hong Kong dollars in 1993, Chen said. The nation is "too integrated in the world economy" to make an about-face in its economic policy, he added. "There is no way that the open-door policy will be reverted," Chen said. "I think Hong Kong will be all right after 1997."
