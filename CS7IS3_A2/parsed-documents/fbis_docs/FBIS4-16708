The decree says that while Russian Federation laws do not work in the state of emergency zone, the rights of Russian citizens are being trampled, and the Provisional Administration has shown that it is completely incapable of stabilizing the situation. Ingushetia's parliament sees the suspension of local bodies of power of North Ossetia in Prigorodnyy Rayon and the introduction of direct federal rule on this territory as the only way out of the crisis. Ingushetia's parliament has forwarded to the Russian Federation president a special statement to this effect. [passage omitted]
