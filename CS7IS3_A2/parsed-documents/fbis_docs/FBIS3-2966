Cheng An-kuo, the MAC's director of Hong Kong and Macao affairs, made the comment at a hearing sponsored by Legislator Parris Chang in the Legislative Yuan on the future course of the government's Hong Kong and Macao policy in view of recent developments there. Chang, a scholar-turned-politican, invited government officials and academics to give their views during the hearing. Cheng, elaborating on the just-announced draft of the statute governing relations with Hong Kong and Macao, said that Taiwan will still consider the colonies as "special areas" rather than as Mainland Chinese territory after the colonies revert to Mainland Chinese rule, and will not consider links with them to constitute "direct" links with Mainland China. He noted that all Taiwan Government offices in Hong Kong and Macao would continue to operate on a civilian basis after the handover, and said that the Taiwan-Hong Kong and Taiwan-Macao relationships would continue much the same way as before. He added that the rights of Taiwan residents living in the colonies would be fully protected. On whether Beijing would try to seize Taiwan Government property in Hong Kong and Macao after 1997 and 1999, Cheng said that he could not rule out that possibility, and said that Taiwan has asked for legal help to safeguard against such an exigency.
