It would seem that this is a completely sensible and well considered approach: New rights entail new obligations. Indeed, when matters take such a turn, the center begins to have fewer headaches regarding what, how and in what amounts to finance this or that in Taldom or Kostroma. But in practice, as often happens, a good idea for some reason unfailingly takes a negative turn. The authorities in small cities and settlements, instead of an easing of the federal tax burden, which permitted them to hope for resolution of many local issues, acquired a whole pile of new problems without any financial levers whatsoever. Figuratively speaking, it was proposed to the local authorities that they swim a hundred meters but it had been forgotten to untie their hands first. Such are the basic themes in the open letter sent to the leadership of the country by the chairman of the Association of Heads of City and Regional Administrations of the Moscow Oblast Roman Popkovich. It is reported in the letter, in particular, that the change in the norm for payments to local budgets from various kinds of taxes, designated by the President's December edicts, is leading to a situation where even such a rich oblast as the Moscow Oblast, which gives the federal treasury almost half of its income, cannot now get along without substantial subsidies. Moscow Oblast's budget deficit under the new normative payments, according to R. Popkovich, will increase in 1994 by at least one trillion rubles. This will make it impossible to finance departmental residential housing and social cultural-facilities that have been transferred since January of this year to municipal ownership. Only retention of differentiated norms for payments from federal taxes into the budgets of the regions, in the opinion of the members of the association, can provide a way out of the situation that has been created. For the Moscow oblast, these payments should be no less than 75 percent with respect to the value added tax (VAT) and a full 100 percent with respect to the individual income tax. A letter from representatives of the executive authorities of the Moscow region, which is filled with disconcerting forecasts, was written immediately after the draft of the federal budget, prepared by the Ministry of Finance, had become public. According to the letter, almost 13.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) is allocated for support of the territories. This is a gigantic sum, if one takes into account that the slogan of the federalization of the budget, as has already been stated many times, was supposed to become the fundamental watchword of the government in 1994. In other words, the local authorities are to rely on their own financial resources. But for many regions, these resources, as is rapidly becoming clear, are catastrophically insufficient. Thus, according to data for January to November 1993, the federal budget transferred 2.4 trillion rubles to territorial budgets on the basis of mutual settlements, 967 billion rubles in the form of subventions, and--to certain regions for resolving "burning" issues--103 billion rubles in the form of short-term loans. In the fourth quarter, the volume of funds allocated from the center sharply increased, totalling 2.6 billion rubles [as published], or 11.7 percent, of the total expenditures of the Russian budget. But how can the level of social security for the population of the country be effectively equalized if certain subjects of the federation (Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, Chechnya) have directed practically all taxes they have collected into the budgets of their own territories. Last year, for example, 100 percent of the profits tax, 99 percent of the VAT, and 94 percent of excise taxes were transferred to the budget of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutiya). In the Republic of Karelia, the corresponding transfers to the budget of the territory were 96 percent, 92 percent, and 91 percent. And, nevertheless, this was not enough money. As you know, over 51 percent of the total expenditures from the consolidated budget goes to expenditures from the federal budget. Twenty-eight percent of all revenue was allocated from the resources of the federal budget just for the support of the national economy in 1993. This money is used to help the coal industry, the agro-industrial complex, the defense complex, and many other entities. Will the local authorities be able to cope with the economic and social problems of their own territories? They should be able to. In any case, they say they can. But in order to do so, as a minimum, they require more financial and taxation independence. The federal government, it seems, should provide them such an opportunity. Local leaders will then not have reason to make declarations about the "tax robberies" of the center. Then, perhaps, we will forever rid ourselves of the currently appealing watchword of oblast and regional "independence."
