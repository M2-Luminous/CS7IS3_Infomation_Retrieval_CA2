"Finding a date that makes membership possible by January 1, 1995 while giving all political parties a chance to campaign and spread information about the EU were the decisive factors in selecting the date," Bildt said. "Despite the fact that a June referendum would have been the most direct and best alternative, I have taken into consideration the strong request by the Social Democrats and chosen a later date," he added. The Social Democratic opposition had campaigned for a November referendum.
