The government team formed in August 1992 by Mr. Etienne Tshisekedi, which continues to claim to be the "legitimate government of Zaire," published a communique which "strongly condemns this criminal and neocolonialist intervention," considered "an insult to the whole of Africa." The communique, which described itself as a report "on a cabinet meeting held on 23 June under the chairmanship of Mr. Etienne Tshisekedi, prime minister and head of government," also condemns "the violation of Zairian territory by French troops." Pro-opposition newspapers have condemned the French intervention with very critical headlines and commentaries. Writing under the heading, "The Recolonization Has Begun," LE PHARE lashes out: "Beware of the Somalia and Vietnam Syndromes." LE POTENTIEL reported on its front page: "Invasion of Rwanda From Zaire," while LE TEMPETE DES TROPIQUES calls on the national and international community not to fall into "the trap" (....) of all-out disinformation" and not to see "in French fascism a mission of good omen."
