[Peres] Good morning. [Einstein] Speaking at a news conference in Mexico, you said Israel and Syria were getting closer to opening real negotiations. Is there anything new we do not know about? [Peres] I said that whoever wants to normalize relations must normalize negotiations. I said that the way to begin normalization is through normal negotiations between two peoples. That is what I said. [Einstein] Are there any signs that we may be approaching such a normalization? [Peres] In my visit in the United States I found an atmosphere that still sees a chance to open negotiations, but I did not discern any real signs or changes. [Einstein] Sir, the question of Jerusalem is currently on the agenda: The prime minister summoned special consultations last night to discuss the PLO's demands; we have heard reports that the draft Palestinian constitution Jerusalem is mentioned as the capital of Palestine. Is Israel prepared to make any concessions whatsoever on the question of Jerusalem? [Peres] Not at all, certainly not in the political sphere. We are prepared to meet all the needs of worshipers of all faiths. Politically speaking, however, it is an absolute and irrevocable fact that Jerusalem will remain Israel's united capital under Israeli sovereignty. We will not Berlinize Jerusalem, even if the PLO passes 1,000 resolutions. [Einstein] But Israel has in fact agreed to discuss the status of Jerusalem if the PLO brings it up at the negotiating table, which it is expected to do. [Pees] Discussions can be held on anything. What difference does it make? It will not change our positions. [Einstein] Is the PLO aware of our categorical position? [Peres] Definitely yes, there is no doubt about it. [Einstein] According to the current scenario, the question of Jerusalem is expected to be the last item on the agenda in the discussions on the permanent arrangement in the territories. [Peres] We have yet quite a few years ahead of us, and there is no need to press the issue. [Einstein] Will our position then be as categorical as it is today? [Peres] It will remain unchanged, because there is no need for any change. Jerusalem was never an Arab capital, while the Jewish people never had any capital other than Jerusalem. [Einstein] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, thank you very much. [Peres] You are welcome. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 27 May adds: "Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres hailed Britain's decision to call off the arms embargo on Israel."]
