Finance Ministry Legal Adviser Rafael Silva said only the Supreme Court of Justice can abolish the IVA law, and therefore it cannot be suspended by a judge, because this would be unconstitutional. He added that the legal basis for the writ of amparo is not clear, because it does not specify what right was violated and places the state in a defenseless legal position [indefension judicial]. Furthermore, the writ of amparo demands from the government additional information on the implementation of the IVA -- a measure that is not required when a law is implemented. He stressed that this tax cannot be suspended. [Begin Silva recording] The Finance Ministry has no legal authority and no legal instrument enabling it to suspend the implementation of a law. We cannot do that. In any event, what the Finance Ministry could probably do after being legally notified of the decision is to instruct customs not to charge the IVA, or not collect the IVA, which is the only tributary obligation this would entail for the Finance Ministry. [end recording] The Finance Ministry has not taken any action against the judge who issued a ruling eliminating the IVA. Nevertheless, Finance Minister Adviser Alcides Villalba has requested his dismissal.
