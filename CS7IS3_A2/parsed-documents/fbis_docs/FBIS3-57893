U.S. Role in Balkans Favored In the 12 December Athens weekly TO VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS, Nikos Marakis reports on the views of the Greek Government and the opposition regarding the role the United States and the European Union (EU) should play in the Balkans. In a departure from past policy, Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou now believes that Greek interests in the Balkans and elsewhere are served "almost exclusively" by a complete harmonization of Greek and U.S. foreign policy. This view, Marakis says, is shared by Minister of Foreign Affairs Karolos Papoulias and Minister of Defense Yerasimos Arsenis. Marakis also writes about the discussion of the issue within the opposition New Democracy (ND). Party luminary Andreas Andrianopoulos believes that Washington, to establish "control" over the southern Balkans, will promote the establishment of a new Yugoslav federation under Serbian hegemony including the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). According to Marakis, Andrianopoulos worries that aligning Greek policy too closely with that of the United States might involve the country in a potentially "explosive" contest for influence in the Balkans, pitting France and Germany against the United States. Another ND luminary, Yeoryios Souflias, argues that Greece should follow its natural pro-European orientation and simultaneously maintain good relations with the United States, Marakis writes. A contrasting view is held by ND official and former Minister of Defense Ioannis Varvitsiotis who, according to Marakis, believes that the U.S. reaction to former Prime Minister Konstandinos Mitsotakis' Balkans policy was so negative that Washington succeeded in engineering the fall of the Mitsotakis government. Varvitsiotis represents an "anti-Atlantic" faction in the ND which includes almost all Eurodeputies and deputies from areas favored by EU grants, Marakis writes. FYROM Recognition by European Countries Viewed The decision by six European countries to establish diplomatic relations with the FYROM stems from their disdain for Greek demands, Thodhoros Rousopoulos writes in the 19 December Athens KIRIAKATIKI ELEVTHEROTIPIA. Even Sweden and Finland, whose application for European Union membership will be reviewed during the Greek EU presidency, were part of this initiative. While a Greek veto on membership is unlikely, Rousopoulos cites Ministry of Foreign Affairs sources as saying that Greece may use delaying tactics to postpone entry of these countries in the EU. According to Rousopoulos, however, Greece lacks leverage in the EU, and other member countries are likely to grant diplomatic recognition to the FYROM. `Macedonian Struggle' Lost Rikhardhos Someritis writes in the 5 December TO VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS that Greece has now lost the "Macedonian struggle." Even should the FYROM disintegrate from internal pressures, as some Greeks hope, the result would be a resort to extremist organizations even more dangerous to Greece and to peace in the Balkans, Someritis believes. Probable integration of FYROM territory by Bulgaria, Serbia, or Albania would add to regional instability. The Greek Government should focus on the huge costs of prolonged "Skopje-mania," Someritis warns, noting the courageous policy of reconciliation adopted by South Africa, Israel and the PLO, and others. Dialogue and honest compromise can never be considered "treason," Someritis concludes. Greek Economic Relations With FYROM Stavros Tzimas reports on economic relations between Greece and the FYROM in the 16 December Athens daily TA NEA. A large quantity of goods such as aluminum sheeting, mineral ore, phosphates, lumber, wheat, and oil transit the Greek port of Salonica on the way to Skopje, and about 100 Greek companies have been established in the FYROM. Many have ceased operations due to the political crisis, but some Greek firms continue their activities, Tzimas reports. About a dozen jointly-owned or Greek-owned firms are located in the Monastir area and a Greek entrepreneur is the majority shareholder of a private bank that recently opened in that city. A large Greek clothing company and an export-import firm are presently active in Skopje, while a food-packaging company is said to be ready to start operations again as soon as the crisis ends. Poll on FYROM A brief article in the 19 December TO VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS reports the results of an opinion poll on the "Skopje problem" conducted by the MRB organization in Athens and Salonica between 2 and 12 December with 1,OOO respondents. Opinions were about evenly divided between those (4O.1 percent) who said that the situation has taken a "negative turn" for Greece since the October elections won by PASOK, and those (42.8 percent) who said that it has remained "unchanged."
