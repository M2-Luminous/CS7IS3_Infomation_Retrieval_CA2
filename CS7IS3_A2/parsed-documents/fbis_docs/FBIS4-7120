On Wednesday, Prime Minister Jim Bolger said the government would be prepared to send troops, but there would be no hasty decisions and any contribution to UN forces would be "very modest". Three New Zealand soldiers are currently with UN forces in Bosnia. He told reporters the UN had [word indistinct] for about 10,000 troops from its member nations and so far 3,500 had been committed. "They will be coming back for the remainder of the 10,000. New Zealand has of course been included in that general call for troops." But in Japan, McKinnon told Radio New Zealand he did not support sending New Zealand troops to fight in a civil war in Bosnia, but saw a future role for them as peacekeepers. "I said more than a year ago when this question was raised that I would be very reluctant to recommend to my cabinet colleagues that New Zealand commit itself to another land war in Europe," he said. "We've been there twice in this century, we've taken enormous losses in that time. " McKinnon said he was more concerned about New Zealand playing its role as current president of the UN Security Council to establish a settlement. "Ultimately that may mean a request for peacekeeping troops; that's quite a different exercise," he said. "But (at the moment) we are in between. We haven't got peace; we've still got a civil war there." McKinnon said he believed New Zealanders did not really want to see New Zealand troops there fighting a war. New Zealand suffered heavy casualites during both world wars this century.
