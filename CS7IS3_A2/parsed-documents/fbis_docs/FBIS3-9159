The meeting at the Russian Embassy here, organised by Russia's special envoy to ex-Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin in coordination with U.S. officials, is the first of its kind to be held in the Croatian capital under the auspices of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR). The two sides last year held several similar meetings in Norway and Austria -- with the Serbs demanding neutral territory for the talks -- but without success because of Serb insistence on autonomy for the Serb-dominated Krajina region which they have proclaimed an independent "republic." John Mills, the spokesman for the international peace conference on former Yugoslavia, told journalists the discussions would focus on "a comprehensive ceasefire and separation of forces" of the two factions. The Serbs of Krajina occupy a quarter of Croatian territory, and Mills acknowledged that separating the two forces was a "very difficult problem." Zagreb has until now opposed any withdrawal of Croatian forces across a demarcation line, which would imply UN involvement, on the ground that this would undermine Croatia's sovereignty. Croatian President Franjo Tudjman has ruled out any kind of "enlarged autonomy" for the separatist Serbs and is demanding the unconditional return to Croatia of Krajina, a UN protected area. Last week he asked the UN Security Council to authorise the use of force to disarm the rebels and he is insisting that the UN peacekeepers, whose mandate for operations in Croatia is up for renewal at the end of March, maintain strict control of the border. Churkin has worked closely with his White House counterpart Charles Redman, who helped broker the Croat-Moslem agreement on a federation in Bosnia that was sealed in Washington on Friday. But further progress in efforts to end more than two years of fighting in former Yugoslavia now depends on a solution to the "Serb question". "The first thing to do is to sign a very solid document, which will ensure that fighting will not return in and around" the Krajina region, Churkin said last week following talks in Zagreb and Belgrade which laid the ground for Tuesday's meeting. Two international mediators, Norwegian ambassador Kai Aide, representing the United Nations, and his German counterpart, Gert Ahrens, representing the European Union, were attending the meeting here Tuesday along with U.S. Ambassador Peter Galbraith. Representing the Croatian delegation were Hrvoje Sarinic, head of the secret police and liaison officer with the UNPROFOR, and Slavko Degoricija. The separatists were represented by Rear Admiral Dusan Rakic, who is the rebel Serbs "defence minister", Slobodan Jarcevic, the "foreign minister" and Mile Novakovic, in charge of security. Croatian intellectuals, opposed to any dialogue with the Serbs who they consider to be war criminals, have called a protest demonstration in central Zagreb later in the day.
