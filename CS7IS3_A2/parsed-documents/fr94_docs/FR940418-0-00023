FR940418-0-00023 FR940418-0-00007 EPA is approving subsections 204&hyph;40(e) of ``Reports, Sampling and Analysis of Waste Fuels A and B,'' and 206&hyph;25(c) of ``Test Methods.'' However, these provisions permit the Commissioner to approve alternate requirements that are not incorporated in the SIP. Any variances adopted pursuant to these subsections become applicable only if approved by EPA. EPA's approval of the SIP revision, specifically the lower sulfur in fuel oil limitations and modeling demonstration for St. Croix included in the PSD permit for VIWAPA, rectify the SIP inadequacy to achieve and maintain the primary NAAQS for sulfur dioxide identified in the August 12, 1986 letter sent to the Governor of the Virgin Islands. This notice is issued as required by section 110 of the Act. The Regional Administrator's decision regarding the approval of this plan revision is based on its meeting the requirements of section 110 of the Act and 40 CFR part 51. Nothing in this rule should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for a revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. This rule makes final the action proposed at 54 FR 51303, December 14, 1989. As noted elsewhere in this notice, EPA received no adverse public comments on the proposed rule. As a direct result, the Regional Administrator has reclassified this rule from Table 1 to Table 2 under the processing procedures established at 54 FR 2214, January 19, 1989. EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The Office of Management and Budget has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of this rule must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit within 60 days from date of publication. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This rule may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See 307(b)(2).)
