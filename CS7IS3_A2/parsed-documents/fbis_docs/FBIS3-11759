Following a tight agenda and after opening the plenary session of the IDB's Eighth Central America, Belize, and Panama Governors Meeting, Iglesias went to the presidential palace where he stated the Nicaraguan economic program must be made flexible to adjust to the nation's needs. Iglesias was referring to the upcoming signing of the so-called ESAF [Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility] with the IMF. The agriculture sector will receive $16 million to increase the production of basic agricultural products for local consumption and exports. Microindustry businessmen will be granted $23.6 million from the loan. Shortly after signing the loan, Iglesias said: "These credits are part of our conviction that Nicaragua's development is on the right road." He said: "I believe the most difficult part of the adjustment process is behind; it is very important that organizations like ours support the nation's development now." Iglesias emphasized that our people have gone through many years of adjustments; now the true battle for production and growth starts. He indicated that the IDB believes it is possible to realize a development program in Nicaragua. This financial institution has approved approximately $400 million in credits in the past three years. Economy Minister Pablo Pereira reported that the program to support small-scale industry is being transformed from a simple ministry program to a mixed institute in which private and public sectors as well as the banks will participate. Foreign Cooperation Minister Erwin Kruger said this week was outstanding after prestigious personalities in the financial and political sector concluded their visits here. Yesterday, Kruger signed an exchange of notes with Kuniji Suzuki, charge d'affairs of the Japanese Embassy, for an $8.5 million donation to purchase agriculture and industrial supplies. The IDB president continued his agenda today by holding a work meeting with the Economic Cabinet. He also met with ministers of the social sector: Health, Social Action, and Emergency Social Funds. A group of advisers and Joel Riley, IDB representative in Nicaragua, accompany Iglesias at these meetings. At the meeting with the economic and social team, all matters relating to the loans the IDB approved for the next four years are being discussed. Yesterday, Iglesias met with Legislative Assembly President Luis Humberto Guzman and Sandinist National Liberation Front leaders.
