Ildiko Nagy reports from Bratislava on the details: [Begin Nagy recording] It lays down close political cooperation, the setting up of joint bodies, a dual election coalition, and further expansion with a third partner. The two sides also agreed that they would begin discussions soon with the Hungarian Civic Party on expanding the dual coalition into a triple one. In answer to a question from Hungarian radio's correspondent [Nagy], Bela Bugar, chairman of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement, said he was satisfied with the result because they managed to achieve what the movement's national executive asked the negotiating delegation to do: to try to form a triple coalition. The two partners have already agreed on the conditions for this; however, this will be made public only after the dual coalition agreement is signed next week. The documents adopted at the 8 January 1994 Komarno rally constitute the basis of the agreement. If these are acceptable to the third party--that is, the Hungarian Civic Party--then, in the view of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement chairman, they will succeed in forming a triple election alliance.
