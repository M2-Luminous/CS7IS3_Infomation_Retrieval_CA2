Kursk residents learned about his arrival beforehand. Local reports said that Rutskoy intends to visit Kursk to see his mother who will be celebrating her birthday. However, Rutskoy is not the kind of a man to restrict his visit by ties of kinship only. The first thing he did upon arrival was to meet workers of the "Khimvolokno" joint stock society, which was followed by a series of other meetings, prompting his political opponents to declare that Rutskoy has begun his "election marathon". Talking to his fellow countrymen, Rutskoy declared that he had not betrayed the president. "I have been and continue to defend the interests of the people who were driven to poverty." he said. In Rutskoy's opinion, the Constitution, parliament and power in the country are invalid, since no one repealed a decision of the Constitutional Court, a law on a referendum and a law on elections and a resolution adopted by the Congress of Russian People's Deputies. When asked about the former socialist system in the Soviet Union, Rutskoy said directly that "what was called socialism in this country was not socialism at all. We must cast aside all `ism' suffixes and look for another way," he said. Rutskoy unveiled his plans which were already outlined in appeals circulated before the beginning of his meetings with the people. He said that at first, it is necessary to unite all social-patriotic forces of the "Derzhava" movement in order to be well-prepared for the forthcoming presidential elections and etc. In conclusion, Rutskoy promised to create civilized society and guarantee life worthy of every citizen if the Derzhava movement won the forthcoming elections. However, Rutskoy never mentioned that he intends to run for the presidency.
