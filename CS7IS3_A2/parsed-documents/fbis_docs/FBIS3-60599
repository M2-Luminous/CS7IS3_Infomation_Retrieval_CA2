But the euphoria which greeted the event is now long forgotten. The inherited weight of the Communist system has crushed the enthusiasm of the young American or Canadian graduates -- the grandchildren of Ukrainian immigrants -- who returned to the land of their ancestors to help the government in Kiev to build a new society. Most of them have now made the return trip back across the Atlantic, such as the senior manager with the Bank of Boston who gave up a very comfortable salary to take up the post of deputy governor of the new central bank of Ukraine. After more than two years of independence, the Ukraine has still not managed to be rid of its past as a formerly model Soviet province and to set a new path once and for all, in economic and political terms. With respect to the economy, the strategy pursued by President Kravchuk -- democratically elected in December 1991 with 62 percent of the votes -- , a mixture of disorganized liberalization and steps backwards toward a planned economy, has led to an unprecedented social bankruptcy. Inflation is verging on 2,000 percent; deprived of raw materials, firms are simply ticking over; barter has become the principal medium of exchange; wages have failed to keep pace with prices; people survive only thanks to support within the family and the black market. The "karbovanetz", the money issued two years ago in order to leave the rouble zone, has lost more than 30 times its value against the Russian currency -- which itself is hardly known for its stability. More than anything else, the Ukraine suffers from its dependency on Russia for energy supplies. The time when oil and natural gas were virtually free is well and truly past. Moscow now demands payment in hard currency at worldwide oil markets. The energy bill alone absorbs 80 percent of the Ukraine's export revenue. The population has already been informed that it should not expect their apartments to be heated above 10 degrees centigrade this winter. Politically, the central authority is relatively stable, thanks to President Kravchuk's skills as a political maneuverer. A former Soviet apparatchik, he has succeeded in steering a course avoiding both the pitfalls of super-nationalism and communist nostalgia. But on the international stage, the Ukraine is in the process of alienating itself from the powers which were most favorably disposed to this former Soviet province. They are concerned by Kiev's prevarication in the matter of nuclear disarmament. [Girard] On 19 November the Ukrainian parliament only voted for a partial ratification of the START 1 Treaty. During a previous interview, in January 1992, you told me that the Ukraine would be rid of all its nuclear weapons by December 1994. What is the situation regrading your country's denuclearization? [Kravchuk] It is true, at the time I told you that the Ukraine intended to become a non-nuclear state. I maintain this commitment. The Ukraine must pursue its policy of denuclearization. Because I remain convinced that there is no other solution for the Ukraine. The Ukraine is not going to build up its international prestige and reputation by possessing nuclear weapons, but rather by respecting the undertakings it has made and pursuing its policy of denuclearization. Unfortunately, our parliament failed to ratify all the documents I submitted for its signature. Why? First of all, because the world's other nuclear powers did not work together with us during the 12 months which preceded the START 1 agreement. They made no effort to understand our particular situation and the concerns of a parliament with which they established no dialogue. [Girard] What is causing concern to the Ukrainian members of parliament? [Kravchuk] They fear the territorial claims which are being expressed in certain nationalist circles in Russia. Their vote reflects the opinion -- which is widely held here -- that nuclear weapons are a means of protection against threats to the integrity of Ukrainian territory. My opinion has not changed: The country must be denuclearized. But the West should understand that a president does not have the authority to run the legislative at will. Fortunately, the text approved by parliament allows me a certain margin of maneuver in order to continue diplomatic negotiations to achieve the conditions for our denuclearization. I intend to make full use of this. [Girard] If you are a candidate at next June's presidential elections, will you campaign for the Ukraine to be a signatory of the NPT [Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]? [Kravchuk] It all depends on the legislative elections next March. If the new parliament is dominated, as I would like it to be, by a majority of competent men who are able to understand the country's domestic situation and international interests, I will again go on the offensive. I will do everything in my power for the Ukraine to ratify the START treaty, the Lisbon protocol, and the NPT. But as I said, it all depends on the parliament. [Girard] Will you stand in June? [Kravchuk] You will know two months in advance, when the candidates have to register. [Girard] Dismantling nuclear weapons is an expensive process. What are you expecting from the West? [Kravchuk] Reciprocal action. The West must understand that the text approved by parliament does not under any circumstances mean that the denuclearization process has arrived at an impasse. It allows the executives in the different countries to continue to work in concrete terms. Rather than speculating on the consequences of this vote, the West would do better to provide me with technical and financial assistance in order to destroy the nuclear warheads! I am also ready to make a gesture to ease international concern. I am ready to start defusing our nuclear missiles and even to dismantle a part of our warheads, while awaiting the time when we can completely dismantle all our nuclear weapon sites. [Girard] But what specifically do you want from the West? [Kravchuk] Above all else, security guarantees. You must understand the fears of the Ukrainian people. [Girard] Are you hoping for defense agreements, or NATO membership perhaps? [Kravchuk] No, but simply declarations by the major nuclear powers undertaking not to attack the Ukraine and, at the same time, to guarantee its territorial integrity. If we receive such undertakings from Russia, the United States, France and Great Britain, the Ukrainian population will feel they are living in safety. [Girard] On 1 October the five permanent members of the UN security council thanked Russia for its action in maintaining peace in the former USSR. What do you think of this declaration? [Kravchuk] I find it premature to say the least. Without wanting to judge the responsibility of any of the parties in complex ethnic conflicts, the fact is that Russian troops were often locally involved. Before applauding a country as a "peace-keeper" you must first be sure that its action is not in any doubt. [Girard] Are the conditions present for Crimea -- which only left Russia under Khrushchev -- to become a new Abkhaz Republic? After what has happened in Georgia with the Abkhaz minority, do you not fear that Crimea, whose population is mainly Russian, will soon revolt against the Ukraine? [Kravchuk] There are two reasons why the situation in Crimea cannot degenerate into a conflict of the Georgia-Abkhaz type. First of all, there is constant dialogue between Russia and the Ukraine. At the outset, I took the initiative for a negotiated regulation of all questions relating to the status of the Black Sea -- including, above all, Crimea. This initiative was approved by President Yeltsin and the process is functioning. The same applies to the dividing up of the Black Sea fleet. The different ethnic groups who make up the population in this region must understand that the interests of both the Ukraine -- in whose territory it lies -- and of Russia must be taken into account. Secondly, the Ukraine has granted almost total economic and social autonomy to Crimea. We do not dictate terms to Crimea. [Girard] Judging by the meddling of Moscow in the conflicts in Georgia, Azerbaijan, Moldavia, Tajikistan, do you not see a return to Russia's imperial policy? [Kravchuk] I would not like to state in such a direct way that there is a return to Russian imperialism. But it is clear that there does exist a strong heritage of imperial policy as pursued first by the tzars and then by the Soviet Union. We must also remember that there are 25 million Russians living in the territory of the former USSR. It is not realistic to expect Russia to give up all its interests outside its own territory. The United States is able to maintain its interests outside American territory: So why should such a policy be denied to Russia? [Girard] So what is the problem then? [Kravchuk] The problem with the Russians is their way of acting, the methods they use to defend their interests. Admittedly, Russian troops were already on the spot in all the conflicts you have just mentioned. Moscow did not send in troops. These troops were faced with very delicate situations. But I believe that they should refrain from intervening in ethnic conflicts. Good intentions are needed on both sides. The local populations should not be too arrogant with regard to the Russians who have stayed behind and at the same time the Russians should renounce any temptations of imperialistic manipulations. [Girard] How are you going to explain to the Ukrainians that independence has meant heating and electricity cuts in the middle of winter? [Kravchuk] All countries have gone through difficult periods such as we are going through now. Independence is not the prime cause. It is the transition between two different systems of organizing society. You cannot change overnight from a planned, centralized economy to a market economy. We have chosen the Western model in order to obtain a new quality of life. That means breaking with a lot of things. Under the former system, the Ukrainian economy was fully integrated into the Soviet economy, of which it represented 20 percent. The division of labor -- and not regional autonomy -- was the rule in the former USSR. We were specialized in processing industries. Under such conditions, how could we build up an independent economy? [Girard] You have debts of 2.5 billion dollars to Russia. This summer, the Russians had suggested that, in order to repay them, you should sell your share of the Black Sea fleet. Now they are calling for a share in Ukrainian companies. Do you consider these demands to be justified? [Kravchuk] We are going to set up mixed companies with a capital open to foreign investors. It is only natural to have industrial relations with Russia. Our companies need its oil, gas, raw materials. In return, we can offer it our refining and processing capacities. The two countries have everything on which to build mutually rewarding industrial relations.
