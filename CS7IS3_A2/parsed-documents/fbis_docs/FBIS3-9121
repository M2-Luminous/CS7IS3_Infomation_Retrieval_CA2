The team is to complete its work by the end of next week, and then the Council of Ministers is to debate the results of the team's work at its next session, [Solidarity Chairman] Marian Krzaklewski told journalists after his meeting with Prime Minister Pawlak. Chiefs of the trade union's regions and branches are keeping their distance vis-a-vis the results of the talks with the prime minister. They have no intention of ending their protests until such time as the agreements concluded are actually implemented. But they did announce that there will be no "massive strike actions" for the time being. The prime minister also met with chiefs of the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ], Solidarity '80, and the Polish Miners Trade Unions yesterday. Prime Minister Opposed to Grumbling While responding to questions from journalists, the prime minister reported that talks among the experts will not be in the form of bilateral negotiations but will be held as "procedural talks." He also said that the principle of "regarding issues concerning all employees, the government negotiates in a multiparty arrangement--that is, one representing all groups and unions" is in effect. When it comes to bilateral talks, they are only possible when "there are disputes concerning issues that are significant from the standpoints of different parties," and the only goal of such talks is to find a formula of how to solve such disputes within the Trilateral Commission (government-employers-trade unions) or within joint negotiating teams (trade unions, employers, government, and territorial self-governments). Pawlak said that experts for the government and Solidarity are to work out a "mechanism for a referral of those issues to the Trilateral Commission and to the teams, with the goal of discussions involving many parties." "No problems have been solved as yet simply by grumbling or shouting how difficult life is in Poland," Pawlak said. It was provided in a joint communique signed by the trade union's spokesman and the director of the Government's Press Office that the results of talks with the chairmen of Solidarity and other trade unions--and also the results of the experts' work--will be presented to the Council of Ministers for debate. Solidarity Keeping Its Distance Krzaklewski and the prime minister did not talk to journalists together. The chairman of Solidarity left the Office of the Council of Ministers by a back door and came across OPZZ Chairwoman Ewa Spychalska on the way. Rumor has it that he kissed her on the hand and wished her success in her talks with the prime minister. Krzaklewski organized a conference for journalists on "'Solidarity's territory." He reported there that he had agreed with Pawlak that a team of governmental and Solidarity experts will be set up this coming Tuesday [22 March]. The team is supposed to come up with suggestions for legal changes that would be required to implement the demands of Solidarity by the end of the week. Subsequently, the Council of Ministers would approve the team's conclusions at its next session. "Until that time, the trade union will maintain its state of readiness," the chairman of Solidarity said. According to Krzaklewski, the Trilateral Commission is supposed to see to it that the agreement is observed in practice. But the reception of the decisions by chiefs of regions and branches of the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union Solidarity, who were awaiting the results of the talks with the prime minister, was cool. "Pawlak is reported to have said that the demands of Solidarity are justified. We were surprised by that statement, especially because leaders for the Democratic Left Alliance have been saying something quite the opposite," a member of the National Commission [of Solidarity] told RZECZPOSPOLITA. Piotr Zak, the National Commission's press spokesman, told us that, until such time as the experts's decisions are implemented, Solidarity will continue its protests, in accordance with a time schedule that was agreed upon earlier. But, for the time being, there will be no "massive strike actions," as had been announced earlier. Zak refused to comment on a statement by the prime minister that the talks with Solidarity are of a procedural nature. --The prime minister agreed with Spychalska that he will set up either a plenipotentiary or a coordinator for the government for the purpose of "making interministry issues more specific." According to the OPZZ chairwoman, lack of agreement among ministries is an impediment to negotiating social guarantees. --The prime minister agreed with [chief of Solidarity '80] Marian Jurczyk that experts for the trade union and the government will hold a session. [Chief of the Miners Trade Unions] Kisielinski was critical of the strikes by Solidarity. The government is to make efforts to include Solidarity '80 and the Miners Trade Union. [sentence as published] Solidarity '80 is to represent Poland at the International Labor Organization this year. Strikes by Solidarity Yesterday, plants in the Ziemia Sandomierska Region were on strike, among them the Stalowa Wola steelworks and a sulfur mine in Tarnobrzeg. Also, five plants in the Jelenia Gora Region were on strike and some in the Elblag Region. Employees of the Radoskor plant in Radom are still on strike.
