The necessity of adhering to the principle of grasping with both hands in the course of socialist modernization is an important part of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. In Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, there are many important expositions on "grasping with both hands and grasping firmly with both hands." For example: "We are building two civilizations. One is material civilization and the other is spiritual civilization." ("Speak With Facts"); "In the four modernizations, we must grasp with both hands and it will not do to grasp with only one hand. Grasping with both hands means grasping construction with one hand and grasping the legal system with the other." ("Speech at the Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee"); "In a socialist country, a genuine Marxist political party must, after becoming the ruling party, devote itself to developing the productive forces, and on this basis gradually improving the people's living standards. This is the building of material civilization. For quite a long period in the past, we overlooked the development of the productive forces. Therefore, at present, we have to pay special attention to the building of material civilization. At the same time, we also have to build socialist spiritual civilization. The most fundamental thing is to enable the broad masses of people to have communist ideals, morals, and culture, and to observe discipline." ("Build Socialist Material Civilization and Spiritual Civilization"); "It is necessary to persist in grasping with both hands. It is necessary to grasp reform and opening up with one hand and to grasp cracking down on various kinds of criminal activities with the other. Both hands should grasp firmly." ("Gists of Remarks Made in Wuchang, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Shanghai") These expositions on grasping material civilization with one hand while grasping spiritual civilization with the other, grasping economic construction with one hand while grasping democracy and the legal system with the other, grasping reform and opening up with one hand while grasping cracking down on crimes with the other shine with the ideological brilliance of dialectical materialism. All things in the world are interrelated and interdependent. This is particularly true of a series of major issues we meet with in the course of socialist modernization. For example, persisting in reform and opening must be closely combined with persisting in cracking down on criminal activities. If we do not severely punish criminals committing economic crimes and other criminal offenses or do not strengthen the building of honest administration, reform and opening up will be seriously interfered with. On the other hand, if we do not carry out reform and opening up, do not greatly increase the country's comprehensive strength and raise the cultural level of society, or do not improve the people's living standards, we cannot thoroughly do away with various criminal activities or corruption. Upholding grasping with both hands and grasping firmly with both hands means upholding the doctrine that everything has two aspects in the theory of knowledge in dialectical materialism. In the process of modernization, we must uphold the doctrine that everything has two aspects advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. Only in this way can we handle various kinds of complicated issues and contradictions dialectically and in an all-round manner and make fewer mistakes or detours in our work. The building of material civilization and the building of spiritual civilization are mutually conditional and promote one another. The building of material civilization is the foundation of the building of spiritual civilization. We must firmly grasp the center of economic construction and should not let go our hold. "Not upholding socialism, not carrying out reform and opening up, not developing the economy, and not improving the people's standard of living can only be a blind alley." ("Gists of Remarks Made in Wuchang, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Shanghai") All comrades engaged in the building of spiritual civilization should firmly establish the idea of serving economic construction, reform, and opening up. Only by correctly locating our position of serving economic construction, reform, and opening up can we realize the value of our work. In his important remarks made during his inspection tour of the south, Comrade Deng Xiaoping scientifically put forward the standard for assessing the correctness of the work in economic construction, reform, and opening up: We "should mainly see whether or not it is conducive to developing the productive forces of the socialist society, whether or not it is conducive to increasing the comprehensive national strength of the socialist state, and whether or not it is conducive to improving the people's living standards." Undoubtedly, this is also the only correct standard for assessing the building of socialist spiritual civilization. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always stressed that the building of socialist material civilization and the building of spiritual civilization should be grasped simultaneously and has attached great importance to the special role played by socialist spiritual civilization in modernization. As early as the beginning of reform and opening up, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "While building a high degree of material civilization, we should raise the level of science and culture of the entire nation, develop a noble, rich, and colorful cultural life, and build a high degree of socialist spiritual civilization." ("Congratulatory Speech at the Fourth Congress of the Literature and Art workers of China") Comrade Xiaoping also said: "The most fundamental thing in building socialist spiritual civilization is to enable the broad masses of people to have ideals, morals, and culture, and to observe discipline." ("Build Socialist Materialist Civilization and Spiritual Civilization") Grasping the building of material civilization and spiritual civilization with both hands is a prominent characteristic in the socialist modernization of our country. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "If the building of spiritual civilization is not strengthened, the building of material civilization will be damaged and we shall make detours. We cannot succeed in our revolution or construction by depending on material conditions alone." ("Speech at the CPC National Congress") The historical experience of reform and opening up in the past 10 years and more have repeatedly proved that whenever we adhere to the principle of "grasping with both hands and grasping firmly with both hands" which Comrade Xiaoping has always stressed, the cause of socialist modernization will become more prosperous every day and will develop smoothly, and whenever we deviate from this basic principle and whenever we make the mistake of grasping firmly with one hand while relaxing the grasp of the other, the cause of socialist modernization will be interfered with and damaged. We must keep firmly in mind Comrade Deng Xiaoping's earnest instructions, learn from past experience and lessons, and ensure the healthy and steady development of the cause of socialist modernization. II. Press and publication work is an important part of the building of socialist spiritual civilization. Doing a good job in press and publication work has an important bearing on properly carrying out the building of the two civilizations. The press and publication sector has the mass media in its hands. In a modern society, it plays a specially important role in spreading information, promoting the development of the economy, science, and culture, forming public opinion, winning people's support, and stabilizing the social and political situation. Without powerful and efficient information- spreading systems and without public opinion for guiding society which is in line with the direction of development of modernization, it is difficult to imagine the possibility of attaining success in modernization. Comrade Xiaoping once said: "Strengthening the party's leadership over the ideological front and overcoming the weak and lax situation have become a pressing task of the whole party. In addition to the theoretical and literature and art circles, education, the press, publication, radio, television, mass culture, mass ideological and political work, and other sectors also have similar or other pressing problems to solve. The work of the entire ideological front needs to be strengthened. We should solemnly put this question before the whole party and on the important agenda of the CPC Central Committee and local CPC committees at all levels. After the center of work has been shifted to economic construction, the whole party should study how to adapt itself to the new conditions, strengthen the party's ideological work, and guard against the tendency of immersing ourselves in economic work and ignoring ideological work." ("The Party's Pressing Tasks on the Organizational Front and the Ideological Front") These instructions of Comrade Xiaoping have great significance in giving guidance. Press and publication work can only be strengthened and should not be weakened. This has been proved by the practice of many years. At present, there are across the country more than 500 publishing houses, 200 audio-video publishing houses, 2,000 newspapers, and 7,000 magazines. In addition, there are more than 100,000 points and networks for selling books and magazines and 4,000 printing houses with regular customers. Since the press and publication industry is developing so rapidly and its scale is so big, only by giving it correct guidance and exercising efficient management will it be possible for it to develop healthily and to provide a powerful spiritual propelling force, intellectual support, a public opinion environment, and an ideological guarantee for reform, opening up, and economic construction. This is an important issue which has a bearing on the success of modernization. Comrade Xiaoping has put forward, precisely at this high strategic level, the necessity of regarding the strengthening of the work of the ideological front, including press and publication, as a very pressing task of the whole party. Comrades working on the press and publication front must seriously understand the earnest hope of Comrade Xiaoping, work hard, explore boldly, and go all out to fulfill their duties. CPC committees and governments at all levels should also strengthen at this high strategic level press and publication work and the building of the press and publication organizations and workers so that the party can really exercise leadership over press and publication work. In the course of the gradual establishment of the socialist market economy structure, the core of strengthening the management of press and publication lies in strengthening the legal system and strictly carrying out management according to law. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "It is especially necessary to grasp legislation work firmly, including the legislation of laws and regulations governing rallies, societies, parades, demonstrations, the press, and publication." ("China Brooks No Chaos") To speed up legislation on the press and publication is the most urgent task in press and publication work at present. We should seriously study new situations and new problems emerging in the press and publication under the conditions of the socialist market economy, extensively solicit the views of various circles in society, and speed up the drafting of the "Publication Law" and the "Journalism Law." At the same time, we should also speed up the formulation of regulations and rules concerning the press and publication and strive to raise the level of the legal system for the management of the press and publication. We should, through strengthening management according to law, make due contributions to maintaining the normal operation of the press and publication and to social stability. Publications, published legally or illegally, which are found to have serious political mistakes, to be harmful to nationality solidarity, to violate foreign policies, to propagate pornography, or to be vulgar, will often become factors causing social instability and will interfere with the overall situation of economic construction, reform, and opening up. Regarding such publications, we should, on the one hand, strive to take preventive measures, and, on the other hand, mete out stern punishment according to law in order to put an end to the recurrence of similar problems. The press and publication is an important part of the party's ideological work and is also a rising industry of the national economy system. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out that "development is the last word [fa zhan cai shi ying dao li 4099 1455 2088 2508 4289 6670 3810]." Under the historical conditions of the gradual establishment of the socialist market economy structure, development and prosperity are also the last word of the press and publication. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the reform of the press and publication has taken a very big step forward and its operation and management level has risen greatly. Most publishing houses have changed from being of a production type to being of a production-management type. In the sales link, the requirements of "one main body, three multiples, and one fewer" (the state-owned Xinhua Bookstore as the main body; multiple channels, multiple economic compositions, and multiple purchasing and marketing forms; and fewer circulation links) and "one delegate, two removes, and one cooperation" (delegate power to invigorate state-owned bookstores; remove restrictions on wholesale channels to invigorate the book and magazine market and remove restrictions on purchasing and marketing forms and sales discounts to invigorate the purchasing and marketing mechanism; and strive to develop lateral cooperation) are gradually being satisfied. In the course of technical transformation, more and more book, newspaper, and magazine publishing enterprises are using the technology of "laser photo-typing, electronic scanning, offset printing, and automatic binding." The era of "lead and fire" has basically ended in the printing of newspapers of party committees at the prefectural and city levels and above. All this has been brought about by reform and opening up and is the result of great efforts made by the party and the government in developing the press and publication. At a time when reform and opening up have entered a new stage of historical development, there is still much work to do to deepen reform and speed up development. For example, further efforts are needed in the reform of the operation and management structure of publishing houses, newspapers, and magazines; further efforts are needed in the implementation of the director responsibility system in publishing houses; further efforts are needed to study how to establish and improve the book and magazine management structure and the mechanism to guarantee the quality of books and magazines; and great efforts are also needed to resolve the question of what channels and methods should be used to enable state-owned book and magazine distributing enterprises to play their guiding role among wholesalers of books and magazines and to enable retailers of various economic compositions to display their skills. It is necessary, through deepening reform, to establish a new publication structure which is in keeping with the socialist market economy structure, which can meet the needs of the building of socialist spiritual civilization, and which reflects the laws of development of the publication industry itself; and it is necessary, through deepening reform, to establish a good operation mechanism and an effective management structure. In the course of the historical process of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the press and publication sector should have greater and faster development and should make even greater contributions to the revitalization of the Chinese nation. Under the conditions of the socialist market economy, the press and publication will, for a long time to come, face the question of how to properly handle the relationship between social benefits and economic results. That the press and publication organizations have attached importance to operation and management and to economic results is in fact a gratifying change brought about by reform and opening up in the past 10 years and more. The reason is very simple. When the press and publication organizations have universally assumed sole responsibility for their own profits and losses, it will be difficult to ensure social benefits without attaching importance to economic results. However, the problem is that at present, "money worship" and "putting money before anything else" are having a serious erosive influence on press and publication workers and the phenomena of "paid news reports," "selling book title registrations," and so on have seriously affected the healthy development of the press and publication sector. Comrade Xiaoping once pointed out sharply: "The tendency of `putting money before anything else' and commercializing spiritual products has also appeared in other aspects of spiritual production. Some people who unworthily occupy places in literature and art circles, publication circles, and cultural circles have simply become merchants who are bent solely on profit." ("The Party's Pressing Tasks on the Organizational Front and the Ideological Front") Through summing up the experience and lessons of the press and publication work in past years, it is not difficult to see that many problems in the press and publication sector are of course caused by ideological understanding, but more of them are caused by the desire to reap great profits and by the "worship of money." Therefore, we must persist in putting social benefits in the most important position and, with this as the prerequisite, unify economic results with social benefits. At the same time, it is necessary to adopt measures related to structure and rules to eradicate the influence of "money worship" and to ensure the healthy development of the press and publication. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's expositions on persisting in "grasping with both hands" and grasping firmly with both hands are guidance for press and publication work. So long as we seriously grasp their essence and use them to guide practical work and so long as we adhere to the correct orientation, carry out management according to law, deepen reform, and promote prosperity, the press and publication sector will certainly develop further.
