[Passage omitted] Foreign Ministry under secretary Ozdem Sanberk returning from a trip to Jordan and Iraq, told reporters at Ankara's Esenboga Airport that a memorandum of understanding was reached with Iraq, adding a team of Iraqi officials will come to Ankara in the next months to meet on technical details with BOTAS [Turkish Oil and Natural Gas Company] officials. He said that the cleaning work could be started within two to three months adding, however, that no precise date can be set up at this point. Sanberk said that the cleaning work will be for "reparation" and "saving the pipeline from rotting" therefore not against any UN imposed sanction. Sanberk said technicians now had to work out "modalities of the technicalities of the flushing-out (operation)...." Once such arrangements are in place, the rescue operation for the whole Iraqi-Turkish oil pipeline system could start. "Under the plan, the pipelines must be flushed and refilled for correct maintenance until regular flow is resumed," Sanberk said. "The pipeline has not been used for almost three years, it is a very valuable asset and we do not want to it to deteriorate," he added. "The purpose was to see whether corrosion had set in and repair the pipeline to have it ready for the day when the embargo is lifted," Sanberk said. [passage omitted] Sanberk said talks during his trip to Baghdad also covered trade and political issues, including Iraq's latest diplomatic campaign to get the sanctions lifted or eased. Ankara has called for easing the embargo but wants Baghdad to fully comply with UN demands to scrap its weapons of mass destruction so the oil and trade ban on Baghdad can be lifted. It also wants Iraq to recognize the newly-demarcated border with Kuwait and open a dialogue with Kurds in Northern Iraq. The three-year-old trade sanctions have caused millions of dollars in losses to Jordan and Turkey, Iraq's neighbors and main trade partners.
