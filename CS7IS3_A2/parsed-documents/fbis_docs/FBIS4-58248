On the eve of his current Middle East tour, the U.S. secretary of state made an effort to lower expectations of "dramatic breakthroughs." Speaking on the U.S. Information Service's Internet at a news conference attended by newsmen from Oman, Beirut, Cairo, Damascus, and Jerusalem, Christopher described his visit as "routine." According to him, he is not carrying any "package," but he hopes to bring the Syrian president "certain interesting information" from Jerusalem. It is doubtful that there is still any "interesting information" left in Jerusalem that the Syrians do not know about. Al-Asad is determined not to give up on a single inch of the Golan, while Israel is crawling its way down from the Golan. Looking back, one cannot help but wonder at the excessive Israeli optimism that followed al-Asad's declaration about his willingness to make peace with Israel. We have been informed of countless instances of "sensational progress," just plain "progress," and "breakthroughs" since we began making progress on the withdrawal. The prime minister must have had very good reason for his declaration regarding his willingness to evacuate settlements on the Golan in return for peace. Yet Israel's lowering of the concession barrier does not follow any moderation in the Syrian stands. After all, Rabin himself stated more than once that "Syria has not made a single gesture to build confidence." Ever since al-Asad made his forced and stuttering remark after his meeting with Clinton in Geneva, Rabin has been waiting for the Syrian president to make another move; he never did. What else should Israel say that it has not yet openly said to make al-Asad kindly take the Golan Heights back? It is very easy to argue with Rabin and quote the unequivocal statements he made prior to the elections regarding the future of the Golan. Nevertheless, ever since he assumed office, there has been a troubling erosion in the prime minister's statements. It is true that Rabin never said that the Golan Heights is an inseparable part of the State of Israel. He relies on the Labor platform and the willingness to make territorial concessions, including on the Golan. Territorial compromise could amount to evacuating settlements, but it should in no way be taken to mean total withdrawal from the Golan and uprooting all the settlements. [passage omitted] Nonetheless, if the prime minister contends that his remarks about the Golan withdrawal and settlement evacuation were not made in order to exact a reciprocal Syrian gesture, who needed them and why were they made? The chilly reactions of the Syrian media left no room for doubt that Syria is not only demanding that all the settlements be dismantled but also that Israel fully withdraw from all of the territories, including Jerusalem -- which has been the Syrian stand since al-Asad assumed power. Reacting to Rabin's remarks on the readiness to evacuate settlements, TISHRIN said he is "throwing sand in our eyes." The Syrian press believes that what is needed now is U.S. pressure on Israel. In practice, the Israeli Government is fulfilling the commitment undertaken in the Labor platform that "efforts to bolster the existing settlements on the Golan Heights will continue." On one hand, it is "business as usual": accelerated development is taking place and investments are being made in every field, with the exception of tourism, including the construction of "the largest cowshed in the Middle East." On the other hand, every unnecessary Israeli declaration weakens the settlers' endurance and makes them feel that, sooner or later, everything will be dismantled or destroyed -- if not in one blow, then in stages. In the current Knesset, the government lacks majority support for a full withdrawal from the Golan and the evacuation of all the settlements there, even in exchange for full peace with Syria. The results of the referendum, the circumstances under which it will be held, and the contents of the "peace package" are unknown. Public opinion polls do not fully answer the question of whether the people are with the Golan or with peace without the Golan. Either way, even if there were no Israeli settlements on the Golan, there is doubt about whether a government decision on a full withdrawal would be widely accepted. Even in the absence of settlements on the Golan, the security consideration must lead the government to ensure that the Golan Heights will never again become a launching pad for attacks on the Galilee and Jordan Rift Valley settlements. Even if there were no settlements on the Golan and even if Syria were willing to sign a peace treaty with Israel, Syrian intentions would have to be tested over a period of 10-20 years before executing a full withdrawal from which there is no return. After all, there is nothing new in the Syrian bazaar: He who is patient wins; he who is in a rush loses. Even if it was not about security and dangerously betting on our future, the Israeli dealer must show the same amount of patience demonstrated by the Syrian merchant.
