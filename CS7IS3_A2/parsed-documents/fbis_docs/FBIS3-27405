The two countries are highly supplementary to each other in economic activities, science and technology, and culture. They should keep developing in-depth, equal, mutually beneficial, and friendly cooperation. Senate President Monory is scheduled to arrive in China on 22 February for a formal, friendly visit at the invitation of Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. He will be the first French Senate president to visit China since the two countries established diplomatic ties 30 years ago. Monory told the reporter that, during his visit, he will meet with Chinese leaders for discussions on ways to improve and strengthen political, economic, cultural, and scientific and technological cooperation between the two countries. Monory expressed admiration of the success China has achieved in economic construction. He said: China is a big country with a population of more than 1 billion. The economy enjoys very rapid development at an annual growth rate of more than 10 percent. He continued: "It is a major event to which people cannot but attach importance." "Everyone in Europe and particularly in France is talking about China now." Touching on relations between the two countries, Monory said: In the past few months, the French Government issued several statements, "unequivocally" guaranteeing that France will no longer sell arms to Taiwan. "It clearly indicates that the French Government is willing to develop friendly economic and political relations with China." He continued: "I completely agree with the Government's stand" on the issue. He said that the main purpose of his visit to China is to further improve and promote friendly Sino-French cooperation. He stressed that, as a major country in Western Europe, France should play an active role in promoting the development of political and economic relations between China and Western Europe. Monory held: The potential for France and China to expand cooperation is tremendous. The two countries are highly supplementary to each other in economic cooperation and trade. China's rapid economic development is in the interests of Europe. He maintained: The development of economic and technical cooperation between the two countries should not be limited to only large enterprises and large construction projects. They should bring into full play the role of medium and small-sized enterprises and strengthen exchanges between provinces and municipalities. France may take advantage of its scientific and technological superiority to participate in China's economic development. In his capacity as minister of national education, Monory visited China in 1988. Looking back on the visit, he said that, during his meeting with Li Peng and other Chinese leaders then, they focused discussions on developing cooperation between the two countries in culture, education, and personnel training. He said long-term friendship should be established between France and China, and bilateral cooperation should be expanded to all fields of endeavor.
