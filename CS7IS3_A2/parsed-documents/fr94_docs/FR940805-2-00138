FR940805-2-00138 FR940805-2-00073 During the March 3&hyph;4, 1994, Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee meeting, Dr. Doris Zallen, Chair of the Working Group on Informed Consent, provided a summary of the proposed amendments to Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;D, Informed Consent. Two versions of revised Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;D were presented: (1) the version drafted by the working group, and (2) a modified version incorporating the modifications suggested by Mr. Alex Capron. The Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee recommended that the working group should develop a consolidated version of Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;D which includes language from both proposed documents. The Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee suggested that questions should be prefaced with an explanation as to the necessity for the requested information. On April 27, 1994, Dr. Zallen submitted revised amendments to Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph; D, Informed Consent, in response to the specific comments posed by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee at its March 3&hyph;4, 1994, meeting. The proposed amendments were reviewed by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee during the June 9&hyph;10, 1994, meeting. The Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee approved a motion to accept the proposed amendments with minor editorial changes to Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;D, Informed Consent, by a vote of 13 in favor, 0 opposed, and no abstentions. The amended version of Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;D, Informed Consent, reads: Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;D. Informed Consent In accordance with the requirements of DHHS regulations for the Protection of Human Subjects (45 CFR Part 46), investigators should indicate how subjects will be informed about the proposed study and the manner in which their consent will be solicited. They should also indicate how the Informed Consent document makes clear the special requirements of gene transfer research. Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;D&hyph;1. Communication About the Study to Potential Participants Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;a.
