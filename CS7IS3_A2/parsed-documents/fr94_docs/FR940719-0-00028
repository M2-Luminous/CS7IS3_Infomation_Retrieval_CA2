FR940719-0-00028 FR940719-0-00008 DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Occupational Safety and Health Administration 29 CFR Part 1910 RIN 1218&hyph;AA51 Permit-Required Confined Spaces AGENCY: Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Labor. ACTION: Final rule; technical amendment. SUMMARY: On January 14, 1993 at 58 FR 4462, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) published a final rule on Permit-Required Confined Spaces, 29 CFR 1910.146 in the Federal Register . On June 29, 1993 at 58 FR 34844, OSHA published a corrections document for that final rule which contained corrections to the regulatory text and to several appendices of the final rule. This document adds a metric equivalent in paragraph (k)(3)(ii) and further revises the ``Atmospheric monitoring'' section of appendix E, ``Sewer System Entry'', of the final rule. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 19, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. James F. Foster, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Office of Information and Public Affairs, room N&hyph;3647, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210, Telephone: (202) 219&hyph;8181. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: OSHA published its final rule on Permit-Required Confined Spaces, 29 CFR 1910.146, on January 14, 1993 at 58 FR 4462. Corrections to the regulatory text and several appendices were published on June 29, 1993 at 58 FR 34844. Amendment to 29 CFR 1910.146 The last sentence of ยง1910.146(k)(3)(ii) requires that a mechanical device be used to retrieve personnel from vertical type permit spaces more than 5 feet deep. OSHA failed to include the metric equivalent of 5 feet in this provision. Since it is the policy of the U.S. Government and OSHA to include metric equivalents of U.S. units wherever possible, OSHA is correcting ยง1910.146(k)(3)(ii) by adding the metric equivalent (1.52 meters) of 5 feet. Amendment to Appendix E In the correction notice of June 29, 1993 (58 FR 34844), OSHA removed all reference to ``broad range sensor instruments'' from the ``Atmospheric monitoring'' section of non-mandatory appendix E (see 58 FR 34845) because the Agency felt that it was inappropriate to suggest a particular type of sensor instrument for all sewer entries. However, it appears that, by removing the reference to the broad range sensor, OSHA inadvertently created the impression that the Agency now favored the use of substance-specific sensors over the use of broad range sensors for atmospheric monitoring in sewer systems. This was not the Agency's intent. As stated in the preamble to the final rule, the choice of sensors or other monitoring equipment will, in general, depend on the extent to which the employer has been able to identify the atmospheric hazards present or potentially present in the sewer. Where the employer has already identified those hazards, substance-specific sensors are preferable, because they accurately indicate the concentrations of the identified air contaminants. By contrast, where the employer has not been able to identify the specific atmospheric hazards present or potentially present in the sewer, broad range sensors are preferable because they indicate that the hazardous threshold of a class (or classes) of contaminants (i.e., hydrocarbons) in the sewer have been exceeded. Sewer permit spaces generally cannot be isolated from adjacent sections of the sewer. This means that air contaminants arising or introduced elsewhere in a sewer system can enter a sewer permit space, without warning, during entry operations. This, in turn, may make it difficult for employers to anticipate the potential atmospheric hazards of a sewer permit space. OSHA expects employers to consider the predictability of sewer permit space's atmosphere when selecting the appropriate equipment for atmospheric testing and monitoring. Accordingly, OSHA is revising the information in ยง1910.146, appendix E, pertaining to atmospheric testing and monitoring in sewers. The reference to broad range sensors is restored and the advantages and limitations of both the oxygen sensor/broad range sensor instrument and the substance-specific device are more clearly stated. However, no preference is expressed for either type of meter. Instrument selection is left up to the employer, who is in a position to decide what type of testing instrument is appropriate for a particular sewer entry. Exemption From Notice and Comment Procedures With regard to this action, OSHA has determined that it is not required to follow procedures for public notice and comment rulemaking under either section 4 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) or under section 6(b) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (29 U.S.C. 655(b)). This action does not affect the substantive requirements or coverage of the standards themselves. This technical amendment does not modify or revoke existing rights or obligations, nor does it establish new ones. This action simply provides additional information on the existing regulatory burden. OSHA, therefore, finds that notice and public procedure are impracticable and unnecessary within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B). For the same reasons, OSHA also finds that, in accordance with 29 CFR 1911.5, good cause exists for dispensing with the public notice and comment procedures prescribed in section 6(b) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Exemption From Delayed Effective Date Requirement Under 5 U.S.C. 553, OSHA finds that there is good cause for making this technical amendment effective upon publication in the Federal Register . This technical amendment simply provides additional information on the existing regulatory burden without increasing that burden. List of Subjects in 29 CFR Part 1910 Confined spaces, Hazardous atmospheres, Monitoring, Occupational safety and health, Safety. Authority: This document was prepared under the direction of Joseph A. Dear, Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210.
