At Chongwadae [presidential offices] today, President Kim held a meeting with businessmen, including the presidents of finance institutions. There he pointed out that the people's insensitivity to national security is a problem. At the same time, however, people should not be uneasy about national security. He also stressed that, as the president, he should safeguard the state and defend people's lives and property and he has been mapping out solid countermeasures to be fully prepared to ward off any provocation from North Korea. People may have trust in the president and government. President Kim expressed strong confidence in national security by stating: We can handle, in a brief space of time, a provocation from North Korea because the government is maintaining an unprecedentedly solid system of cooperation between the ROK and the United States; because the government is maintaining an around-the-clock system to watch the North; because the morale in the military is higher than ever before as politically oriented soldiers have been removed; and because our firing power and maneuverability are in an excellent status. President Kim made it clear once again: The government is coping with the matters related to the North on the basis of the great principle that North Korea should not possess nuclear capability and that peace on the Korean peninsula should be maintained. Although North Korea is showing an unstable and shocking attitude toward the United States through withdrawing from the International Atomic Energy Agency, all of their strategies are not working as they planned. President Kim predicted that the countries concerned at the UN Security Council are now fine-tuning the wording of sanctions against North Korea. They will put sanctions into action in two or three weeks after they complete their consultations on the intensity of the sanctions. They will heighten the intensity of sanctions gradually. President Kim asked the financiers to make efforts, equipped with confidence in national security, to achieve this year's goal of 6 percent economic growth, to keep the increase in commodity prices under 6 percent, and to achieve an annual export goal of $90 billion.
