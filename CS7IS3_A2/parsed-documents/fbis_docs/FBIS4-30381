Law Minister Datuk Syed Hamid Albar said the attempt to introduce these clauses will undermine the objectives of trade liberalization and perpetuate protectionism. He added G-77 must remain vigilant and check this attempt which would be detrimental to the objectives of a liberalized trade regime. He was speaking at a special ministerial meeting of the Group of 77 in New York. The text of his speech was faxed today. At the meeting held to commemorate G-77's 30th anniversary, Syed Hamid called on the joint coordinating committee involving the G-77 and the Nonaligned Movement to chart a common strategy. He said G-77 had to continue to build the bridges not only with groups and institutions in the South but with those outside to overcome the asymmetries in the international economic system. In welcoming South Africa as a new member of G-77, Syed Hamid said that cooperation among developing countries was an integral part of the strategy to achieve economic growth. He stressed the problems of developing countries would not be resolved if they remained dependent on the international community and without a specific follow-up of the declarations adopted. He said the issue of poverty which affected one-third of the global population should be given priority attention in the United Nations agenda for development.
