According to witnesses, al-Turabi received one or two blows to the head by a karate expert. Consequently, he fell down and his head collided with the ground, causing him to lose consciousness for 15-20 minutes. Al-Turabi arrived at the Civic Hospital's emergency section at 1935. He was breathing normally, and his pulse and blood pressure were stable and within normal range. There was blood in the nostrils, the upper lip was swollen, and there was a wound on the right rear side of the head. But no operation was needed to stitch the wound. His eyes opened automatically, and he responded to verbal directions most of the time. But his verbal responses were not logical. Despite this, he showed no sign of weakness at the time. A sectional brain scan showed a concussion in the front left side and temple. But the examination showed no blockage at the base of the skull, excluding a slight swelling in the left section of the skull. Treatment with dexamethasone was initiated and Dr. al-Turabi spent the night of his hospital admission in the intensive care unit. On the following day (26 May), he was transferred to the neurosurgery ward. Dr. 'Abd-al-Amin visited Dr. al-Turabi on 27 May at the request of al-Turabi's family. Dr. 'Abd-al-Amin suggested that al-Turabi be treated with minitol and phenytoin. Repeated brain scans showed signs of a broader concussion than shown initially by the preliminary tests. It also became evident that there was great accumulation of fluids. It further became manifestly clear that the patient had lost the ability to speak. On 28 May, Dr. al-Turabi seemed to be extremely exhausted and sleepy and totally unable to speak. Moreover, he was breathing haltingly. (A test of carbon dioxide pressure in the blood showed a reading of 47 TUR (measuring unit). He was readmitted to the intensive care unit and hooked to intravenous tubes and a breathing machine. His condition remained stable until the tube leading to the lungs through the trachea was removed. This was followed by a weakness of 4/5 degrees on the right side and total loss of speech. On 2 June, al-Turabi was taken out of the intensive care unit. On 4 June, a rash appeared on his skin, and it was attributed to an allergic reaction to the drug dilantin. Consequently, it was decided to treat him with 250 milligrams of valboric acid three times daily. His treatment with minitol was suspended, the dosage of dexamethasone was reduced, and feeding by tube was resumed. After this, al-Turabi was able to take a few steps in his room and could urinate without help from anybody. He also regained his ability to understand verbal directions, along with the ability to read and write. This was on 13 June. He also became able to feed himself. The treatment with valboric acid may continue for six months. It is likely that a degree of the inability to comprehend and a large degree of the inability to speak will persist in a manner that cannot be determined by the preliminary tests. If his family agrees, Dr. al-Turabi can be helped to regain his fitness in a special unit, either in the United States or in Europe. This can be done on his way back to his country or shortly after he arrives in Sudan. I personally prefer that he be treated at a European center.
