Industrial output, however, stagnated. Orders are continuing to increase, with demand from abroad gaining in momentum. The price situation has become more stable. In view of wage agreements being in keeping with the economic situation, the pressure on costs has been reduced and the downward trend in interest rates is continuing. All this indicates that business will pick up over the next few months. Expectations that warehouse stocks will have to be increased and an actual tendency to do so support a cautiously optimistic view. However, this cannot conceal the basic problem -- weak domestic demand. The BDI does not assume that domestic demand will increase over the rest of the year. However, expectations of a further rapid increase in exports are completely justified. In addition to a strong economic upturn in a whole series of countries outside Europe, the first signs of an increase in demand in Europe have become apparent. The first indications of economic recovery as well as a reversal of the tendency for the German mark to increase in value within the European Monetary System play a role in this respect. The prospects for the labor market are not good. Even if the economy develops favorably, the BDI estimates the number of persons in employment will fall further. The reduction in employment in both western and eastern Germany will constitute the most serious economic policy problem over the next few years. It is inconceivable that this problem should be solved unless investment grows at a significant rate. That is why the federation has called for an easing of the taxation and public dues burden on companies. This could help encourage investment and thus contribute to the creation of new jobs. Growth in the new laender has accelerated, writes the BDI. However, despite considerable progress, east German industry still cannot keep pace with international competition. The unsatisfactory development of exports to Western industrial countries reflects this very clearly. In western Germany, the impact of gradual economic recovery on the various branches of the economy has differed considerably. The raw materials and industrial goods industry had recovered the most in the meantime. Output rose in almost all sectors. According to the BDI, the recession has bottomed out for manufacturers of producer goods thanks to increased demand from abroad. Until recently, output in the consumer goods industry was falling. This is the strongest indication of weak growth in private consumption. The BDI economic reports also note a sustained upturn in the west and an improvement in the situation in the east for certain selected branches of industry. The Construction Industry The situation in the construction industry has stopped deteriorating over the past few months. Housing construction is expanding rapidly, and there are indications of more stability in industrial and public construction. Orders for industrial construction are once again close to last year's high level, and the recession in civil engineering is slowing. There has been no improvement in the case of structural engineering orders placed by the railroad, postal service, and in civil engineering orders placed by local government. In contrast to orders, the earnings situation is being increasingly negatively assessed. In eastern Germany, housing construction, which registered a nominal increase in sales of 40 percent in 1993, expanded the most, with industrial construction increasing by 33 percent and public construction increasing by 15 percent. East German construction companies posted sales of 125,000 German marks [DM] per employee. Thus, the difference in productivity compared to west German companies fell by one-fifth. Employment rose by a substantial 12 percent to over 370,000. Engineering The continuing negative trend in west German engineering shows that investment in western Germany is still in retreat. However, orders from abroad indicate that there will be an upturn. In addition, in January/February 1994, orders from EU [European Union] countries picked up for the first time. The first positive effects of improved business abroad can already be felt in the ancillary field. The stimulus from abroad has slowed the decline in output, but at the beginning of 1994, output fell once again, by a further 2.1 percent compared to last year's level. Since 1990, engineering output has easily fallen by a fifth. The shedding of jobs that this has triggered has still not come to an end. In the course of 1993, east German engineering has experienced a turn for the better. Output has grown rapidly, and the rate at which jobs are being shed has slowed. However, the productivity gap has still not been closed, and the number of people employed in the industry will continue to decrease. The Automobile Industry Demand from western companies has grown for the first time compared to a year before. However, this does not mean that the situation in the automobile industry will pick up, because the level of domestic demand is still very low. The decline in domestic demand for commercial vehicles reflects the continued weak level of investment. On the other hand, there has been a slight increase in demand from abroad. However, for a long time, there has not been a sustained improvement that would stimulate higher output. Production of automobiles in the east is expanding rapidly. The number of employees is no longer declining. In terms of sales per employee, two-thirds of west German productivity levels have been reached. Electrical Engineering In the west, the rate of decline markedly slowed during the second half of 1993. Nevertheless, the continued rise in orders from abroad could not compensate for a further sharp fall in domestic orders. The manufacture of electrical engineering capital goods continued to fall, but the level of a year ago was only marginally exceeded. Output of consumer goods grew and production of entertainment electronics even rose rapidly. The rationalization measures introduced in 1993 have led to a steep increase in productivity and in the fourth quarter of 1991, unit labor costs fell for the first time. The situation in the east German electrical engineering industry has stabilized. Employment stopped declining in 1993. The productivity gap compared to the west has become smaller. Printing In contrast to other branches of the economy, the west German printing industry did not come out of the recession in 1993. The downward trend in output -- a good 4 percent lower over the year as a whole -- gained in momentum in the second half of the year. Nominal sales fell for the first time since the establishment of the FRG. There was no indication of a reversal of this trend at the end of the year. In line with the fall in output, the number of employees also declined. Nevertheless, the pressure exerted by costs intensified at the end of the year. Whereas average labor unit costs in manufacturing were below the previous year's level in the fourth quarter of 1993, in the printing industry they grew by more than 4 percent. In view of this, the prospects for 1994 remain unfavorable. There were no indications of a recovery. In eastern Germany, the situation in the printing industry continued to improve. However, the upward trend in 1993 was weaker than in 1992. The productivity gap was reduced once again. In the fourth quarter, sales per employee reached three-quarters of west German levels.
