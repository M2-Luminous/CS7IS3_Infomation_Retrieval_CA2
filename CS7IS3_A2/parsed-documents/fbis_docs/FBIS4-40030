Co-chairman of the Ukrainian inter-regional bloc Grinev-Kuchma and the former deputy-speaker of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet Vladimir Grinev greeted the convention. On behalf of the delegates, Anatoliy Chubays, who chaired the convention, wished the inter-regional bloc success in the June 26 presidential elections. President Yeltsin's press secretary Viacheslav Kostikov refuses to recognize the new party as "presidential". But in terms of politics, he told newsmen, the new party shared much with the president and was a product of what Yeltsin started back in 1991. According to Kostikov, the Choice's leaders had made no false moves to make Yeltsin join them. In response to a question from Interfax, Kostikov said the convention could yet receive a message of greeting from Yeltsin. In Kostikov's view, the new party and Yeltsin ought to keep a reasonable distance between them. Kostikov would not want to join the party in his capacity of a public servant. That would make it more difficult for Yeltsin to work, he said.
