"I am quite sure of it." In contrast to the pessimistic announcements from the economic associations upon the presentation of the annual economic report in January, Rexrodt thinks that a growth of 1 to 1.5 percent across Germany is likely. The growth in the west will be between 0.5 and 1 percent and in the east between 6 and 8 percent. "Possibly, this is the lower limit of what can be achieved," the minister stresses. As a result of the improved situation in the international economy, export conditions have improved considerably. On the inside, improvements in productivity and cost reductions have taken place. The companies are well on their way to regain their technological top position. The minister does ignore that there are still unutilized capacities in German industry. Therefore, the companies are restrained with investment. Domestic consumption has been dampened, among other things, because of the tax increase this year. In 1995 the solidarity surcharge will be added. Over the next few years the expected room for maneuver must be used not to dispense benefits but to reduce taxes. Before the end of this legislative period the Federal Government wants to set down the basic values for the corporate tax reform. It is undisputed that trade tax and taxes that are not related to profit must be reduced. Something must also be done for low wage-earners and concerning taxation of the subsistence level. The main question for Rexrodt is: What about the top tax rates? As of 1996 these must also be reduced for nonbusiness revenue, first to 47 percent for the time being. "In the medium-term, until the end of the next legislative period, I expect a reduction of the top tax rates to clearly below 45 percent." Inflation is no longer a topic now. "The two before the decimal point can be achieved." For the new laender he expects inflation at 3.5 percent, which is less than the 4 percent predicted by the annual economic report. Unemployment remains the sensitive spot. This winter the 4-million threshold was exceeded. This will not be repeated. However, great success will be achieved only in 1995. During this legislative period the Law on Simplifying Planning and the Investment Facilitation and Housing Construction Land Law were passed. In addition, improvements were made for work time and the labor exchange monopoly of the Federal Employment Office was abolished. The discount law is being discussed by parliament just now.
