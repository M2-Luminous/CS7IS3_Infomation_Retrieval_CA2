FBIS4-64069 "drsov103_b_94016" FBIS-SOV-94-103 Daily Report 26 May 1994 RUSSIA NATIONAL AFFAIRS Political Issues Investigation Into Oct Uprising Faulty Investigation Into Oct Uprising Faulty LD2605153994 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1046 GMT 26 May 94 LD2605153994 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] Investigators into last October's parliamentary uprising made serious mistakes, a commission of the Prosecutor General's Office concluded. This is precisely why Deputy Prosecutor General Vladimir Kravtsev was dismissed. Although the formula of indictment on former Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoy, ex-Speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov and former Deputy Soviet Defence Minister Vladislav Achalov was ready in January, this was delayed because of incomplete work on plaintiffs and damage sustained. Other mistakes include lack of coordination and duplication of work by separate investigating teams. The files were kept apart and none of the teams had enough information to substantiate the case. The commission also indicated that a substantial part of external investigating officers had little experience with 28 percent of prosecuting officers and 33 percent of police investigators having work records of less than three years. As many as 7,000 witnesses had been questioned and the identity established of 151 dead victims and 913 wounded casualties by February 22 when the State Duma declared an amnesty. Apart from subjective reasons, the investigation was also hampered because of delays caused by a number of government bodies. Despite the PGO's [Prosecutor General's Office] repeated requests, no estimates were provided of the damage done to the buildings of the Russian parliament and Moscow mayor's office.
