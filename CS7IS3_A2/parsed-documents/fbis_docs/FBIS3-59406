The killers kidnapped his wife, Marija, who owned a little cafe on Dolac which the Zec family had obtained in the past thanks to good connections with powerful people, mainly Serbs in the communist system, and his daughter Aleksandra (age 12). Marija and Aleksandra were later shot and killed. The bodies were found near the Adolfovac mountain lodge on Sljeme. A week after that crime the Croatian police arrested suspects who confessed to the murders during the investigation. They were Nebojsa H., Munib S., Sinisa R., and Igor M., who took part in Zec's murder and the kidnapping of his wife and daughter, and Suzana Z., who accompanied the murderers. In mid-December of the year before last, all the suspects were already in prison pending the investigation. It was learned from police circles that they had confessed to that and certain other crimes. The Zec case seemed to have been solved. But some 10 months after the murder of Mihajlo Zec, his wife Marija, and his daughter Aleksandra, charges were dropped against the arrestees because of procedural mistakes in investigatory proceedings. Their lawyers felt that there was a good chance of an acquittal even if there had not been those procedural mistakes, because under the conditions of an immediate danger of war (and those conditions prevailed in Croatia in the fall and winter of 1991) even members of the reserves of the Ministry of Internal Affairs [MUP] had the right to use firearms in a number of critical situations, for example, if a person attempted to flee to avoid arrest. All those suspected of having murdered the Zec family were members of a reserve unit of the MUP whose commander was Tomislav Mercep. This is Mercep's famous unit that played a decisive role in the defense of Gospic and liberation of part of western Slavonia; it was initially founded back in the time of Vukovar, when Mr. Mercep was responsible for defense of that city, and from time to time serious violations of the rules of war have been attributed to its members. At the time of the crime against the Zec family, there was talk in Croatia about the disappearance of a certain number of Serbs from Zagreb. There was also talk about the mysterious disappearance of certain Croats well-known to the public. The best-known of these cases was the disappearance of Mrs. Marina Nuic, president of the Kraljevica branch of the HDS [Croatian Democratic Party]; nothing is known about her fate even today. Not only that, but several members of the Croatian Armed Forces, most of them members of the MUP reserves, have also disappeared. Two years after these enigmatic disappearances, some of whose victims were relatively well-known, representatives of the United Nations want to do some digging in the area of Pakrac, where it is said that several murdered Serbian civilians have been buried. According to the information we have obtained, those buried in the zone of Pakracka Poljana are not only Serbs, but also Croats, indeed distinguished Croatian nationalists who in the dramatic months toward the end of 1991 seemed dangerous to someone. How the Zec Family Was Killed The Croatian police have reacted promptly and effectively to a number of the mysterious disappearances. The contents of an extensive police investigation were submitted to a few of the highest officials of the Croatian Government some six or seven months ago. That "report" ran to 13 typed pages and was classified as a state secret. "The report was written by one of the Croatian intelligence services," says a government official who has had it in his possession. The full title of the document, which we obtained from the very top leadership of the government, reads: "Report Drafted Concerning the Criminalistic Workup of the Murder of Mihajlo Zec, His Wife Marija, and His Daughter Aleksandra, and Also Related to Information About Persons of Serbian Nationality Taken From the City of Zagreb and Other Areas to the Headquarters of a Reserve Unit of the MUP of the RH [Republic of Croatia], Where Several of Those Persons, as Well as Members of the Reserve Unit of the RH MUP, Were Killed." The "Report" begins with a description of the murder of the Zec family. It states precisely that on or about 2300 hours on 7 December 1991 members of the MUP reserves in camouflage uniforms were taken in a van and a VW Golf automobile to No. 22 Poljanicka Street in Zagreb. According to the police report, which was later published in all the major Croatian newspapers, they were Munib Suljic, who was age 32 at the time; Sinisa Rimac, age 19; Igor Mikola, age 20; Nebojsa Hodak, age 25; and Snjezana Zivanovic, age 20. Because Mihajlo Zec attempted to flee from the house, one of these five members of the MUP reserve unit killed him with rounds from an automatic rifle. Following the murder, the persons in camouflage uniforms took about 30,000 dinars from the house and took away the murdered man's wife and daughter. They took them to the Adolfovac, where they bound, gagged, and blindfolded them and then killed and buried them. The statement by Munib Suljic, who allegedly led the suspects, is quoted in the "Report." According to that statement, at the Zagreb fairgrounds, where the equipment storehouse of their unit was located, he was given the assignment of finding and bringing in Mihajlo Zec by the commander Zvonko Trusic in the presence of Tomislav Mercep. When the police searched the house of the Zec family, they found a threatening letter sent to Zec from Zagreb on 29 November 1991. We quote the letter in its entirety: ``1. You have until 24 December, and by that date you must leave Croatia. Beginning on 25 December and thereafter, your life will not be worth anything. ``2. You may not convey your house and other real estate (Tresnjevka Opstina and the Assembly of the city of Zagreb have been notified). It will all be turned over to the Croatian state to care for Croats who have been the victims of genocide. ``3. We know that you have sent out foreign exchange along with your gold, but because this was taken from Croatia there will also be punishment for that. ``HOP ``Croatian Defense Movement "It is our sacred duty to cleanse Croatia within a period of 24 months so that not a single peasant sandal [opanak] treads any longer on this holy land." The police officials who drafted the report added that the HOP [Croatian Defense Movement], along with certain people from abroad, had been established by certain well-known politicians of the Republic of Croatia so that they could operate outside the legal and political system of the Croatian state. The case of the Zec family was obviously an occasion for the Croatian security services to devote serious attention to discovering those responsible for the disappearance of several people of Serbian and Croatian nationality. Some of those disappearances are described in detail in the "Report." The Horrible Deaths of Ivosevic, Paic, and Gruic The case of Milos Ivosevic is the first one mentioned after the killing of Mihajlo, Marija, and Aleksandra Zec. According to the "Report," on 31 October 1991 members of the reserve unit of the MUP already mentioned picked up Ivosevic, who headed the customs office in the Zagreb railroad switchyard, whose address was No. 81 Rudeska Road, and took him to the Zagreb fairgrounds along with Rado Paic and Marko Gruic, whom he knew. Ivosevic, Paic, and Gruic were later taken to Pakracka Poljana. A fairly new Golf automobile, 20,000 dinars, and about 300 German marks [DM] were taken from Ivosevic. The "Report" said that Ivosevic, Paic, and Gruic, along with nine other persons unnamed from Pakracka Poljana, were taken to the basement of a house in the village Bujavice near Pakrac, where B.M., J.A., A.A., Z.A., and a person known as "Bego," members of the reserve unit of the MUP which has been mentioned, shot and killed them. The bodies of those killed were found in the village Bujavice and were taken to the Bureau for Forensic Medicine and Criminalistics in Zagreb, where an autopsy was performed, and after that they were taken by their families. It is of particular interest that the automobile of the murdered Milan Ivosevic was found in the possession of those suspected of having murdered the Zec family. The police returned that car to the Ivosevic family. According to the testimony of one of the members of the MUP reserve unit who was interrogated, Milos Ivosevic was arrested by order of Zvonko Trusic. The Murder and Robbery of Stevan Brajenovic The next case that the "Report" describes in detail concerns another customs officer, Stevan Brajenovic, head of the Dobovo customhouse, who on 8 November 1991 was taken from his residence at No. 14 Djuro Simunic Street in Zagreb by B.T., M.B., and two other members of "Mercep's unit." According to the "Report," the auxiliary police also drove away Brajenovic's Toyota Corolla. Brajenovic was taken to the Zagreb fairgrounds and then to Pakracka Poljana, where on 12 December 1991 he received a wound in the abdomen. He was shot by a guard nicknamed Karlo. At the time when the "Report" was written, Brajenovic's car was being used to meet the unit's needs, and the money taken from Brajenovic (about DM10,000) was delivered to P.Dj., an active employee of the Police Department in Zagreb, who for a time was commander of the unit in Pakracka Poljana. The Murder of Ina Zoricic-Nuic The authors of the "Report" make reference to the statement by M.S., who said that Brajenovic was arrested by order of Zvonko Trusic. The following case, which the "Report" describes in detail, does not involve Croatian citizens of Serbian nationality, but a Croatian woman, whose disappearance has been frequently discussed in our media. We are referring to Ina Zoricic-Nuic, known as Marina Nuic, born 1960. Marina Nuic was the head of the HDS in Kraljevica. Her father was a member of the HDZ, and Mrs. Nuic was responsible for the housing of refugees from Slavonia in the coastal area known as Primorje. According to the "Report," she was arrested on 3 November 1991 near the Mirogoj Cemetery in Zagreb at the funeral of Pavo Mlinaric, a member of the MUP reserve unit that has been referred to here. The authors of the "Report" think that Ina Zoricic-Nuic was arrested because she had prepared an assassination attempt on Tomislav Mercep. In any case, she was also taken to the Zagreb fairgrounds, where she was interrogated by P.Dj., the unit's commander who has already been mentioned. Following the interrogation, Ina Zoricic-Nuic, the "Report" explicitly states, was taken to Pakracka Poljana by order of Tomislav Mercep himself. J.A. and S.R., members of the MUP reserve unit, shot and killed her in Pakracka Poljana. Ina Zoricic-Nuic, according to the "Report," was buried approximately 1 km from the improvised prison in Pakracka Poljana in the direction of Janja Lipa. The Murder of Aleksandar Antic One other Croat was killed at that time in Pakracka Poljana. This was Aleksandar Antic, who himself belonged to the MUP reserve unit. Aleksandar "Sasa" Antic was allegedly killed because he had taken from Tomislav Mercep's car "a sizable number of blank identity cards of reserves of the MUP of the Republic of Croatia." The "Report" says that Antic was killed by I.M. and S.R., members of the same unit, and that the commanders of that unit knew about the murder. The "Report" also states that N.P. and B.V., Serbs from Kutina who had to dig the grave in which Aleksandar Antic was buried, were present at the murder of Aleksandar Antic. N.P. and B.V., Serbs from Kutina, are the only victims whose names we are not publishing, solely because these are people who survived Pakracka Poljana. According to the police report, they were arrested by K.P., a member of the MUP reserve unit who owned a private butcher shop in Zagreb, with the help of several persons whom the police had been unable to identify at the time when the report was written. Two Mercedeses and one BMW were taken from the Kutina Serbs, as well as appliances and equipment from their homes. N.P. and B.V. spent about a month in prison without any court order whatsoever. During that time, according to the "Report," they were tortured (electric current was applied to them, wire and nightsticks were forced into their rectum, and so forth). They were released on 18 December 1991. One of them spent some time in Zagreb hospitals, where he was treated for injuries received while he was in prison. The "Report" says that several dozen persons from the area of Zagreb, Kutina, and other towns were taken to the prison in Pakracka Poljana, "from what we know now." The drafters of the "Report" suggest that the persons taken were mainly quite rich, and "quite valuable personal property" was taken from them at the same time. The Murder of Djuro Dobrota and Nedeljko Igric Certain cases of the unclarified disappearance of Croatian citizens in other parts of the country are also mentioned near the end of the "Report." It says first that "the unit of the MUP RH reserve unit under command of Mr. Tomislav Mercep" took part in military operations in the region of Vukovar and then in the region of Gospic. It says that on the territory of Gospic that unit operated the same way it had on the territory of Pakrac. It refers to several cases of murder or kidnapping. Thus, in Karlobag, according to the "Report," members of the MUP reserve unit that Tomislav Mercep formed took custody of and arrested the retired policeman Djuro Dobrota, whose personal car they confiscated. S.J., M.I., and R.S. shot Dobrota on the road between Velebeni and Ostarija. These same reserve policemen, members of the special Mercep unit, arrested in Karlobag Nedeljko Igric, whom, according to the "Report," they beat with a metal rod in a police Landrover. Then they executed him before a firing squad. The automobile of Momcilo Cipcic of Gospic, who was taken to Karlobag with his wife Veselinka and two Croats, was also found in the possession of members of that unit. The Ciplic family and their friends, who disappeared in the autumn of 1991, had not been found by the time when the "Report" was written. The "Report" also mentions a case from Vukovar, where Tomislav Mercep was the principal organizer of the city's defense until the arrival of Mile "Hawk" Dedakovic, who is being tried right now in Zagreb for having embezzled money. The authors of the "Report" believe that a person nicknamed "Gango" in the group of M.P., one of the leaders of the defense of Vukovar in the summer of 1991, murdered the director of the SDK [Social Accounting Service] in Vukovar and took from the safe a large amount of money (the figure of no less than DM20 million is mentioned!), as well as jewelry, gems, and works of art. At the very end of the "Report" it is said that the cited information was obtained through talks with the murder suspects, who were all members of the MUP reserve unit under the command of Tomislav Mercep. The suspects were arrested and detained in the rooms of the police administration headquarters in Zagreb on the basis of the Decree on Internal Affairs in Wartime or Time of Immediate Threat to the Independence and Unity of the Republic of Croatia. It should also be emphasized that the drafters of the "Report," operatives in one of the Croatian security services, mentioned the possibility that the members of the MUP reserve unit, which was stationed in Pakracka Poljana, had lists of people they were supposed to arrest and execute. Those lists included names of Serbs and Croats, including even certain employees of the Zagreb Police Department and the MUP of the Republic of Croatia. Will Any Members of the HDZ Be Charged With War Crimes? Members of the unit in Pakracka Poljana obtained the necessary information about employees of the Zagreb Police Department and the MUP by telephoning the Zagreb Police Department, according to the information of the authors of the "Report," mainly after 2100 hours. It is also important that some members of the reserve unit, who had been under suspicion of having actually committed murders, kidnappings, and robberies, were recorded in police files even earlier as criminals and thugs. The Croatian police obviously took extensive steps to combat the lawlessness and violence that existed in certain parts of the Croatian Government. Much of the information published in the "Report"--which is classified as a state secret--was gathered back in late 1991 and early 1992. The "Report" itself was submitted to several of the highest officials of the Croatian Government this past spring. Before we came into the possession of one of the few copies of the "Report," one of the ministers in the Croatian Government warned us that in view of the interest of UN representatives in war crimes on the territory of Croatia some of the Croatian politicians might soon find themselves before an international court! If certain Croatian political leaders received the "Report" back in the spring, it is logical to put the question: Why was nothing undertaken by the judiciary, especially the state prosecutor's office? Did Stjepan Herceg have to resign because he did not win a single important case, or because he did not want to act against people suspected of serious crimes who at the same time had played a heroic role in the homeland war? One of the most difficult postwar problems in Croatia is the attitude toward those volunteers in the homeland war who violated international war conventions (which Croatia has adopted) and who committed crimes which cannot be justified from the civilian and peacetime standpoint. This problem is especially serious if any politicians still active are among the perpetrators. One of the most complicated aspects of the conflict in the Croatian Democratic Union concerns the fact that certain distinguished members of the incumbent party may be charged with war crimes as well as with wrecking the political and legal system of the Republic of Croatia. The leadership of the government and party still have not found the strength to face this danger.
