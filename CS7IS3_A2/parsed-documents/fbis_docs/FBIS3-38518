Thus the Berlusconi cartel now includes the right-wingers of the old Christian Democrat party, grouped in the Democratic Christian Centre, the ex-Liberals and Social Democrats of the Centrist Union, a separate movement headed by (ex-Liberal party) art critic and media personality Vittorio Sgarbi, and the small group of Socialists who stayed loyal to disgraced former leader Bettino Craxi. The entry of the Socialists took place at a meeting last night at Berlusconi's Rome apartment, when agreement was reached on a programme focussing on "responsible liberty, for individuals and business." Sources for the Federation of Reformist and Libertarian Socialists said that, for the moment, any possible alliance with the far-right National Alliance (formerly the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement) was held up by "differences on the programme."
