FR941122-1-00085 FR941122-1-00019 International Trade Impact Assessment The proposed rule would neither have an effect on the sale of foreign aviation products or services in the United States, nor would it have an effect on the sale of United States products or services in foreign countries. The proposed rule would neither impose costs on aircraft operators nor aircraft manufacturers (United States or foreign). Federalism Implications This proposed rule would not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685; October 30, 1987), it is determined that this proposed rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environmental Analysis The procedures implemented by this rule have been determined to not significantly affect the quality of the human environment. Pursuant to the Department of Transportation ``Policies and Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts'' (FAA Order 1050.1D), this action is categorically excluded per Appendix 3, paragraph 4e(2). Paperwork Reduction Act This proposed rule contains no information collection requests requiring approval of the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 et seq.). International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and Joint Aviation Regulations (JAR) The FAA has determined that this proposal, if adopted, would not conflict with any international agreements of the United States. Conclusion For reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings in the Regulatory Flexibility Determination and the International Trade Impact Analysis, the FAA has determined that this regulation is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. In addition, the FAA certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This regulation is not considered significant under Order DOT 2100.5, Policies and Procedures for Simplification, Analysis and Review of Regulations. A final regulatory evaluation of the proposed regulation, including a final Regulatory Flexibility Determination and International Trade Impact Analysis has been placed in the docket.
