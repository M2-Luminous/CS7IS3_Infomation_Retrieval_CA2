They said the government will seek a revision of the Insurance Business Law in fiscal 1995 to allow brokers to sell policies for different insurance companies. Japan is also willing to liberalize in stages the insurance markets for disabilities, diseases and nursing to meet U.S. demands in the talks, the sources said. Foreign insurance companies control a major share in those fields. But Japan will refuse to introduce numerical targets for market opening, the focus of the insurance negotiations as well as in other talks, they said. The U.S. is demanding that the foreign share of the Japanese insurance market be increased to 10 percent from the present 2 percent. The sources said negotiations on this issue are likely to drag on until the scheduled Japan-U.S. summit in Washington on February 11 between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton.
