The State Statistics Bureau (SSB) said in a release today that 4,989 towns out of a total of over 50,000 have registered an agricultural and industrial output value of more than 100 million yuan (about 12 million U.S. dollars) each. Among these towns, called China's "100-million-yuan towns," 72 enjoyed an output value of more than 1 billion yuan (some 120 million dollars) and 434 boasted at least 500 million yuan (some 60 million dollars) in output. The township is China's fundamental governmental unit. The mushrooming of comparatively wealthy towns is considered an indication of the upgrading of China's rural economy. Statistics show that the "100-million-yuan towns," home to 20 percent of China's total rural population, produced half of the country's rural output value, and two-thirds of China's rural industrial output value. The booming rural industries have been the biggest contributors to the development of the wealthy towns, the statistics show. In these towns non-agricultural production accounted for 88 percent of total output value, about 24 percentage points higher than the country's average. The output value of township enterprises in these prosperous communities made up 52 percent of the country's total. Most of the towns are scattered in the southeastern coastal areas, mainly in the provinces of Jiangsu, Shandong and Zhejiang, where rapid economic growth has taken place over the past decade. Experts said this manifested the disparity of economic growth in different areas in China. However, they said, the most encouraging si'nal is that 100-million-yuan towns have sprung up in poor areas, especially in the western part of China.
