"They were, as a matter of fact, laid on the negotiating table by the Chinese Government right from the beginning," the official said. Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs office of the State Council, made these remarks in a speech delivered here today at a luncheon given in his honor by several local organizations. He said that before the Sino-British negotiation on the Hong Kong issue, the Chinese Government had worked out a 12-point policy regarding the Hong Kong issue under the instructions of the then top Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. The 12-point policy, which was later laid down in the Sino-British joint declaration and in the Basic Law, is the basic policy of the Chinese Government regarding Hong Kong, he said. According to Lu, before the Sino-British negotiation on the Hong Kong issue, Deng Xiaoping personally held talks with people from Hong Kong and sent people to Hong Kong for many times to make field studies. A special team was then set up to look into this question, said Lu Ping. As a member of the team himself, Lu said that the team first analysed the factors leading to the economic success in Hong Kong and the conditions under which they were formed. He said that the 12-point policy was formulated following the positive answer that the team had got after studying whether these factors could continue after 1997. Lu Ping quoted Deng Xiaoping's speech in 1984 while meeting with the then British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe as saying that "Hong Kong's prosperity and stability cannot be maintained without a guarantee on its continued capitalist system." "I am confident that the principle of `one country, two systems' is workable," Deng Xiaoping was quoted as saying.
