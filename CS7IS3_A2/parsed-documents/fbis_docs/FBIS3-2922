While joining the deputies' discussion and listening to their views, Premier Li Peng also chipped in and discussed with the deputies ways and means to expedite reform and development. In light of Hebei's actual situation, Provincial Governor Ye Liansong said: "Commodity prices, especially prices of goods closely related to people's livelihood, have a direct bearing on social stability." Li Peng supported his view, saying: "There are 23 kinds of goods which are closely related to people's livelihood, including the essential ones in their `food baskets.' In recent years Hebei has been attaching great importance to the `food basket' project and has done a fairly good job in promoting direct trade between consumers and producers. I hope you will sum up your experiences so that you can continue to improve your work." Cattle raising has been developing quite rapidly in Hebei. Deputy Li Bingliang, deputy secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, especially mentioned Li Fucheng, a major cattleman in Sanhe County. Li Peng said: "I have visited his cattle farm. I even met him when he made a special trip to Beijing during the Spring Festival this year!" Li Bingliang said: The size of Li Fucheng's cattle production has been expanding ever since his cattle raising business was semimechanized. His cattle inventory last year exceeded 4,700 head; and he made a net profit of 6 million yuan from the $5 million foreign exchange he created by selling 1,700 head of cattle. Li was pleased with the report, saying: "Cattle raising is profitable in many ways. Cattle bred for meat yield high economic returns. In addition to meat, cow hide and bone can be extensively processed into useful products. Cattle eat straw and their droppings are good manure for soil improvement and can also be used for producing marsh gas. Hebei has advantage in this regard in many ways, and I hope that this project will continue to be a success." Deputy Cheng Weigao, secretary of the provincial party committee of Hebei, a major cotton producing region in the country, said that low state-set prices for cotton and drought are major problems hindering Hebei's cotton output. Li Peng asked: "Are there any cotton plant comrades here? How much do you pay for one dan [50 kg] of cotton?" Deputy Zhang Fenge, a worker of the No. 1 Handan State-Operated Cotton Yarn Plant, stood up and gave Li Peng an answer. Li Peng said: "I mentioned in the government work report that the state will pay a higher price for cotton, but the textile industry may not be able to tolerate if the price is raised excessively. And so I think this problem can only be resolved step by step along with the establishment of the socialist market economic system and price restructuring. As for the impact from drought, can we solve the problem by developing water conservation measures, such as sprinkling irrigation, as well as by improving cotton strains to make them more drought resistant?" When Deputy Liu Hanzhang, director of the Handan Iron and Steel Works, took the floor, Li Peng asked him with concern: "I visited your plant in 1988. Has its annual output reached 1 million tonnes yet?" After he received a positive answer, Li Peng said: When I visited your plant, your annual output was only 800,000 tonnes or so. Then Li Peng asked Liu about his plant's production situation as well as the way it obtained its coal, iron, and other raw materials and the types of products it produces and their quality. Li Peng specially empasized the importance of high technology, saying that high technology not only can yield higher returns, but also can conserve large amounts of energy. Li Peng asked Deputy Xu Ji, director of the Kailuan Mining Bureau: "Have you solved your water problems? How is production? Have you totally removed price control? What is the all-personnel labor productivity?" Xu Qi answered all the questions, feeling very excited that Premier Li Peng was so familiar with the situation in Kailuan and other areas in Hebei. He also factually reflected the bureau's problems but pledged to live up to the premier's expectations. Li Peng said: Hebei has fairly good natural conditions and fine revolutionary traditions, and it has made fairly fast progress in its development since adoption of the reform and opening up policy. This shows that as long as leading cores at various levels are united, work with one heart and one mind, and deal with common problems with concerted efforts, they can expedite economic construction and make new progress in both material and spiritual construction under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. On improving state-operated enterprises, Li Peng stressed that leading authorities at all levels should place this project high on the agendas, take effective measures to create an environment favorable for business, and help enterprises solve their problems through upgrading their technology and management. He said enterprises should give full scope to their initiatives by taking advantage of the opportunities created by various reform measures. Li Peng said: As a major agricultural province, Hebei should pay special attention to developing water-efficient agriculture and scientific farming, and diversify operations on the basis of stabilizing grain and cotton production. As soon as the premier finished saying "I wish Hebei greater success and faster progress every year!" the hall reverberated with applause and laughter.
