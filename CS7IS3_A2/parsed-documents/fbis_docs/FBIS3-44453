The comments came after the government issued a directive asking them to turn down invitations from the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) for the Special Administrative Region [SAR] Preparatory Committee to discuss transitional matters. The chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants' Association, Peter Wong Hyo, said it was imperative for them to discuss transitional matters with PWC members, particularly for the civil service. "I think the government should not be too sensitive on this. It is absurd that we should seek approval from our supervisors before meeting the PWC members," he said. Despite his strong advocation of having contacts with the PWC, Mr Wong said the unfriendly political climate made it difficult for them to sit on the panel, as suggested by a PWC member Vincent Lo Hong-sui. "I think it is embarrassing for us to sit on the panel. But we hope the PWC members will take our opinions into consideration," Mr Wong said. The chairman of the Local Inspectors' Association Robert Chau Chuen-kung, said he did not see any problems with them having contact with the PWC. "I personally find nothing wrong for us to be consulted by the PWC, as long as we act according to the Official Secrets Act," he said. "But since the Government has issued the directive, we must abide by it or risk our job prospects." Although Mr Chau said civil servants could refrain from sitting on the PWC, which was a consultative body, he called on the government to let them join the SAR Preparatory Committee to be set up in 1996 to finalise details of the post-1997 government. "We are talking about convergence, which is very important to Hong Kong and cannot be done within a matter of 24 hours. We need to prepare for it" he said. His concern was shared by the chairman of the 15,000-strong Government Employees' Association Cheng Chung-wai, who feared that civil servants would be discriminated against by the Government if they established close links with the PWC. "The participation of civil servants will be of great help to the PWC's work and, in turn, will benefit the smooth transition of Hong Kong," he said. Mr Cheng said about 90 percent of civil servants would stay in Hong Kong after 1997 and there was an urgent need to get their views and concerns through to the Beijing Government. The deputy chairman of the Association for Expatriate Civil Servants (AECS) Barry Brown, said the group would work according to the decision of the senior Civil Service Council. It might not be appropriate for civil servants to become members of the PWC, but they should give their opinions on the transition to their members. Mr Brown said the AECS was particularly concerned about the definition of locals and whether they would be allowed to serve Hong Kong after 1997. Article 99 of the Basic Law stipulates that public servants be permanent residents of Hong Kong.
