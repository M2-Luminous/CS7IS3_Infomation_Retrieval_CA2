FR940428-2-00072 FR940428-2-00044 Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement AGENCY: Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, Interior. ACTION: Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement and to hold scoping meetings. SUMMARY: The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) proposes to revise a draft environmental impact statement (EIS) which analyzed the environmental impacts of the alternatives for rulemakings that would (1) define the term Valid Existing Rights (VER), and (2) determine the degree, if any, to which subsidence resulting from underground coal mining is subject to the prohibitions of section 522(e) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 2977 (SMCRA). OSM invites comments on the scope of the analysis and will hold scoping meetings upon request. OSM would like to emphasize, however, the comments received on the previous draft EIS are being considered and need not be re-submitted. DATES: Written comments: OSM will accept written comments on the scope of the EIS until 5 p.m. Eastern Time on May 31, 1994. Scoping meetings: OSM will meet with interested persons upon request to discuss the scope of the EIS until May 31, 1994. See ADDRESSES for the location of the meetings. ADDRESSES: Written comments: Hand deliver to the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, Administrative Record, room 660, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., Washington, DC; or mail to the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, Administrative Record 660&hyph;NC, 1951 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20240. Scoping meetings: Upon request, OSM staff will be available to meet with interested persons, individually or in groups, during the comment period at the following OSM locations: Eastern Support Center, Ten Parkway Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15220 (Contact: Chuck Wolf, 412&hyph;937&hyph;2897); Western Support Center, 1020 15th Street, Second Floor, Denver, Colorado 80202 (Contact: Floyd McMullen, 303&hyph;844&hyph;3104); Knoxville Field Office, 530 Gay Street, suite 500, Knoxville, Tennessee 37902 (Contact: Gary Tucker, 615&hyph;545&hyph;4122); and Branch of Environmental and Economic Analysis, rm 640, 800 North Capitol Street, Washington, DC 20002 (Contact: Andy Devito, 202&hyph;343&hyph;5150).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: OSM proposes to revise the draft EIS that was made available to the public on April 19, 1991 (56 FR 16102). The draft EIS analyzed the environmental impacts of the alternatives for a rulemaking that would (1) define the term VER, and (2) determine the degree, if any, to which subsidence resulting from underground coal mining is subject to the prohibitions of section 522(e) of SMCRA. OSM had decided to issue a revised draft for two reasons. First, prior to the close of the comment period on the April 1991 draft EIS, OSM published a notice (56 FR 33170, July 18, 1991), which informed the pubic that, in response to an inquiry from OSM, the Department of the Interior's Office of the Solicitor had recently revised the issue of whether the prohibitions of section 522(e) of SMCRA apply to subsidence resulting from underground coal mining, and issue a Memorandum Opinion (M&hyph;36971, July 10, 1991). The Solicitor's Memorandum Opinion concluded that the best interpretation of SMCRA is that subsidence is not a surface coal mining operation subject to the prohibitions of section 522(e). The July 18, 1991 Federal Register notice also stated that OSM had determined that existing regulations were consistent with the position and, therefore, no further rulemaking on the issue was necessary. In an August 1, 1991 notice (56 FR 36843), extending the comment period on the draft EIS, OSM informed the public that commenters should be aware that since the issuance of the draft EIS, the issue of whether and to what degree subsidence is covered by the mining prohibitions set forth in section 522(e) of SMCRA, had been resolved as a result of the Solicitor's Opinion and the July 18 1991 Federal Register notice. In September 1991, a lawsuit was filed against the Secretary, challenging the July 18, 1991 Federal Register notice. On September 22, 1993, in National Wildlife Federation v. Babbitt, No. 91&hyph;2275, (D.D.C.), the court held that OSM's July 18, 1991 Federal Register notice concerning the applicability of section 522(e) to subsidence was a legislative rule issued in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The court remanded the matter to the Secretary for rulemaking in accordance with the requirements of the APA. The court also noted for the record that OSM must either prepare an EIS or state on the record the reasons why an EIS had not bee prepared. OSM also intends to publish a new proposed rule defining VER.
