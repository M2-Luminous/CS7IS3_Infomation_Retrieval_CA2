This Order is issued pursuant to: (1) Commission rule 30.3(a), 17 CFR 30.3(a) (1993), which makes it unlawful for any person to engage in the offer or sale of a foreign option product until the Commission, by order, authorizes such foreign option to be offered or sold in the United States; and (2) the Commission's Order issued on July 20, 1988, 53 FR 28840 (July 29, 1988), authorizing certain option products traded on the Montreal Exchange to be offered or sold in the United States. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 4, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jane C. Kang, Esq., Division of Trading and Markets, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20581. Telephone: (202) 254&hyph;8955. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission has issued the following Order: Order Under Commission Rule 30.3(a) Permitting Option Contracts on the 3-month Canadian Bankers' Acceptance Futures Contract Traded on the Montreal Exchange to be Offered or Sold in the United States Thirty Days after Publication of this Notice in the Federal Register . By Order issued on July 20, 1988 (``Initial Order''), the Commission authorized, pursuant to Commission rule 30.3(a), 1 certain option products traded on the Montreal Exchange to be offered or sold in the United States. 53 FR 28840 (July 29, 1988). Among other conditions, the Initial Order specified that: 1 Commission rule 30.3(a), 17 CFR 30.3(a) (1993), makes it unlawful for any person to engage in the offer or sale of a foreign option product until the Commission, by order, authorizes such foreign option to be offered or sold in the United States. Except as otherwise permitted under the Commodity Exchange Act and regulations thereunder, *␣*␣* no offer or sale of any Montreal Exchange option product in the United States shall be made until thirty days after publication in the Federal Register of notice specifying the particular option(s) to be offered or sold pursuant to this Order. By letter dated February 9, 1994 the Montreal Exchange represented that it would be introducing an option contract based on the 3-month Canadian Bankers' Acceptance Futures Contract. The Montreal Exchange has requested that the Commission supplement its Initial Order and subsequent Order 2 authorizing Options on the Government of Canada Bond Futures by also authorizing the Montreal Exchange's Option Contract on the 3-month Canadian Bankers' Acceptance Futures Contract to be offered or sold to persons in the United States. Upon due consideration, and for the reasons previously discussed in the Initial Order, the Commission believes that the request for authorization to offer or sell an option contract on the 3-month Canadian Bankers' Acceptance Futures Contract should be granted. 2 See 56 FR 3207 (January 29, 1991). Accordingly, pursuant to Commission rule 30.3(a) and the Commission's Initial Order issued on July 20, 1988, and subject to the terms and conditions specified therein, the Commission hereby authorizes the Montreal Exchange's Option Contract on the 3-month Canadian Bankers' Acceptance Futures Contract to be offered or sold to persons located in the United States thirty days after publication of this Order in the Federal Register .
