He held the Israeli Government fully responsible for this criminal act perpetrated by malicious Zionist settlers in collaboration with regular Israeli military forces. In a statement issued today after a meeting held by some PNC members in Jordan, al-Za'nun added that the criminal practices against our people's masses in the occupied homeland are a natural result of the occupation and the Israeli settlements that are spread throughout the occupied territories. He demanded the dismantlement and removal of the settlements and the repatriation of the settlers. He also demanded the full withdrawal of the occupation army from occupied Palestinian territories, including holy Jerusalem. Al-Za'nun called for offering help and support to the steadfast kinsfolk in the occupied homeland and for holding a PNC session.
