U.S. Analysts on Russia's Future"] [Text] A book entitled Russia in the Year 2010 and What It Means for the World has been published in the United States. THE NEW YORK TIMES reviewed the book and described it as the "methodology of informed forecasting," in which "the social, political, and economic forces operating in Russia are separated from the myths, then these forces are formed into various structures and unexpected changes made in them." The book, which, according to THE NEW YORK TIMES, provides an "invaluable service" for anyone "trying to predict where Russia is going," was the by-product of research by its authors, Daniel Joergen and Professor Thane Gustafson of Georgetown University. The book will disappoint people looking for an unequivocal answer to the question posed in the title, namely what Russia will be like in the year 2010. Instead the reader is offered four scenarios for the possible development of events. The so-called "miracle" scenario takes him to 17 May 2010 when, in the trade center built for the Moscow stock exchange, the head of a major Russian bank announces the purchase of the seventh largest U.S. bank. Thus symbolically summing up the successful implementation of market reforms. The "Russian bear" scenario makes a diametrically opposite forecast: A military parade is under way in Moscow's Red Square to mark the eighth anniversary of a successful military coup. The Kremlin towers are adorned with two-headed eagles, slogans proclaim the glory of the supreme commander in chief and the valiant Russian Army. According to the other two scenarios, Russia either gradually breaks up in the grip of political and economic paralysis or continues to vegetate under the leadership of an authoritarian group of officials, representatives of the military-industrial complex, state enterprise directors, and the Army command. Strictly speaking, all these scenarios only summarize the very extensive range of predictions and hypotheses current in the United States. The book's authors draw several conclusions which, in their opinion, will remain true however events develop. Thus they believe that, whatever happens, Russia will inevitably have increasingly close ties with the world economy. They also predict that toward the year 2010 Russian agriculture will not under any circumstances be able to find its feet even if it passes entirely into private hands, since the countryside is too ravaged and lacking in manpower. The authors' main conclusion throws down a challenge to those who are banking on the West in the formation of the new Russia. They write confidently: "Ultimately Russia will of course write its own history by itself...."
