Justice Kriegler, chairman of the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), "whose visits to Bophuthatswana preceded the toppling of Mr Mangope, has descended on Ulundi to demand the cooperation of the kwaZulu Government in the running of the election." "Clearly the ANC is plotting what it calls a popular uprising to get rid of Chief Buthelezi; the government is sending more troops into Natal in case of trouble; Mr Justice Kriegler is intent on getting the election run the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] way, and Chief Buthelezi and the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] are making concessions, but not enough to stave off intervention" from the TEC. THE STAR Zwelithini Can Establish Cooperation in Kwazulu -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 28 March in a page 14 editorial believes the "dire situation in kwaZulu/Natal has come about primarily because Buthelezi and his Cabinet will not use their power to ensure a free vote and a free boycott. The chief minister's reassurances to the contrary are mocked by armed supporters occupying stadiums; the situation is untenable. Something is going to have to give, and the question is not whether an election will take place in the province, but at what cost." THE STAR believes Zulu King Zwelithini can establish the "requisite degree of stability and co-operation" in kwaZulu "if he were to make an independent and visionary intervention, persuading his subjects to allow those who want to vote to do so freely, and those who wish to stay away to exercise the same freedom of choice, peacefully." BUSINESS DAY TEC Must Intervene 'Legally' in Kwazulu Issue -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 28 March in a page 6 editorial says "KwaZulu seems likely to have freedom imposed on it this week. The question will be whether government and the Transitional Executive Council can do so legally and relatively peacefully before ANC revolutionaries do it for them." "It is probably too much to hope that the TEC will admonish ANC leaders for their increasingly militant threats to take matters into their own hands. It is not just the hotheads in the ANC Natal leadership who are threatening to overthrow KwaZulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi. And Cyril Ramaphosa, the ANC's senior TEC representative who announced the decision to depose the Bophuthatswana administration, leaves no room for doubt that the ANC's demand is free political activity or else." BUSINESS DAY believes Buthelezi's continued rule in the "kwaZulu homeland will depend on the degree to which he, his administration and his party assist the democratic process." However, securing political freedom in Natal should be through orders "given by civil authority, not militants and revolutionaries." Eroded Police Morale, Need for Restructuring -- "Police morale is being eroded on two fronts -- at the top, where long-serving, mostly right-wing officers worry about their future under a new government, and in the lower ranks, where policemen are frequently killed or injured in the many-sided political conflict," notes a second editorial on the same page. Now, if the Goldstone interim report implicating senior policemen in gun running and hit squad activities are is upheld by the international inquiry, "the way will be open for a purge and substantial restructuring." In the restructuring there are "strong reasons to support the suggestion by Institute of Defence Policy executive director Jakkie Cilliers that the police's public order function should be transferred to a separate arm of the new national defence force. The SAP [South African Police] can then devote itself to community policing and fighting crime, which have been badly neglected because of the force's quasi-military role in the political turmoil." SOWETAN De Klerk Must Take Necessary Steps in KwaZulu Issue -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 28 March in a page 12 editorial says President de Klerk is "naive" to believe the mere assurances of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi will ensure free and fair elections in kwaZulu and the rest of Natal. "The IFP's political options have been reduced to the far-fetched concept of a sovereign Zulu kingdom and the hope that international mediation would deliver on its constitutional demands. A successful poll in Natal next month would mean a guaranteed ANC victory and a power shift away from Ulundi. The wrecking of the elections in Natal is therefore an imperative for the IFP." "De Klerk's political dilemma is understandable. He does not want to be seen as a pawn in an alleged ANC scheme to make kwaZulu ungovernable. His responsibilities as head of Government, however, demand that he takes the necessary steps to ensure free and fair elections and end the bloodshed in Natal."
