[Butrus-Ghali] Of course, we welcome the decision of 9 February. In fact, the United Nations acted as a kind of catalyst with its letter to Manfred Woerner. We confronted NATO with its responsibility and thus contributed to their new determined position. [Difraoui] Who will decide on air strikes when the ultimatum has expired: NATO or the United Nations? [Butrus-Ghali] First of all, we hope it will not get that far and negotiations will lead to heavy weapons being handed over to the blue helmets before the ultimatum expires. The United Nations and NATO are cooperating closely. Who will give the "all clear" for possible air strikes has not been determined. [Difraoui] If you are allowed to do so, will you start air strikes? [Butrus-Ghali] I would not hesitate one moment to enforce the Security Council's decisions by means of air strikes. If NATO gives me a mandate, I can act immediately because I already have a UN mandate. [Difraoui] Could air strikes fail because of Russian opposition? [Butrus-Ghali] Certain members of the Security Council, such as the Russian Federation, have their own interpretation of certain security resolutions, as far as the difference between air support and air strikes is concerned. They consider these two things as completely separate. But at the moment, the Russian Federation shares the same aims as the United States, the European Union [EU], and the United Nations, and it plays an active role in the Geneva talks. [Difraoui] Would not a lifting of sanctions have been more effective than the threat of air strikes? [Butrus-Ghali] Lifting the embargo is a decision that the Security Council has to take. So far, the Security Council has rejected doing this. [Difraoui] In your capacity as Secretary General -- are you tending toward lifting the embargo? [Butrus-Ghali] My position has various nuances. I will follow the Security Council's decision. I think that the Security Council has to accept responsibility for such a decision. [Difraoui] In view of the continuing massacres, there are numerous voices in the world that advocate a tougher approach.... [Butrus-Ghali] I can understand the worldwide feeling of dismay. I am suffering as well, I am alarmed by the massacres, the genocide, the rapes. I am shocked. Nevertheless, public emotions have to be restrained in order to be able to go on negotiating. [Difraoui] Has the United Nations been able to determine yet who is to blame for the massacre in the Sarajevo market? [Butrus-Ghali] No, we are still investigating. Paradoxically, these investigations are very difficult because there was only one shell involved and not several. If there are more than one explosion, it is easier to determine where the shells come from. [Difraoui] In your opinion, who is mainly responsible for the continuation of the war? [Butrus-Ghali] This is a difficult question. We are all responsible, of course there are the warring parties, but also those who did not want to intervene. As far back as last May, the Security Council demanded 8,000 blue helmets for Bosnia. We (the General Secretariat) asked for 30,000 troops. So far, we have not even gotten the 8,000. Of course, the continuation of the war is mainly the fault of the warring parties, who are sisters and brothers really -- but it is also the fault of the international community. It does not make the necessary efforts to find a solution. There are not enough funds being made available. [Difraoui] Several UN generals in former Yugoslavia, such as Francis Briquemont and Jean Cot, criticized exactly that. They blamed the United Nations for not providing enough troops -- and this is why they had to go. [Butrus-Ghali] I can understand their standpoint. But the United Nations does not have any troops of its own. It is the member states that supply the United Nations with troops. We kept asking, we sent letters to dozens of countries. We did not get anything. It is, therefore, not our fault. The United Nations has fulfilled its task and has established contact with the member states, but it did not get a single soldier.... [Difraoui] Is this not a situation where everybody is blaming everybody else -- the United Nations is blaming the member countries, and the member countries are blaming the United Nations? [Butrus-Ghali] No, I do not think so. We have always demanded troops and additional material to carry out our task properly. We need a maximum number of troops in order to achieve maximum results. But still, we will not blame the countries that have not sent any troops. There are 124 member countries, and you cannot blame them all -- but the United Nations is being blamed. [Difraoui] Where did the United Nations make mistakes? Where are you blaming yourself? [Butrus-Ghali] The only thing for which we can blame ourselves is that we have not managed to convince the member states of the necessity of having more troops there. That we have not managed to convince them to pay their contributions. We are in a bad financial crisis -- $1 billion are outstanding. [Difraoui] Is this not also due to mismanagement and corruption within the UN administration? [Butrus-Ghali] Various newspapers keep reporting gigantic failures within our administration. This is an exaggeration. I have nominated an inspector to fight corruption; as soon as problems become obvious, sanctions will be taken. On the subject of mismanagement: One has to remember that with the same administration, the same number of people, we are no longer carrying out three, but 17 international peacekeeping missions. We have not taken on one single additional person. We have troops in Burundi, Rwanda, observers in South Africa, soldiers in Cambodia, Somalia, a military presence in the Spanish Sahara, in El Salvador.... The fact that we manage to do all this speaks for itself. Cambodia was a particular success. The United Nations managed to create stable conditions for free and fair elections. Yasushi Akashi, the United Nations' special envoy in Cambodia is now in charge for former Yugoslavia. [Difraoui] Does this mean you feel unfairly treated by world opinion? [Butrus-Ghali] To put it simply, public opinion looks for a scapegoat and blames the United Nations. I would not say that we do not make any mistakes. But the mistakes arise from our being inundated with work. At the same time, we do not have either the military or the logistic means to carry out 22 operations. This is our weakness. We have the funds for three, four missions, but not for 22. [Difraoui] After a long debate, Germany is now finally deploying blue helmets -- not for military missions, but for humanitarian and logistical support. Should the Federal Republic not provide combat forces? [Butrus-Ghali] No!!! -- What counts for me is that Germany takes part in UN activities at all. It is up to the individual member country to choose which field it is most interested in. Peacekeeping missions are only 30 percent of all UN missions; 70 percent are environmental measures, economic and social cooperation, development aid, etc. There is a lot to be done every week. [Difraoui] This means there will be no Bundeswehr bombers over former Yugoslavia? [Butrus-Ghali] Our policy is that every country can decide itself what it wants to offer. We accept anything. One state could say: We are prepared to send aircraft, another one sends a hospital. A third: We are going to send troops, but only under the condition that they do not fight. [Difraoui] If you had the opportunity to do so, how would you change the composition of the Security Council, which goes back to the times of the Cold War? [Butrus-Ghali] I would not make any suggestions, but I would think practically: Who pays, who sends people.... [Difraoui] Germany pays almost one-twelfth of the contributions. Would not Germany have the right, if not to a seat on the Security Council, at least to house some of the important UN organizations? The United Nations promised this indirectly on several occasions? [Butrus-Ghali] Yes, I was in Bonn for this reason, and we will transfer several UN organizations there. But I would also like to say that it is more important to have many German engineers within UN organizations worldwide than to have the headquarters of these organizations in Germany. [Difraoui] But if the Germans would like to have more of the United Nations in their country.... [Butrus-Ghali] We have achieved this. During the next few months we will transfer a division of the UNDP, that is the UN development aid program, to Bonn. [Difraoui] But this is not an important organization.... [Butrus-Ghali] You have to start making small steps. [Difraoui] Do you intend moving a human rights organization to Germany in the future? [Butrus-Ghali] We can talk about that when such an organization is established.... I will come to Bonn during the next few months. I would like the Germans to take an even more active part in UN activities. I am counting on Germany's role in the world to strengthen the United Nations' role. As I said before, this does not only mean peacekeeping missions, this is just one activity. There is a summit on social development going on in Copenhagen; there will be a summit on overpopulation in Cairo next year; in 1995 Beijing will host a summit on women. These are examples for important contributions and technological help of a country like Germany.... [Difraoui] Are you content with the situation in Somalia? [Butrus-Ghali] After the withdrawal of the Belgian, French, U.S., and German troops we are trying to do our best, replacing them with African and Asian units. [Difraoui] Is this not a failure? [Butrus-Ghali] No. Of course, we have not been successful in the south of Mogadishu. But in the entire rest of the country, and this is 95 percent, we were successful. We have established local police forces, local councils, hospitals, orphanages, etc.; food supply is safeguarded, children no longer die of hunger.... These are very positive things. [Difraoui] The only peace talks that brought about concrete results last year were those between Israel and the PLO. The United Nations did not have a share in these -- is this not typical? [Butrus-Ghali] No, there is no text of the United Nations that says that the United Nations holds a monopoly on conflict solving. On the contrary, I would be very pleased if the Israeli-Palestinian conflict were solved tomorrow outside the framework of the United Nations. I would also be content if the conflicts in Burundi or Rwanda were solved by the Organization of African Unity. As I said, I am overburdened. I do not have the means to care for 22 sick persons, if I have only beds for three or four available. If anybody else wants to solve a conflict, I am the first person who will be pleased about it. [Difraoui] During the Gulf war the idea of a new world order was emphasized. Was this not a big illusion? [Butrus-Ghali] I have never said that there is a world order, not to speak of a new one. The only thing I said was that a new world order must be established -- and that the United Nations can help develop it.
