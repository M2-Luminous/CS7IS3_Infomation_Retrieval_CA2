He said security in these areas was good by virtue of SNA supporters discharging their responsibilities towards the Somali people's unity and love of peace. He said: It is important to note the existence of bandit gangs taking advantage of the difficult times in the country to rob and kill Somalis. He called on the bandits to stop causing chaos in Mogadishu, the capital, and in the regions and on the people collectively to counter the bandits. Abdi Hassan Awale Qaybdid also said the United States and other forces were about to leave the country at the end of this month. It was now time for the Somali people to decide their destiny. He said: It is our duty to respect the departing forces, as well as other foreigners and foreign journalists, while upholding the Somali people's dignity and rights. Somali people must stop shooting and killing, which is illegal. He also referred to the formation of SNA district councils which was at an advanced stage and complete in some regions, such as Shabeellaha Hoose and Benaadir. He said some had been illegally formed by UN Operation in Somalia, but most Somalis realized that was a mistake. By contrast, the other district councils were formed according to the SNA leader's circular of 28 October 1993. Referring to the confusion at Mogadishu port over taxes, Abdi Qaybdid said: It is illegal and irrelevant in the absence of [words indistinct] that can guarantee the collection of taxes, adding that no foreign company had the right to levy taxes at Mogadishu port. On the drought in the central regions, he said: Lack of water and food combined with ill health is killing five to 10 people a day. He appealed to the relief organizations, the Somali people and the international community to help these areas by sending food, water and medicine to save the community which is on the verge of death. In conclusion, Abdi Hassan Awale Qaybdid, the chairman of the higher committee for internal affairs, called on the Somali people to reconcile and unite to achieve progress and justice.
