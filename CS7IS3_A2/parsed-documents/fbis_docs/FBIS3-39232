At the moment, the issue is a "balancing" of the texts, Veit Steinle, spokesman of the FRG Transporation Ministry, stated in Bonn on Friday [11 February] upon inquiry. If the U.S. side wants improvements in the agreement, the same must be done for Germany, too. It is necessary to keep a balance. Gemany is trying to end the negotiations without "excitement and panic." This is being done in the closest coordination with the Federal Government and Lufthansa, Steinle said. The talks with the U.S. company United Airlines on the contentious issue of code-sharing, which Lufthansa would like, will be continued in Washington on Friday. [passage omitted]
