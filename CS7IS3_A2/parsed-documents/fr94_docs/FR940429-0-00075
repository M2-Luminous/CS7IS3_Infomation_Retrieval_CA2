FR940429-0-00075 FR940429-0-00010 Several commenters argued that many of the specific responsibilities assigned to accrediting agencies by the various standards would force agencies into becoming government regulators. They also argued that these new requirements would require accrediting agencies to duplicate the efforts of the Department and the States and would substantially increase the paperwork burden on institutions and accrediting agencies. In their opinion, these requirements would be so burdensome to accrediting agencies in terms of time and personnel that they would shift the focus of accreditors away from their primary function_that of reviewing educational quality_to a role in which they served merely as investigative and enforcement agencies for the Federal government. While the opinions expressed above were shared by the majority of commenters on this issue, they were by no means unanimous. Some commenters from the proprietary sector, for example, had no serious objection with the standards, noting that most of what was contained in the standards was already being examined to the degree of specificity contained in the proposed regulations by either their accrediting agencies, the State, or both. Others commenters felt that the standards, as written, protected students as well as Federal dollars. One commenter thought the introductory paragraph to the required standards section should be strengthened by requiring agencies to have quantitatively validated standards that were based on a rigorous assessment of the value added by the education or training. Finally, one commenter expressed concern that the Secretary was exceeding the statute by requiring institutional accrediting agencies whose accreditation does not serve Title IV, HEA purposes to meet the student outcomes requirements of ยง602.26(b)(9). Discussion: The Secretary has given very careful thought to all the concerns raised with regard to this section. Of particular concern to the Secretary is how best to achieve an appropriate balance between the need for agencies to have rigorous standards in order to protect students' interests and the need for agencies to have flexibility in addressing these standards in order to reduce cost and burden to both agencies and institutions. Another important factor, in the Secretary's opinion, is the need to build a partnership among triad members that is based on mutual trust and allows each member the flexibility to determine the appropriate means to carry out its responsibilities under the HEA. After considering all of these factors, the Secretary has decided to eliminate all but the statutory language for each of the 12 required standards. This approach eliminates many requirements that commenters found especially burdensome, such as that in ยง602.26(b)(4) concerning annual financial audits. In addition, it allows accrediting agencies that already have rigorous standards in these areas to continue operating as they have, thus eliminating the need for additional cost to agencies and institutions to comply with the requirements of this section. While the Secretary believes it is appropriate not to prescribe specific minimum regulatory standards elaborating on the standards in the statute, the Secretary also believes that the standards contained in the NPRM provide a sound framework for a thorough assessment of these areas. For this reason, the Secretary summarizes below the major provisions contained in the NPRM concerning the statutory standards. The Secretary believes these provisions are appropriate for agencies to address in their own standards for these areas. In addition, the Secretary believes that, in addressing the development of their own standards, accrediting agencies should consider any comparable Title IV, HEA program standards and any relevant and applicable State standards developed under the State Postsecondary Review Program. However, the Secretary wishes to make it clear that this does not prevent an accrediting agency whose standards do not include all of these provisions from being recognized by the Secretary, provided the agency can justify the appropriateness of its standards as reasonable applications of the statutory standards in light of its needs, the needs and circumstances of the institutions or programs it accredits, and the students they serve. Finally, the Secretary wishes to emphasize the importance of accrediting agencies' developing their standards in such a way that they minimize burden, overlap, and duplication at the same time they ensure overall educational quality. The Secretary notes that for most of the standards discussed below there are comparable, or very similar, standards in section 494 and some in 498 of the HEA. The Secretary expects to take a leadership role in working with accrediting agencies and SPREs to ensure that the standards for all three members of the triad are complementary, rather than redundant. Fiscal and administrative capacity as appropriate to the specified scale of operations. An accrediting agency's standard for assessing this area should generally address the overall quality of an institution's or program's fiscal and administrative capacity. The assessment should examine in particular whether the institution's or program's finances are sufficiently strong to enable it to meet, and appear likely to continue to meet for the foreseeable future, all of the agency's standards for accreditation. The assessment should also include some provision for the ongoing monitoring of an institution's or program's finances throughout any period of accreditation or preaccreditation granted by the agency. The Secretary notes that section 494(d)(5) of the HEA contains a comparable SPRE review standard and sections 498 (c) and (d) of the HEA contain comparable Department standards. Recruiting and admissions practices, academic calendars, catalogs, publications, grading, and advertising. An accrediting agency's standard for assessing these areas should generally address whether they are reasonable in light of an institution's or program's educational mission, reflect good practice, and accurately reflect actual practice. The Secretary notes that sections 494(d) (1), (2), and (12) of the HEA contain comparable SPRE review standards. Program length and tuition and fees in relation to the subject matters taught and the objectives of the degrees or credentials offered. An accrediting agency's standard for assessing this area should generally address the appropriateness of an institution's program length and tuition and fees, taking into account such factors as program objectives and content, the types and locations of instructional delivery, the knowledge and skills necessary for students to reach competence in the field being taught, and generally accepted practices in higher education. The Secretary notes that section 494(d)(7) of the HEA contains a comparable SPRE review standard.
