David Stahlavsky was present on behalf of Czech Radio Radiozurnal. [Stahlavsky] [passage omitted] Josef Zieleniec does not believe that the visit by Russian nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to the Czech Republic is imminent. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy was invited by the Association for the Republic-Republican Party of Czechoslovakia. The minister is surprised that Zhirinovskiy, who professed the demise of the Czech Republic recently and made improper remarks about our country, could have been invited by anyone. He said he found it difficult to understand this. The foreign minister responded also to the Austrian effort to block the American guarantees for the completion of the Temelin nuclear power plant [south Bohemia] and to the Vienna government's endeavors to stop this construction altogether. [Begin Zieleniec recording] Our course of action is not only in line with the law, it is also fair to our neighbors. It is neither the fault of our nuclear power plant nor of anyone else that Austria has to cope with the preelection situation. Of course, we keep in touch with the Austrian Government. We try to explain to them that these matters create unnecessary tension in our neighborly relations and that there is no need for such a spectacular approach. It is a pity. I sincerely regret that irrational elements emerge in our relations with Austria. [end recording]
