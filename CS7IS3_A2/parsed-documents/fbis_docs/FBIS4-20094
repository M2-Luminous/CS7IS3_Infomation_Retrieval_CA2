"Contrary to our original intentions," Joerg Haider admitted yesterday. Why are they doing it then? "Because the chances are very favorable that we can still stop the government taking the wrong path it is taking," Haider stated. At the FPOe's special congress on the EU in Villach on 9 April, 85.5 percent of the delegates voted for the double strategy: - The FPOe members of parliament were urged to reject the EU laws; - FPOe supporters and citizens are, however, given a free choice in the referendum. At yesterday's FPOe Executive Committee meeting behind closed doors in Bad Tatzmannsdorf it was decided to initiate an anti-EU campaign. Haider said, "I myself will appear at large rallies to clearly explain the FPOe's arguments for Austria and against the EU of Maastricht." One of the FPOe's prominent politicians, Hirnschall, expressed disappointment: "This does not correspond to what was decided in Villach. There was no mention of an anti-EU campaign." Hirnschall said that the campaign is "a danger for EU membership, because it will certainly arouse emotions and heat up the atmosphere."
