One day before the plenary session, the upper house's special committee will vote on the bills, officials said. The schedule was fixed after the second chamber's special committee voted Monday to set the date of a public hearing on the bills at January 17. Officials said a vote can be taken at any time if a public hearing is called. Public hearings are mandatory for budgets and revenue bills to become law. Hearings are necessary for other bills which parties consider important. The ruling and opposition parties have agreed to require public hearings for the passage of the political reform bills, which call for introducing single-seat constituencies combined with proportional representation for House of Representatives general elections and imposing stricter controls on political funding. The bills cleared the lower house in mid-November. At Monday's session of the special committee, a ruling legislator entered a motion to set the date for the public hearing. Committee Chairman Shoji Motooka called a vote, drawing angry protests from members of two opposition parties, the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the Japanese Communist Party [JCP] legislators. Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the biggest party in the seven-party coalition, told a meeting of coalition leaders Monday, "we should not accept any proposals to put off the final vote until after January 19." Upper house deliberations on political reform bills have stalled by opposition resistance. Coalition leaders also decided not to bargain with the LDP over possible modifications unless it pledges to cooperate with the coalition in enacting the bills by the deadline of January 29, the sources said. Meanwhile, Man Sasaki, chairman of the LDP's Diet Affairs Committee, threatened to table a no-confidence motion against Motooka for calling the vote on the public hearing without the consent of the opposition camp. "It is an unprecedented parliamentary tactic to call a vote at the very moment the ruling coalition and opposition are still consulting on the upcoming parliamentary agenda," Sasaki said. The government-proposed electoral bill calls for replacing the current 511-seat lower chamber with a 500-seat mixture of 274 single-seat constituencies and 226 proportional representation seats. The LDP has been demanding that the number of single-seat constituencies be increased from the proposed 274. It has also urged the coalition to ease curbs on a proposed ban on donations from business corporations to individual politicians. Political analysts said the ruling coalition fears the package of four bills might be killed at a final vote, if more than a dozen SDP legislators voted against them, along with legislators of the Niin Club, a five-member parliamentary group in the upper house. The LDP, JCP, and Niin Club has a combined parliamentary strength of 114 in the upper house, while the ruling coalition has 131. There are also six independents.
