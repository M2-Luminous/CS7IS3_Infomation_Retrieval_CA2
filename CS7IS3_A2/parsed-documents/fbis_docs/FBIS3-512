Addressing striking workers this afternoon in Mmabatho, President Mangope informed the staff he had deccided to close down the corporation. He told the staff he would make arrangements for the collection of employees' pensions and salaries. Meanwhile, the situation in Mmabatho is volatile, following sporadic incidents of violence at the University of Bophuthatswana. Students stoned cars, mostly government cars, and the police used tear gas and rubber bullets. Earlier the Bophuthatswana government refused a request by the Independent Electoral Commission to set up voting stations for South Africans in Bophuthatswana. It has also refused to allow electioneering in the state and to allow monitoring of the election process. The National Party [NP] says that President Mangope has betrayed most of the values in which he believes. The NP said the state had become the victim of an increasingly oppressive system. The party said that Bophuthatswana was a tragic example of what could happen when leaders made the wrong decisions.
