Needless to say, one of these was the struggle for the reversion of Okinawa to Japanese rule, and the other was the "struggle for land." The first struggle came to a successful conclusion for the most part on 15 May 1972. However, the second struggle has yet to end, strictly speaking. Today, U.S. military bases which occupy a large portion of the land on Okinawa still continue to suppress and hamper the livelihood of the Okinawan people and impede Okinawa's reconstruction and development projects as well as its future, even though 23 years have already passed since reversion. Recently, however, it is heartening to see new moves toward settling Okinawa's land problems. One such move is the fact that the United States, which is the most important of the parties concerned in the land issue, has started inspecting, evaluating, and considering the issue. Taking into consideration the changes in the international political situation and the military scene due to the collapse of the Cold War structure, it is only natural that the United States has decided to review the matter. Another move is one that has been brought about by the collapse of the political structure in which the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] continuously held on to power since 1955, changes in the domestic political situation, and changes in the government's attitude regarding the issue of military bases on Okinawa. Politicians from different parties are also moving toward helping enact a bill on special measures for promoting the use of land currently occupied by military bases, upon their return. Finally, let us not overlook the fact that the local chapter of the LDP has revised its policy regarding military bases. In the past, it seemed that military base issues were a specialty of the local reformist forces. Local conservative parties, including the local chapter of the LDP, appeared to be passive about military base issues, entrapped in the framework of the Japan-U.S. security arrangement upheld by the LDP, which dominated national politics. However, the local conservatives bid farewell to their past at the local LDP chapter's convention held on 10 June. They spelled out a local-interests-oriented platform, asserting that "a new economic system and a reconstruction of the social structure is being sought," and that "progress has not been made despite efforts to reduce excessive reliance on military bases by calling for their consolidation and retrenchment." As the history of postwar "people's struggles" show, the only time that the Okinawan people emerged victorious was when they were able to put up a united front. Among the problems that Okinawa faced were the struggle for reversion and the struggle to uphold the four principles regarding safeguarding the Okinawan people's land. Such problems were basically related to domestic policies and foreign affairs. Okinawans were up against the United States as well as their own home country. Against such a solid wall, the greatest power that could pierce an opening in this wall toward solving these problems is their unity and determination. As former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has written in his book, the strength and determination of the local people can change both foreign and national policies. Currently, Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota is visiting the United States in a bid to resolve such issues related to military bases as the return of the naval port in Naha, return of the Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield, and suspension of live-shell firing exercises across prefectural route 104. On 10 June, Ota met with Hawaii Governor John Waihee and held a news conference with U.S. reporters, during which he explained the situation of U.S. military bases on Okinawa and tried to gain understanding on the purpose of his U.S. visit. During the same news conference, U.S. Representative Neil Abercrombie, who is a member of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, disclosed that a provision for a total review of U.S. military bases on Okinawa has been included in a bill calling for a review of national defense for fiscal year 1995. The bill was recently approved by the House Armed Services Committee. The representative reportedly has also said: "Firm demands by Governor Ota are necessary so that the United States will actually conduct a total review of its military bases on Okinawa." It is hoped that with the Okinawan people firmly backing him up, the governor can turn his U.S. visit and his efforts at "direct diplomacy" into a tremendously fruitful mission. Although it may be a little early at this stage, groundwork should eventually be laid down to handle matters in the event the land occupied by military bases are turned over. In this regard, it is urged that a law on special measures for promoting diversion of military-occupied land be enacted during the current Diet session by all means.
