FR940503-2-00047 FR940503-2-00033 21. Arizona Public Service Company [Docket No. ER94&hyph;1171&hyph;000] Take notice that on April 20, 1994, Arizona Public Service Company (APS) tendered for filing the Reciprocal Transmission Service Agreement (Agreement) between APS and PacifiCorp. The enclosed Agreement essentially proposed two transmission service arrangements: (1) APS will provide 30 MW of interim firm transmission service for PacifiCorp over the Cholla/Four Corners System until PacifiCorp's Four Corners/Borah-Brady System is able to accommodate additional transmission for APS; and (2) at such time as PacifiCorp's Four Corners/Borah-Brady System has sufficient capacity to accommodate additional transmission for APS, the Agreement then converts to a classical ``reciprocal'' type arrangement whereby APS and PacifiCorp will each provide 30 MW of firm unidirectional reciprocal transmission to the other. Comment date: May 6, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph E at the end of this notice. 22.
