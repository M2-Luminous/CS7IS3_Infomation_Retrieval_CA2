In the introduction to the annual report Tietmeyer writes that the central bank has carefully sounded out the existing margin in a difficult situation. With the slowing down of the persistent inflation and the resulting positive developments on the financial markets, the preconditions for an "appropriate and lasting" economic growth have improved decisively. "Monetary policy did not and does not prevent the process of economic recovery." A "short-winded" monetary policy, which would have reduced the central bank interest rates aggressively and without consideration for the reemerging expectations of inflation, would hardly be so successful. "Cautious action, aimed at making positive expectations permanent, was, in the end, also in the interest of the other European countries." Also with a view to the second stage of the European Monetary Union, which has already begun, no doubts must arise about the orientation of German monetary policy toward stability. [passage omitted]
