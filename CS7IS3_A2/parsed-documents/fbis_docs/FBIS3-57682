Before signing the partnership document at the NATO headquarters, President Algirdas Brazauskas, stressed Lithuania's plans to eventually join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. "As she begins her participation in the `Partnership for Peace' program, Lithuania has a clear goal of becoming a fully-fledged NATO member," Brazauskas told ambassadors of the 16 NATO nations. That aim could bring a clash with Russia, Lithuania's mighty neighbor and former ruler. Moscow opposes any eastward expansion of the Western military alliance and reacted with alarm earlier this month, when Lithuania became the first of its former Warsaw Pact satellites to formally apply for NATO membership. President Boris Yeltsin's press secretary, Vyacheslav Kostikov warned then that Lithuania's move could provoke "a negative reaction in Russian public opinion" and play into the hands of the country's extreme nationalists. Brazauskas sought to allay Russian fears. "Lithuania's position regarding NATO membership is not directed against any neighboring or other European states," he said in a speech at NATO headquarters. The integration of Eastern European nations into NATO and other Western structures would "significantly support the strengthening and continuity of democratic processes in Russia," he added. Lithuania became the second former Warsaw Pact state to accept the "Partnership for Peace" offer made earlier in the month at a summit of alliance leaders. Romania signed up on Wednesday. [passage omitted] Brazauskas echoed the determination of other leaders that the partnership must be a step toward membership -- not a replacement for it. "I imagine that this initiative does not completely satisfy every state that is striving for closer proximity to or membership of NATO," he said. "It is a compromise plan." Under the partnership proposal, the East Europeans must share information about defense budgets and defense forces, promise civilian control over the military and standardize weapons systems. Each nation is expected to work out a specific work plan with the allies, tailored to its needs and capabilities.
