Jibril said the radio will urge Libyans to escalate the struggle to topple al-Qadhdhafi and set up a democracy in Libya. He appealed to concerned international organizations to rescue the life of Colonel (Muftah Qurdum), a Libyan opposition figure whom the Libyan Television presented on Monday [7 March] as a spy working for the United States. Qurdum introduced himself as a former Army colonel. He admitted that while residing in Switzerland he contacted Libyans living abroad, who supplied the Americans with information. He added that the Americans sought information on the Libyan Armed Forces and the Libyan missile program. They were planning to attack Libya with the help of their spies, who would then seize power. Muhammad Fayiz Jibril said Qurdum made these false confessions under duress.
