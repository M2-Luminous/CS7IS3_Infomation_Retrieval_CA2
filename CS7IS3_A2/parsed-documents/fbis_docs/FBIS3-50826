That is what he said at the end of the lunch he held with his Argentine and Uruguayan counterparts Carlos Saul Menem and Luis Alberto Lacalle at the Charrua Hill farm belonging to Samuel Liberman. For more than three hours the three presidents met with businessmen, industrialists, and some press barons. Although Wasmosy at first said that bilateral issues or those related to Mercosur [Common Market of the South] were not treated, he later explained that he talked with Menem on aspects related to the Pilcomayo River. "We are going to discuss that matter with Menem on 14 January when the Mitre Canal dredging begins. This is part of the riverways and Mercosur projects," he said. He added that he told Menem and Maria Julia Alsogaray [natural resources and environment secretary] that in Buenos Aires they will talk thoroughly about the Pilcomayo River, when Public Works Minister Engineer Carlos Vacetti and engineer Luis Alberto Meyer, director of the National Pilcomayo River Commission, will also be present. Asked whether during the dialogue on the Pilcomayo River they discussed the infrastructure that will reportedly be built to take advantage of the river's low waters, he said: "This problem does not affect Paraguay and Argentina alone. It also affects Bolivia, and after all it is also an ecological problem which needs very special attention." The Paraguayan president did not rule out the possibility of demanding compensation from Argentina for the damage caused by the diversion of the Pilcomayo River. He thus said that he will first try to solve the problem, and then seek the indemnification or some arrangement that could be achieved on the matter. Wasmosy was also consulted on whether they discussed the automatic lifting of tariffs that will be in effect among Mercosur countries, and he said that it is a subject that has a process to follow. He explained that the policy on this matter is based on achieving coordination of macroeconomic policies among Mercosur countries, because otherwise the issue will be delayed even more. Asked again why Paraguay did not submit in time the official lists of products that would be exempted from taxes, he said: "It is not true that we did not submit in time the lists of our products, but the integration treaties will be signed and fulfilled only if they bring more bread, happiness, and well-being to the inhabitants of the country." The president added that the presidents of Bolivia and Chile were invited to the meeting with the Mercosur presidents to be held in Colonia (Uruguay), but he declined to name the fundamental topics that will be discussed at that summit.
