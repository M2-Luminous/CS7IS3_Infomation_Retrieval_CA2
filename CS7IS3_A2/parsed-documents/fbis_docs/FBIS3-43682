The action is within the framework of disbanding irregular forces within the framework of the General Peace Accord. A letter sent to our news desk a few hours later questions how one would now guarantee that warehouses suppling Maputo residents are protected. The reply is not simple. The police corps cannot be everywhere and they do not have such specific missions as guarding shops and warehouses. The solution seems to be for residents, businessmen and entities to use private security companies which are growing like mushrooms in the city, with means that make the Republic of Mozambique Police jealous. A militiaman was content to receive 100,000 meticals, the private security companies vary between 250 and 1,000 contos monthly per agent. Part of the amount will end up being paid by the consumers. Who will benefit from the business? Those who saw the opportunity and put in action the appropriate mechanisms, namely the new businessmen linked to Mozambique's defense and security apparatus.
