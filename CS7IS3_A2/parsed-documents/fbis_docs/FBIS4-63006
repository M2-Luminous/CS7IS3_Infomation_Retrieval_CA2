He had also to withstand threats, numerous attacks, press libel, and unwarranted accusations by his propresidential colleagues on the Constitutional Court itself. Now, six months later, this same Valeriy Zorkin is the initiator and one of the leaders of the "Accord for Russia" movement. What kind of accord does he have in mind, and with whom? Is it possible in our country at all today? [Zorkin] I am very keen to ensure that nobody should confuse concepts such as accord and appeasement. There is and can be no accord between a criminal and his victim -- the person robbed and the robber cannot agree, and still less is it possible to agree on something with someone who has taken a life. Maybe my interpretation of the evangelical formula "Whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also" will strike you as unusual, but in my view it applies only to those who did this unintentionally, certainly not to an enemy or a criminal. Does Russia's history itself not confirm this? When enemies came, Russian people did not bow their heads before them but fought. For there have been a number of critical moments in our great history when we seemed to be approaching the very limit, the very brink, but we won just the same! Let us ask this question: Thanks to what? Thanks to the pooling of everyone's efforts and the merging of the will of individual citizens into the united will of the entire people -- in other words, thanks to accord. This is the kind of accord I mean. It is not an accord between a dispossessed people and the criminal power but an agreement within the people themselves, a kind of citizens' social charter. Its purpose is, on the basis of measures worked out by the people, to move away from the abyss into which we are all sliding. [Kasyanenko] It seems to me that today we have already gotten too far away from the line beyond which political and directly related economic phenomena were still reversible.... [Zorkin] Despite the fact that I hate it when people bang their fist or raise their voice, despite the fact that I am an opponent of radicalism and, all the more so, of barricades, I am forced to admit that without tough measures we cannot instill order in the country today or tomorrow. Order is the first of the conditions that are necessary to end the country's free fall into the abyss. For it is impossible to watch the escalation of crime, the collapse of industry, and the demise of agriculture. In the space of two or three years we have almost halved meat production and reduced the cattle population, simply butchered it, including the pedigree, elite cattle. Is this not a national disaster? Every ordinary peasant understands that it will take more than one year to restore what has been lost. So why does the government not understand it? We are told -- it is because of the imperfection of economic relationships. But I will start with something else -- because the authorities have not ensured that elementary order of ties which it must maintain and implement. These are the ties between city and countryside, between producer and processor, and between suppliers. [Kasyanenko] You quite frequently encounter facts like these, for example: A producer is paid 150 rubles [R] for a liter of milk, the dairy makes as much, if not more, out of this liter, and [retail] trade makes more again. As a result, we buy a liter of milk for R400-500 or more, the smallest proportion of which goes to the one who worked for long months to produce it. Here you cannot help thinking not just about our Russian disorganization and muddle but about a well-organized disorder which is advantageous to the authorities. [Zorkin] Of course, nothing will come of the economy until there is normal people's power free from corrupt officialdom, which today has become a veritable national disaster. Order presupposes the curbing of corruption in the power apparatuses themselves. Power must serve not itself but the people and guard and protect them. Otherwise the power becomes alienated from the people, as we have been seeing for the past two years. We must stop lying to the people and say openly what we have ended up with. We have ended up with a criminal, corrupt, antipeople state. Therefore, accord for Russia is not an appeal to live amicably in the spirit of Leopold's cat [reference to popular cartoon character]; it must be the people's accord in a united demand -- to restore the power's responsibility and capability and, on this basis, to gamble on national priorities in everything: in industry, in agriculture, in culture. For Western aid represents fairy tales for children. Everyone pursues his own interest. It is in the West's interests to turn us into a colony, into a cheap raw materials market and a dump for the world's production waste. We are already being turned into a colony. All the signs are there. English is becoming the second language in our country, and the dollar the dominant currency. According to certain information, approximately $50 billion is circulating within the country. Those who either work in commercial structures geared mainly to the West or who serve the mafia live well in our country. All the rest are plunging into poverty. Our national culture is being lost. A certain cacophony of destruction reigns in the country. And yet we have a very rich history and country and a splendid people -- supersensitive and supersincere. We must turn to the roots from which we grew and go our own way without copying anyone. The peasant commune, for example, is a primordial Russian institution. Is it not the linchpin of the collectivism inherent in our people? Without it the Russian person becomes a part of the crowd or an isolated grain of sand, certainly not a constituent part of the people's original life. Thus, in my view the main, basic principles must be order, people's power, and national priorities in the economy and in culture. We base accord on the principles which stem from reason, from the people's soul. As you see, they are nonparty principles and can be reduced to a single denominator -- the principles of patriotism, enlightened patriotism, I would say. [Kasyanenko] It is difficult to object to anything here. They really are fine principles. But what about the mechanism for realizing them? [Zorkin] This mechanism aimed at changing the situation must be systemic, since the crisis which has hit the country is precisely of a systemic nature. It is impossible to change the situation of the miners without changing the situation in the whole country. It is impossible to help the peasant without having resolved the problems of the energy complex or the machine-building complex. Measures to surmount the crisis must be based on the people's trust, and the people must be aware of them and support them. "Accord for Russia" is not a contract among a few people in Moscow nor their contract with the people. Everyone must understand that he must not be a blind tool in the hands of the authorities and that his passivity and nonresistance merely deepen the abyss and open up the way for those who wish to assert their radical course and impose their aggressiveness on society. People today undoubtedly find it hard to fathom out who is who, because the radicalism of the mass media, particularly television, does not allow them to form an objective opinion of what is happening. But there is the Duma, which constitutes a certain cross section of society, and there are the regions, whose interests are virtually identical. On this basis it is necessary to strive for order and the stabilization of the institutions of power and then carry out those transformations in the economy which will benefit the people and Russia. [Kasyanenko] Do you believe that the president, the government, and the power structures will agree to -- or will permit -- a change of course? [Zorkin] The ideal, of course, would be to hear confession and a statement that a wrong, antipeople course was chosen and that they are prepared to change it, to heed the people's opinion, and to act in the future only for the good of Russia. This would mean pulling back from the abyss in a peaceful, bloodless, and civilized manner. We can see on the basis of our own experience that transformations should not be entrusted to one person without a team vested with the people's trust. The present collective Rasputin can be countered today only by some capable organ, call it what you like -- collective president, state council, etc. Naturally, it must be headed by a leader, but he is obliged to accede to power not with domestic servants but with a team of authoritative people representing the main political spectrum of society. This is the only way to achieve accord. Collective leadership does not mean evading responsibility but creating a mechanism which enables us to unite various movements and parties in a single congregational organism responsible for its actions not to foreign experts but to the motherland and the people. One person cannot assume the responsibility of deciding for the whole people, as is done in our practice and as was the case with the Belovezhskaya Forest troika, for example. [Kasyanenko] Valeriy Dmitriyevich, certain so-called "democratic" mass media constantly run the topic of the president's health, and in this connection, for some reason, frequently on the same page, they discuss the question of his possible successors, early elections, etc. I have even read that your involvement with the "Accord for Russia" movement marks the start of your election campaign. [Zorkin] Let such allegations remain on the conscience of those who make them. In general, this represents one more attempt to brand the opposition and those people who really want to do something for the motherland. I personally cannot imagine myself as president, and I am dubious about the way aspirants in general are appearing. When the roof of a building is on fire, it is suicidal to think about which chair it is best to sit in. Both the chair and the person sitting in it will burn. For me the question of who will fulfill a package of measures blessed and supported by the people is secondary. The chief thing is that it should be fulfilled. [Kasyanenko] The initiators of the "Accord for Russia" movement were leaders of the opposition and of the patriotic forces, very different people who were interesting in their own way but who had hitherto acted separately. What helped you to unite? [Zorkin] Life and destiny. Theoretically, this should have been done considerably earlier. Then, maybe, what we have now would not have happened. I believe that life, in the end, will make not only the opposition unite but also the former union republics. For we were like a single living organism which found itself destroyed. As a result, everyone acquired very similar problems. Why should everyone resolve them on his own and keep to his own segment when this can be done more successfully by uniting on terms acceptable to all? Any division or disunity is always the result of someone's arrogance, whatever reasons are used to cover this up. The sooner this is understood in Russia and in other republics, the better it will be for everyone. [Kasyanenko] In conclusion, Valeriy Dmitriyevich, please tell our readers what connections you have with the countryside. [Zorkin] I believe that there are very few Russian people whose roots are not connected somehow with the land. My own grandmother, mother, and other relatives used to live in a village in Tambov Oblast. I attended my first three classes in a rural school. They were the hard postwar years. The countryside fed us with goosefoot, rotten potatoes, and black bread, but it did not let us die. But there was war, devastation, and general grief then. I very much want us not to end up with no awareness of our past and not to forget about our roots and the land which nurtured us.
