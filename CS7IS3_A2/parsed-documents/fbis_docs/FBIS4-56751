[Maldonado] President Gaviria, you are about to complete four years in office. How are relations with Venezuela? Are they better off, the same, or worse, and in what area? [Gaviria] Before answering your questions, I want to reiterate what I said this morning: The Colombian president's happiness in coming here with all the Colombian cabinet members -- an unprecedented action in Colombian politics -- to express to President Caldera and all the Venezuelan people our solidarity, and our willingness to continue working in the area of integration, which has been so fruitful and positive. During this special working session held today with President Caldera and all the members of his cabinet and Venezuelan officials, we discussed all the areas which advanced during the last few years. We discussed how close the relationship has become and how much we have advanced in trade and in many other aspects. We discussed how useful the mechanism of the negotiation and integration commission has been. We also established new goals and objectives. We reviewed progress in many positive aspects and how new problems have appeared, some of which are growing problems; but this is normal in a relationship, one sharing a 2,200 km border, that has advanced so much. Our government's assessment of relations with Venezuela is that the integration process has been very fruitful and positive. We -- Colombia and Venezuela-- have the most advanced commercial and integration process in the developing world today. We must continue to further that process. We must continue to resolve controversies and problems. We must resolve together the problems we are facing and open new possibilities for integration. [Alvarez] Lucy Faustino, representing Venezuelan television stations. [Faustino] My question is addressed to the Colombian president. One week ago you told an international news agency the following, and I quote: We are always going to have problems in relations with Venezuela. The important thing is to deal with the problems patiently. In light of those words, which can somehow be interpreted as an unrealistic definition of the coexistence of binational relations, how can Venezuelans interpret your words? Can we expect effective results from this summit to overcome those problems you addressed? Can you briefly summarize those problems you deem most important? For Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera, I would like to know if you agree with your colleague's view, and do you term it optimistic, pessimistic, or realistic? [Gaviria] I think it is unrealistic to think we will only advance in positive aspects. We have made significant progress regarding trade over the past years, and we are reaching the $2 billion figure in trade. We have made significant progress regarding investments, and it is public knowledge how Colombian investments have increased in Venezuela and vice versa. We have progressed in transportation, physical integration, and our open skies policy. The negotiation commissions have done a great job and have advanced in designing proposals and solutions in the area of basins, immigration, river navigation, and border delimitation. In all these aspects, an important and interesting job has been done, but, obviously, the border is a long one. Exchange brings about new problems. The greater flow of people brings new problems. The immigration issue remains unresolved, and it has even been complicated furthered by kidnappings and car thefts. One can even say certain problems -- drug-trafficking problems -- have worsened. Regarding this, there is a new relationship between the Armed Forces, particularly since 1988, which is helping to resolve these problems. We must be realistic. We have made significant progress, but we still have problems that must be dealt with. We cannot rip our clothes apart, nor can we cry out every time there is a conflict, every time an incident occurs. We all have to try and pay attention and resolve such incidents, conflicts, and problems, within the framework of this relationship. This is a relationship between sister nations, nations that have found integration, nations that have found the developing world's most advanced system of integration. By the same token, we must realize that because of this, we will never have a relationship free of conflicts or incidents. What we have to do is face them constructively and positively, without making a big deal out of every incident; that would be a mistake of which our children and descendants would never forgive us. They will never forgive us if we try to turn each small incident into a conflict. [Alvarez] So we do not create any bad habits. I believe that later we should ask President Caldera to answer that same question, when he answers another question. William Parra, representing Colombian television. [Parra] Colombia has stood out among the nations of the world, because it has paid the highest price in the anti-drug-trafficking fight; unfortunately, there is news regarding Colombia's proud struggle. The Constitutional Court has decided to legalize a specific drug dose for personal use. What is the Colombian president's response to the Constitutional Court's decision, especially in light of the unanimous rejection expressed by Colombian sectors? There is even a letter from the business associations stating that if Colombia and the government want to hold a referendum to reject the court's decision, they are willing to pay for all the publicity. What is the Colombian president's response to this, and what kind of image does this create abroad of the country's anti-drug-trafficking struggle? [Gaviria] I gave a full response to that before I left this morning, but allow me to explain something quickly now. We will abide by the Constitutional Court's decision, but we do not agree with it. We do not agree because of the serious effects it could have on Colombians' health. This can create violence. We do not agree with the rationale behind the decision, which says this is something concerning the development of one's personality. We are highly concerned with this, and we must wait for the ruling to be handed down. The decision was mad, but the ruling has not been issued yet. We hope the Colombian Congress will be able to issue a law establishing limits, which is required for such a decision. I am referring to the limits that should be established for consumption by children and teenagers, consumption in schools and public places, preventing drivers and pilots from using drugs, and all these other normal restrictions any community must impose when taking such a step. There should be clear provisions for people to be able to appeal for and receive medical treatment for drug consumption. I do not believe the Colombian community or society can in any way accept drug consumption as something good or as something against which it cannot fight. The president has also said that in countries or in U.S. states where this decision has been adopted, this has been a decision made by citizens or their representatives. This should not be a judicial decision but, rather, a decision of the Colombian parliament, the Colombian Congress, preceded by a public discussion on the implications of such a decision, such as health and family considerations; in fact, I have mentioned the possibility of a referendum, for which our Constitution provides. [Alvarez] Miss Paola Badaraco, representing Venezuelan newspapers. [Badaraco] Good afternoon, Mr. President. Together with the question asked by my colleague from your country, I would like to know or advise you that in Venezuela, a judge from the state of Tachira has just released 32 people implicated in the laundering of drug money. Do not both of you, the two presidents, fear that the struggle against drugs could founder in light of such decisions by the judicial branch? Thank you. [Gaviria] It would seem to be a question for... [pauses] That is news to me. Well, yes. What Colombia's Constitutional Court decided in principle -- I say in principle, because only an announcement on a decision has been made, not a ruling -- is to eliminate sanctions or penalties for personal drug consumption. They invalidated the provision stating that personal drug use was a violation of Colombian legislation. The president of Colombia's Constitutional Court clearly said that this does not mean that drug trafficking will now be legal. The sanctions set forth in our codes for drug trafficking and drug production remain unchanged. This only refers to the elimination of penalties for personal drug use. As far as I understand, the court invalidated the articles establishing arrest for this type of violation. This in no way weakens the struggle against the drug cartels or drug traffickers. I am sure Colombian society would never take such a step, much less at the international level. [Alvarez] Maria Elizabeth Vargas, representing Colombian press. [Vargas] Good afternoon, Messrs. Presidents. How does the recent devaluation of the bolivar affect bilateral agreements, and what kinds of agreements were reached? [Gaviria] I would say this is basically a question for the Colombian president -- a question on how decisions adopted by Venezuela regarding its currency can affect the agreements we have signed. Today, for the first time, the economic cabinets of both countries held their meetings, despite the fact that they had a framework for solutions within the bilateral integration agreements. They held the first meeting today and reviewed the situation, and let us say they did so within the terms of the agreements of the two countries with other regions and with the G-3 [Group of Three], of the agreements with Central America and the need to boost these accords, of the agreements with the Caribbean, and also a review of the macroeconomic situation. We are alert, and we are keeping abreast of what is happening. Colombia, obviously, is not going to make any decision. Colombia hopes to assimilate the exchange rate decisions made by the Central Bank and the Venezuelan Government. We hope these economic decisions adopted by President Caldera's administration will in no way alter our integration process. We do not plan to adopt any measure to affect that integration process. We trust in this process and have found Colombia's participation in this process to be enriching. We hope to contribute to help Venezuela overcome its recent economic difficulties. For this, President Caldera, his government, and the Venezuelan people can count on our full support. [Alvarez] Representing international news agencies based in Venezuela, Mr. Roberto Cienfuegos. [Cienfuegos] Good afternoon, Messrs. Presidents. Representatives of your governments and of Mexico are meeting today in Santa Fe de Bogota to analyze the future of the G-3. My question is this: When do you plan to culminate the free trade agreement that you proposed? Also, excuse me, but this question is being asked throughout the region: Will President Gaviria, when he assumes his post in the OAS, commit his efforts toward Cuba's total reintegration into this organization? Thank you. [Gaviria] I will respond regarding the G-3. The will of the two economic groups of both countries -- the one expressed by all members of the economic cabinets -- was clear-cut in wanting to culminate the G-3 agreement soon and to proceed to sign it. We all agree that the G-3 is very important and serves as the focal point of economic integration with the Caribbean, Central America, and a large portion of South America. Also, we hope the few differences we still have can be resolved promptly. Negotiations are taking place in Santa Fe de Bogota today, as one journalist has already noted. We hope that the process can be finalized. Today, President Caldera and I are hoping -- and we have already taken steps to place the telephone call -- to call Mexican President Carlos Salinas to reaffirm our political commitment and our wish to finalize the G-3. The ministers of the two countries have made this recommendation to us, and we have accepted it. As soon as this news conference is over, President Caldera and I hope to talk to President Salinas. As for Cuba, I would simply like to make a very broad statement, because I cannot take action on this issue without the mandate of the organization after I have assumed the post of secretary general. I think all Latin Americans, without exception, believe... [pauses] We want Cuba's reincorporation into the inter-American system. Nevertheless, we also want political and economic changes to take place in that country, making this reintegration possible. All of us want democratic progress in Cuba, as well as progress toward a market economy. I think all of us in general agree on using diplomacy to achieve these ends. [Alvarez] Here is Raul Gutierrez, on behalf of Colombia-based international correspondents. [Gutierrez] Mr. Caldera, the thorny issue in relations between the two countries is the border dispute. Looking ahead to when President Gaviria steps down, are you considering the possibility of direct talks within an international court or the termination of this border dispute? [Caldera] Venezuela has been in favor of the idea of dialogue. There is no reason to interrupt it. The talks held between the commissions appointed a few years ago have explored many paths toward resolving this dispute. Many steps have been taken toward understanding and recognizing the importance and significance of demarcation. We have agreed on the need for a global approach. This is not the only country, not the only problem, and should not be considered a thorn in anyone's side. As President Gaviria has said, there naturally will be problems between two countries with such a long-lived border -- countries that feature so many various interests. There will be more problems in the future. Nevertheless, there are no differences that cannot be resolved through dialogue, and there is no dialogue that cannot lead to a solution, especially when there is an awareness of the need and the willingness to become integrated. [Gaviria] I would briefly like to reiterate what I told the negotiating commissions this morning. The Colombian Government has complete confidence in the mechanisms on which Colombia and Venezuela have agreed to resolve this and other problems between the two countries. Here, I am talking about direct dialogue and negotiations, as well as the negotiating commissions themselves -- mechanisms that we regard as adequate for resolving not only the border dispute, but also the problems of immigration and river navigation, problems shared by the two governments. The political forces of both countries have been represented in this process of negotiations and talks. We believe these mechanisms are proper and appropriate, and we also believe that the overall approach has made it possible to make great progress in the resolution of common problems and to take positive steps in the economic, physical, and cultural integration of the two countries. [Alvarez] The final question of this news conference will be asked by Mr. Jose Lugo, who is representing the Venezuelan radio stations. [Lugo] Good afternoon to both presidents. This question is for Mr. Gaviria, and here I am departing a bit from the area of bilateral relations. Considering the support extended to you by the U.S. Government in your bid to become the next OAS secretary general, what position will you adopt, once you are in that post, concerning the announcement of an intensification of the blockade against Haiti and the possibility of a military invasion of that Caribbean island? [Gaviria] I have decided not to play the role of OAS secretary general until after I am sworn in. I do not intend to express any OAS-related views until I assume the position. Currently, I am the president of Colombia, and I will not express any views on any issue except as president of Colombia. I will express those views at the appropriate forums, the OAS and United Nations, if those topics are discussed there. As president of Colombia, however, I believe that I speak for my country when I say that all of us truly yearn to see the full restoration of democracy in Haiti through the appropriate mechanisms. [Alvarez] Thank you, Messrs. Presidents, for your presence at this news conference, and thanks to all of the journalists of Colombia and Venezuela.
