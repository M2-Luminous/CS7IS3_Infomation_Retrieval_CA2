Backwardness and poverty have existed in that beloved part of the Republic for many decades. In the past five years, we have worked hard and have invested many resources to correct this situation. This has been possible because of many different social organizations that have maintained a constant dialogue with the government, and this dialogue has been fruitful. Nevertheless, a different kind of organization has emerged in Chiapas State. National and foreign experts on violence, who have nothing to do with the efforts being made by the people of Chiapas, have inflicted a painful blow against a region of this state and against the heart of all Mexicans. This is why it has been correctly said that we must establish a distinction between two situations that exist in Chiapas: The armed aggression from a violent group, and the situation derived from the poverty and shortcomings in that region. There is no Indian uprising in Chiapas. There is an action by a violent armed group that is acting against the peaceful state of the communities, public peace, and government institutions -- that is, against all those things that the Mexicans have been working to build for generations, and, for this reason, those things we appreciate so much. The violent ones are carrying out discredited actions. In countries where this type of violence has existed, the result has been destruction and backwardness. An action like this has never produced social progress for the poor or democratic progress in any country. The events in Chiapas sadden all Mexicans, because even after recognizing inequalities, for many years Mexicans have worked to open the way for respect, dialogue, and peace. Attacks on Indians, on people from those cities, on policemen, on soldiers from the National Army are wrong. In addition, it is not fair to make attempts on anyone's life. They are all Mexicans; they deserve the greatest respect. At the same time, it is disturbing that, by taking advantage of this situation, some are trying to damage the name of Mexico, which has taken so much time and effort to build. Attempts to undermine the country's prestige would not contribute to resolving social or economic problems and would not produce political progress. Therefore, this is an action that goes against national interests. This armed group is against Mexico. The objectives of the armed group in Chiapas have not been secured. Several Indian and rural communities have rejected these people. Many Indian and peasant communities of Chiapas have demanded protection from the Mexican Army and have offered to participate in efforts to avoid the aggression. We are making firm progress, although the situation is still delicate because the aggressors have continued attacking our soldiers. They can continue producing isolated actions of violence. No country can avoid this, but they will fail. The resoluteness of the Mexicans united against violence will defeat them. They were offered a dialogue from the very beginning of the confrontation. They responded with more acts of violence. We again reiterate our offer for dialogue. The roads of participation are open to everyone. New avenues may be opened if we persevere in our way of doing things, in our tradition of working in peace and united. No one wants a Mexico in which liberties are reduced in an effort to guarantee security. No one wants to suspend constitutional guarantees in that region of Chiapas. Violence does not generate more freedom or democracy but, rather, hatred and political narrow-mindedness. The Army and the state's security forces are fulfilling their duties in accordance with the law. The government's actions have had two purposes: the first, to protect the lives of the civilian population; and the second, to reestablish normalcy in the region -- normalcy Chiapas residents are so fond of -- normalcy that will allow us to devote all of our efforts to promoting more justice. To achieve the first objective, we have protected the personal safety of citizens and the security of communities. To achieve this second objective, those criminals who have been arrested are being placed under the custody of the Attorney General's Office, which takes its authority from local authorities. The most important priority has been to protect the civilian population and to restore the possibility of a peaceful solution to the conflict. To protect the civilian population of this area from the difficulties they are experiencing, we have launched programs to deliver food, blankets, and medicine, and other public health programs are under way to deal with emergencies, prevent diseases, and reestablish medical care in the hospitals damaged by the attackers. Army personnel are protecting and distributing much of these badly needed supplies in this area. The actions of the government of the Republic are within the framework of the Constitution. The law will be applied strictly. The authorities' firm action will not be exercised against the communities, which we respect and support, or against the many organizations that work hard in the area in a dedicated manner and with which we have held dialogues. For those facing conditions of poverty, and for those who have participated in these actions because of deceit, pressure, or even desperation -- for these people who end their violent and illegal actions, we will seek honorable treatment, and we will even consider granting a pardon. The government of the Republic has the unyielding determination to resolve this conflict and fully reestablish the state of law in this part of Chiapas with a clear and firm commitment, respecting human rights. My fellow Mexicans: There is clear commitment to respect for human rights. There is a national consensus in favor of peace. In light of the events that have taken place in Chiapas State, this Monday I asserted, before the Permanent Commission of the Congress of the Republic, that within no region of Mexico are differences so great that they preclude our capacity for dialogue, nor is there enough distance to undermine our fundamental unity. This will always be the way things are. At the same time, I want to express my gratitude for the responsible support stated today by all the political forces of the country -- support against violence. Once the fighting concludes in the area of conflict in the state of Chiapas, this region will continue to advance in its objectives of more justice for Indian communities and in favor of those who need more. By standing united, we Mexicans will continue to progress and will be able to make Mexico's democratic life stronger for the wellbeing of everyone and, above all else, for the well-being of our children. Thank you, very much.
