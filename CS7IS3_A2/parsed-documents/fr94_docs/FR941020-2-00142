FR941020-2-00142 FR941020-2-00082 Columbia, and fourteen of the subsidiary companies (``Subsidiaries''), 2 seek Commission authorization for the recapitalization of Columbia Gulf, Columbia Development, and Columbia Coal (``Recapitalization Subsidiaries''), the 1995 and 1996 Long-Term and Short-Term Financing Programs of the Subsidiaries, and continuation of the Intrasystem Money Pool (``Money Pool'') through 1996. 2 Columbia Pennsylvania, Columbia Ohio, Columbia Maryland, Columbia Kentucky, Commonwealth Services, Columbia Gulf, Columbia Development, Columbia Resources, Columbia Coal, Service Corporation, Columbia Propane, Commonwealth Propane, TriStar Capital, and Columbia Atlantic. Prior to July 31, 1991, almost all external financing for Columbia and the Subsidiaries (``System'') had been through public equity and debt offerings, short-term borrowings from banks, and sales of commercial paper. The proceeds were provided to the Subsidiaries on comparable terms through purchases of debt or equity, through open-account advances, or through the Money Pool. Columbia and Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (``Columbia Transmission''), in consequence of significant financial difficulties related to the purchase of high-cost gas under long-term contracts, sought protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (``Code'') in July 1991. Thereafter, Columbia negotiated debtor-in-possession (``DIP'') financing in order to fund the operations of its subsidiaries besides Columbia Transmission. Columbia Transmission negotiated its own DIP financing. An order that approved a $275 million Secured Revolving Credit Facility for Columbia (``DIP Facility'') was granted by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (``Bankruptcy Court'') in September 1991. The Commission approved the DIP Facility by order dated September 21, 1991 (HCAR No. 25380). Orders approving amendments to the DIP Facility, which improved its terms and reduced its available amount to $100 million, were granted by the Bankruptcy Court in May 1993 and in August 1994. The Commission approved the amendments by orders dated June 11, 1993 (HCAR No. 25828) and September 12, 1994 (HCAR No. 26120). Columbia and the Recapitalization Subsidiaries seek Commission authorization for the recapitalization of Columbia Gulf, Columbia Development and Columbia Coal on or about December 31, 1994 to establish capital structures that are more appropriate for current business and economic conditions. The proposed transactions and the goals for the Recapitalization Subsidiaries were approved by the Bankruptcy Court in July 1994. With respect to Columbia Gulf, the goal is to bring its long-term debt-equity ratio to 45/55. It is proposed to (i) issue Installment Promissory Notes (``Installment Notes'') of up to $67 million to Columbia for cash; (ii) reduce the par value of its common stock from $25 per share to $10 per share (in order to create approximately $90 million in additional paid in capital; and (iii) pay a dividend of up to $67 million to Columbia out of surplus. The dividend would approximate the dollar amount of Installment Notes issued. It is stated that the proposed increase in the debt service of Columbia Gulf can be supported from cash flow from its operations. With respect to Columbia Development, the goal is to bring its long-term debt-equity ratio to 40/60. It is proposed for Columbia to make a tax-free capital contribution of up to $62 million of Installment Notes previously issued by Columbia Development and held by Columbia. The transaction proposed would be similar to that approved by the Commission by order dated December 11, 1992 (HCAR No. 25703).
