In his speech to the Federation Council, the upper house of Russia's new parliament, on Thursday Chernomyrdin said that after steep price rises in January "inflationary processes have slightly slowed down." In February inflation was about ten per cent. In 1993 the number of people living beyond the subsistence level shrank twofold. Presently, there are 25 million such people in Russia. However, the situation in the country "remains extremely complex on the whole," the premier continued. He blamed this on the continuing production decline which causes stoppages in the work of industrial enterprises. As a result of such stoppages 22 million man-days were lost at 4,000 enterprises in February. Chernomyrdin believes stoppages are caused by "difficulties in selling finished products." They account for the loss of 58 per cent of working time. One third of losses is caused by the shortage of material resources, six per cent "are connected with the conversion of the defence complex." He said it would be "premature and inappropriate" to feel elated about the decrease in inflation. The main problems in the economy "are directly connected with non-payments which are the most vivid indicator of the depth and intensity of crisis processes." As of March 1, 1994, "overdue credit debts exceeded 25 trillion roubles. Overdue debit debts totalled about 32 trillion rouble," he said. There are several factors behind the problem of non-payments, the prime minister explained. Among them he named "debts of CIS republics to the fuel and energy complex," "uncontrolled money movement" and "inability of many heads of industrial enterprises to increase labour productivity." Chernomyrdin stressed the need to "get rid of incapable leaders." To solve the problem of non-payments, the government has mapped out several measurers, including to pay off the debt for 1993 estimated at 4.6 trillion roubles by the end of March. A new procedure for issuing centralised credits has been introduced. Under the new regulations, they will be issued to end users for targeted payments. There are also plans to introduce soon a mechanism for settling overdue credit debts through finance bills. Additionally, commercial bills will be introduced. Work is underway to prepare documents obliging tax payers to provide information about all of their bank accounts. "The government is taking measures to begin the process of halting ineffective industries and will actively use bankruptcy proceedings," Chernomyrdin said.
