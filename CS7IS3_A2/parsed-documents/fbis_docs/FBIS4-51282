Speaking at a press conference here today, Radoje Kontic, the prime minister of the Federal Republic, said that his country maintains a foreign policy of independence, and will not seek any tie with NATO. He also said that the country will not join any other military alliance either. This is the first time the government of the Yugoslav Federal Republic rules out the possibility of joining the NATO Partnership for Peace program. Kontic also said that his government supports all peace proposals that treat the three warring sides in Bosnia on an equal foot, and respect the interests of the people of all sides. He also said that any peace proposal should include the lifting, or at least the reducing, of the current economic sanctions against his country. "To continue maintaining the sanctions is to encourage the Muslims to continue the war," he said, adding that the sanctions are against humanitarian principles and are damaging the image of the United Nations. The sanctions are not only bringing tremendous losses to the economy of Yugoslavia, but also to its neighboring countries, he said.
