FR940217-0-00007 FR940217-0-00003 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;97&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8821; AD 94&hyph;04&hyph;03] Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 727 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to all Boeing Model 727 series airplanes, that currently requires repetitive inspections to detect cracks in the slat track roller bearing bolts, and replacement, if necessary. This amendment adds an inspection of the positional plates installed on certain airplanes, and replacement, if necessary; reduces the compliance time for the initial inspection; and cites the latest revision to the service bulletin as the appropriate service information source. This amendment is prompted by a report that certain positional plates may not stop rotation of the roller bearing bolts. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent jamming of the affected slat or separation of the slat from the airplane. DATES: Effective March 21, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of March 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O. Box 3707, Seattle, Washington 98124&hyph;2207. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Walter Sippel, Aerospace Engineer, Airframe Branch, ANM&hyph;120S, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2774; fax (206) 227&hyph;1181. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations by superseding AD 90&hyph;18&hyph;02, Amendment 39&hyph;6708 (55 FR 34699, August 24, 1990), which is applicable to all Boeing Model 727 series airplanes, was published in the Federal Register on August 23, 1993 (58 FR 44466). The action proposed to require repetitive inspections to detect cracks in the slat track roller bearing bolts, and replacement, if necessary; and an inspection of the positional plates installed on certain airplanes, and replacement, if necessary. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. One commenter supports the proposed rule. One commenter requests that the compliance time of 2,500 flight cycles, as specified in paragraphs (b) and (d) of the proposal, be reduced to 2,000 flight cycles to coincide with the interval expressed in Boeing Service Bulletin 727&hyph;57&hyph;0172, which is cited in the proposed rule. The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request to shorten the proposed compliance time. In developing an appropriate compliance time, the FAA considered the safety implications, parts availability, and normal maintenance schedules for timely accomplishment of the modifications. Further, this AD supersedes an existing AD that specified a compliance time of 2,500 flight cycles. The FAA has received no reports to date of any problem encountered as a result of that compliance time. To reduce the compliance time of the proposal would necessitate (under the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act) reissuing the notice, reopening the period for public comment, considering additional comments received, and eventually issuing a final rule; the time required for that procedure may be as long as four additional months. In light of these considerations, and in consideration of the amount of time that has already elapsed since issuance of the original notice, the FAA has determined that further delay of this final rule action is not warranted. The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, on behalf of its members, requests that the FAA review existing approvals of alternative methods of compliance for AD 90&hyph;18&hyph;02 and determine if these approvals remain valid for this AD and, if so, either place a ``NOTE'' in the final rule or convey that information to affected operators through individual notices. ATA contends that including such a ``NOTE'' in this AD would expedite AD handling and reduce processing costs for both operators and the FAA.
