FR940112-2-00078 FR940112-2-00057 Sections 1611 and 1614(a) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1382 and 1382c(a)) Supplemental Security Income_Disability_Illegal Activity as Substantial Gainful Activity 20 CFR 416.910, 416.920(a)&hyph;(b), 416.971, 416.972(a)&hyph;(c), 416.973(a)&hyph;(b), 416.974 (a)(1), (b)(2)(vii) and (b)(3)(vii), and 416.976 Dotson v. Shalala, 1 F.3d 571 (7th Cir. 1993) The claimant applied for disability benefits under the supplemental security income program, alleging that he was disabled due to asthma, multiple allergies, and past drug abuse. His application was denied initially and upon reconsideration and he requested a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ). At the hearing, the claimant testified that he currently used $200&hyph;$300 worth of narcotics each day and that he supported his drug habit through stealing and panhandling. Based on the claimant's testimony, the ALJ concluded that the claimant's stealing and panhandling constituted substantial gainful activity (SGA) worth an average of approximately $5,600 per month. Specifically, the ALJ found that due to the poor area in which the claimant panhandled, the bulk of his income must be derived from stealing, which the ALJ determined involved significant physical and mental activities. The ALJ concluded that because the claimant was engaging in SGA, he was not disabled and, therefore, not eligible for disability benefits. The Appeals Council declined to review the ALJ's decision which became the final decision of the Secretary. The claimant sought judicial review in Federal district court. The district court upheld the Secretary's decision and the claimant appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. On appeal, the claimant argued that illegal activity undertaken to support a drug addiction cannot constitute SGA; that assuming such activity can constitute SGA, the Secretary's finding of SGA in his case was unsupported by substantial evidence; and that if illegal activity to support a drug habit can be considered SGA, then the Secretary, in determining SGA, was required to deduct the cost of the narcotics from the claimant's income as an impairment-related work expense. Additionally, the claimant contended that using illegal activity as a basis for finding SGA denied him due process and equal protection of the law. The court of appeals found nothing in the Social Security Act (the Act) or the Secretary's implementing regulations which requires SGA to be lawful. The court noted that under the regulations, work activity is substantial if it ``involves doing significant physical or mental activity'' and is gainful if it is ``the kind of work usually done for pay or profit, whether or not a profit is realized.'' The court stated that these considerations ``apply with almost equal ease irrespective of the legality of the activities involved,'' and that, therefore, ``[w]hether legally or illegally employed, the regulations direct an ALJ to focus on whether the claimant is performing significant physical or mental activities, and doing so with the intent of earning money or making a profit.'' Finding that neither the Act nor the regulations recognizes a distinction between lawful and unlawful activity for purposes of determining SGA, the court of appeals concluded that illegal activity can constitute SGA. The court also determined that the claimant's uncontradicted testimony regarding the thievery in which he engaged to support his $200&hyph;$300 per day drug habit provided substantial evidence to support the ALJ's finding that the claimant was engaged in SGA. The court rejected the claimant's contention that the cost of narcotics must be deducted from his income as an impairment-related work expense. The court noted that to be considered an impairment-related work expense under the Secretary's regulations, a drug must ``reduce or eliminate'' the symptoms of a claimant's impairment, or ``slow down its progression.'' Contrary to these criteria, the court found that in this case the claimant's use of drugs was the basis of his alleged disability, and that his continued usage of drugs only exacerbated his medical condition. The court also found the claimant's due process and equal protection arguments to be without merit. Accordingly, the court of appeals affirmed the decision of the district court upholding the Secretary's decision denying the claimant's application for disability benefits. Engel, Senior Circuit Judge * * Sitting by designation. Harold Wayne Dotson, a Supplemental Security Income claimant, appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Donna E. Shalala, Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. In granting summary judgment, the district court upheld an administrative law judge's finding that Dotson was engaging in substantial gainful activity by supporting a $200- to $300-per-day heroin and cocaine habit through illegal means. See Dotson v. Sullivan, 813 F. Supp. 651 (C.D. Ill. 1992). Because we agree that illegal activity can constitute substantial gainful activity, we affirm.
