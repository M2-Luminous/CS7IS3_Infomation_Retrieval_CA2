The union leader said the mass protests might occur despite the six-month moratorium on strikes which was announced by the labour unions in order to give the new government the chance to undertake measures to overcome the crisis. The problem is that several unions which are hostile to the Cabinet of Ministers did not agree with the general decision on the moratorium. The conditions are more than ripe for exciting mass unrest in Moldavia. According to the labour unions, the physical subsistence minimum (in May prices) is 133 lei (30 U.S. dollars) per month. The minimum consumer's basket, which includes several industrial goods in addition to the necessary food products, is now around 260 lei. If one compares this with the average monthly wage in Moldovia of about 82 lei, one can understand the reasons for dissatisfaction. Pensioners have it even worse, since the average fixed pension is only 18.8 lei per month. But even these crumbs are not received by the population regularly. Following the advice of the International Monetary Fund, the Moldavian Government is implementing a fairly strict financial and credit policy and sharply limiting the currency supply. In light of the continuing decline in production, this policy has led to systematic delays in the distribution of salaries and pensions. According to the statistics department, the government already owes its people about 80 million lei (20 million dollars). Of that sum, more than 60 million lei have not been given to agricultural workers, who form the backbone of the Moldavian economy. Experts say that these debts account for more than half of the salaries earned by Moldavia's four-million strong population in the first quarter of this year. Due to fears of a social eruption, the government has had to put off a price increase on communal services (heating, electricity) three times. Local authorities would like to raise these prices in response to the fact that energy prices are constantly on the rise. The Cabinet of Ministers is now holding negotiations with the labour union leaders and entrepreneurs in the hopes of letting the steam out of the situation.
