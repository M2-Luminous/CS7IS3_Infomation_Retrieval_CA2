Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said NATO was acting within the mandate of the Security Council resolution passed last March when New Zealand acted as president. "They (the aircraft) were warned, they ignored it and they have paid the price," he said. "The resolution really sent two signals -- that the Security Council would not tolerate violations of its resolutions and decisions and that the best course was to stop fighting and instead work on setting differences by negotiation," the minister added. NATO said its fighters yesterday shot down four Serb warplanes which were conducting a bombing raid over Bosnia.
