A Greenpeace ship cannot leave the Vladivostok port for the Svetlaya Bay for the fourth day to inspect activities of the Russian-South Korean log felling enterprise. Operating in compliance with Russian legislation, border guards approved the call only for the ship's crew members. However, the bulk of the delegation consists of ecologists, researchers and journalists who are, in actual fact, passengers and, according to Russian laws, have no right to cross Russian territorial waters. Commenting on the situation, head of the Vladivostok port check point Oleg Sukhanov claimed that the Greenpeace deliberately earns scandalous popularity on the conflict with authorities. The ship with crew members may go to the bay without any problems. The rest of the delegation may go to the bay (some 500 kilometers from Vladivostok) by other types of transportation, for instance, by air. "Despite my great respect for the international `Greens' movement, we cannot permit a violation of Russian legislation on the protection of the state border," the border guard stressed.
