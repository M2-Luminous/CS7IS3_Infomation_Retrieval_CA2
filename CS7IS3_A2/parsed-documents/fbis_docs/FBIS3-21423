Reacting to the recent speech of Ms Robin Raphel, U.S. assistant secretary of state for South Asian affairs, in Washington, an official spokesman in a strongly-worded statement said such references "tend to provide encouragement to Pakistan and terrorists sustained by them to continue with their violent activities" in Jammu and Kashmir. He asserted that "no comparison can be drawn between the situation in Afghanistan and Jammu and Kashmir." He said the situation in Afghanistan was a by-product of the cold war whereas Jammu and Kashmir had been facing a massive campaign of terrorism aided and abetted by Pakistan. "The only link between Afghanistan and Jammu and Kashmir is that weapons and mercenaries have moved from both Afghanistan and Pakistan in support of terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir." The spokesman said such references by U.S. officials were "unhelpful and hinder resumption of the democratic political process and a return to normalcy (in Jammu and Kashmir) which the Government of India is striving to bring about."
