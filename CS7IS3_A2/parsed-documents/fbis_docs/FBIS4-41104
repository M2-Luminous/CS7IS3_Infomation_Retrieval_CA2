The Central Bank as an Ultra-Patriot of the Russian Banking System"] [Text] Luxembourg is home to more than 200 foreign banks from all over the world. Billion-dollar operations take place here every day, and the financial powers that be are frequent guests in this city. Viktor Gerashchenko, chief of the Central Bank of Russia, who was in Luxembourg last week, answered questions concerning the admission of foreign banks to the country's financial market. [Katin] State protectionism of the banking sector in Russia is one of the obstacles that prevent our country from forging partnership relations with European business. This obstacle has also long held up the conclusion of an agreement on trade cooperation with the EC. But recently a shift has emerged in which foreign financial institutions seem to be given significant concessions that appear to be coming from you personally, the Central Bank. Is this really so and what do you think about that? [Gerashchenko] Let us first, so to speak, take a glimpse at the overall picture of banking activity in Russia. In my view, the way the banking sector is currently developing is not bad, it is even doing well. I absolutely disagree with those who say that we already have more banks than we need. At present there are approximately 2,100 banks in the country. Plus 600 applications to open new ones. Given that in addition they have 4,500 branches strewn over the country, it will make over 6,000 banking units. Still, I cannot say that this is enough, that the banking system has covered all areas, has penetrated all capillaries of society and the economy. One reason for such an unsatisfactory -- so far -- status is the overconcentration of banks in one place -- Moscow, which accounts for around 38-40 percent of all banks. This, however, is normal, this is a tradition for large cities in all countries, all the more so for capital cities. So, the current banking system, despite its clear trend toward evolution, toward expansion, alas, still is not fully capable of servicing small and medium-size businesses. In addition, national banks sometimes try to call the shots. That is, they attach fairly tight or expensive conditions to their loans or when carrying out one transaction or another. Now we are faced with the need to give foreign banks access to the Russian financial market. I would like to underline, however, that this access should be measured. The evolution of the entire modern banking system in the world, where each country sooner or later arrives at this particular decision, speaks in favor of opening national borders for foreign banks. There was a time where the Spaniards, the Australians, or the Dutch did not let in foreign banking capital, but in the end all of them have changed their approach. [Katin] What is the reason for such a shift in some countries and such an interest in others? [Gerashchenko] When a foreign banks appears in an unfamiliar country that may be even unknown to its traditional customers, it helps them, first, to invest their money in its economy in the best possible fashion. Second, the bank helps create an international climate in interbank cooperation. This has a direct bearing on Russia. If we are seriously and actively to take part in the international division of labor, to become an inalienable part of the world economy, and to enter the world market, we cannot do without cooperating with the banking system on an international scale. You cannot but agree that it would be simply ridiculous and naive to reason as follows: Yes, we will pass a law on foreign investment and agree to give it access to industrial production, trade, mediation services, but it will be not allowed in the banking sector, no way! All these things are organically intertwined, after all. Doubtless, we should not admit all the -- excuse the phrase -- riff-raff only to have problems with them afterward. This is precisely why we need measured access. [Katin] Will you please expand on this principle: How should this formula be applied in practice? [Gerashchenko] The situation is as follows. Under current Russian legislation, the admission of foreign banks falls under the jurisdiction of the Central Bank, which sets a measure or a quota for foreign banking capital on Russia's financial market. Recently, in accordance with our powers we made a decision that the capital of foreign banks that will receive licenses from us to operate in Russia may not exceed 12-15 percent of the overall capital of national banks put together. This is one side to the problem. Another principle of the measured access formula is our right to select those who will be best suited to operate on the Russian financial market. We will choose what they call the first- class names -- the most respectable banks that can really help their customers invest their money in the development of the Russian economy. Let us imagine the following situation. Say, a foreign bank has had a mission in Russia for 10-15 years, and its exposure to Russia stands at $1 billion. This is our state foreign debt that we are for the time being unable to repay on time and so we are negotiating its rescheduling. So why shouldn't we allow such a bank to have its office here, in Moscow, to do its business, its wheeling and dealing, as the saying goes? In this case, the frozen portfolio of Russian assets will look entirely different to the bank's shareholders. A psychological factor will also be at work -- there will be a rising tide of confidence. [Katin] In your account the Central Bank of Russia's stance appears fairly clear and convincing. What do the chiefs of the numerous private banks that you referred to at the beginning of our conversation think about the prospective arrival of foreign banking capital in Russia? [Gerashchenko] I will say this: When our commercial banks say that giving access to foreigners amounts to selling out, they are for the most part guided by parochial interests. They simply do not want healthy competition, that is it. No, we do not call for the Russian sector of commercial banks to be stifled with help from foreigners, just the opposite, we want to give the banking sector a boost! I want to take the opportunity to state through NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: We, the Central Bank of Russia, in this sense are even ultra-patriots of the development of a serious banking system in our country. Who is crying and protesting loudest against foreign banks? It is mostly the small Russian banks and those who are not involved in long-term economic development. In doing their business, they are ready to give loans at huge rates while giving no thought at all to what this loan will be spent on. [Katin] I would like to hear your opinion on the astronomical interest rates offered by some of our banks to their customers, such as "We guarantee 1,000 percent on ruble and hard-currency deposits!" I hope you are aware of such advertisements, you read our press after all. What is it -- swindling? [Gerashchenko] Yes, I read our press, and sometimes I even watch television. I believe that these advertisements are made by organizations that are unscrupulous or not entirely comprehensible to me. I wonder from whom they could obtain licenses for their activity, without which it is prohibited to attract people's money for any operations. Only the Central Bank or the Finance Ministry is entitled to issue such licenses. Admittedly, we still have lots of twilight zones whose activity is not covered by law -- that is the problem. In short, I would not rush to an institution that offers 1,000 percent on a deposit. [Katin] How do you, from the standpoint of your post as the country's chief banker, assess the ruble's health? [Gerashchenko] In my view, our ruble is a completely healthy currency. This can be proved, for instance, by the following fact: Many people no longer buy foreign currency to save their rubles from inflation, but place their money at Russian banks precisely on ruble deposits. Yes, the ruble exchange rate is declining, this is a normal phenomenon given the current inflation, but it is far from a tragedy. In addition, it is declining much more slowly than exporters, who are interested in this decline, would like it to.
