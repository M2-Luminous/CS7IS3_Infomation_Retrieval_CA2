Protection Force (UNPROFOR) staff to have AIDS tests, after several cases of the disease were reported among U.N. forces. Former foreign minister Zvonimir Separovic, who heads the Croatian Victims Society, said he would make the request officially to U.N. officials and the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday, World AIDS Day. Separovic said that the U.N. operation has ``contributed, among other misfortunes, to the extension of AIDS,'' in Croatia. He said authorities had to ``protect everyone who could be under threat, not only sick people.'' Zagreb said last month that four U.N. workers serving in former Yugoslavia had died of the killer disease this year. UNPROFOR spokeswoman Shannon Boyd declined to confirm the figure, but said that a small number of cases had been registered among the tens of thousands of U.N. forces in the Balkan region. According to official statistics, 53 people have been registered as suffering from AIDS in Croatia since 1986, of whom 36 have died.,
