FR941107-2-00143 FR941107-2-00084 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;34917; File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;43] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change by American Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to New Organizational Structures for Member Organizations. October 31, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 notice is hereby given that on October 14, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On October 31, 1994, the Exchange submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change in order to narrow the scope of the original filing. 3 The Amex has requested accelerated approval of the proposal. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1991). 3 See letter from Claudia Crowley, Special Counsel, Legal & Regulatory Policy Division, Amex, to Glen Barrentine, Senior Counsel, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated October 31, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1''). The portions of this filing that were withdrawn in Amendment No. 1 have been submitted to the Commission as part of File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;23. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The Exchange is proposing to expand the categories of organizations which are eligible to become member organizations to include entities with new organizational structures. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, Amex, and at the Commission. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item III below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 1. Purpose The Exchange is proposing to amend its Rules relating to the admission of entities with new organizational structures as member organizations. Specifically, the proposed amendment would permit the Exchange, in its discretion, and on such terms and conditions as the Exchange may prescribe, to approve limited liability companies (``LLCs''), business trusts or other organizational structures as member organizations so long as the characteristics of the entity in question are essentially similar to those of corporations or partnerships. An LLC is a hybrid business entity, combining the limited liability characteristics of a corporation with the pass-through taxation attributes of a partnership. Currently, approximately 45 States and the District of Columbia have adopted LLC statutes. New York State recently adopted legislation, effective October 24, 1994, authorizing LLCs. The Exchange has been advised that a number of existing member organizations are considering altering their business structure to that of an LLC. Both the Chicago Board Options Exchange (``CBOE'') and the Chicago Stock Exchange (``CHX'') already permit membership by an LLC, and the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') recently received SEC approval to amend its rules to do so. 4 4 See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 33124 (November 1, 1993), 58 FR 59282 (November 8, 1993) (File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;93&hyph;40); 34604 (August 26, 1994), 59 FR 45316 (September 1, 1994) (File No. SR&hyph;CHX&hyph;94&hyph;17) (``CHX Approval Order''); and 34664 (September 13, 1994), 59 FR 48346 (September 20, 1994) (File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;01) (``NYSE Approval Order''). The term ``business trust'' is generally used to describe a trust in which the managers are principals, and the shareholders are cestuis que trust. As stated in Black's Law Dictionary, ``[t]he essential attribute [of a business trust] is that property is placed in the hands of trustees who manage and deal with it for use and benefit of beneficiaries.'' 5 5 Black's Law Dictionary 180 (5th ed. 1979). Accordingly, the Exchange proposes to adopt new Commentary .01 to Definition 2 of the Exchange Rules to provide that entities may be accepted as member organizations by the Exchange if they have characteristics essentially similar to partnerships, corporations or both. At the present time, the Exchange intends to consider both LLCs and business trusts as eligible to become member organizations. These entities would be subject to all rules applicable to member organizations, and existing references to member firm or member corporation, as appropriate, and member organization would be deemed to include any such entity which is approved as a member organization. Of course, in order to be a member organization, an entity must be able to qualify as a broker or dealer registered with the SEC pursuant to the Act. In addition, the Exchange staff would review applications on a case-by-case basis as it does with all member organization applicants. Prior to approving any such organization for membership, the staff would have to be satisfied that: (1) the Exchange would legally have appropriate jurisdiction over such an entity; and (2) the permanency of the entity's capital is consistent with that required of other member organizations. 2. Statutory Basis The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(2) in particular in that it is designed to ensure that the rules of the Exchange provide that any broker or dealer or natural person associated with a registered broker or dealer may become a member of the Exchange. B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The proposed rule change will impose no burden on competition.
