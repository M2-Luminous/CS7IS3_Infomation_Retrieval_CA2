M.: "Violation of the Will of the People"] [Text] Knin -- "The SDS [the Serbian Democratic Party] of Krajina was the winner at the elections that have just ended," is stated at the beginning of a statement for the public, signed by Drago Kovacevic, chief of the party's electoral headquarters. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the SDS of Krajina won the greatest number of deputies in the future republican parliament and an absolute majority in 14 communes, while Dr. Milan Babic won at the presidential elections. "Through manipulation by the Republican Electoral Commission, Babic's victory has been quashed by enlarging the electoral body for 4 percent of invalid ballots, which is without precedent in the world." "The Republican Electoral Commission, which consists of seven judges of the highest Krajina courts, in a so far unprecedented manner, usurped the right to alter laws, although this is an exclusive prerogative of the Assembly of the republic of Serbian Krajina, thus violating the legal system and the institutions." Within the legally prescribed deadline, the SDS of Krajina has sent a request for protection of legality to the constitutional court of the republic of Serbian Krajina. "A decision to hold the second round of presidential elections on 23 January 1994 and not on 9 January 1993, proceeding from the article 6A of the Law on Presidential Elections, constitutes the height of violation of legality by the Republican Electoral Commission. The SDS of Krajina, as a party that strictly observes democratic procedure has demanded protection of legality from the constitutional court of the republic of Serbian Krajina in a belief that the constitutional court will act in accordance with its authorities and put an end to the arbitrariness of the Republican Electoral Commission and the current authorities in the republic of Serbian Krajina.
