Market Statement_Egypt Category 340/640_Men's and Boys' Cotton and Man-Made Fiber Woven Shirts January 1994 Import Situation and Conclusion U.S. imports of men's and boys' cotton and man-made fiber woven shirts, Category 340/640, from Egypt reached 424,073 dozen during the year ending October 1993, more than six and one half times the 62,423 dozen imported from Egypt in the year ending October 1992. In the first ten months of 1993, imports of Category 340/640 from Egypt reached 402,042 dozen, nearly seven times the January-October 1992 level and nearly five times Egypt's total calendar year 1992 Category 340/640 imports. The sharp and substantial increase of Category 340/640 imports from Egypt is causing a real risk of disruption in the U.S. market for men's and boys' cotton and man-made fiber woven shirts. U.S. Production, Import Penetration and Market Share U.S. production of men's and boys' cotton and man-made fiber woven shirts fell from 16,956,000 dozen in 1989 to 12,850,000 dozen in 1992, a decline of 24 percent. This decline continued in 1993, with U.S. production falling to 6,320,000 dozen in the first half of 1993, 3 percent below the January-June 1992 level. In contrast, U.S. imports of Category 340/640 increased from 26,637,000 dozen in 1989 to 30,395,000 dozen in 1992, a 14 percent increase. Category 340/640 imports continued to increase in 1993, reaching 27,275,000 dozen during the first ten months of 1993, five percent above the January-October 1992 level. The ratio of imports to domestic production increased from 157 percent in 1989 to 236 percent in 1992. This trend continued in 1993, with the ratio of imports to domestic production reaching 238 percent during January-June 1993. The domestic manufacturers' share of this market fell from 39 percent in 1989 to 30 percent during the first half of 1993, a decline of 9 percentage points. Duty-Paid Value and U.S. Producers' Price Approximately 77 percent of Category 340/640 imports from Egypt during the year ending in October 1993 entered the U.S. under HTSUSA 6205.20.2046_men's and boys' yarn dyed, napped woven cotton shirts, other than dress and corduroy; HTSUSA 6205.20.2065_men's woven cotton shirts, other than dress and corduroy, with one color in the warp and/or the filling; and HTSUSA 6205.20.2075_boys' woven cotton shirts, other than dress and corduroy, with one color in the warp and/or the filling, other than imported as a part of a playsuit. These shirts entered the U.S. at landed duty-paid values below U.S. producers' prices for comparable men's and boys' woven shirts. Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements February 15, 1994. Commissioner of Customs, Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20229. Dear Commissioner: Under the terms of section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1854), and the Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Textiles done at Geneva on December 20, 1973, as further extended on December 9, 1993; pursuant to the Bilateral Cotton and Man-Made Fiber Textile Agreement, effected by exchange of notes dated March 15, 1992 and June 9, 1992, between the Governments of the United States and the Arab Republic of Egypt; and in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended, you are directed to prohibit, effective on February 23, 1994, entry into the United States for consumption and withdrawal from warehouse for consumption of cotton and man-made fiber textile products in Categories 340/640, produced or manufactured in Egypt and exported during the period beginning on January 31, 1994 and extending through December 31, 1994, in excess of 467,062 dozen. 1 1 The limit has not been adjusted to account for any imports exported after January 30, 1994. Textile products in Categories 340/640 which have been exported to the United States prior to January 31, 1994 shall not be subject to the limit established in this directive. Textile products in Categories 340/640 which have been released from the custody of the U.S. Customs Service under the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1448(b) or 1484(a)(1) prior to the effective date of this directive shall not be denied entry under this directive. Import charges will be provided at a later date. In carrying out the above directions, the Commissioner of Customs should construe entry into the United States for consumption to include entry for consumption into the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements has determined that this action falls within the foreign affairs exception of the rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1). Sincerely, Rita D. Hayes, Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;3915 Filed 2&hyph;18&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DR&hyph;F
