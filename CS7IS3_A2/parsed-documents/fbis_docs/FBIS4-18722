He said plans had been made for the 150-seat aircraft to fly civilians from the Rwandan capital of Kigali to Bujumbura, provided that a safety zone could be established 20 kilometres (12.5 miles) around Kigali airport. The Belgian cabinet was due to meet here around 1300 GMT to decide whether to evacuate Belgian civilians from Rwanda, what troops to provide for the operation and how to coordinate the operation with the United Nations. Di Rupo said a flight crew of the Belgian airline Sabena was already in Kigali, and that the captain and first officer had been slightly injured when the Sabena-owned hotel there came under machine-gun fire. He added that a Sabena DC-10 aircraft was being sent to the Ugandan capital of Entebbe to increase the evacuation capability.
