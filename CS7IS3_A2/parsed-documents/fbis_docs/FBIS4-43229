The distribution of seats among the 31 Netherlands representatives at the EP was in line with forecasts at the close of voting on Thursday [9 June]. The CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] wins 10 seats, the PvdA [Labor Party] eight, the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] six, D66 [Democrats 66] four, the coalition comprising the Political Reformed Party, the Reformed Political Union, and the Reformational Political Federation wins two seats, and the Green Left one. The leaders of the main parties expressed disappointment at the low turnout among Netherlands voters for the European elections. VVD leader Bolkestein finds the low turnout, not only in the Netherlands but in other European countries too, grounds for reflection on the future of the European Union (EU). At the VVD party council on Saturday, he stated that the EU must reflect upon some essential questions. "Europe does not seem to be sufficiently relevant to the voter," Bolkestein stated. The biggest winner in the European elections in the Netherlands was D66, increasing its seats from one to four. The VVD doubled its seats from three to six. Bolkestein described this as a "good result." But given the low turnout, he does not believe the results can be taken as indicative of the results of a national election. The CDA and the PvdA remain at their former levels with 10 and eight seats, but their actual loss of support was masked by the fact that the number of Netherlands seats in the EP has been increased from 25 to 31. The small Christian parties increased their seats from one to two. The Green Left was the only real loser, down from two to one seat. PvdA leader Kok does not believe the results can be compared to the national political situation. He described the turnout as "very poor." The Netherlands Euro MP's will have a hard job in making people feel more concerned by Europe, Kok believes. CDA leader Brinkman also described the turnout as disappointing. The good score achieved by the CDA is "encouraging" Brinkman stated on Saturday at the CDA party council. Opinion polls had predicted a sharp fall in CDA support.
