FR940505-2-00157 FR940505-2-00113 In connection with its ongoing process of guideline review, the Commission welcomes comment on any aspect of the sentencing guidelines, policy statements, and official commentary. Specifically, the Commission solicits comment on which, if any, of the amendments submitted to the Congress that may result in a lower guideline range should be made retroactive to previously sentenced defendants under Policy Statement 1B1.10. Authority: 28 U.S.C. 994(a), (o), (p); sec. 7109 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;690). William W. Wilkins, Jr., Chairman. Amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines Pursuant to section 994(p) of title 28, United States Code, as amended by section 7109 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 [Pub. L. 100&hyph;690, Nov. 18, 1988, the United States Sentencing Commission reports to the Congress the following amendments to the sentencing guidelines, and the reasons therefor. As authorized by this section, the Commission specifies an effective date of November 1, 1994, for these amendments. Policy Statements, and Official Commentary 1. Amendment: The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned ``Application Notes'' is amended in Note 2 by inserting the following additional paragraph as the eighth paragraph: ``A defendant's relevant conduct does not include the conduct of members of a conspiracy prior to the defendant's joining the conspiracy, even if the defendant knows of that conduct (e.g., in the case of a defendant who joins an ongoing drug distribution conspiracy knowing that it had been selling two kilograms of cocaine per week, the cocaine sold prior to the defendant's joining the conspiracy is not included as relevant conduct in determining the defendant's offense level). The Commission does not foreclose the possibility that there may be some unusual set of circumstances in which the exclusion of such conduct may not adequately reflect the defendant's culpability; in such a case, an upward departure may be warranted.''. The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned ``Application Notes'' is amended in Note 9(B) by deleting ``and the time interval between offenses'' and inserting in lieu thereof: ``, the regularity (repetitions) of the offenses, and the time interval between the offenses. When one of the above factors is absent, a stronger presence of at least one of the other factors is required. For example, where the conduct alleged to be relevant is relatively remote to the offense of conviction, a stronger showing of similarity or regularity is necessary to compensate for the absence of temporal proximity.''. Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the operation of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) with respect to the defendant's accountability for the actions of other conspirators prior to the defendant's joining the conspiracy. The amendment is in accord with the rule stated in recent caselaw. See, e.g., United States v. Carreon, 11 F.3d 1225 (5th Cir. 1994); United States v. Petty, 982 F.2d 1374, 1377 (9th Cir. 1993); United States v. O'Campo, 973 F.2d 1015, 1026 (1st Cir. 1992). Cf. United States v. Miranda-Ortiz, 926 F.2d 172, 178 (2d Cir. 1991); United States v. Edwards, 945 F.2d 1387, 1393 (7th Cir. 1991)) (applying earlier versions of §1B1.3). By expressly addressing this issue, this amendment will ensure consistency in guideline interpretation. In addition, this amendment adds a well-phrased formulation developed by the Ninth Circuit in United States v. Hahn, 960 F.2d 903 (9th Cir. 1992), to the commentary addressing the circumstances in which multiple acts constitute the ``same course of conduct.''. 2. Amendment: Section 1B1.10(a) is amended by deleting ``guidelines'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``Guidelines Manual'', by deleting ``may be considered'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``is authorized'', by inserting ``and thus is not authorized'' immediately following ``policy statement'', and by deleting ``subsection (d)'' wherever it appears and inserting in lieu thereof in each instance ``subsection (c)''. Section 1B1.10(b) is amended by inserting ``, and to what extent,'' immediately before ``a reduction'', and by deleting ``originally imposed had the guidelines, as amended, been in effect at that time'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``imposed had the amendment(s) to the guidelines listed in subsection (c) been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced''. Section 1B1.10 is amended by deleting subsection (c), and by redesignating subsection (d) as subsection (c). ’The Commentary to §1B1.10 captioned ``Application Note'' is amended by deleting ``Note'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``Notes'', and by deleting Note 1 and inserting in lieu thereof:
