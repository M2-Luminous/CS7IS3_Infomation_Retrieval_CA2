However, despite verbal declarations of sympathy with the Russian Army's hardships, it was this budget that opposition parties such as Liberal Democrats, Communists and others had approved in its first reading, Kostikov said. In his words, there is a ploy behind the parliamentary move aimed to put the Army on a ration so as to bring it into head on collision with the president. "The president is well aware of this behind-the-scenes political gambling". On the country's further defence spending, Kostikov said that it would make no sense to increase military expenditure given that the Russian Army was to be trimmed down. But to try to keep it at last year's level proceeding from the 1993 prices was a different matter altogether, Kostikov said. However, he made it clear that an increase in this year's defence budget would not be made at the cost of public spending.
