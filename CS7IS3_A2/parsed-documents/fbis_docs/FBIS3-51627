Contino, the top-ranking UJC leader and also a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba, told PRENSA LATINA in an interview that people are in the habit of talking about a new generation's taking over from the old and that the term is inappropriate, because it is like saying: You have come this far; now only I will go forward, alone. Contino stressed: There are three generations of revolutionaries living in Cuba today, who, far from having a tradition of antagonisms, are in full agreement regarding the principles, paths, and objectives of the revolutionary process begun in 1959. The youth leader also denied that Cuban society is currently facing a values crisis. He did admit, however, that there are segments of the youthful population with whom Cuba is having difficulties because of the national economic situation.
