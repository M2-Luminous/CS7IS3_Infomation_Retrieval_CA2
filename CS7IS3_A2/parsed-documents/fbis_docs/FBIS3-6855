The Israeli Embassy was probably the target of the bomb attack. The accident forced the terrorists to desert their truck, which was eventually moved to Lumpini Police Station. Inestimable damage and tragedy would have resulted if the terrorists were able to carry out their mission. What prevented the tragedy was the accident, not the ability of the officials concerned. Police and security officials and questioning of witnesses indicate initially that the bombing attempt was the work of international terrorists, possibly Arabs who seek to avenge the Hebron massacre. Among the observations concerning the bombing attempt are: How did immigration officials allow these terrorists to enter the country? Is the intelligence network sound and is its coordination with foreign intelligence agencies efficient? True, because Thailand is a democratic country and tourism is a major revenue earner, its check on arriving foreign tourists is rather loose. But this should not mean that entries are permitted without checks or for selfish reasons. Another observation is: Why did officials of the Lumpini Police Station leave the explosive-laden truck unchecked for six days? This delay deprived others of any chance of a timely arrest of suspects. Was there a written record of the accident? Was there a neglect of duty? Although the cold war has ended, disputes among nations have continued more vigorously in some places, such as in the former Soviet Union, the former Yugoslavia, and in the Middle East. International terrorism has not ceased. The countries who have lax security will fall prey first.
