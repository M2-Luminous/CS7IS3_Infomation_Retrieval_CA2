There are a lot of candidates--750, and not much air time. So they give us less than a minute to get acquainted with each candidate. Can the broadcasting network made available by the radio and television company be used more effectively? Of course it can. And the solution is right there, on the surface. It would suffice to broadcast in each rayon of the city only the information on candidates going on the ballot from this rayon. Then in Kalininskiy Rayon, for instance, you would only need to provide information about five electoral districts rather than 50, and in Oktyabrskiy Rayon--only one. This way, air time would be used 10 times more effectively in Kalininskiy Rayon and 50 times more effectively in Oktyabrskiy Rayon! Is there, though, the technical capability to simultaneously broadcast different programs in different rayons of St. Petersburg? Yes, there is. In a number of rayons such "rayon-wide" broadcasting has been the practice once or twice a week for quite a while. And nothing prevented the mayoralty from organizing such rayon-targeted election broadcasts. I think that in this rather simple matter the mayoralty uses the resources made available by the radio and television company (that is, in the final analysis, the taxpayers money) with a utilization coefficient of between 2 and 10 percent. In any case, I usually fail my students who show this sort of productivity.
