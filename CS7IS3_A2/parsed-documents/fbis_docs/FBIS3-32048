Nevertheless, in statements to the media, de Leon acknowledged that the "yes" victory--which garnered 84 percent of the votes when only 51.5 percent of the total votes have been tallied--did not reach the expected magnitude. "In politics, what really matters, however, are final results," the president said, downplaying the 82.8-percent abstentionism evidenced by preliminary Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] results. "The Guatemalan citizen voted and represented those who decided not to vote," the president said. The head of state attributed low voter turnout to the peculiarities of the referendum as well as to fears of possible terrorist attacks, such as ones the that occurred today and in the previous weeks during which dozens of bombs exploded, killing one, injuring 18, and causing numerous property damage, especially to the country's electrical system. De Leon said in 60 days the reforms will become effective, and afterward the country's Supreme Court magistrates and deputies will have to resign. Last year, the president went through a power struggle with Supreme Court magistrates and deputies when he attempted to purge both institutions due to charges of corruption. The president believes today's referendum marks a new page in the country's history, and he announced that once the Legislative and Judicial Branch problems were solved, he will be able to direct his efforts to the struggle against corruption and impunity. Both the Legislative and Judicial Branch will be changed once general elections, which have been rescheduled for an earlier date as contemplated in the constitutional reforms, takes place.
