In a statement made after his departure to Sofia and Bucharest where he is expected to pay formal visits over 6-9 April, the Brussels head of diplomacy stressed that "Belgium follows attentively the process of reform and privatisation in Romania." In a gesture "with a symbol value for the joint cultural values of our united Europe" and as an undeniable illustration of the special friendly character of the visit, Willy Claes, who is also a talented musician, will conduct a concert of the Romanian radio symphonic orchestra. Belgian and Romanian sources in Brussels are noting among other things "the double character of the visit, the bilateral and the European one," as well as its "considerable" duration, taking into account the busy schedule of the Belgian deputy premier who is also the acting president of the Ministerial Committee of the Council of Europe. According to the same sources, Belgium "is aware of the economic and social difficulties implied by the Romanian transition, but it is determined to reassert -- through its head of diplomacy -- its support, as to its possibilities, for a democratic and European Romania."
