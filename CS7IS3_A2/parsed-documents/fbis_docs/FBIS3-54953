The approved state program does not greatly differ from the privatization program which was in effect in 1992-1993. The new program does not change the major peculiarity of the Russian legislature on privatization, namely privatization by means of vouchers; their term of operation is to expire on July 1, 1994. In comparison with the previous one, the new state program expands rights of the regions and increases the list of sites, the privatization of which was earlier prohibited or restricted. In addition, this document removes all restrictions for the participation of foreign investors in the privatization of Russian state property. According to the state program, foreign individuals and legal entities can participate in auctions and competitions organized to sell state property on equal rights with Russian investors. Foreign investors are allowed to procure state securities (including vouchers) without any coordination with the RF [Russian Federation] Finance Ministry (according to the decree on foreign investments, a foreigner had to receive permission from the Finance Ministry in order to buy state securities). Chairman of Russia's State Property committee Dmitriy Vasilyev says that about 80% of state property is expected to be privatized by July 1, 1994. Currently, 45-50% of Russian property belongs to the private sector.
