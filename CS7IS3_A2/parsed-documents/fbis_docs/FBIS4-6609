We still have time until 1540 [0640 GMT], and we would like to receive some questions. Thank you in advance for your cooperation. Please go ahead. [Reporter Kure] I am Kure from Nihon TV. In the last two weeks since Prime Minister Hosokawa's resignation announcement, the coalition parties' opinions were at first split over whether the next prime minister should be elected by coalition party leaders or party secretaries general, and interparty disputes continued until the very last stage of working out new policy accords. It seemed to us that these disputes left serious cracks in the coalition. However, the coalition reached an accord early this morning to start again under the leadership of Mr. Hata. Mr. Hata, could you give us your comments on the two-week dispute? [Hata] In fact, a two-week period is not a very short time to me. I think it took so long because the parties discussed various issues frankly. While you said cracks may remain in the coalition, we are allies who have been working together under the premiership of Mr. Hosokawa. It is true that the coalition often faced difficulties in such subjects as the Uruguay Round and electoral reform; however, we somehow overcame all of these problems. Recalling the last eight months, I do not think any serious discord remains among us. With respect to the pending issue of tax reform, we have an international pledge to settle the issue before the end of June. Taking this opportunity of forming a new administration, we tried to narrow disparity in the parties' stances on such issues as much as possible, and this was why it took so long to work out an accord among the parties. In this sense, I think the prolonged debates were quite meaningful. The coalition parties have been working together over the last eight months, but each of them has its unique standpoint and history. Throughout the two-week debates, I have become confident of a point that the coalition parties are always able to overcome their positions when they exhaustively discuss the nation's present circumstances. So, I have to say I do not see any cracks in the coalition. I met a foreign official earlier today. When I asked him if the international community is worrying much about the prolonged political confusion in Japan, he replied that, if the new prime minister is nominated today, that would be regarded as a relatively smooth election process as a nation ruled by a multiparty government. He said one nation has a rule to set a three-week period to form a new administration, and, when the period runs out, spends another three-week period to continue discussions. He said yet another nation conducted a national election a long time ago, but anything but parliament membership has been determined up until now. I thought that was a funny way to cheer me up. All party leaders gathered today know the fiscal 1994 budget must be compiled as soon as possible, and political confusion should not worsen the economy. Also, we have to work on the 1995 budget following the compilation of the 1994 budget. Under such circumstances, we tried hard to reach an early accord, and, as you all know, yesterday's discussions continued even after midnight. My understanding is that mutual confidence and the sense of unity are strengthened through the debates. [Matsuoka] Next question, please. [Unidentified reporter] In the beginning of the interparty debates on the new administration, the coalition's decision-making mechanism, or the conference of party secretaries general, evoked so much controversy. The coalition agreed to review the position of the secretaries general's conference. How do you do that hereafter? [Hata] I am not aware of such an agreement. As you all know, party secretaries general played key roles in the inauguration of the coalition government led by Mr. Hosokawa. In the Hosokawa administration, we are all serving as cabinet ministers, and we have to spend almost all day working on administrative duties. As Mr. Nakamura noted earlier, party secretaries general met 27 times in the two-week period. While I do not know the total length of the meetings, it must have been impossible for party heads to spend the time on political debate. Since we are in the cabinet, secretaries general are actually taking charge of all political affairs such as Diet administration. In this sense, I think the conference is an important mechanism for the coalition government. I do not think some people are intentionally disparaging the mechanism, and I think it is necessary to smooth out interparty talks. However, I believe the interparty accord could not be reached without the secretaries general's conference. So, my opinion is that we have to set much value on the mechanism. Any more questions? [Unidentified reporter] Since the new policy agreement was reached, the issue of forming a united lower house group will be a new political task. Can I ask each party leader to briefly comment on this? [Hata] Chairman Murayama told me to go ahead first. We have been discussing political reform since we were in the LDP. Now, Japan plays a very important role in international society. We have to daringly promote major reform at home too. Under such circumstances, some people thought it was not a good idea to have many political parties. I have been saying that the dynamism of Japanese politics will be created if two major parties debate and compete with each other. However, we have formed the coalition. To tell you the truth, I think it would be better if the coalition parties could debate together on what party representatives or party leaders discussed at party representatives' meetings rather than having separate discussions. For example, we can have true cooperation in elections if we all belong to the same party or the same group. This is an issue over which we will have heated debate again in the future. However, we all agree that we have to promote reform. On the basis of this common viewpoint, I wish we could form one main group or a concentric circle. If we can do that, then we will be able to exert greater power. [Murayama] On the basis of what we have gone through, the second coalition government is about to start. As you know, we are confronted with important international and domestic tasks. We talked about what this administration has to do to respond to the people's expectations. I am sure that all parties which support the coalition administration are trying to find ways to deal with these tasks. Therefore, I think it is possible that some of them may try to merge into one group. This is something each party or each group has to think about. However, as I said earlier, the SDPJ will deal with the reality to enable the Hata coalition administration to smoothly respond to the people's expectations. [Ishida] We confirmed in the policy agreement that the next general election will be held under the new administration. In this sense, we can say that the new system will determine which party or parties will take power. Needless to say, I cannot tell you when the general election will be held. However, it is extremely important for Komeito to continue to exert efforts and to seek formation of a united group because the new election system will determine the governing party. [Ouchi] Since it is the beginning of a new administration, I plan to give this issue some serious thought. [Nishioka] Regarding policy decisionmaking and other procedures under the Hosokawa administration, for its part the Kaikaku no Kai has fully witnessed the hardships encountered by those who have participated in the process. I feel that maybe it is necessary to adopt new ideas based on the experiences of these people. In addition, as mentioned earlier by Chairman Ishida, it has been decided that elections will be held under a new electoral system. Therefore, I feel it is proper for the coalition to move in this direction as a single unit, and we of the Kaikaku no Kai are in the process of discussing the issue with this thought in mind. [Nakamura] Minshu Kaikaku Rengo has already formed an upper house floor group called Shin Ryokufukai. This group is comprised of Minshu Kaikaku Rengo, Shinseito, JNP, and DSP. We are now in the process of asking upper house members from the SDPJ and Komeito to join us in Shin Ryokufukai. Therefore, particularly in the upper house, it is clearly evident that in order to enact the long-awaited policy agreement and prepare for next year's election, the coalition parties now want to move toward forming a unified group. With this in mind, we are actually in the process of moving in this direction. [Matsuoka] We do not have much time left. Let us have one more question. A while ago... please go ahead. [Unidentified correspondent] This is for confirmation. As the new coalition government is being formed, when we look at the stage there is one member missing who was present when the first coalition government was formed. Takemura from Sakigake is not here. While Sakigake withdrew from the coalition amidst the recent turmoil, there have been some LDP defectors, and many small groups have been formed. This has been referred to as Act II of the political realignment. Under such circumstances, in what specific ways does the coalition plan to deal with these groups, as well as Sakigake, in regard to working out cooperative relations with them? [Hata] I cannot talk about specific ways since I have not spoken to any of these people yet. However, the representatives of these groups have asked me to meet them immediately after this news conference. I plan to hold frank discussions with them. [Matsuoka] Thank you very much for your cooperation. We would like to conclude the joint news conference at this time. However, to round things off, we would like all the party leaders to shake hands together on the stage.
