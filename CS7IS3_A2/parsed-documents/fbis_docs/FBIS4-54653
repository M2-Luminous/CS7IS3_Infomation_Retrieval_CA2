At the same time, work must begin on raising the retirement age, on flexible retirement, and on incentives to work longer. The coordinating session, which was initiated by the retirement administration based on a resolution of the latest general assembly, was attended by six of the parliamentary groups, including representatives of the Hungarian Socialist Party, the Association of Young Democrats, the independents, the Hungarian Democratic Forum, and the Christian Democratic People's Party. The attending representatives agreed that the prerequisites for raising the retirement age by 1 January 1995 have not been met. For this reason the retirement administration proposed to postpone raising the retirement age, to detach it from the package of amendments to the social insurance law, and to treat it as a separate package. According to Social Committee Chairman Gyula Kis, who also represented the position of the Welfare Ministry, women who have been employed for at least 20 years and who will turn 55 between 1 January 1995 and the time when the law on increasing the retirement age becomes effective should be able to retire without limitation, but their employers should not be able to send them into retirement merely because they reached the retirement age. A motion to this effect was submitted to parliament already, requesting urgent discussion of the matter. Work continues on the rest of the package.
