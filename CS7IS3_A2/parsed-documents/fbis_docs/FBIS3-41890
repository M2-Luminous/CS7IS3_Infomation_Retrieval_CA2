In 1993, Russia's arms exports amounted to $1.2 billion. The work that has been accomplished has laid the foundation for future contracts, for example the supply of MiG-29 fighters to Malaysia. New opportunities in arms exports are opening up with the setting up of the Rosvooruzheniye [Russian Armaments] company. Its task is to amalgamate Russia's main exporters in military equipment and to coordinate their activities.
