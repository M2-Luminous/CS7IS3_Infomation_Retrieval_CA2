At the same time the high unemployment rate remains the key economic problem, according to the ministry's economic report for February, published in Bonn today. The rebuilding of the east German economy is continuing to make "clear progress," the report says. The private sector in eastern Germany is "increasingly gaining momentum." [passage omitted] The rise in the level of registered unemployed to over 4 million was "not surprising" and in line with the annual forecast. It was due largely to the usual effects of winter on the labor market, which would subside during the spring, the report predicts optimistically. In addition, the labor market is seen as a delayed indicator which "still shows the effects of last spring's economic setback in eastern Germany." [passage omitted]
