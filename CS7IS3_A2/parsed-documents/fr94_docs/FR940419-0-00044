FR940419-0-00044 FR940419-0-00017 Under the third prong of the definition, the Order decides that service made available ``to the public'' means any service that is offered without restriction on who may receive it. The Order also concludes that whether a service is offered to ``such classes of eligible users as to be effectively available to a substantial portion of the public'' depends on several relevant factors, such as the type, nature, and scope of users for whom the service is intended. The Commission decided not to consider limited system capacity or coverage of small geographic areas as factors in restricting system availability. If a service is provided only for internal use or only to a specified class of eligible users under the Commission's rules, then the Order concludes that the service will not meet the ``public availability'' prong of the CMRS definition. Third, the Order interpreted the term ``private mobile radio service'' by closely adhering to the statutory definition, and with the aim of advancing the congressional objective of applying a symmetrical regulatory framework to mobile services. The Order determines that the statutory language and the legislative history support the conclusion that a mobile service may be classified as PMRS only if it does not fall within the statutory definition of CMRS and is not the functional equivalent of a service that meets the three-part definition of CMRS. Those services that are classified as PMRS will, however, be presumed PMRS unless it is demonstrated that the service is the functional equivalent of CMRS. In applying the functional equivalence test, the Order considers a variety of factors, including whether the mobile service involved is a close substitute for any CMRS offering as evidenced by the cross-price elasticity of demand. Fourth, applying the definitions discussed above, the Order classifies existing private land mobile services and common carrier services. For example, all existing Government and Public Safety Services (including the Special Emergency Radio Service) and all Industrial and Land Transportation Services other than certain Business Radio Service are classified as PMRS. The Order also classifies Automatic Vehicle Monitoring as a private mobile radio service. In the Business Radio Service, which has a broader range of eligible users than other Industrial and Land Transportation services, the Order classifies Business Radio licensees who provide for-profit interconnected service to third-party users as CMRS. Business Radio licensees who operate not-for-profit internal systems, or who do not offer interconnected service, are classified as private. The Order classifies Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) licensees as CMRS if they offer interconnected service to customers. In addition, private carrier paging (PCP) services are classified as CMRS because they fit the statutory definition of CMRS. The Order concludes, however, those PCP systems that service the licensee's internal communications needs and do not offer for-profit service to third-party customers will be classified as PMRS. The Order classifies 220&hyph;222 MHz private land mobile systems using the same approach taken by the Order for classifying SMR and PCP licensees. Finally, with respect to existing common carrier services, the Order classifies as CMRS: Cellular service, 800 MHz air-ground service, common carrier paging service, mobile telephone service, improved mobile telephone service, trunked mobile telephone service, 454 MHz air-ground service, and Offshore Radio Service. With respect to mobile satellite service, the Order concludes that the Commission will exercise its discretion under the statute to determine whether the provision of space segment capacity by satellite licensees may be treated as common carriage. Lastly, the Order concludes that the Commission will seek further comment in a subsequent proceeding on whether it should remove existing restrictions that bar CMRS providers from offering dispatch service. Fifth, the Order determines that personal communications services (PCS) should be classified presumptively as CMRS. Under this approach, a PCS applicant or licensee would be regulated as a CMRS carrier, but would be able to offer private PCS and be regulated as PMRS, upon making the requisite showing. The Order concludes that treating PCS as presumptively CMRS most suits the manner in which the Commission has defined PCS, and the four goals that the Commission established for the service_speed of deployment, universality, competitive delivery, and diversity of services.
