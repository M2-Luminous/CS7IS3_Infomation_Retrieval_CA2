FR941021-0-00172 FR941021-0-00022 131. ARINC/ATA agrees that the proposed limits will protect GPS. 168 The FAA, however, recommended that the protection bandwidth for GPS ``be established at least 20 MHz wide ( i.e., 1575.42+/^10 MHz).'' 169 No technical analysis was provided to support this recommendation. 168 See ARINC/ATA Comments at 3. 169 See FAA Comments at 3. 132. TRW, Ellipsat, and LQP contend that the proposed out-of-band emission limits should be relaxed. 170 They contend that relaxing the limits will allow for reasonably priced user terminals and will adequately protect GPS from out-of-band emissions from these terminals. Constellation, in contrast, supports the proposed limits. It states that the protection level of GPS receivers is reasonable given the frequency separation between the lower end of the MSS band at 1610 MHz and GPS signals at 1575.42 MHz. 171 170 LQP suggested that the limit be ^50 dBW/1 MHz averaged over any 20 ms period in any portion of the 1575.42+/^1.023 MHz band for broadband noise emissions.

We believe that the proposed out-of-band emission limits for MSS user transceiver operations in the 1610&hyph;1626.5 MHz band are appropriate to protect GPS operations near 1575 MHz. Both the aviation and MSS parties participated in the Committee's deliberations that resulted in a consensus on an out-of-band emission limit for protecting GPS. No party has demonstrated that a modification of those limits is now warranted. The MSS parties do not demonstrate that the limits are overly restrictive or that significant additional costs would be incurred by building transceivers to meet the limits. Similarly, the aviation parties have not shown that additional protection bandwidth for GPS is necessary. We therefore adopt proposed ยง25.213(b) with minor editorial changes. 134. Protection of GLONASS from out-of-band emissions from primary uplinks in the 1610&hyph;1626.5 MHz band. The Committee also addressed potential MSS out-of-band interference to GLONASS operations below 1610 MHz, but did not reach a consensus. It did, however, suggest a methodology that could be used to determine appropriate limits. It also noted that there was general agreement that the MSS user transceiver out-of-band emission limits recommended for protecting GPS would be sufficient to protect GLONASS operations below 1610 MHz. 172 We requested comment on the proposed methodology and on the appropriate parameters to be used in developing protection criteria. 172 See Committee Report, note 23, supra, at para. 5.2.2.7. 135. ARINC/ATA and Rockwell maintain that the MSS out-of-band emission limits appropriate for protecting GPS operations near 1575 MHz should similarly apply to GLONASS operations below 1610 HMz. 173 The FAA suggests an interference threshold of ^145 dBW/1MHz of GLONASS receivers operating below 1610 MHz and calculates a ^71 dBW/1MHz MSS user terminal out-of-band emission limit which, it argues, is necessary to protect GLONASS operations at that particular interference threshold. 174 . 173 See ARINC and ATA Comments at 3 and Reply at 7; Rockwell Comments at 4. 174 FAA Comments at 3&hyph;4. 136. The MSS applicants question whether the assumptions made by the aviation parties in their analyses are appropriate and disagree that a direct correlation can be made between the out-of-band emission limits necessary for protecting GPS and the limits necessary for protecting GLONASS below 1610 MHz. Constellation, for example, noted that the provisions to protect GPS from MSS out-of-band emissions were agreed to in the Committee, but that agreement was ``without prejudice to the application of the interference protection model to any other case, i.e., GLONASS, where it would be impractical to provide this same level of protection and for which other solutions are required to avoid harmful interference.'' 175 LQP notes that while the FAA, ARINC and ATA seek protection of individual GLONASS signals, they have not provided an analysis of why such protection is required to ensure the integrity of the GLONASS system. 176 Motorola contends that the analyses conducted by the aviation community are ``skewed'' because they have assumed that the MSS transmitter and the aircraft receiver are static when, in fact, both devices are usually mobile. 177 Motorola also lists a number of factors which it argues would provide a more accurate determination of necessary out-of-band emission limits. 178 TRW requests that we incorporate in the rules the ongoing measurement programs and the system vulnerability analyses now being used to determine actual protection requirements of GNSS. 179 175 See Constellation Comments at 49. 176 See LQP Reply at 60&hyph;61. On LQP's behalf Sat-Tech Systems conducted an independent study of GNSS satellite availability. Sat-Tech Systems concluded that since multiple measurements from a number of GPS and GLONASS satellites would always be available, the loss of a single GNSS signal would not impair the ability to navigate using GNSS. LQP Comments, Technical Appendix at para. 2.2.1. 177 Motorola Reply at 51. 178 These include the effects of duty cycle, modulation technique, spectral overlap, channel assignment, airframe shielding, time duration of event, and signal processing. Motorola describes in detail the individual impact of each of these factors on the analyses in its reply technical appendix at 1&hyph;10. 179 See TRW Reply at 77 (n 118). 137. We will not adopt out-of-band emission limits to protect GLONASS operations below 1610 MHz at this time. The Committee did not agree on limits and the record indicates that a suitable methodology for determining such limits has still not been agreed upon. We note, however, that RTCA Working Group SC159 ad hoc has been established to assess interference to GNSS and possible interference mitigation techniques. The aviation community and the Big LEO applicants participate in this group. We expect that the report from SC159 ad hoc will include an assessment of the out-of-band emission limits on MSS operations necessary to protect GLONASS operations below 1610 MHz. We also believe that this information will provide a mutually acceptable out-of-band emission level.
