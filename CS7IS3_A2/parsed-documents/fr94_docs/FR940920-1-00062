FR940920-1-00062 FR940920-1-00007 As shown in table 5, the EU guidelines cover many of the same pollutants as the EPA NSPS proposed in today's notice. There are differences between the EPA standards and the EU guidelines with regard to regulatory flexibility for demonstrating compliance, as well as the test methods used to measure emissions. Factors like these should be considered when comparing emission requirements. The EPA and EU both have set levels for PM, HC1, SO 2 , and CO. For these pollutants, the allowable emission levels proposed by the EPA are more restrictive than the EU guidelines. No EU guidelines exist for NO X or dioxins/furans, and the EU metals emission guidelines are for combined metals (e.g., Hg+Cd). As shown in table 5, the EPA NSPS for both large and small plants for Hg and Cd, if combined, are lower than the EU Hg+Cd guideline. Some of the EU countries have adopted limits that are more stringent than the general EU guidelines. For example, The Netherlands has recently adopted standards for new and existing MWC's that are considered to be some of the most stringent in the world. For example, the Dutch Hg limit of 0.065 mg/dscm for new MWC's (corrected to 7 percent O 2 ) is lower than both the EU guideline and the EPA's proposed Hg standards. The Dutch dioxin/furan limit for new MWC's is 0.13 ng/dscm TEQ. This limit is lower than the EPA's proposed standard of 0.20 ng/dscm TEQ or 13 ng/dscm total dioxins/furans. The EU has no dioxin/furan limit. It is difficult to directly compare the Dutch standards to the EPA standards or to the performance of U.S. MWC's because the test methods used in The Netherlands to measure emissions are different from those used in the United States. Several new MWC plants are currently being constructed in The Netherlands and are expected to demonstrate compliance in 1995. As with some of the EU countries, some of the individual States are establishing more stringent emissions standards than those in today's proposed standards. Brief descriptions of the regulations under consideration in Florida, Minnesota, and New Jersey are presented below. The State of Florida has promulgated a regulation that would set an Hg emission limit of 0.070 mg/dscm (corrected to 7 percent O 2 ), or an 80-percent Hg reduction, for facilities that install Hg control equipment (e.g., activated carbon injection) and that are equipped with acid gas control equipment. This limit must be met by July 1, 1995, and compliance must be demonstrated annually using EPA Reference Method 101A. For facilities equipped with acid gas control equipment that choose to control Hg exclusively through the use of an Hg waste separation program, Hg emissions would be limited to 0.14 mg/dscm after July 1, 1995 and to 0.070 mg/dscm after July 1, 1997. Compliance must be demonstrated semiannually using Reference Method 101A. Facilities not currently equipped with acid gas controls will be required to meet the proposed Hg emission limits when the facility is required to demonstrate compliance with the acid gas limits included in the EPA's proposal. Florida's rulemaking procedures to develop SO 2 and HC1 emission limits will be initiated by December 1, 1994, unless the Federal regulations (today's action) have been proposed by that date. The State of Minnesota has also promulgated Hg requirements for MWC's. For mass burn MWC's with acid gas control, the quarterly Hg emission limit (one three-test run average) is 0.10 mg/dscm (corrected to 7 percent O 2 ). However, the annual average Hg emissions limit (average of the four most recent quarterly tests) is 0.060 mg/dscm. Measurements must be made using EPA Reference Method 29. The Minnesota requirement also allows MWC's to demonstrate compliance with the quarterly and annual limits by achieving an alternative 85-percent reduction in Hg emissions. Similar to the Florida regulations, the Minnesota regulations provide less stringent standards for MWC's without acid gas control until the time that acid gas control is required. The State of New Jersey will be proposing an Hg standard for MWC's of 0.028 mg/dscm (corrected to 7 percent O 2 ), which would be effective as of January 1, 2000, and an interim standard of 0.065 mg/dscm or an 80-percent reduction, which would be effective as of December 31, 1995. The 0.028 mg/dscm limit is based on reducing the uncontrolled Hg emission level (assumed to be 0.70 mg/dscm) by 80 percent through reduction of Hg in the waste burned, and another 80-percent reduction from Hg in the flue gas. These limits are annual averages based on quarterly 3-run testing (i.e., a total of 12 runs), using EPA Reference Method 29. IX. Miscellaneous This section addresses the two following issues: (1) The selection of a ``no control'' limit for NO X for MWC's at small MWC plants, and (2) the July 14, 1992 remand of the issue of lead-acid vehicle battery combustion, and (3) a general request for comment on the proposal. Regarding the first issue, section 129 of the Act specifies that standards for MWC's must include emission limits for PM, opacity, SO 2 , HC1, NO X , CO, Pb, Cd, Hg, and dioxins/furans. This means that emission limits for these pollutants must be specified even if the MACT selected for a subcategory of facilities does not control that particular pollutant. In particular, under today's proposal, the MACT floor and MACT for NO X control at small MWC plants is based on no control (see section IV.F.1.c for additional discussion). Therefore, a ``no control'' emission limit is proposed for NO X emissions from small MWC plants. The proposed ``no control'' limit for NO X for small MWC plants is 500 ppmv. This proposed limit is not intended to result in emissions control, and the proposal does not include any testing, reporting, or recordkeeping requirements. The EPA expects that the ``no control'' limit will not be exceeded. The 500 ppmv limit represents an emission level higher than any of the test data and allows an adequate margin to accommodate the variability in NO X emission levels. The EPA requests public comments on whether it is appropriate to include such a ``no control'' emission limit in the final NSPS or whether such a limit is not necessary. Regarding the second issue, on December 20, 1989, the EPA proposed NSPS and emission guidelines for new and existing MWC's under section 111 of the Act. The proposed NSPS and emission guidelines included a prohibition on the combustion of lead-acid vehicle batteries in MWC's. On February 11, 1991, the EPA promulgated standards and guidelines for new and existing MWC's that did not prohibit the combustion of lead-acid vehicle batteries. The decision not to prohibit the combustion of lead-acid vehicle batteries was challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals by the NRDC, the State of New York, and the State of Florida. In 1992, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that the EPA had not adequately explained its decision not to require a lead acid battery separation as part of the 1991 NSPS and emission guidelines, when it had included such a requirement in its proposed rule ( State of New York v. Reilly , 969 F.2d 1147, 1153 (D.C. Cir. 1992)). The EPA is not addressing the lead acid battery issue in this notice, but will publish a separate notice in the Federal Register in the near future.
