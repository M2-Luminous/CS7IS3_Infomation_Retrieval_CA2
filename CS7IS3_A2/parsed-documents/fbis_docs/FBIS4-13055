Thus, a mere few hours later, the Israeli delegation and the Omanis reached an agreement -- the first of its kind -- on regional Omani-Israeli cooperation in solar energy development. Israeli experts will visit an Omani solar energy center in about two weeks, and Omani solar energy experts will visit Israel several weeks later to promote the issue. Thus, Omani-Israeli cooperation on solar energy is to be launched in the coming weeks. So far, all the Israeli proposals at the multilateral talks have been submitted through third parties, but today Israel itself will submit a proposal on a project for sea water desalination for small towns.
