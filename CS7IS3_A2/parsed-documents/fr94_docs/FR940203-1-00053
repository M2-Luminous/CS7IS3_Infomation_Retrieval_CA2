FR940203-1-00053 FR940203-1-00011 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 50 [FRL&hyph;4832&hyph;8] Review of National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone AGENCY: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). ACTION: Notice of review. SUMMARY: This notice announces the EPA's plans to review and revise the Air Quality Criteria for Ozone and Other Photochemical Oxidants (Criteria Document) as rapidly as possible and to complete review of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for ozone (O 3 ) as soon as possible thereafter. The Clean Air Act (Act) requires periodic review and, if appropriate, revision of the NAAQS and of the air quality criteria on which they are based. The EPA completed its last formal review of the air quality criteria for O 3 in 1989. Based on that review, the EPA announced a final decision on March 9, 1993 not to revise the existing O 3 NAAQS. Since early 1989, however, a substantial number of new studies on the health and environmental effects of O 3 have appeared in the peer-reviewed literature. The EPA is moving as rapidly as possible to review them, consistent with assuring a sound, scientifically-supportable decision. The review process includes: (1) Reviewing and revising the Criteria Document; (2) reviewing the NAAQS through development of a Staff Paper based on the revised Criteria Document; (3) external review of Criteria Document and Staff Paper drafts by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) of the EPA's Science Advisory Board, an independent panel of scientific experts, and by the public; and (4) examining implementation ramifications of changes to the O 3 NAAQS. The EPA intends to adhere to strict schedules for external review of Criteria Document and Staff Paper drafts consistent with a full opportunity for thorough scientific and public review, and to deny any requests for extensions of the public comment periods specified in this notice. During this NAAQS review, the EPA intends to continue implementing programs designed to meet the current standards and the requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 to ensure continued improvement in air quality. The EPA is also examining options for implementing alternative O 3 NAAQS to ensure a smooth transition if a decision is made to revise the existing NAAQS.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Based on a Criteria Document issued by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare in 1970, the EPA promulgated the first NAAQS for photochemical oxidants under section 109 of the Act (36 FR 8186) in 1971. The primary and secondary NAAQS were both set at an hourly average of 0.08 parts per million (ppm) total photochemical oxidants not to be exceeded more than 1 hour per year. In 1977, the EPA announced (42 FR 20493) the first review and updating of the 1970 Criteria Document in accordance with section 109(d)(1) of the Act. The EPA published a Criteria Document in 1978. Based on the revised Criteria Document and taking into account public comments on revisions proposed to the primary and secondary NAAQS in 1978 (43 FR 16962), the EPA announced revisions to the 1971 standards in 1979 (44 FR 8202). The primary standard was revised from 0.08 parts per million (ppm) to 0.12 ppm; the secondary standard was set identical to the primary standard; the chemical designation of the standards was changed from photochemical oxidants to O 3 ; and the form of the standards was revised from a deterministic form to a statistical form, which defines attainment of the standards as occurring when the expected number of days per calendar year with maximum hourly average concentrations greater than 0.12 ppm is equal to or less than one. In 1982 (47 FR 11561), the EPA announced plans to revise the 1978 Criteria Document. In 1983, the EPA announced (48 FR 38009) that review of primary and secondary standards for O 3 had been initiated. The EPA subsequently provided a number of opportunities for public review and comment on drafts of the Criteria Document and associated Staff Paper (Review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone: Assessment of Scientific and Technical Information_Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards Staff Paper). After reviewing the draft Criteria Document in 1985 and 1986, the CASAC sent the Administrator a ``closure letter'' outlining key issues and recommendations and indicating that it was satisfied with the final draft of the 1986 Criteria Document. Following closure, a number of scientific articles and abstracts were published or accepted for publication that appeared to be of sufficient importance concerning potential health and welfare effects of O 3 to warrant preparation of a supplement to the Criteria Document (Supplement). The CASAC, having already reviewed two drafts of the Staff Paper in 1986 and 1987, concluded that sufficient new information existed to recommend incorporation of relevant new information into a third draft of the Staff Paper.
