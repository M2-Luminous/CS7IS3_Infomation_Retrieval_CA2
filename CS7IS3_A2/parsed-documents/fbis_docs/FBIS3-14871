Andrey Kozyrev told Russian and foreign journalists on Monday night at the Foreign Ministry that at present it is necessary for Russia, the United States, and other states to unite efforts in the search for a political settlement in Bosnia. There is only one way toward peace in Bosnia -- not through escalation of violence and using air power, but through a joint search for a political solution, he said. Now, following the initiative of the Russian president, it is important not to lose momentum, tackle the problems of setting up safety zones, and work on the implementation of what has already been agreed with regard to stabilization of the situation in the region, the minister stressed.
