One may say that this is nothing odd for a society in transition, for a state in which changes have been moving so fast that, in spite of peace and tranquility, changes, traumas, social segmentations, political fervor, and disappointments are taking place. They are yet to come! The disintegration of the VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Movement for Macedonian National Unity] today, as an affair, is nothing new. It has been the most evident political process going on for three years. It has already broken down into several parties with the same prefix. The leadership of this party was the only one that did not become aware of this process, forecast long ago by Macedonian political analysts! Actually, that is the main reason for this disintegration. Perhaps it is traumatic for the common affiliate, sympathizer, or member of this party. As far as the leadership is concerned, as well as those who led it and created it (and degraded it), there is simply no justification for lies or ignorance. There were (we shall see that later in the text) enough signs, indications, and warnings that advertised the present situation. Ehether they could not or did not want to, the VMRO-DPMNE leadership neither listened to the warnings, nor wanted to see what was coming. "Spying" Affair That is why the thesis putting the blame on the State Security Service, which was said to be the main suspect for the misfortune of the party that won the majority of seats in the Assembly at the first multiparty elections in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] simply cannot be true. The plain and obvious reason for this is that if it were correct, the logic would be -- if the VMRO-DPMNE had been a party that articulated its political doctrine, united and solid, there could have been no influences that could affect the disintegration of the party, which had such great chances. However, chances are one thing, political skill is another. Yes, why is the VMRO-DPMNE actually falling apart? The roots of this misfortune must be searched for in the past. They are to be found right at the beginning of the formation of this party, in the establishment of its foundations, in the establishment of its political practice. Since its formation, suspicions have been created that have not been negated so far, nor have there been any attempts to clear them up. Information on who created this party remains obscure, as well as whose idea and intention it was. The ideological founder, Dragan Bogdanovski, is still formally the honorable president of the party, and he hinted that he would discover the details, however nothing has happened so far. In the euphoria of the election campaign, few people paid attention to details, thus many inconsistencies, unproven claims and promises, and unjustified attacks and insinuations came from this party. Nevertheless, when that political embellishment became regular practice, it was clear that this party was full of contradictions that could only be removed with a wise, hard, and realistic political work. Instead, some recognizable (and predictable) events took place in the party. Starting from the elimination of Vladimir Golubovski just after the elections, in the style of communist showdowns in the struggle for power, to the present purges -- the VMRO-DPMNE staff acted on the principles of "supreme" power and feverishly sticking to the positions held by the leadership. It is logical that such a party, not open to debate, deprived of the feeling for ideas and reality, will be left without a clear perspective. Mistake After Mistake At the root of the disintegration of the party that was close to power (and it alone is to be blamed for not achieving it), there were uncounted elements, events, procedures, initiatives, and excesses. All of them, together, have played their role in today's outcome. It is symptomatic that the VMRO-DPMNE did not succeed in taking a decisive, consistent, and politically opportune stance on numerous question in the area we refer to as "strategic." It is still not clear why the VMRO-DPMNE opposed the referendum on independence until the very end, offering instead the far less important declaration on independence that had to be adopted by the Assembly. The party's delegates were against the adoption of the Macedonian Constitution until the last moment; they even organized demonstrations in front of the Assembly building, with the aim of blocking its adoption. Everything continued in the same style. A range of laws that this party had an interest in and proposed were not adopted, and it contributed to this, because the manner of the parliamentary group became that of an opposition, thus their stances and dilemmas lost the crucial significance. In the domain of the "hottest" question -- the dispute with Greece -- the parliamentarians of the majority group in the Assembly had a negative approach. Their proposals were limited to support for a "more aggressive diplomacy" and their full contribution was reduced to suspicions that somebody was "selling off Macedonia," that somebody was doing something devious. Regarding the importance of the admission of the Republic of Macedonia to the United Nations, they constantly repeated (without effect) that it was achieved in that awkward name -- FYROM. We simply did not hear a single inventive thought that could support their denial and opposition. It is not known on the basis of what assessments they expected the government and the parties that constitute it to fall soon so that they may come to power, but it is even less explicable that Georgievski left the position of vice president of the presidency, thus losing the opportunity of learning something and being, more or less, near the sources of information that could provide him with more sense in decision making when important issues are at stake. It is also unknown why this party voted for the fall of [former Prime Minister] Kljusev's government in which there were many persons affiliated to the VMRO-DPMNE, after which they missed the opportunity of forming a government in which they would represent the majority. The present debacle is a result of the numerous staements and deliberations of the party in which it called for rebellion (on 2 August 1991), expressing semitruths and lies whenever it suited somebody in the party, making statements that power could be taken in Macedonia in a democratic way. Political Semi-People The responsibility for the fall in the party's ratings falls on the parliamentarians. Through the low level of their discourse and the inarticulate deliberations and excesses, with a lower-class vocabulary, the VMRO-DPMNE parliamentarians were the leading personalities in debasing the reputation of the parliament. The awareness that it is to do with political (and moral) semi-people was overwhelming for many of those who expected much from pluralism. Whether it was it by intent or simply their nature, it will be noted that this party signed and insisted on its verdict itself, in the presence of the public. And finally, the suspicions about its affiliation to the eastern neighbor were proven by the party itself after its recent support for the Movement for Friendship between Bulgaria and Macedonia. The same party that was strongly criticizing all those who were allegedly affiliated to the northern neighbor is now unreservedly acting under influences that are of a very suspicious nature. The VMRO-DPMNE is a sad story about the great wish for power based on small possibilities, small efforts, and little reason. Instead of using victory to define a political line that would be compatible with the times and circumstances, the leadership of the party involved itself in the schemes and inheritance of a classical totalitarian and nationalist party (or movement) that, at the moment it had nothing to support -- when the independence of Macedonia and its self consciousness came so quickly and in a relatively painless way -- did not find the strength to modify its policy. The election victory, won as a lottery, was wasted the way a poor person spends money that is easily earned. That is why looking for the reasons for the disintegration is nothing but a bad excuse, a befogging and covering up of the real guilt for the debacle. Fortunately, but it is also a great disappointment, the members and sympathizers of this party know perfectly well where the problem lies. We believe they discovered it a long time ago.
