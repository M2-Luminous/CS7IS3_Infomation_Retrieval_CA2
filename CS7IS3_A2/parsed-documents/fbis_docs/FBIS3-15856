Many nonindigenous inhabitants sincerely believed that this act was in the mainstream of the democratic transformations which had begun and candidly answered that they were in favor. But now they have become convinced that they were simply misled. And on the third anniversary of that memorable poll a mass protest meeting was held on Riflemen's Square in central Riga, announced as a memorial meeting for the defunct "Latvian democracy for all." The triumphal all-Latvia poll laid the foundation not to interethnic harmony but created a "Republic of South Africa in the center of Europe" -- that was the leitmotiv of the speakers' speeches. Municipal elections will be held in Latvia soon. The Latvian saeima has adopted a law whereby only citizens of the republic can elect the municipal organs of power. Now the saeima intends to deliver another blow to noncitizens: A draft law on the status of the deputies of local organs of management of all levels has been put on the plenary session's agenda in its third, final, reading. At the initiative of the national radicals it includes a clause compelling deputies to receive voters and examine the applications and appeals of voters, that is only of those who are Latvian citizens. The Latvian league of stateless persons has notified the republic's leaders and the ambassadors of foreign states that depriving noncitizens of the right to resolve their delay problems at elected municipal level and simply to be received is a gross act of provocation which pushes hundreds of thousands of outcasts to create their own alternative organs and representative missions at municipal level.
