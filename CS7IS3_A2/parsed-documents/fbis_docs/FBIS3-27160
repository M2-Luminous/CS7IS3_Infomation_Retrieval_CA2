In a telephone conversation with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, he said the other two priorities were to take action to consolidate other safe areas in Bosnia and to urge the warring factions to reach an accord on a peaceful settlement based on the European Union (EU) plan. According to the Russian president's press office, leaders of the two countries expressed support for an active UN role in resolving the Bosnian issue and said the proposal put forward by mediator states to end the conflict through political means was very important. They hoped that the meeting of foreign ministers from Russia, the United States and EU member states, which is to be held Tuesday [22 February] in Bonn, would present specific measures for solving the Bosnian issue through political means. Meanwhile, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev today reiterated Russia's hope that leaders from Russia, the United States, Britain, France and Germany would hold special talks on the Bosnian situation. In a conversation over the telephone with his U.S. counterpart William Perry, he also suggested that defense ministers from these countries meet to discuss specific measures for resolving the Bosnia crisis. The Russian television reported that Perry had rejected Grachev's proposal to send U.S. peacekeepers into Bosnia's Muslim-dominated areas, but said his country would discuss the matter with its Western allies.
