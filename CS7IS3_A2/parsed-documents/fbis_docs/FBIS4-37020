FBIS4-37020 "drnes116_l_94006" FBIS-NES-94-116 Daily Report 15 Jun 1994 ISRAEL U.S. Ban on Export of Supercomputers Bypassed U.S. Ban on Export of Supercomputers Bypassed TA1506170294 Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew 15 Jun 94 p 19 TA1506170294 Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT Hebrew BFN [Report by Dudi Goldman] [Text] Several Israeli institutions recently purchased sophisticated American computers with a capacity equivalent to that of a supercomputer, which the U.S. Defense Department has banned from being exported to Israel. The United States restricts exports of fast supercomputers to many countries, especially those who have not signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. But a new development by the U.S. firm Mips [as transliterated] and the Japanese firm Toshiba enhances the performance of medium-size computers, which can be exported to Israel, to the level of a very fast supercomputer, which cannot be exported to Israel. The new development provides the computer with a processing capacity of 300 million instructions per second. In fact, it is a flexible computer which can operate on one array of chips, which does not require a special export license, but to which an additional array of chips can be added. A computer with three arrays of chips requires a special license since it attains the processing power of a supercomputer. In principle, even five such arrays of chips can be added to the computer.
