This goes dead against the Danish Government's plans to reduce Danish military expenditures in the next defense agreement by around 5 percent, an amount corresponding to 750 million kroner. Defense Minister Hans Haekkerup (SDP [Social Democratic Party]) does not see any problem with the Danish military cutbacks, however. "Denmark, in comparison to a number of other NATO countries, has cut relatively little over the past few years, and when we measure in defense expenditures per capita, Denmark is doing fine." In the press release from NATO, it states that the organization in "an uncertain world must preserve its military strength and capabilities, so the alliance can fulfill its missions." At the same time it was emphasized that NATO's new peackeeping role places increased demands.
