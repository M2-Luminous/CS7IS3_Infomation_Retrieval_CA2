The Beijing Language Institute held a campus debate between two teams of Chinese and foreign students, respectively, recently, exploring the topic "equality between the sexes, forever impossible?" The debate drew an audience of over 100 foreign students studying in Beijing. The six-strong team of foreign students from the Beijing Language Institute proved a tough rival for their Chinese counterparts, both in the Chinese language and arguments, the judges from the institute said. Taking the position that men and women can never be equal, the foreign team said that physical conditions, social customs and division of labor will not allow real equality between the sexes. But the Chinese team argued that as a half of the society, women can and must play an equal role to men's. The debate ended with an even score. Two Chinese and two foreign students won prizes for "best debater". The students said that they realized there is really a gap between the rival opinions, and they learned a lot about how different the situations in specific countries are. It was the first campus debate between Chinese and foreign students ever held by the institute, which was the first college to take in foreign students for studying Chinese on the mainland. It is the seventh consecutive year that it has sponsored debates in the Chinese language for foreign students.
