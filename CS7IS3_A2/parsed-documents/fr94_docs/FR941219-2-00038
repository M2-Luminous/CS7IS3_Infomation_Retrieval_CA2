FR941219-2-00038 FR941219-2-00028 We will adopt a presumption that the alleged crude oil overcharges were absorbed, rather than passed on, by applicants which were (1) end-users of petroleum products, (2) unrelated to the petroleum industry, and (3) not subject to the regulations promulgated under the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973 (EPAA), 15 U.S.C. 751&hyph;760h. In order to receive a refund, end-user claimants need not submit any evidence of injury beyond documentation of their purchase volumes. See Shell, 17 DOE at 88,406. Petroleum retailer, reseller, and refiner applicants must submit detailed evidence of injury, and they may not rely upon the injury presumptions utilized in refined product cases. Id. These applicants, however, may use econometric evidence of the type found in the OHA Report on Stripper Well Overcharges, 6 Fed. Energy Guidelines ¶90,507 (1985). See also PODRA §3003(b)(2), 15 U.S.C. 4502(b)(2). If a claimant has executed and submitted a valid waiver pursuant to one of the escrows established by the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement, it has waived its rights to file an application for Subpart V crude oil refund monies. See Mid-America Dairymen v. Herrington, 878 F.2d 1448 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App.), 3 Fed. Energy Guidelines ¶26,617 (1989); In re: Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation, 707 F. Supp. 1267 (D. Kan.), 3 Fed Energy Guidelines ¶26,613 (1987). As has been stated in prior Decisions, a crude oil refund applicant will only be required to submit one application for its share of all available crude oil overcharge funds. See, e.g., A. Tarricone, Inc., 15 DOE ¶85,495 (1987). A party that has already submitted a claim to any other crude oil refund proceeding implemented by the DOE need not file another claim. The prior application will be deemed to be filed in all crude oil refund proceedings finalized to date. The DOE had previously established June 30, 1994 as the final deadline for filing an Application for Refund from the crude oil funds. See 58 FR 26318 (May 3, 1993). Although that date has passed, it has been decided to re-open the crude proceeding. See 59 Fed. Reg. 55656 (November 8, 1994). The new closing date for this proceeding has been tentatively set for June 3, 1996. Id. It is the policy of the DOE to pay all crude oil refund claims at the rate of $.0008 per gallon. While we anticipate that applicants that filed their claims before June 30, 1988 will receive a supplemental refund payment, we will decide in the future whether claimants that filed later applications should receive additional refunds. See, e.g., Seneca Oil Co., 21 DOE ¶85,327 (1991). Notice of any additional amounts available in the future will be published in the Federal Register . C. Payments to the Federal Government and the States Under the terms of the MSRP, we propose that the remaining eighty percent of the alleged crude oil overcharge amounts subject to this Proposed Decision, plus accrued interest, should be disbursed in equal shares to the states and the federal government for indirect restitution. Refunds to the states will be in proportion to the consumption of petroleum products in each state during the period of price controls. The share or ratio of the funds which each state will receive is contained in Exhibit H of the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement, 6 Fed. Energy Guidelines ¶90,509 at 90,687. When disbursed, these funds will be subject to the same limitations and reporting requirements as all other crude oil monies received by the states under the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement. It Is Therefore Ordered That: The funds remitted by Murphy Oil Corp., Murphy Oil USA, Inc., and Murphy Exploration & Production Co. pursuant to the Consent Order entered into with the DOE on July 15, 1994 will be distributed in accordance with the foregoing Decision.
