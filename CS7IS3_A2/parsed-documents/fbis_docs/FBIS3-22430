This is the disturbing conclusion of Candidate of Technical Sciences Boris Karasev, senior scientific associate at the Hydrogeology and Engineering Geology Institute. Few people know about the independent study conducted by teams of experts from the Sociology Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the U.S. Center for Civic Initiative in Bryansk, Zhitomir, and Gomel oblasts in 1991 and 1992. They found that many people living in these regions displayed signs of acute radiation sickness, which can be caused by doses of 100-400 rad. Some of the victims had died. In others, the sickness had taken chronic forms: Their complaints included asthenia, headaches, xerostomia, enlarged lymph nodes, and tumors of the thyroid gland and other organs. Half of the children in zones of radioactive pollution measuring more than 40 c/km[.sup]2[/] are suffering from these chronic forms of illness. The independent commission's findings contradicted the IAEA reports that the radioactive pollution in the contaminated regions could not cause any particular damage. Then why did local inhabitants, contrary to the expectations of the nuclear scientists, suffer radiation injuries? The independent experts had no explanation. It was not until two years later than Boris Karasev found the reason. He went to the regions affected by the Chernobyl disaster each year to study the content and migration of regressive radionuclides. The experimental findings he accumulated are unique: They serve as the basis for fundamentally new theoretical conclusions. Boris Karasev frequently encountered paradoxical cases: Some of the people in regions where the average level of radiation did not exceed the allowable limit had been exposed to doses of radiation dozens of times as high as the hazard level set by the USSR Ministry of Health. People in these regions sometimes died of radiation sickness.... The researcher's observations were corroborated by the Russian-American commission of independent experts. After comparing its findings to his own, Boris Karasev was able to guess the secret of the radiation injuries these people had suffered. "According to official data," Boris Viktorovich explained, "the damaged power unit in Chernobyl discharged around 40 percent of the cesium-137 and almost all of the iodine-131 it contained at the time of the accident. These radioisotopes entered the environment in approximately the same quantities, but their effects were incomparable. The fact is that iodine-131 has an extremely short half-life -- eight days -- and is therefore highly radioactive. It is a thousand times more active than cesium-137, for example, with its half-life of 30 years. Iodine-131 is extremely volatile and can be carried thousands of kilometers in clouds of radioactive dust. It is also highly soluble, and it penetrates soil easily, where it is absorbed by plants and then enters the organism of animals and humans. These properties of iodine are the reason for the colossal damage it inflicted on the environment in the first days after the Chernobyl disaster. Radioactive background levels were three or four times as high even in Moscow at the end of April 1986, and in Kiev they were almost 8,000 times as high, reaching 5 milliroentgens per hour. The population of Novozybkovskiy Rayon in Bryansk Oblast was not advised to use powdered milk and to protect and decontaminate buildings until after May Day. The antitoxin for the radioactive iodine was distributed...three weeks after the accident, when this isotope had already decayed. Many people shared this experience: Almost all of us -- from Kiev to Moscow and Minsk -- breathed, drank, and ate some iodine-131 in late April and early May 1986. What did this do to us? Almost all of the iodine entering the human organism is absorbed by the thyroid gland. It takes on most of the brunt of the iodine shock. Whereas the average load on the organism does not exceed the maximum allowable dose of radiation by radioactive iodine -- 30 rem -- the local radiation of the thyroid can be as high as 800 rem. That is why people are suffering from numerous disorders of the thyroid gland -- even cancer and the destruction of thyroid tissue -- in regions where the IAEA believes that the level of radiation is not dangerous. The amount of radioactive iodine carried by precipitation differed widely: In some places the content in the soil was dozens of times higher than in surrounding areas. Some types of plants absorbed it more vigorously and were then consumed by humans. Other people ingested iodine-131 in concentrated form -- in the milk of cows and goats feeding on radioactive grass. All of this could have been harmless for people who had drunk potassium iodide: This substance contains non-radioactive iodine, and a thyroid saturated with it will cease to absorb radioactive iodine, which will then quickly be flushed out of the organism. Regrettably, most of the inhabitants of the affected regions learned about this too late. "But the nuclear scientists," I said to the researcher, "must have known about the horrible implications of the massive accident at the nuclear plant. Why did they not warn the civilian population in time and supply it with the means of preventing radiation sickness?" "On orders from the government," Boris Karasev replied, "some `specialists' are still pretending that they know nothing about this danger. They calculate the average maximum allowable doses for polluted territories and seem not to notice the statistical disparities, which can be quite sizable. Their calculations are based on methods military specialists have been using since the early 1960's. For some unknown reason, however, the `experts' in calculating the maximum dose for civilians have been drawing harmonious isoflux patterns of radionuclide dispersion and migration on their charts, showing that everything is fine on the average, and have argued that exceptional cases cannot be anticipated. It turns out, however, that they can: Several other researchers and I compiled the logarithmic curves for different isotopes long ago, showing how the population can absorb doses of varying intensity. These curves have extremely long `tails': This means that some people in territories deemed safe by the IAEA can receive a more than lethal dose. This was corroborated by the independent Russian-American commission in 1991 and 1992." "Judging by your graphs, however, some people in the polluted territories received doses that were hundreds or even thousands of times as high as the average. Is this really possible?" "It is, and that is the whole problem. Specialists know that the reactor discharged huge quantities of so-called hot particles at the time of the Chernobyl accident in Chernobyl. At a temperature of 2,000 degrees the radioisotopes were `fused' together. They formed extremely tiny grains, no larger than a hundredth of a micron, but they were many times more active than the rest of the substance. "These particles do not dissolve in water. If they get into the lungs, they stay there until they decay. During that time the individual could receive local doses thousands of times as high as the allowable maximum: This individual would be just as sick as someone who received a lethal dose when the atom bomb was dropped. "Of course, these details spoil the rosy picture the IAEA has painted, but is it not time to remove our rose-colored glasses and face the danger? Accidents at nuclear plants are still occurring, and no one is insured against new Chernobyls. "It is no secret that small nuclear reactors are operating in Moscow and other big cities. Powerful Mev reactors are operating in many oblasts. Even in the fail-safe mode, some reactors discharge many different radioactive substances through their exhaust pipes. Nuclear power engineers argue that these substances are distributed evenly across a huge territory, but according to logarithmic law there is the possibility of quite sizable disparities. In some types of weather, the smoke from pipes hugs the ground, and the iodine-131, krypton-85, and other radioisotopes in the smoke can be washed away by rain. There is the possibility, therefore, that the content of radioactive isotopes in the air and soil in some places is higher than the danger level -- with all of the ensuing consequences. "If anyone still plans to start up huge new reactors at nuclear power plants," the researcher said in conclusion, "he must consider the serious danger of iodine shock as a result of a disaster, as well as the uneven patterns of radioisotope fall-out in the fail-safe mode. All of the old forecasts, after all, turned out to be inaccurate, to say the least. We need new calculations, based on logarithmic curves. They probably would prove the need for higher expenditures on gas masks, potassium iodide, decontamination agents, and other means of preventing radiation injuries in the civilian population. Can anyone doubt that these expenditures will be recouped a thousandfold by the preservation of the health of millions of people?"
