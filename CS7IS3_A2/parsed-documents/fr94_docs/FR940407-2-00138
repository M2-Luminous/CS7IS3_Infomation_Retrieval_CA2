SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Over the past several years, the marine industry has undergone significant change. A much more competitive marketplace, an emphasis on quality, regulatory initiatives in response to several marine casualties, and significant legislation such as OPA 90 have influenced and changed the way virtually all segments of the industry currently conduct business. The Coast Guard also has taken a new approach as a regulatory agency and embarked on several major initiatives to improve quality and customer service. In view of these changes, for this year's industry day, we plan to present a series of speakers representing all segments of the industry in lieu of the traditional panel sessions. These presentations, among other topics, will include the Coast Guard marine safety program's new ``business plan,'' discussions on the Coast Guard's Maritime Regulatory Reform Program, the status of several joint industry-Coast Guard initiatives to streamline and improve the vessel inspection process, the latest on marine licensing, an update on several industry ``quality'' programs, and new initiatives in pollution response. The presenters will be from both the Coast Guard and industry. The theme for this year will be ``A Partnership in Quality.''
