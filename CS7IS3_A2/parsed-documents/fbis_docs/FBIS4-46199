On Wednesday [25 May] the Moroccan judiciary announced that the six Moroccans and two Algerians, who were arrested on 17 May carried large amounts of weapons and military equipment, including 13 submachine guns, ammunition, and 12 infrared night-vision devices. According to the head of the group, 34-year-old Moroccan Ighir Hassan, the weapons were bought in Germany and brought to Morocco via Spain. Thus, for the second time this month, Germany is accused of being the country of origin of weapons used by the armed groups in Algeria in the battle against the ruling regime. On 6 May, on the German-French border, French police arrested an Algerian who had just entered the country from Germany carrying 5,000 rounds of ammunition, 13 kg of explosives, three automatic weapons, and other military equipment in his car. In both cases the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), which is banned in Algeria, was reportedly the customer. According to Algerian information, several prominent members of the FIS have asked for political asylum in Germany, including the sons of FIS founder Abassi Madani, who is in prison in Algeria, as well as Rabah Kebir, the fundamentalist party's boss abroad. The latter is accused by Algeria of having been essentially involved in the bomb attack on the airport in Algeria on 26 August 1992, during which nine people were killed. The special court in Algiers has, therefore, sentenced him to death in absentia. In September 1993, the Munich Regional Court repealed an extradition warrant for Kebir, because the documents presented by Algiers did not provide sufficient justification of the suspicion.
