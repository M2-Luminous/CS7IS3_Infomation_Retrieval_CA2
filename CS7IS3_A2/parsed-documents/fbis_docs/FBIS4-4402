Security Council president constitutes a strong message to North Korea over the nuclear question. In a press conference at the Watergate Hotel where he was staying, Han said the statement would be a "tremendous pressure" on North Korea especially because China is supposed to take part in next-phase steps set to be taken if North Korea does not heed the message. "The statement is highly significant in that it was unanimously approved by the whole 15 member nations of the Security Council," Han said. He was on a visit here to discuss nuclear-related follow-up steps with Washington officials. On the deadline for North Korea's acceptance of additional inspections, Han said the statement did not give it but Hans Blix, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), reported that there should be additional IAEA inspections within six months. Discussing the background that led China to change its initial stand and agree to include a clause on additional steps in the statement, Han said President Kim Yong-sam's talks with the Chinese leadership during his recent visit to Beijing, had paid off. "There were communications between South Korea and China during the Security Council meeting, too," Minister Han said. China, Han said, gave word that it would play a role in support of Korean peninsula's denuclearization and peace and stability on the peninsula. "China expressly showed it (through deeds) by supporting the statement," Minister Han said.
