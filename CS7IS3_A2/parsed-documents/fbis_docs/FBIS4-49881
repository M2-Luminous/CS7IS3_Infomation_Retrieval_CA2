Wu Yi told the Chinese and foreign participants at the symposium that China, while restructuring its economic and trade systems, will continue to attend to respecting and protecting foreign businesses' legitimate rights and interests. She said: During the new round of foreign trade reforms, state-owned foreign trade businesses are allowed to convert renminbi for foreign exchange or to buy foreign exchange with renminbi, but will adopt interim measures on all foreign-funded businesses in China, namely permitting them to maintain their current spot exchange accounts to facilitate their production and operations, including their import and export businesses. Wu Yi also noted: On the whole, foreign-funded businesses in China do not have to pay higher taxes during the new round of financial and tax reforms. For the few businesses which do have to pay higher taxes, China has drawn up some compensatory measures to make sure that they will continue to enjoy preferential treatment prescribed in Chinese laws and cooperation accords. Wu Yi indicated that China's preferential policies for foreign investors remain unchanged. She added that China will continue to improve the investment environment and create the necessary conditions so that foreign businessmen can enjoy the "same treatment as Chinese nationals."
