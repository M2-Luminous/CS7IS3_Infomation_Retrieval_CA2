Spokesman Meyer said that he had expected there would be a contact between the two sides this week for follow-up negotiations on the IAEA checklist that was delivered to North Korea on 9 January [as heard] for inspection of the seven reported nuclear facilities [haek sisol], and that now it seems that the next contact will be delayed until next week because there has been no response from North Korea as of the evening of 14 January. Regarding this, an IAEA source analyzed that the delay of the next contact may be considered a North Korean negotiation strategy, but he also pointed out the possibility that North Korea is taking pains in reviewing the details of the IAEA demand and deciding how to respond to it because of the large gap between the IAEA and North Korean positions on the nuclear inspection issue.
