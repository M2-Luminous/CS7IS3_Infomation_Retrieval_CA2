ACTION: Notice of the 1994 EPA SO 2 Allowance Auctions Results. SUMMARY: Pursuant to Title IV of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR part 73, the EPA is responsible for implementing a program to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), a precursor of acid rain. The centerpiece of the SO 2 control program is the allocation of transferable allowances, or authorizations to emit SO 2 , which are distributed in limited quantities to existing utility units and which eventually must be held by virtually all utility units to cover their SO 2 emissions. These allowances may be transferred among polluting sources and others, so that market forces may govern their ultimate use and distribution, resulting in the most cost-effective sharing of the emissions control burden. EPA is directed under Section 416 of the Act to conduct annual sales and auctions of a small portion of allowances (2.8%) withheld from the total allowances allocated to utilities each year. Sales and auctions are expected to stimulate and support the allowance market and to provide a public source of allowances, particularly to new units for which no allowances are allocated. In the Fall of 1992, EPA delegated the administration of the EPA allowance auctions and sales to the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). Today, the Acid Rain Division is giving notice of the results of the second annual SO 2 allowance auctions that were conducted by the CBOT on March 28, 1994. For rules governing the conduct of the auctions and sales see 40 CFR part 73, subpart E. I. Offers A. Total Allowances Available for Auction In the spot auction (year 1995 allowances sold), a total of 108,001 allowances were offered for sale: 50,000 that were withheld from the utilities and an additional 58,001 that were voluntarily contributed from utilities. In the 6-year advance auction (year 2000 allowances sold), a total of 75,000 allowances were offered for sale: 25,000 that were unsold from the 1993 direct sale and an additional 50,000 that were contributed from utilities. In the 7-year advance auction (year 2001 allowances sold), a total of 147,000 allowances were offered for sale: 100,000 that were withheld from the utilities and an additional 47,000 that were contributed. The minimum prices that utilities would accept for their contributed allowances are listed in Table 1.
