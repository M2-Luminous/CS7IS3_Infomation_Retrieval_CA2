Two of its close neighbors Iran and China have advised Islamabad to seek a dialogue with New Delhi to solve the issue which they have said is a bilateral matter. [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent recording] Iranian and Chinese backing of India's position on Kashmir came during the visit of [Indian] External Affairs Minister [Dinest Singh] to Teheran. The Iranian president, 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, told Mr. Dinesh Singh that Teheran wants that Pakistan should hold direct talks with India to solve the Kashmir issue. The Indian minister also held talks with his Iranian counterpart 'Ali Akbar Velayati and apprised him of the latest situation in the Kashmir valley. Mr. Velayati felt that there was much scope for cooperation between India, China, and Iran on a regional basis. Later, the Indian minister also held talks with his Chinese counterpart, Mr. Qian Qichen, who was in Teheran on Sunday [March 6]. Mr. Qichen described Pakistan's tabling of the Kashmir issue at the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva as being out of context. He said Beijing favors a solution of the Kashmir issue within the framework of the Simla accord. The Indian foreign secretary, Mr. K. Srinivasan, at the end of the Teheran visit said that both China and Iran agreed with India that human rights should not be used by nations as a political tool. [Srinivasan] This was to have a successful joint commission meeting but it so happened that it was coincident with the ongoing round at Geneva and also coincidental to the Chinese foreign minister's visit to Teheran. It gave us an opportunity to present our point of view at foreign minister's level and I think that our point of view has been well received in both capitals, or rather in Teheran and by the Chinese foreign minister's delegation.
