This is his second visit to Bulgaria (the first one was in the autumn of 1991). He will meet with Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov, National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov, Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov, representatives of the Parliamentary National Security Committee and Foreign Policy Committee and President Zhelyu Zhelev. He will also deliver a lecture at the Bulgarian Atlantic Club. "I was invited by the Bulgarian Government to have consultations on the relationship between Bulgaria and the Western European Union," Mr. Van Eekelen said upon his arrival at Sofia Airport. "At the May meeting, the 9th of May, when the Bulgarian foreign and defence ministers will also be attending, we hope to upgrade the form of consultations to allow your country more participation in our activities and I would like to hear the Bulgarian views on that new situation and new status," he said. When asked about Bulgaria's chances, he made the following comment: "We already have close cooperation with your country on the Danube embargo, so we have moved already from consultation to cooperation (...) but I think it is important that as Bulgaria is moving closer to European Union, you already have a treaty of association with the Union, and also close relationship with the Western European Union as the security dimension of European integration, now, that means that we will open up some of our meetings, some of our activities and as far as I am concerned, the more, the better." Later today Mr. Van Eekelen met with Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov to discuss Bulgaria's relations with the WEU. "Our relations with the Western European Union are very good. Bulgaria's integration with WEU is among the priorities in Bulgaria's foreign policy," Mr. Daskalov said after the meeting. He added that Bulgaria hopes to be granted the so-called "enhanced status" of a WEU associate member "which would provide a new basis for cooperation". "I think we had a most informative session; I explained to the minister (...) how we are looking forward to a meeting in May where he and the defence minister will attend and where we will enhance the form of consultation and open up some of our activities, bring Bulgaria close not only in terms of consultation but also in cooperation." Mr. Daskalov said that they also discussed the crisis in the former Yugoslavia and the role of the sanctions. "I stressed the importance of the embargo (...) and I expressed my appreciation for the role played by Bulgaria and the sacrifices made by your country," said Mr. Willem van Eekelen. His visit to Bulgaria coincided with the visit of a delegation of the WEU Assembly, led by its president, Sir Dudley Smith.
