FR941006-2-00197 FR941006-2-00113 Applicants that have not received a grant from the Institute within the past two years should include a statement describing the capacity of the applicant to administer grant funds including the financial systems used to monitor project expenditures (and income, if any), and a summary of the applicant's past experience in administering grants, as well as any resources or capabilities that the applicant has that will particularly assist in the successful completion of the project. If the applicant is a non-profit organization (other than a university), it must also provide documentation of its 501(c) tax exempt status as determined by the Internal Revenue Service and a copy of a current certified audit report. For purposes of this requirement, ``current'' means no earlier than two years prior to the current calendar year. If a current audit report is not available, the Institute will require the organization to complete a financial capability questionnaire which must be signed by a Certified Public Accountant. Other applicants may be required to provide a current audit report, a financial capability questionnaire, or both, if specifically requested to do so by the Institute. Unless requested otherwise, an applicant that has received a grant from the Institute within the past two years should describe only the changes in its organizational capacity, tax status, or financial capability that may affect its capacity to administer a grant. 10. Statement of Lobbying Activities Non-governmental applicants must submit the Institute's Disclosure of Lobbying Activities Form that requires them to state whether they, or another entity that is a part of the same organization as the applicant, have advocated a position before Congress on any issue, and identifies the specific subjects of their lobbying efforts. 11. Letters of Support for the Project If the cooperation of courts, organizations, agencies, or individuals other than the applicant is required to conduct the project, written assurances of cooperation and availability should be attached as an appendix to the application, or they may be sent under separate cover. In order to ensure that there is sufficient time to bring them to the Board's attention, letters of support sent under separate cover must be received at least four weeks before the meeting of the Board of Directors at which the application will be considered (i.e., no later than October 17, 1994, February 1, 1995, March 31, 1995, June 23, 1995, or August 18, 1995, respectively). D. Budget Narrative The budget narrative should provide the basis for the computation of all project-related costs. An application for a package grant for more than one project must include a separate budget narrative for each project component, with the same alphabetic identifier and project title used to describe each component project in the program narrative. Additional background or schedules may be attached if they are essential to obtaining a clear understanding of the proposed budget. Numerous and lengthy appendices are strongly discouraged. The budget narrative should cover the costs of all components of the project and clearly identify costs attributable to the project evaluation. Under OMB grant guidelines incorporated by reference in this Guideline, grant funds may not be used to pay for coffee breaks during seminars or meetings, or to purchase alcoholic beverages.
