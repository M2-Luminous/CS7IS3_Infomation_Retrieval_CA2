Inactivity in terms of recovery in some regions can be the source of new economic and social differences. Developmental projects should necessarily involve promising firms. Three years of transformation have restored the macroeconomic balance (in the sense described by Walrasov) and has created a demanding environment for the attainment of microeconomic balances (in the Marshall sense). This historical operation, based on the restoration of actual ownership, its responsibility, and motivation, will culminate in the years immediately ahead. There thus ensues the "moment of truth," in which it will be shown, in specific terms, what has been done well, what has been done wrong, and what was forgotten. Subsequent "macro" and "micro" adjustment efforts will be ongoing in the realistic territory of the new state and in its spatial components. The recovery and failure of companies are connected, albeit in an undesirable way, with the recovery and failure of jobs. No definitive regions or any regional policy exist, but more or less prosperous territories and areas develop and can be transformed into crisis regions. The unseen hand of the market directs capital streams toward more advantageous areas; in other areas, however, people must also live and prosper. The territory of the Czech Republic is also limited and a rare resource, which must be handled economically. Over the past three years, there have been great structural changes in the market, changes in the areas of production and services, changes in the structure of employment. The latter have taken place even in the face of an enviable and criticized low unemployment rate. This development was aided by a specific policy and the activities of people, things that relieve the pressure on the labor market. The ranks of the unemployed did not include mothers, who may devote themselves to their children at home thanks to a social contribution--neither did the ranks of the unemployed include those working abroad or 120,000 of those who, with the support of labor offices, embarked upon new activities in newly created jobs. Thus, 4-5 percent of the people did not become unemployed but are working, for the most part, for low wages and are paying high taxes. However, given the ideal 3-percent unemployment rate (some consider it to be harmfully low), individual and contiguous territories have come into being in which an average of 30-60 unemployed can be offered only a single job. In the city of Prague, one applicant for work is statistically offered 10 jobs from the register and actually has 20 from which to choose. The creation of new jobs is progressing under influences that are different from those that created populations in the territories. Not all of these people can move without the development of depopulated and "uninhabited" territories. In looking at the situation depicted on the map, it must be clear that, in some territories, a situation is developing that makes further restructuring more difficult. For example, this holds true in the Saar region, the Rhine River region, Lotringen, Linz, and the Japanese steelmaking regions; restructuring was so successful in these areas that the so-called centrifugal effect gave rise to the development of thousands of small firms with hundreds of thousands of jobs in neighboring territories. In the "old territories" of United Germany, employment rose 5 percent over the past 12 years in 41 industrial centers but increased 17 percent in its marginal territories! It was only as the result of such a centrifugal effect that employment in the Rhine River region was able to decline by 24 percent without causing economic or social reverberations. In our country, for example, Ostrava (with 5-percent unemployment) is surrounded by territories having a far higher rate of unemployment and a frozen rate of new job creation, even before restructuring, which is far worse. Unemployment in the Territories For more than two years now, there has been express territorial differentiation regarding the development of unemployment and the creation of new jobs. Current records, by okres, documenting this development indicate that, on the one hand, okreses in which there are 10 jobs per applicant do exist and, on the other hand, there are okreses in which there are 30 applicants for one job. However, in the smaller territorial entities, these differences are significantly greater. In the attached map [not reproduced here] showing the territorial breakdown of unemployment (as of 31 August 1993), territories with double-digit unemployment (dots), quadruple unemployment (crosses), and sextuple unemployment (black areas) can be clearly seen in comparison with the Republic average (3 percent). An analysis of these critical and languishing territories shows that: - Long-term unemployment is growing there, and the number of jobs is declining; the creation of new jobs is negligible, temporary, and thus results in repeated unemployment. - The wage and income level of the population in these territories is declining; community budgets are shrinking, and resources for temporary employment in publicly beneficial type of work are disappearing. - In these territories, the number of families drawing payments to supplement their minimum level of the standard of living, with which it is possible to exist for a certain time but not to live normally in the long run, is growing. - These areas are not demonstrating growing buying power and demand for new products and services; the opportunities to develop new meaningful jobs are running up against the tight barriers created by a market that is progressively more impoverished. - In these areas, the infrastructure, transportation, communications, etc. is failing; "uninhabited" regions with devastated facilities, etc. are developing. The above negative tendencies are gaining in strength and absent any new effective policy for territorial recovery will acquire socioeconomic emphasis, particularly in the area of Silesia and Moravia. Additional unemployment, over and above that shown on the map--that is to say, an increase in the Czech Republic by 0.5 percent during the period 1 September through the end of 1993--took place primarily in the more expanded crisis territories of Moravia and Silesia, in addition to several regions in Bohemia. This trend will continue at a greater rate of speed and will, apart from affecting less or more qualified workers, impact primarily on mothers and people with impaired health. If we project the ongoing trends in the territorial development of unemployment and incorporate in them the inaccurate notions regarding the downsizing of existing firms, it is possible to express the notion, on an overall basis (macro), that, if the average rate of unemployment rises to 5 percent, it will be distributed as follows: Czech Republic--5% Bohemia--Less Than 3% Moravia and Silesia--More Than 9% Including:3 okreses Including:Half of okreses with about 10% with about 15% unemployment5 unemploymentOne-third of territories with territories with about 25-30% about 15% unemployment unemployment Note: Territories do not cover an entire okres but transcend the borders of two or three okreses. A further "waiting for economic growth" can, particularly in more extensive territories in Moravia and Silesia, lead to weakening civic solidarity and support for economic transformation. The warning thus expressed is based not only on the analysis of the reasons for its development but also from the evaluation of further development projected for the territories of the Jesenik area, the Osoblah area, the Vitkov region, the Zivotice region, the Hlucin region, the Novy Jicin area, the Roznov area, the Belokarpaty area, the Breclav area, the Mikulov area, the Znojmo area, the Trebic area, etc. An evaluation of further possible development in West Bohemia, Central Bohemia, and North Bohemia territories indicates the possibility of a certain recovery over the next one to two years as a result of the transfer of thousands of new jobs from Germany (resulting from the advantage of comparatively lower costs for the German firms involved). In a number of the indicated regions of Czech okreses, it is more likely to be able to anticipate a recovery, an above-average growth of wages and income, a growth in prosperity. In territories to the east of the Czech-Moravian highlands, capital interest in subsupplier or cooperative establishment of jobs is only extremely weak, the comparative advantages are negligible; and low wage costs do not predominate over transport and infrastructure disadvantages. The anticipated restructuring, the downsizing and liquidation of some firms that do not show any structural promise for the future, in areas that are already in a crisis today will result in a negative multiplier effect--that is, in the liquidation of hundreds of small private firms. In the crisis territories, paradoxically, there was even the downsizing and liquidation of an entire series of formerly secondary and "splinter" production facilities, which occurred on the basis of "competitive privatization interests." Meanwhile, privatized companies with promising futures, located where the former "principal" enterprises were found, approximately 100 km away, are increasing their employment by hiring foreign workers. The growth of authorized as well as "black" foreign employment has grown to excessive and warning dimensions in 1993. The number of instances in which the provision of support for the development of new private firms has resulted in increased unemployment of foreign workers in areas of economic prosperity and increased unemployment in crisis areas is expanding. The excuse that workers have lower mobility is based, for the most part, on ignorance of the relevant demographic, economic, housing, and transport characteristics. Further inactivity regarding territorial recovery can, within a short time, result in new economic and social differences--that is to say, there can develop extensive territories of prosperity and extensive territories of failure. For purposes of revival of territories heading toward failure, it is necessary to fundamentally create external advantages for the influx of promising coproduction facilities and the development of positive multiplier effects. Projects Involving the Recovery of Crisis Regions If we wish to avoid ineffective and expensive methods of state subsidies and support for territories that are falling behind--that is, the perfunctory kraj or okres understanding of subsidies "from above"--we must consider the creation of advantageous conditions for the establishment of effective jobs by existing promising firms as the economic and social solution. Such "external advantages" require the working out of territorial projects, on the basis of which those firms with good competitive prospects must be persuaded to establish operating facilities in crisis locations. The plan for territorial recovery should contain the characteristics of localities for new firms on the territory, their product and technological aims and equipment, their infrastructure requirements, and personnel (professional) staffing, including supplemental and on-the-job training. All of this should then be accompanied by the appropriate financial budget. In the majority of cases, for demographic, technical, infrastructure, and other reasons, this will involve the establishment primarily of small or medium-sized enterprises of a cooperative, subsupplier character in relatively small territories. In 1994, approximately 12 such projects for territorial recovery should be worked out and initiated--three in Bohemia and nine in Silesia and Moravia. As a general rule, the identified territories will incorporate parts of two or three okreses and will transcend "historical" borders of various lands (Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia)--that is to say, they will require cooperation even among several community and okres organizations, several branch offices of banks, labor offices, and appropriate facilities of okres offices. A so-called pilot project should determine the adequate form for the initiative-directing organ for the project, its composition, authorities, and responsibilities. Okres labor offices and their branches will thus acquire new tasks involving the following: - The diagnosis of crisis territories, their labor, demographic, and professional potential. (Note: Existing records of job applicants do not provide all necessary data for this purpose.) - Participation in placing the order for and the financing of the project with a specialized firm. - Selection and combination of amended instruments of an active employment policy. - Recommendation of the optimal character of production and services for the working potential of the territory in question. - Evaluation of the mobility characteristics of workers and qualified estimates of multiplier effects of employment in the territory in question or in surrounding territories. - Initiative activities involved in directing the work on the project and its realization. - The acquisition of firms and those interested in moving to the territories--that is to say, collaboration with labor offices in those okreses in which the potential applicant firms, interested in establishing their operations in the projected crisis territory, are active. - Evaluation of the extent and the need for external advantages for the realization of the project--that is, investments for the acquisition of suitable areas, the infrastructure and buildings for the entry of new firms, "softer" credits, etc. Identifying the territories for the recovery project will result even in a new degree of initiative, cooperative and financial participation on the part of the Directorate of Employment Services of the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare of the Czech Republic. The leadership of that ministry has made a fundamental recommendation for the necessary changes in the instruments governing the area of requalification, participation in public works programs, etc. It even supports the concept of intensifying territorial recovery that I have presented on behalf of the Research Institute for Labor and Social Affairs, together with the Directorate for Employment Services. Now, it is a question of finding the firms or institutes that will work out the project with our help--of course, in competition (for a contract price) so that the quality of these organizations might entice both our firms and foreign firms to establish new operations. As far as foreign firms are concerned, let us be realists. The recession and unemployment, which are general, tend to prevent rather than stimulate the entrance of large-scale capacities. Not even the most recent "high-tech" technologies will come. Help for the crisis territories will come primarily out of our heads and as a result of our specialized efforts. If anyone has the desire to "help" the problem through the use of vulgar politicization, he should consider that we are talking here about jobs for 100,000 people and not of a few power positions.
