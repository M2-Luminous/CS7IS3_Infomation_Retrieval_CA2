An article signed by journalist Nicanor Leon Cotayo and published in GRANMA's Saturday edition reports that annexationists of Cuban origin who live in the United States deploy a campaign to maintain a blockade against the people of the largest island in the Antilles. The article -- entitled "Keep Out, Annexationists" -- says that in a poll recently performed in Miami 40 percent of the people stated they reject the blockade against Cuba and that the number of people who protest against this unfair measure is increasing significantly in the United States. GRANMA emphasizes that the annexationists' views coincide with those of extreme-right U.S. politicians of the last century.
