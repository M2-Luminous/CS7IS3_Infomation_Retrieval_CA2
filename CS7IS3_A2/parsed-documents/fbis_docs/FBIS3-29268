The agreement, reached at a joint government-party meeting held on Tuesday, is considered a change from Seoul's policy against imports of Japanese culture, especially music and films. Culture and Sports Minister Yi Min-sop represented the government at the joint meeting, while Rep. Paek Nam-chi spoke for the party in his capacity as chief policy coordinator. Emerging from the meeting, Paek said President Kim Yong-sam would not say anything about opening the arts market to Japan during his summit with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Tokyo next month. Opening the arts market to Japan is not a matter of consideration in view of the national sentiment against the Japanese today, he added. "But we've agreed that the nation should make all necessary preparations for the inflow of Japanese arts to ride the internationalization and market opening trends," he said. The government and the ruling party also agreed to demolish the former Japanese colonial government building in Seoul as scheduled, though this has drawn both praise and criticism from the public.
