Replying to the representative of the al-Sabah regime, Fadil Mahmud Gharib, head of the General Federation of the Iraqi Workers Trade Unions, cited documents and exposed the falsehood of these allegations. Gharib explained that these lies are aimed at perpetuating the embargo being imposed on the Iraqi people. The Iraqi news agency correspondent in Tunis cited Gharib as saying that the Iraqi people--who are prominent in Arab history, thanks to their pan-Arab heroic deeds, and who have never failed to support the fraternal Arab states and carry out a pan-Arab role in confronting the hostile plans--will remain steadfast in the face of all attempts aimed at destroying Iraq's capabilities and preventing Iraq from carrying out its pan-Arab role. Gharib's reply to the representative of the al-Sabah regime received lots of applause and profound enthusiasm on the part of all Arab labor delegations participating in the conference.
