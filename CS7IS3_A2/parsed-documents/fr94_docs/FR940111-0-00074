FR940111-0-00074 FR940111-0-00019 In addition to the relatively low level of overall industry Rule compliance, the rulemaking record demonstrates that funeral providers have not provided the initial stimulus for ``increased competition'' on the basis of price considered necessary by the Commission. The few funeral home entrants that aggressively compete on price, documented in the record, appear to be former, more traditional funeral directors who reentered the market as ``discount'' providers, and who are considered to be ``mavericks'' by the funeral industry as a whole. More traditional funeral homes, by industry representatives' own admission, generally do not price advertise or otherwise compete on the basis of price. 45 The record further indicates that funeral providers show little support for unfettered competition in the sale of pre-need funeral services, 46 and that many affirmatively attempt to discourage potential price competition from third-party cemeteries and other non-funeral home retailers who sell caskets on a pre-need basis, by imposing so-called ``casket handling fees,'' averaging $300&hyph;$500 per funeral on consumers who patronize those sellers. 47 45 R&hyph;G&hyph;6 (NFDA/NSM Comment) at 5, 109&hyph;110, 113&hyph;114; R&hyph;M&hyph;9 (NFDA/NSM Proposed Findings) at 8&hyph;9, 31, 17&hyph;19, 199&hyph;200, 202&hyph;204; Krause, Tr. Vol. II, 12&hyph;13 (majority of Wisconsin providers do not compete); R&hyph;M&hyph;7 (PAA Rebuttal) at 21 (entry in the funeral market is virtually unheard of without a prior affiliation with a funeral home or cemetery, or the entrant is chain-related). 46 The testimony of various funeral directors and cemeterians indicates that funeral providers as a group have supported state 100 percent pre-need ``trusting'' laws. The major impact of a ``100 percent'' trusting requirement_all moneys received from the consumer for a pre-need purchase must be placed in trust until the time of need_is to leave the pre-need seller without current funds to pay for the expenses associated with pre-need sales, such as an active sales force. See, e.g., Krause, Tr. Vol. II, 8, 13, 31, 34; Starks, Tr. Vol. II, 362&hyph;363, 367; Graf, Tr. Vol. II, 593, 649; Nelson, Tr. Vol. II, 180; and Barr, Kansas state representative/cemeterian, Tr. Vol. III, 1513. 47 Record evidence concerning the widespread existence and effects of so-called ``casket handling fees'' is fully discussed in Section II.C.3, infra. Finally, the empirical data and record testimony documents that a majority of consumers exhibit low levels of awareness concerning their rights under the Rule 48 and funeral prices and service options, 49 as a result of a general lack of ``visibility'' of the Rule and of readily-available, comparative price information. 50 Other empirical evidence indicates that consumers' ``experience'' with funerals is low by any measure 51 and that, regardless of their level of experience, consumers are not ``familiar'' with the funeral transaction. 52 Most rulemaking participants concluded that the documented low levels of overall industry compliance and consumer knowledge, viewed together, indicate that the Rule has not been in place long enough to adequately assess its impact on the funeral market. 53 48 Messer, trade embalmer, R&hyph;F&hyph;60 at 1; Carlson, author/lecturer, HX&hyph;22 at 7; Blake, Memorial Society of Door County, Wisconsin, Tr.

Vol. II, 709 (consumers are no more aware of prices because they don't price shop). 50 Although not uncontroverted by the rulemaking staff and funeral industry representatives, the results of two national, consumer opinion surveys indicated that: (1) When asked whether they were ``familiar with the FTC's Funeral Rule and what it requires,'' 90 percent of the 782 respondents aged 45 and above surveyed in the first of these ``Excel'' surveys said ``no'' and 10 percent answered ``yes;'' and (2) when asked whether each of several declarative statements about funeral director obligations and funeral consumer rights was ``required by federal law or not,'' a majority (54 percent-75 percent) of the 916 consumer-respondents aged 21 and over said that, to the best of their knowledge, federal law does not require the rights and obligations actually mandated by the Funeral Rule, or said that they do not know. See McFadden, HX&hyph;8 at 3 and Exhibit B, Table 001; Soulas, HX&hyph;76 at 3. The ``McFadden'' survey results also provided evidence that older consumers aged 65 or over are significantly less likely to be aware of the Rule's protections than are younger consumers aged 18&hyph;34. HX&hyph;8 at Exhibit B, tables 002&hyph;004, 006&hyph;007. 51 Thirty-six percent of the RS respondents reported that they had no prior experience arranging funerals; another 30 percent said that they had participated in planning arrangements once before, and the remaining third said they had done so twice before or more. R&hyph;B&hyph;2 at III&hyph;9, Table III&hyph;7. Because the RS surveyed recent funeral arrangers, however, and not the general public, the level of respondents' prior experience may not be representative of the population as a whole. The Commission found, for example, that, at the time it promulgated the Rule, about 50 percent of the adult population had never arranged a funeral and another quarter had done so only once. See R&hyph;B&hyph;5 (SBP) at 42265. 52 The Bureau of Economics staff performed an analysis of the RS data to determine whether there was any link between respondents' degree of experience in making funeral arrangements (Question 10. of the study) and their level of knowledge about the funeral transaction (Question 55 asked whether embalming is required by law and whether a sealed casket/vault preserves remains indefinitely). BE staff divided respondents into two categories_those with arrangements experience prior to the one surveyed and those without such prior experience. BE staff then performed a statistical test to determine whether there was any relationship between those two categories and their answers to Question 55. BE staff found no relationship between the degree of respondents' reported prior experience and their level of knowledge. See R&hyph;N&hyph;1 (SR) at n. 124. In addition to BE's statistical test, the RS results show that 50 percent and 42 percent, respectively, of the RS respondents, all of whom had arranged a funeral at least once, reported incorrectly that embalming was always required as a public health measure and that a sealed casket/vault preserves remains for an indefinite time.
