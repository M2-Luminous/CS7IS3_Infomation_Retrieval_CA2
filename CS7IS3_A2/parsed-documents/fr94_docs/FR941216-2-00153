Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 1 (``Act''), notice is hereby given that on November 8, 1994, the Midwest Clearing Corporation (``MCC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared primarily by MCC. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s (b)(1) (1988). I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change MCC proposes to amend its procedures to comply with New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') Rule 412 which sets forth the time for transferring customer accounts 2 and with National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'') Rule 50, Section 9 3 regarding NSCC's Automated Customer Account Transfer (``ACAT'') Service. 4 MCC also proposes to amend its procedures regarding the ACAT-Fund/SERV interface to comply with the NYSE requirement that all mutual fund account transfers be accomplished by use of an automated system where the NYSE member organizations are participants in a registered clearing agency which has such a facility. 2 For a complete description of the recent amendments to NYSE Rule 412, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34633 (September 2, 1994), 59 FR 46872 [File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;21] (order approving amendments to NYSE Rule 412). 3 For a complete description of the recent amendments to NSCC's Rule 50, Section 9, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34879 (October 21, 1994), 59 FR 54229 [File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;94&hyph;13] (order approving modifications to NSCC's ACAT Service to accelerate the time in which customer accounts are transferred). 4 For a complete description of NSCC's ACAT system, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 22481 (September 30, 1985), 50 FR 41274 [File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;85&hyph;7] (order approving proposed rule change establishing ACAT Service). II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filng with the Commission, MCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. MCC has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. ( A ) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change NSCC's ACAT Service is an input, comparison, and settlement service for customer account transfers from one brokerage firm to another. MCC Article VI, Rule 3 authorizes MCC to establish procedures for its linkage to NSCC's ACAT Service including the establishment of time periods. MCC's proposal is consistent with NSCC's recent amendments to NSCC Rule 50, Section 9 shortening NSCC's recent amendments to NSCC Rule 50, Section 9 shortening the period in which a participant that is to receive a transferred account has to review the transfer instructions and reply thereto. The completed transfer cycle will be reduced from ten business days to seven business days for transferring cash or margin accounts and from fifteen business days to seven business days for transferring retirement accounts. The portion of MCC's filing containing these procedures is consistent with the NYSE and NSCC proposals; therefore, MCC's procedures also will take effect on December 2, 1994. MCC's proposed rule change also proposes to make minor changes to the ACAT-Fund/SERV interface 5 to comply with the NYSE requirement that generally all mutual fund account transfers must be accomplished by using the automated systems of a registered clearing agency where both the receiving broker-dealer and the delivering broker-dealer are participants in a registered clearing agency which has such a facility. 6 In accordance with a NYSE Rule 412, this change will be effective March 3, 1995. In addition, under its proposal MCC no longer will treat account transfers containing option positions differently from transfers of accounts without option positions. 5 For a detailed description of NSCC's ACAT-Fund/SERV interface, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27454 (November 20, 1989), 54 FR 48962 [File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;89&hyph;12] (order approving modification of NSCC's ACAT Service rules to provide for the automated transfer of eligible book share mutual fund assets). 6 Supra note 2.
