"We have clear-cut evidence about direct interference by Uzbekistan in the Kabul fighting," presidential spokesman Abdol Aziz Morad told AFP. Morad said the former communist militia warlord, Uzbek General Abdol Rashid Dostam, who launched a failed coup attempt in the capital on New Year's Day, has received much military support for the one-month long Kabul factional fighting. He went so far as to say that representatives of Dostam met with government officials in the Uzbek capital Tashkent in order to help plan the coup attempt in Kabul. "Many facilities, both military and economic, have been put at Dostam's disposal by Uzbekistan," Morad said. He accused Uzbekistan of not only supplying Dostam with jets, aircraft spare-parts and the construction of a military airstrip, but also of launching air-raids over Kabul and other targets from inside Uzbekistan itself. Although Morad said it was not clear if the Uzbek interference in Afghanistan originated from the highest official level, he nevertheless demanded that a joint Afghan-Uzbek commission be appointed to investigate the charges. The rumble of anti-aircraft fire over the capital followed three raids on Kabul by Dostam Jets before midday Sunday, with bombs exploding at the foot of the strategic "television mountain," which houses a lot of heavy artillery. Meanwhile, fighting intensified Sunday in northern Baghlan province, where a spokesman for Hekmatyar's Hezb faction said an offensive by pro-Rabbani forces had been repulsed. The coalition forces fire@ two long-range Luna missiles on the presidential troops in the Nahrin district, while infantry troops were also making advances towards the garrison, said Hezb spokesman Qaribur Rehman Saeed in the bordering Pakistani city of Peshawar. He said one of the missiles, having a range of 80 to 90 kilometers (53 miles), landed in the military base built by the former Soviet troops while the other landed in Nahrin's bazar. Details of the losses were not available, he said. Saeed, giving importance to the opening of the new front in the north amid a slowdown in the Kabul fighting, said the anti-Rabbani coalition's strategy appeared to be to engage troops of the president's main commander, Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, in his northern strongholds and ultimately reach Jabalus Siraj. The highway town of Jabalus Siraj, located in the south of Baghlan, is Mas'ud's last major base north of Kabul, he added. He said Mas'ud had already brought troops to Kabul from his northern bases, and his Nahrin commander, Abdol Haye, was facing a shortage of manpower. Morad was keen to note that pro-Rabbani jets, which fly out of the Soviet-built Bagram airbase 50 kilometres (31 miles) north of Kabul, are also active in the factional fighting. Apart from the air raids, Kabul was largely spared the punishment of bombardment Sunday, with merely a handful of rockets exchanged and quiet frontlines; this unusual lull in hostilities prompted some locals to speculate on the prospect of a ceasefire. Dostam's ally, Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, is reported to be open to ceasefire negotiations if there was international backing, but his rival Rabbani appears sceptical of such moves. "Neither the United Nations, the Organisation of Islamic Conference, nor any other foreign country has raised any popular and acceptable proposal to solve the Afghan crisis," Morad said. Morad summarised by saying that the Dostam-Hekmatyar alliance has become weakened, was now on the defensive, and was looking for political solutions to its military problems.
