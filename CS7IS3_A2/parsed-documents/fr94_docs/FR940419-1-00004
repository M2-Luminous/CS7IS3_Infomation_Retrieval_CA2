FR940419-1-00004 FR940419-1-00002 In its letter of March 14, 1994, to DOE, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers requested postponement of the public hearing, or scheduling of a second hearing and extension of the deadline for written comments, based on ``the short time allowed to prepare for the hearing, and the lack of publication by DOE of information on test procedures.'' In its letter of March 16, 1994, to DOE, the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association requested postponement of the public hearing, or scheduling of a second public hearing and extension of the deadline for written comments, stating that given ``the unexpected severity of DOE's proposed rule, a short interval between publication of the proposed rule and a public hearing on the proposed rule does not give GAMA or manufacturers enough time to prepare adequately for the public hearing.'' In its letter of March 25, 1994, to DOE, the Edison Electric Institute requested postponement, and a second public hearing and extension of the deadline for written comments, based on ``the significance and far-reaching implications of the proposed rule.'' In its letter of March 25, 1994, to DOE, the Electronic Industries Association requested postponement of the public hearing and extension of the deadline for written documents. The EIA gave as reasons: ``the voluminous amount of the Technical Support Document, and the need for its member companies to obtain input from their regionally-based engineers.'' In its letter of March 25, 1994, to DOE, the Carolina Power & Light Company stated as its reason for requesting postponement, a second hearing and extension of the deadline for written documents that ``the proposed rule could have significant implications for its company and the entire electric industry.'' Based on these representations, the Department is extending the comment period to July 18, 1994, and scheduling a second public hearing for June 7 and 8, 1994. Frank M. Stewart, Jr., Acting Chief of Staff, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;9284 Filed 4&hyph;18&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;P
