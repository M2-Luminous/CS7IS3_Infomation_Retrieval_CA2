However, these days the recurrence of feudal superstitions has again become in certain areas a public menace to social security. The Obnoxious Growth of the "Fortune-Telling Craze." Fortune-telling, predicting the so-called "lucky or unlucky fate" by means of planchette or palmistry, has in the olden days been the way some people made a living. Nowadays, we again see their footmarks almost everywhere, from Chongqing's first avenue to in front of the Yellow-Crane Tower in Wuhan, from the shores of Yueya Lake in Dunhuang to the roadsides on Qingdao's Laoshan Mountain. In Shaoyang County of Hunan Province, there is Heyecun Village with 1,900 people of whom an astounding 13 percent make a living by fortune-telling. In Minquan County, Henan Province, a peasant woman became mentally deranged when divination for her came up with a bad omen. She first killed her husband and then herself. In the Nantang district of Lufeng County, Guangdong Province, it happened within not quite one year that eight girls lightly believed in the nonsense of the fortune-teller and committed suicide. Outrages Committed by the "Witch Doctor Gang." According to statistics, approximately 1.8 million witch doctors operate in the various cities and villages; they pretend to be inspired and able to control demons. They practice black magic; they "eliminate misfortunes and heal sicknesses" for people, and they practice quite openly. About 71 percent of them are illiterate or semi-literate. In the countryside, 73.9 percent of sick people ask a witch doctor to cure them, and, as a consequence, a large number of people are harmed by them. A 59.2 percent of male witch doctors have violated women, and 10.6 percent of the witch doctors have caused the death of people. A peasant woman in Yangxin County, Hubei Province, believed a witch doctor when he told her that she is "bound to die on 7 July, unless she prevents the calamity by finding someone to take her place." She thereupon poisoned the son and daughter of a peasant. A couple in Mengjin County, Henan Province, believed a witch doctor when he told them, "your daughter is a `star of disaster,' a `patricidal woman,' only a show of blood can ward off your disaster." The peasant thereupon cruelly killed his daughter with a sickle and displayed her corpse at the street corner. Stirring Up Trouble With "Geomancy." In recent years feudal clan power is raising its head in the rural areas, and such activities as "cleansing the landscape," "identify one's clan cemetery," and "repairing the ancestral temples" are being taken up one after the other. In the end, every opportunity is given the practitioners of geomancy "show off their specialty." They not only obstruct the spread of science and technology in the rural areas, but constantly stir up disputes and armed clashes between neighbors, thus constituting a hidden menace to social stability. In a certain county of Jiangsu Province, it was due to the absurd nonsense of the geomancer who said: "If you grow grapes in your courtyard, your women will give birth to `grape-like monsters' [hydatids], that the practical and useful technique of grape-growing in that courtyard was never allowed to be spread. When the chief of the Ma clan died in a certain Taipingxiang village, his descendants asked in a geomancer who found a "`dragon and phoenix propitiated" plot in the cemetery of the Li clan, which the Ma clan forcefully occupied by mere strength of their superior numbers, but as a result a big fight ensued, and it all ended with one person dead and five injured. Deceiving People With Ghost Stories Under the Pretext of Doing "Missionary Work." China's Constitution guarantees its citizens freedom of religious beliefs, but strictly forbids to confuse people's minds with "religious missionary activities," thereby sabotaging the society's production and orderly daily life. Many kinds of religious activities that have a strong feudal superstitious coloring are poisonous to the extreme for the uninformed masses and are cause of great tragedies. A villager by the name of You Shengji in Sixian County, Anhui Province, posing as a "believer in Jesus," started a so-called "religious training class," for the alleged purpose of spreading the message of the Holy Bible. He loudly proclaimed: "The spirit borrows my physical body to be married with people, you are all wed to the spirit." This deceitful nonsense provided him with opportunity to rape or deduce 16 of his female followers. A peasant of Xiangcheng County, Henan Province, a believer in the "White Robe Religion," followed the entreaties of his daughter: "The last day is near, earlier death is the way to paradise," and cut off her head. Setting Themselves Up as Emperors and Kings and Inciting to Riot. Some reactionary elements are taking advantage of legitimate religious organizations to wantonly conduct inflammatory counterrevolutionary propaganda. They enlist believers, assume titles of kings and emperors, oppose state policy and state law, and wait for an opportune moment to unleash a rebellion. Peasant Li Chengfu and his cronies in Fudicun Village at Funiushan Mountain [Henan Province] started a fund drive ostensibly to rebuild the Hongchun Temple at Laomanchang, the site of an old Tang Dynasty temple, but actually to set up a "Wanshun [all-favorable] Heavenly Kingdom." On the pretext of geomantic inspection, he visited six counties and recruited soldiers, bought horses, and organized a counterrevolutionary armed force. According to his slogan: "Not the intercalary seventh month, but the intercalary eighth month is right, that is when we will start our fight." His secret plan was to start a rebellion in the intercalary eighth month [of the lunar calendar] which will occur in 1995. He was later punished according to law by the public security organs. In Yongcheng county in the east of Henan Province there was a "howler sect" [hu han pai 0729 0815 3175], a religious organization, that called its leader "the Living Christ." They distributed a large amount of reactionary propaganda and loudly proclaimed they will rule all the world. Before they were suppressed in July of 1993, they had established over 100 activity centers and had several hundred core members. New Characteristics of Present Feudal Superstitious Activities The deceit was in the past carried out by the activity of single persons, but it has now developed into the action of organized groups. In "simultaneous operations" they recruit followers, continuously expand their contingents, and form a professional stratum. They also do not use only one type of tricks, such as fortune-telling, necromancy, geomancy, but are "experts in one thing and good at many." Their operations get more and more comprehensive and modernized. In some places, for instance, fortune-telling is done by means of a "computerized fortune-telling sutra." The pattern of their activities has also changed from the former sedentary, localized way to dashing around to commit their crimes hither and thither. The periods of activities have changed from the former preference for the slack farming season to regular activities in all four seasons of the year, and membership has changed from formerly being in the majority older people to now a combination of old, middle-aged, and young people. According to the analysis of parties concerned, the resurgence of feudal superstitions in the 1990's started in the economically developed southeastern coastal regions. The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League found out in an investigation at Lufeng County in Guangdong Province that various types of feudal superstitious activities were now being conducted completely openly on a very widespread scale, and that a surprisingly large number of people were working in the production and sale of articles used for feudal superstitious purposes. In Jieshizhen township a man called his factory "People's Bank of the Underworld," and had over 200 persons working especially to manufacture various kinds of articles for feudal superstitious purposes, which he widely marketed domestically and abroad. One item in the records of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau said, that over 2,000 people in Shanghai from in and around the three counties of Chongming, Chuansha, and Jiading are specially engaged in feudal superstitious activities. A news item broadcast in July of 1992 by the Central Broadcasting Stations said that it was considered fashionable by some people in Wenzhou City, Zhejiang Province, to build during their lifetime luxurious mausoleums for themselves, for which the maximum expenditure had been as much as several hundred thousand yuan. Feudal superstition finds a market already among middle school students. An investigation by the Youth Center of the China Welfare Association revealed that 60 percent of the middle school students believe that man's life is determined by fate. They pray: May the light of Buddha shine everywhere, may a Bodhisattva make his power felt, and are boy scouts that kneel in prayer before Buddhist altars. One student, in the second class of higher middle school, had on his desk the following motto for his personal guidance: "Having not yet passed my examination, I still need a Bodhisattva's assistance." A very bright student in lower middle school in Anhua County, Hunan Province, was told by the fortune-teller that he was not destined for book studies. He thereupon secretly took 400 yuan from home and went to a place in the southeast, as directed by the fortune-teller, to engage in business. The result was that after eight days he begged to be allowed home again. There are rather serious incidents of even some party members and cadres participating in, supporting, and organizing feudal superstitious activities. Somewhere in Yuzhou City, Henan Province, some party cadres participated in temple construction and collected money from the peasants to build an earth god temple, a temple to the goddess, etc., for each village at least one. A village party secretary in Fangcheng County did not call a doctor when his wife fell sick, but determined that she was possessed by an "evil spirit." To "suppress the evil spirit" he went to Wudangshan Mountain [in Hubei]" and brought back a "spirit-venerating statue" and a "treasured sword," which he displayed in the main room of his house. On the first of every month he also went to the village temple to burn incense and pray to ward off the illness. Moreover, the RENMIN MINZHU BAO reported in November of 1993: In recent years, some personnel from a powerful organ of the National People's Congress also began to play the "mystery chain" game [shen bi lian 4377 4434 6969].
