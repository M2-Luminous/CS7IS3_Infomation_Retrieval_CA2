Who knows if some indiscreet camera may not have revealed the platform intended to add a few inches to Fininvest's owner. A show business expert, a manic perfectionist when it comes to framing TV shots, Berlusconi tried to cash in as much as possible on Bill Clinton's visibility. And he succeeded by playing the game on the most favorable field to him, namely that of images and communication. Undoubtedly, the abundance of TV images of Clinton's Roman tour, with Berlusconi acting as ever-smiling host, has impressed the general public as a sort of blessing of the government on the part of the first -- and nowadays sole -- world power. However, what is the truth behind glamorous TV images? By the very fact that it took place, Clinton's visit politically legitimizes the Fininvest government. This, however, is only true to a certain point, if we want to give an objective report on yesterday's events. The U.S. President's words did not sound like an unconditional approval. They included reservations and undertones of concern. On the other hand, the press conference itself gave a measure of the extent of the problem posed by the fascists' presence in the government. Many of the questions concerned this topic. Clinton was able to gauge, first hand, the seriousness of this issue, and he seemed to behave accordingly, within the limits imposed by circumstances. He seemed to be in some Latin American country or other, in which an exceedingly fragile democracy is at risk, and whose rulers must, in the first place, give assurances as to democracy and human rights (the latter were in fact mentioned), with the American leader of the moment listening and giving out marks, and reserving the prerogative to judge on the basis of facts. This is how Clinton behaved, and it amounts to an unspoken admission that a problem does indeed exist, and that it is not one which can be easily surmounted. In his global, strategic outlook, Clinton may, cynically, deem it expedient to support a government like the present one in order -- among other reasons -- to win over an area of Europe -- whose remaining, and largest, part is moving further away from him every day -- rather than merely out of a noble and genuine antifascist feeling. However, he must also take very much into account public opinion at home -- a public opinion which continues to feel growing concern at the absurd escalation of Italian politics, including a whole series of facts (Nazis in Vicenza), threats (scraping the Osimo Treaty), and statements (gay people should be interned in concentration camps). Yesterday THE NEW YORK TIMES's editorial highlighted the "historical irony" involved in the fact that the President found himself commemorating Europe's liberation at the same time as fascist exponents were returning to government. Is it only the past that is involved? Are today's fascists not the same as yesterday's? Berlusconi assures us they are not. However, a more skeptical THE NEW YORK TIMES warned Clinton: "The 50th anniversary of the offensive against fascist Europe is the occasion to commemorate the heroic crusade for freedom undertaken by America and her allies. But it is also an occasion for remembering the damage fascism inflicted on Europe in a not-too-remote past. When `postfascist' parties speak of scrapping treaties and sending people to concentration camps, they must be taken seriously and called to account."
