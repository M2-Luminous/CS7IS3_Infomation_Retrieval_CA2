Mr. Ishayev said that the agreement harmed the far eastern regions of Russia and the country as a whole and accused its authors of having failed to take into account many economic and historical factors. Taking advantage of that agreement, the Chinese authorities want their civilian and military ships to be given free passage in the Russian waters along the Rivers Ussuri and Amur and demand that Russia cede to China a number of islands in the Amur. "We want to trade and improve relations with China, but in doing so we shouldn't harm our own interests," Mr. Ishayev said.
