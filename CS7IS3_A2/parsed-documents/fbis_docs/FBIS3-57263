The draft statement also asks the parliaments of the countries to put pressure on Russia so that the legal successor of the defunct Soviet Union would condemn the 1940 annexation and the following genocide against the people of the countries. Estonian parliamentary foreign relations commission has discussed the draft twice and a consensus has been achieved between different parties, Vardo Rumessen from the Estonian National Independence Party said upon handing over the draft.
