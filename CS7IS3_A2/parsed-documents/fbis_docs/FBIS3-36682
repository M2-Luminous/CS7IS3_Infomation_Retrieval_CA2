Kozyrev has no intention of commenting on Zhirinovskiy's numerous statements. He urges public opinion "not to focus" attention on them. The foreign minister said so in a conversation with a group of journalists on the eve of his visit to Tashkent and Almaty. As Kozyrev said, such attention "feeds the embryos of a furer [as received]" the LDP leader actually is. "If we begin to listen to what Zhirinovskiy says, and comment on his escapades, we'll have no time for anything else. As a result we'll find ourselves in a fantastic, not to say stupid, world," said Kozyrev. According to him, Zhirinovskiy, with his discourse on the tasks of Russia's foreign policy, is reminiscent of a clown who "distorts reality." "In fact, this is what he is doing," Kozyrev pointed out. Long before the emergence of Zhirinovskiy he, as Russia's foreign minister, raised the issue of "ethnic cleansings" taking place in some Baltic countries, particularly in Latvia and Estonia, he stressed. "About one-third of the population is mistreated on the basis of ethnicity. This relates to the Russian speakers -- ethnic Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Jews and even Finns, who are denied the right to citizenship," the minister said. "They wish to receive such citizenship, but it is denied to them for only one reason, their ethnicity. If this is not ethnic cleansing, what is it?" According to him, in some cases, in Bosnia-Herzegovina for instance, ethnic cleansing is expressed in the form of "criminal violence," and in other cases in the form of denying large groups of the population their civil rights, particularly the right to citizenship. "If -- wherever this takes place -- people are called "invaders" and "aliens," they begin to behave accordingly. A result of this is instability," Russia's foreign minister said. He referred to one more example of how the rights of Russian- speakers are infringed upon. "In the former USSR everyone was obliged to undergo military service. Estonians and Latvians were no exception -- they served in the Soviet Army. Now they want to evict from Estonia and Latvia not all the former Soviet servicemen, but only Russian-speakers. Obviously what underlies the demands for eviction is the ethnic, not political, principle," Kozyrev said. According to him, "the attempts to take revenge on ordinary people for the crimes committed by the Stalinist regime reflect political foolishness." "I recognize that the Stalinist regime committed crimes, but one must not forget that they were committed by political powers -- Stalin and Hitler -- who concluded the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. To avenge these political crimes 45 years later on thousands of ordinary people, and use the ethnic principle when doing so, is inadmissible." Russia, in the vicinity of whose borders such things are happening, cannot remain indifferent to them, Kozyrev stressed. "The world must pay attention to this inhumane and potentially dangerous situation," he concluded.
