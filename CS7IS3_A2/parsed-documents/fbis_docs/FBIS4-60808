He deems it necessary that city leaders should also take part in negotiations, which should address the question of purposive economic assistance to the region from the states that use the territory of Crimea and Sevastopol for their military bases. In his appeal, Mykola Hlushkov says that the situation in the region is being further exacerbated because of lack of objective information and comments by Ukrainian and Russian chief officials regarding actions by the two states' defense ministers.
