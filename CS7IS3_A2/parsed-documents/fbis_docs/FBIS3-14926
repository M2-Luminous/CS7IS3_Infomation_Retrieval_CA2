It would be interesting to learn about its goals and results in detail. [Paleckis] I went there at the invitation of the U.S. Information Service. This service, in cooperation with the State Department and other federal services, prepared a special program: To demonstrate how decisions on foreign policy issues are adopted in their country. [passage omitted] The things that we saw could be summarized as follows: There, as well as in our country, foreign policy decisions are adopted by the president. Unlike us, however, no one imagines that he or she knows more than the president or feels human moods better. The American way of thinking is pragmatic and democratic: He who has won the elections has the right to decide. It goes without saying that much attention was devoted to President B. Clinton's policy. He came to power with promises of focusing on domestic problems which, however, are not easy to resolve. Therefore, B. Clinton, like other presidents, immediately turned to foreign policy where effective results can be achieved more readily. Many political scientists with whom I met assess the president's foreign policy favorably, although he has not had any experience in this sphere until now. This does not mean, however, that the president does whatever he wants. The National Security Council set up in 1948 coordinates decisions adopted by government offices and consults the president. I think that we also made a similar move when establishing a Coordinating Foreign Policy Council late last year. [Kriauciuniene] Can the things that you saw be applied in Lithuania? [Paleckis] We could learn something: How to adopt decisions, analyze different options, and predict the future considering the interests of the state. Moreover, the Americans wanted to show us the role of public opinion in adopting foreign policy decisions. Public opinion is expressed there not only through the press, television, or the legislature (which is the case in our country) but also through trade unions and lobbyism. [passage omitted] U.S. ethnic minorities also express their interests in foreign policy. We had several interesting conversations with representatives of the black population. Currently, they are being represented broadly in the Congress, the diplomatic corps, and federal government institutions. Their number in the State Department might be slightly smaller. Observing this, one may think that the participation of our Polish, Russian, and other minorities in adopting various decisions, including foreign policy issues, is insufficient. [Kriauciuniene]So, the trip was interesting. [Paleckis] [passage omitted] One realizes particularly clearly during such trips that the world is so big, while Lithuania is so small. One understands that we often exaggerate the influence of our country, the three Baltic states, or even entire Central Europe on the world. In fact, this influence is not so large. In general, one could feel that America would become slightly less active in foreign policy after the cold war. Certainly, it does not intend to return to isolation, as was the case between the wars. Everyone remembers how many victims the failure to prevent fascism required. However, the Americans do not want to interfere in events that do not concern them. One professor explained to me why NATO did not want to admit Poland. In case of aggression, NATO would have to defend it and send young U.S. soldiers to death away from home. Public opinion, which is considered there so much, would not approve this. True, in the opinion of H. Kissinger, former national security secretary and state adviser, it is now that Central European states should be admitted to NATO. It is quite often the case that an activist from the opposition tries to express a different opinion from the official one because otherwise he would not be interesting to anyone, the more so that not being in power, he is not responsible for the effects. Taking into account its economic interests, the United States is currently directing its glance toward the Pacific Ocean and the Asian region, particularly southeastern Asia. The economy decides politics. [Kriauciuniene]Is the United States so little interested in Europe? [Paleckis] It is interested in Europe as well. The key issue is Russia's problems. The rule of democracy and a free market in that country would protect the United States against many troubles, additional expenses, and the restoration of the cold war. Therefore, the Americans are determined to help Russia. I happened to hear the opinion that V. Zhirinovskiy is a considerable gift to B. Yeltsin because the Russian president can ask the West for more aid under V. Zhirinovskiy's threats. While I was staying in the United States, B. Clinton returned from his trip to Europe. I was told at official federal offices that one of the key topics of his talks with President B. Yeltsin had been the issue of the Baltic states, particularly, the Army withdrawal from Latvia and Estonia. At the same time the United States wants the Baltic countries to apply international standards to ethnic minorities. The United States is very much interested in good and constructive relations between Russia and the Baltic states. I happened to be in the Congress at the time when S. Talbott, assistant to the secretary of state, was making a report about ties with Russia and other CIS countries. He stressed repeatedly that assistance would be rendered to Russia only if the latter adhered to the norms of international law in its relations with other states -- former USSR republics and Central European countries. It would be an illusion to think that relations with Russia will not be a U.S. priority. The very fact that the uncontrolled and chaotic development of this big state would be fatally dangerous to Russia's neighbors and even the transatlantic superpower is responsible for such a U.S. attitude. Thus, I categorically disagree with those who suppose that instability in Russia is useful to us and enhances our security. Undoubtedly, we would like that stability to be democratic and in line with the norms of international law. [Kriauciuniene]Did you meet with the Lithuanian-American community? [Paleckis] First of all, I would like to say that I had useful and practical meetings with Alfonsas Eidintas, Lithuanian ambassador to the United States, in Washington and Anicetas Simutis, ambassador to the United Nations, in New York. I was happy to hear that representatives of federal government institutions in Washington were pleased with the work of our embassy and its employees' competence. It is common knowledge that the official Washington assessed former Ambassador Stays Lozoraitis positively. It is pleasant, therefore, that favorable words are also said about the new ambassador. A. Eidintas has appeared as very flexible in maintaining ties with our emigres and their organizations. He feels the Americans' moods well. [passage omitted] [Kriauciuniene]Is the emigres' attitude toward Lithuania's current government changing? [Paleckis] I could not draw any conclusions from these several meetings. Recalling the president's trip to the United States last fall, I can say, however, that very many emigres wanted to see and hear him in New York and Los Angeles. Maybe, A. Brazauskas was unacceptable to some of them as a personality. but he was shown respect as Lithuania's president. Incidentally, A. Brazauskas read an annual report in the Seimas [parliament] last week, and some members of the opposition did not stand up demonstratively or clap symbolically on his entry. This shows the lack of our democratic culture because disrespect for the president means disregard for the state. [passage omitted] [Kriauciuniene]Could you explain in conclusion what your rank -- ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary -- means? Most people imagine that one may be ambassador only in some other country. [Paleckis] I go abroad quite often, and not only with the president but also on special missions, as this one. Last fall, I visited NATO headquarters in Brussels, as well as Oslo, Moscow, Bonn, and other places. The title of ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary gives more weight and helps resolve certain problems. [Kriauciuniene]Thank you for the interview.
