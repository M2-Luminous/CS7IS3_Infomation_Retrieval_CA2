FR940922-0-00023 FR940922-0-00013 There have been no tribal comments or revised proposals for the late seasons received since publication of the early season final rule. However, tribal proposals were made before late-season final frameworks for States were established. Thus, with the liberalization that has occurred, changes have been made in some of the tribal seasons that are not reflected in the earlier proposed rule document. Public Comments on Tribal Proposals The Service received a letter from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MIDNR), dated August 30, 1994, that generally supports the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission (GLIFWC) migratory bird hunting proposal in the 1836 and 1842 ceded areas of Michigan. The MIDNR did advise that State rules had been modified to limit the take of brant to no more than two daily within a daily bag of seven geese. This was in response to a recent Mississippi Flyway Council recommendation. The Service's view on this is that the likelihood of a hunter taking, or even seeing, a brant in an interior area is not very great given that brant are almost exclusively a marine species. Although they are seen on occasion, records indicate the occurrence of brant in Michigan are on a ``rare'' to ``extremely rare'' basis. Establishment of a guideline or regulation to restrict the daily bag limit of brant to two is somewhat meaningless in that context. Nevertheless, as it would seem that the regulation is in part designed to protect the hunter, the Service will defer to the GLIFWC to decide for next season how they will propose to respond to the Mississippi Flyway Council recommendation and the State of Michigan establishment of regulations for brant harvest. For this current season, after consultation with both the MIDNR and the GLIFWC, the potential problem has been taken care of through inclusion of brant in the ``Other Geese'' category of the GLIFWC regulations. Other comments from States regarding tribally proposed regulations, received earlier, were addressed in the early season final rule published on September 1, 1994. In summary, this rule amends section 20.110 of 50 CFR to make current for the late 1994&hyph;95 migratory bird hunting season the regulations that will apply on Federal Indian reservations, off-reservation trust lands and ceded lands. These regulations take into account the liberalization that the Service has determined is biologically feasible for this current season, based on improved production. NEPA Consideration Pursuant to the requirements of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(C)), the ``Final Environmental Statement for the Issuance of Annual Regulations Permitting the Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds (FES&hyph;75&hyph;74)'' was filed with the Council on Environmental Quality on June 6, 1975, and notice of availability was published in the Federal Register on June 13, 1975, (40 FR 25241). A supplement to the final environmental statement, the ``Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement: Issuance of Annual Regulations Permitting the Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds (SEIS 88&hyph;14)'' was filed on June 9, 1988, and notice of availability was published in the Federal Register on June 16, 1988 (53 FR 22582), and June 17, 1988 (53 FR 22727). In addition, an August 1985 environmental assessment titled ``Guidelines for Migratory Bird Hunting Regulations on Federal Indian Reservations and Ceded Lands'' is available from the Service. Endangered Species Act Considerations Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531&hyph;1543; 87 Stat. 884), provides that, ``The Secretary shall review other programs administered by him and utilize such programs in furtherance of the purposes of this Act'' (and) shall ``insure that any action authorized, funded or carried out *␣*␣* is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of [critical] habitat *␣*␣*'' Consequently, the Service initiated Section 7 consultation under the Endangered Species Act for the proposed migratory bird hunting seasons including those which occur on Federally recognized Indian reservations and ceded lands. The Service's biological opinion resulting from its consultation under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act may be inspected by the public in, and will be available to the public from, the Division of Endangered Species and Habitat Conservation and the Office of Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C. 20240. Copies of these documents are available from the Service at the address indicated under the caption ADDRESSES. In an August 1994 opinion, the Division of Endangered Species concluded that the proposed action is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of their critical habitats. Hunting regulations are designed, among other things, to remove or alleviate chances of conflict between seasons for migratory game birds and the protection and conservation of endangered and threatened species and their habitats. Regulatory Flexibility Act, Executive Order 12866, and the Paperwork Reduction Act In the April 7 Federal Register , the Service reported measures it had undertaken to comply with requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ) and Executive Order 12866. These included preparing an Analysis of Regulatory Effects, preparing a Small Entity Flexibility Analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and publishing a summary of the latter. This information is included in the present document by reference. This action was not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. This rule does not contain any information collection requiring approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3504. Authorship The primary author of this final rule is Dr. Keith A. Morehouse, Office of Migratory Bird Management. Regulations Promulgation The rulemaking process for migratory bird hunting must, by its very nature, operate under severe time constraints. However, the Service is of the view that every attempt should be made to give the public the greatest possible opportunity to comment on the regulations. Thus, when the proposed hunting regulations for certain tribes were published on August 16, 1994, the Service established the longest possible period for public comments. In doing this, the Service recognized that time would be of the essence. However, the comment period provided the maximum amount of time possible while ensuring that this final rule would be published before the late hunting season beginning on September 24, 1994. Under the authority of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of July 3, 1918, as amended (40 Stat. 755; 16 U.S.C. 703 et seq. ), the Service prescribes final hunting regulations for certain tribes on Federal Indian reservations (including off-reservation trust lands), and ceded lands. The regulations specify the species to be hunted and establish season dates, bag and possession limits, season length, and shooting hours for migratory game birds other than waterfowl. Therefore, for the reasons set out above, the Service finds that ``good cause'' exists, within the terms of 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) of the Administrative Procedure Act, and this final rule will take effect on September 24, 1994. List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 20 Exports, Hunting, Imports, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Transportation, Wildlife. Accordingly, Part 20, Subchapter B, Chapter I of Title 50 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows: PART 20_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for Part 20 continues to read as follows: Authority: Migratory Bird Treaty Act, as amended (16 U.S.C. 703 et seq. ). ( Editorial Note: The following annual hunting regulations provided for by §20.110 of 50 CFR Part 20 will not appear in the Code of Federal Regulations because of their seasonal nature.) 2. Section 20.110 is revised to read as follows: §20.110 Seasons, limits and other regulations for certain Federal Indian reservations, Indian Territory, and ceded lands.
