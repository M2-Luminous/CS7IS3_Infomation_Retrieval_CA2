What is meant by the economy "overheating," from the perspective of the materials production system, is that certain sectors of the national economy can no longer support the going rate of growth. From the monetary point of view, meanwhile, an "overheated" economy refers to the rise in the overall price level; it means "inflation." Between July and August of 1992, there were clear signs of the economy overheating and of inflation. They could be seen in three areas: 1) Bottlenecks in the "tight sectors" such as communications and transportation, especially rail transport; energy, especially power supply; raw materials, especially construction materials, were even more restrictive. 2) Inflationary pressure found its way from M<inf> 2</inf> which had a low rate of circulation to M<inf> 0</inf> which had a high rate of circulation, and the retail price index began to rise. If we include the price of means of production, the price index would be even higher. 3) People began to expect inflation. For example, the sale of Phase II state treasury notes which paid 9 percent annual interest was sluggish and the resale of Phase I and older treasury notes was at below face value; meanwhile, there were incidents of panic buying of gold, gold jewelry, and hard currencies (U.S. and Hong Kong dollar). These indicated that people were expecting the inflation rate to run at above 10 percent. At the end of last year and early this year, inflation was obvious, or in the words of a newspaper, "inflationary pressure is being released": The overall price index of the workers' living expenses rose to double-digits; retail price index in the 35 large and medium-sized cities rose to around 15 percent; RMB's exchange rate plummeted. At the same time, because there were no market rules and because of the expansionary monetary policy, China's stock market, real estate market, and the just-opened futures market created a "bubble economy." The situation clearly indicated that the financial chaos and the soaring rate of inflation were threatening our economic stability and the normal operations of businesses and industries. If proper measures were not taken, it could lead to serious economic turmoil. Under the circumstances, the government began to take steps in July to rectify financial order and lower the rate of increase in the money supply. Although we were a little late, we were heading in the right direction, and decisive action was necessary. Current measures being taken can be separated into three levels: 1) Use of direct administrative controls, which include tightening the control over the loan quota, sorting out investments in basic construction projects and the development zones, and setting a deadline for retrieving illegal short-term loans. 2) Use of economic measures, which include raising the interest rate on loans again and resuming the opening of inflation-proof savings accounts. 3) Proceed with reform of the financial system. It has been a month since the introduction of the first measures, and judging by the current situation, although there have been some problems and difficulties, the overall situation is good: Price increases have slowed; foreign exchange prices have dropped; the "bubble economy" created by stocks and real estate has shrunk. If all goes well, the national economy may stabilize in the near future -- say, at the end of the year or early next year. But, whether things will turn out as expected will depend on whether the yet-to-be-introduced measures are correct and whether they can be effectively implemented. The initial success so far is due mainly to the first level measures and some of the second level measures. Under conditions of extreme economic chaos, it is necessary to use some "hard measures" to quickly put the situation under control. But we must clearly understand that these administrative measures have limits as well as side effects. That is to say, one, after 14 years of reform, China's finances have, in part, "come alives," which greatly diminishes the ability of administrative plans to control the economy. About 50 percent of the gathering and distribution of funds no longer go through the state banks' formal channels. Therefore, it will be a mistake to rely too heavily on administrative measures. Two, although we must make every effort to do what is right and avoid what is harmful, it is impossible to avoid being indiscriminate when using administrative measures, and so when we use administrative measures to cool the "overheated" parts of the economy, other parts which need even more support or are even "hotter" will often be affected, thus preventing the increase in supply. Furthermore, since the financial system has not undergone radical reform, some units may not be implementing state policies properly, and when that happens, what should be tightened may not tightened and what should not be tightened may be tightened. For example, some units may not take away funds used for real estate speculation but may take away necessary industries' and businesses' circulation funds, and this can cause serious consequences. The effectiveness of the second type of measures is 1) constrained by the effectiveness of organizations and institutions manipulating those economic measures and 2) limited by defects in other economic mechanisms. Therefore, the success of those economic measures is predicated on reforms in other areas. Today, the more serious problems are: 1) Speculation in the bubble economy is yielding a high rate of return--100 percent profit or better a year. This has resulted in large amounts of money being channeled to the stock, real estate, and futures markets for speculation purpose, thus exacerbating the shortage of funds needed by industries and businesses, and it also makes it difficult for the interest lever to function effectively. Therefore, as we tighten the money supply, we must increase the supply of financial goods, strengthen market order and management, and carefully release the air in the "bubbles." 2) Foreign exchange reform is out of sequence (regular accounts are still using dual exchange rates and under administrative control, and meanwhile, capital circulation is very lax,) and as a result, our own currency is grossly undervalued and the masses' confidence in our currency is shaken, which adds to the inflationary momentum. We can remedy the situation in two ways: One, retract the order and change those methods that have loosened the control over the capital accounts. Another way is to accelerate the reform to make trade-related foreign exchange convertible. Personally, I favor the second method. Since the root cause of this round of inflation is the slow pace of reform, the basic cure of course is to accelerate reform. Just as we have pointed out many times before, the root cause of today's accelerated inflation and widespread corruption is the very slow pace of reform of the taxation, financial, and state-owned enterprise systems, and so the solution is to accelerate reforms in those areas. In other words, not only must we speed up the restructuring of the financial system, we must also speed up the reform of the tax system and the restructuring of the state-owned enterprise system. Moreover, reforms in these areas must be coordinated, because only then can we quickly set up the basic frame work of a market economy and give play to the market economy's overall ability to allocate resources properly. Therefore, it is imperative that we focus on the research and study of a coordinated reform program, and once the program is formulated, we must immediately get organized and quickly begin its implementation.
