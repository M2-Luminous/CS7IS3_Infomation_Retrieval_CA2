Meksi pointed out that the decision is taken in relation to the developments of fire-wood production private sector, the necessity for the development of private sector in the production and selling of electric power and avoiding the abuses in its usage and subsidies as well. The government aims to secure the supply of population with these provisions pointed out Meksi saying that in the future, electric power will meet better the vital demands, as lightening, cooking but in no way for heating. To achieve this we have applied the principle of compensation to salaries, in order to cover the price rise. Admitting that we compensate a quota of 160 kilowatt hours in a month per family for the whole year, we compensate the consumed electric power against payment for 1993 and more than 50 per cent of free of charge consumed quantity, so more than the needs and possibilities. The government will improve the legislation, considering the usage of electric power without payment as a criminal case and will invest in the improvement of electric apparatus as well as the eventual privatisation of the sector for the delivering of electric power. In the end he said that taking into consideration these reasons, the government decided that the compensation for a family should be 700 lek in a month. This will enter in force in 1995 and will be a permanent part of a monthly salary for the whole year. Later was approved the law "An Addition to the Law", "On the City Planning" presented for approval by the president Sali Berisha. The law will impede the illegal selling of the construction sites, sold since January the first 1990. The persons that have carried out the purchase and the registration in cadastre and mortgage will be reimbursed the cost of the site according to the present index of the prices.
