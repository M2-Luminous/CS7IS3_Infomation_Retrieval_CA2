The fair, which started Tuesday [19 April] afternoon, attracted more than 700 business people from about 300 U.S. firms. The Chinese and U.S. businessmen have signed 62 contracts and agreements valued at 5.4 billion U.S. dollars, according to the spokesman of the fair. The spokesman said these deals include six contracts on U.S. investment in China and agreements on China's purchasing of 600 million dollar U.S. commodities. The 200-member strong Chinese trade and investment mission came to the United States two weeks ago with the Chinese economic and trade delegation, headed by Wu Yi, Chinese minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation. While the minister and her delegation was in Washington to attend the eighth session of the Sino-U.S. Joint Committee on Commerce and Trade last week, the Chinese entrepreneurs also held a trade and investment fair in Los Angeles. In Los Angeles fair, the two sides have signed 11 contracts worth 1.3 billion U.S. dollars and 134 agreements valued at 4.4 billion dollars. Shen Yonglie, one of the chiefs of the Chinese mission, told the press that he had found that U.S. business people are extremely active in trying to understand China and in finding ways to do business with China and to invest in China. "A number of senior U.S. business leaders had proposed," Shen said, "that Chinese fairs of this kind should be held in the United States once a year." Chinese entrepreneurs, he added, were also very much interested in establishing closer business ties with their American counterparts. "In this regard, we have already achieved our goals," Shen said. "we have set up a lot of contacts with U.S. firms, far more than we had expected." The Chinese official expressed his belief that these contacts would result in much closer business relations between the two countries.
