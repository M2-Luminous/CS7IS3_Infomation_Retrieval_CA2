A check carried out by this committee jointly with other agencies revealed that some of the Northern Fleet's personnel had been exposed to excessive radiation dozes (7 people were hospitalized). Nuclear materials are not properly isolated, while nuclear facilities and ships are operated with violations of the safety regulations. Some of the installations, put out of service, have not been placed in a safe condition. The State Atomic Inspection Committee is seriously concerned about the handling of nuclear wastes. Containers are overloaded and no measures are taken to process the radioactive wastes. Liquid wastes are still being dumped into the sea. The committee reports that it has informed the Defense Ministry of the alarming situation on the Northern Fleet. It says that on October 17, a TMT-27 tanker dumped liquid radioactive wastes 105 miles east of Vladivostok and 295 miles from the Japanese island of Hokkaido, all of which aroused Japan's and Korea's protests. The introduction of state control over the radiation safety of the Defense Ministry's facilities is a must, says the State Atomic Inspection Committee.
