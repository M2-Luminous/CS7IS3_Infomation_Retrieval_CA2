It was announced on 20 February that [Defense Minister] Lajos Fur had been elected party chairman. At the end of the National Meeting, Fur said in his closing speech that the competition will be decided between the left-wing bloc and national Christian forces. What is at stake is nothing other than whether the development of democracy will continue. He warned that the left-wing danger must not be underestimated. We asked various politicians to comment on this issue. For the Social Democratic Party of Hungary [MSZDP], General Secretary Istvan Podkoniczky said that they do not consider this fear justified because, in their view, a left-wing bloc does not exist. Although, he immediately added, in balanced politics, the left wing has a role in the same way as the right wing does. It is quite certain that "the continuation of pure democracy" is not possible without social justice, solidarity, and equality of opportunity. Social and even economic difficulties can be increased if these three important elements are ignored. Regarding the emphatic section of the MDF's election program urging the preservation and improvement of public security, the MSZDP's view is that crime can be reduced mainly through social measures rather than with a strong police. Left and right wings are obsolete notions, as people do not divide themselves into sides; the Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP] does not think in these terms, either: It wishes to be the party of the Hungarian people, a modern European people's party, Mrs. Agnes G. Nagy, deputy chairman of the party, said at a news conference in Kaposvar, where Somogy county's Smallholder candidates were introduced. According to Tamas Deutsch, deputy chairman of the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], Lajos Fur's statement that the elections will be decided between the left-wing bloc and national Christian forces only indicates that the MDF's new chairman values his party's election chances highly. In the Fidesz's view, the MDF and the current coalition will obtain less support at the elections than in 1990. However, it is far from true that only the current coalition can call itself a national force because it is difficult to dispute that other parties, including the Fidesz, are nationally committed. According to Zoltan Gal, parliamentary group leader of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], the speeches at the MDF's National Meeting indicate that a right-wing populist is the party's new chairman, while, in this peculiar division of labor, Prime Minister Peter Boross strengthens the MDF's pragmatic image. The National Meeting confirmed the MSZP's expectations: The MDF cannot boast about its performance over the past four years, and so it is trying to push the problems of the present into the past and to blend the MSZP with the past, the former interior minister thought. Bela Csepe, parliamentary group leader of the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP], said that the parliamentary group had sent a greetings telegram to Lajos Fur on the occasion of his election. This greeting indicates that the parliamentary group does not consider the functions of MDF chairman and defense minister irreconcilable. (In an MTI statement on 20 February, KDNP Deputy Chairman Laszlo Varga said that at a time when it is completely uncertain how the south Slav events will end, the same person cannot hold the positions of party chairman and defense minister.) According to Attila Karoly Soos, deputy of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], Lajos Fur is dreaming if he thinks that only the left wing can be the opponent of the current right-wing parties. A strong liberal center is also present on the political scene and this group will also have a say in forming the next government coalition. Pal Dragon, deputy of the United Smallholders Party, said that he agrees with Lajos Fur's statement. In his view, this coalition has managed to lay the foundations of a democracy that is able to function. With this, the Hungarian Government has achieved a unique performance in Europe that no one else can boast about. "I am proud that the United Smallholders Party, the former Group of 36, has preserved its original principles and fought throughout the four years together with the MDF."
