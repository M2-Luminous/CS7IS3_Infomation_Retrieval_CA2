FBIS4-13371 "drnes076_o_94006" FBIS-NES-94-076 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 SYRIA Israeli Occupation Seen as Cause of Hadera Attack Israeli Occupation Seen as Cause of Hadera Attack JN1904194594 Damascus TISHRIN in Arabic 14 Apr 94 pp 1, 11 JN1904194594 Damascus TISHRIN Arabic BFN [Editorial: "Occupation Is the Cause"] [Text] Israel quaked again for the second time in less than a week as a result of the Hadera operation carried out in the heart of the Zionist entity near Tel Aviv. This proves that through measures of repression, terrorism, and siege, the Israeli occupation forces cannot guarantee security and stability in the 1967 occupied territories or in the 1948 territories. This shows Israel's propaganda that its plans and proposals can guarantee the achievement of peace is mere illusion and imagination. Israel is reaping the results and effects of its policy of continued occupation. It is reaping what it has planted in lies, delusions, and claims. All these confirm that partial agreements and separate deals cannot make peace or lead to security and peace, but to further disturbances and confusion, and to the escalation of violence and bloodshed. Developments and facts in the occupied territories prove Israel has fallen into the impasse of fragile and destructive settlements. It caused the situation to explode due to its adherence to occupation and disregard of the just and comprehensive solution, and as a result of its maneuverings and delusions to circumvent the resolutions of international legitimacy. Certainly, the situation can expect to see additional grave dangers and damaging repercussions if Israel continues its repressive and terroristic policy, and its rejection of the pillars of a just and comprehensive peace. This is because occupation, or any part of it, is the problem. In fact, it is the major obstacle to achieving security and stability in the region. Undoubtedly, the full removal of the occupation of the Arab territories in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, Jerusalem, southern Lebanon, and Golan, is the true ground for an honorable, lasting, and successful peace. As long as Israel continues to avoid this, it will be responsible for the cycle of violence, and for the anger, indignation, and explosions in the occupied Arab territories. These are impossible to bridle or stop by continuing the occupation. Had Israel been really concerned about security and stability, it would have immediately managed to learn from and to comprehend what is taking place by announcing it is ready to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories, to respond positively to the requirements of a just and comprehensive peace, and to abide by the resolutions of international legitimacy, the Madrid formula and principles, particularly the land-for-peace principle. However, instead of doing so, it maneuvered, cheated, and did its best to drag the Palestinian side into making further concessions leading to partial agreements and separate secret deals. The result of this was that the Oslo agreement's repercussions, and threats to and relinquishment of the Palestinian people's rights have reflected negatively not only on the Palestinians who signed the agreement, but also on Israel itself. This is because the Palestinian people discovered in this agreement full relinquishment of their national, legitimate, and political rights, flagrant violation of their just demands, and full liquidation of their cause, for the sake of which they have been waging a struggle so it will continue to live as a cause of a people striving for liberation and salvation from the yoke of occupation, and for living in peace, security, and stability. Therefore, under no circumstances should one ask the victim to ignore its killer. After all these sacrifices and confrontations, the Palestinian people should not submit or yield to capitulatory deals, or accept the continuation of occupation. The fact is that all parties have participated in the peace process knowing it is comprehensive. Otherwise, the Madrid conference would not have been convened. So, we should go back to the bases of the Madrid formula, to facts that have become axioms, and to established facts stressing the need for a just and comprehensive peace, especially since this is the only means to prevent disturbances, end setbacks, catastrophes and tragedies, uproot the manifestations of violence and counteractions, and the causes of terrorism, repression, siege, and Israeli occupation.
