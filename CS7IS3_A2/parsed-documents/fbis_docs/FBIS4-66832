The calm atmosphere had led a good many people to return to an almost ordinary life--a life of strolling about and going to the beach. If there was detente, it was bought at a high price, considering that the Army, which for a time had seemingly abandoned the field to armed Islamist groups, resumed its offensive in fundamentalist bastions both in the eastern and the western part of the country. It did not spare the means--including napalm, among other things--in its attempt to get the better of its opponents at the risk of harming the innocent. The armed Islamist groups were probably hit hard, but despite that, they are not ready to let go. They are more convinced than ever that victory is to be found at the end of a gun and that nothing can be won around the green baize of a conference table. Their fierce resistance promotes the goals of the "politicians" in the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), especially its leaders, Abassi Madani and Ali Benhadj, who can thus raise the stakes in their fight against the government, which is striving to draw them into the institutional game. By refusing to participate in the march for reconciliation, the "party of God" won a victory by default. By murdering two Catholic religious, the most radical of the Islamists tried to go even further and show anyone who might tend to forget it that time does not dull their combativeness and that it will eventually work in their favor. In assuming the office of president, General Lamine Zeroual gave the impression that he wanted to find a political solution to the crisis being experienced by the country rather than relying on the law-and-order approach. He went about it by surrounding himself with men who were not hostile to that view of things and by initiating discreet dialogue with the Islamist leaders. It must be admitted that for the moment, he has gotten nothing in return. The government is being forced to have two irons in the fire. It must simultaneously engage in warfare with the armed groups and hold talks with the Islamist leaders in the visiting room at Blida Prison, while at the same time not burning its bridges with the traditional political forces, be they "reconcilers" or "eradicators"--advocates of strong-arm tactics--who are always ready to draw it into their own camp. And, above all, without endangering the unity of the Armed Forces, which are the cornerstone of any solution. Algeria therefore seems to be taking its troubles patiently and adjusting as best it can to an instability that is difficult to overcome and a "war" that no camp seems capable of winning. Except by putting the country to fire and the sword.
