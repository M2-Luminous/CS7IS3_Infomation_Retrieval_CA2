V. Kuznetsov; UDC 519.717:621.39:534.782.001] [Abstract] Pulse-code modulated and delta-modulated signals are used to represent speech signals. The Fourier spectra of pulse-code modulated signals were analyzed; Hartley spectra were also considered. The spectra were divided into frequency ranges, or spectral coefficients. Three spectra types were isolated: those with almost all energy at low frequencies, mixed spectra, and those with most energy in the high-frequency range. The number of coefficients which can be transmitted in one frame is determined. Methods of decreasing the initial number of coefficients are described. A graph of the signal compression algorithm is presented. An algorithm is developed to compress a delta-modulated speech signal: an Adamar-ordering algorithm is used to represent a delta-modulated signal in the form of coefficients expanded into a system of orthogonal Walsh functions. The minimum number of spectral coefficients is determined for which analog signal quality is not worsened. Vector quantization and orthogonal Fourier, Hartley, and Walsh transforms were found to be effective in compressing pulse-code-modulated and delta-modulated speech signals. The algorithm used to determine the optimal code size is described, and the results are discussed. Optimal transmission speeds are found to be 2.3-2.5 kb/s for delta modulation and 4.6-4.8 kb/s for pulse-code modulation. Figures 4; references 4 (Russian).
