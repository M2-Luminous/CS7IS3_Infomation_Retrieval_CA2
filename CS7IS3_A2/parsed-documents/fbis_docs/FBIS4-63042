The president expressed the view that the idea to set up the Eurasian Union was no more than a "populist slogan". "If we are unable to enforce real economic integration between CIS countries, how can one talk about setting up the Eurasian Union?" he said. Islam Karimov stressed the importance of the creation of the CIS, noting that "without the Commonwealth, the breakup of the former USSR could have resulted in the start of civil war" in several republics. Speaking about NATO's Partnership for Peace program, the president made it clear that Tashkent does not intend to hurry in deciding whether to join it. "We are now studying the issue," Islam Karimov said. He noted that Uzbekistan is consulting with Russia on the issue of joining the NATO program. "We have good understanding with Russia on the matter," the president said.
