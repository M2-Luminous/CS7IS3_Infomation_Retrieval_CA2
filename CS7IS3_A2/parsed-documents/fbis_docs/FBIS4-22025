In February and March two vehicles were discovered, which were registered to Steinmetz in the past: a Honda Civic passenger car and a Suzuki 750 motorcycle. According to the chief federal prosecutor's office, both vehicles might have been used by the RAF for attacks. According to findings by the Hesse police, the motorcycle might have been used for escape in six bank robberies. In the car investigators found traces of the explosive element nitropenta, among others on gloves that had been left in the car. Such traces were also found by investigators after the blowing up of the new prison in Weiterstadt near Darmstadt in March 1993, for which the RAF claimed responsibility. At first, Steinmetz told the BfV that he had known about the attack on the prison. Later on, however, he denied this self- incrimination and presented an alibi. Since the authorities do not know which of his versions is correct, there are comprehensive checks being conducted at the moment. Thus, it was noticed that traces of saliva on cigarette butts which were found in Steinmetz' car are identical to traces on butts which were found in connection with the Weiterstadt case. Whether the butt really came from the liaison man is now supposed to be clarified by producing a so-called genetic fingerprint. The blood sample necessary for that is available: Some time ago, Steinmetz voluntarily agreed to have a blood sample taken, because he believed that as a witness he need not fear anything. Since the car and the motorcycle were used by many members of the autonomous scene before and after the operation in Bad Kleinen, a new investigation by the chief prosecutor's office is aimed against unknown persons at the moment. Ex-liaison man Steinmetz lives in an unknown place with a new identity.
