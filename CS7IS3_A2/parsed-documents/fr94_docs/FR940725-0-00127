FR940725-0-00127 FR940725-0-00019 Therefore, in the final rule, the employer is permitted to use any form or format of reporting that identifies the employees who are designated as competent persons and the date they were trained or that a Marine Chemist will be used to perform atmospheric testing. Under the final rule, OSHA will continue to recognize the OSHA 73 form as an acceptable recordkeeping medium, but will not require its use. Employers are free to use whatever recordkeeping medium they choose as long as the record contains the minimum information required in the final rule and can be presented for inspection upon request. By requiring that the record be made available for inspection upon request, OSHA is eliminating the need for employers to file new OSHA 73 forms or certifications of designated persons with the nearest OSHA area office as required in the previous language of §1915.7(a)(2). In paragraph (b)(2)(iii), OSHA has reorganized the requirements of the certificate designating employees as competent persons, keeping most that were proposed, but eliminating the requirement to include the date the record was made and adding a requirement to include the date the competent person was trained. As long as the list of competent persons represents the current situation, there is no need to know when it was created. However, knowing when a competent person was trained will enable OSHA to determine easily that the employee was trained, thus facilitating enforcement and ensuring that the employer is aware of the date the employee was trained. Criteria for a competent person. In the proposal, the Agency requested public comment on whether there should be OSHA-approved or OSHA-required training for competent persons, whether competent persons should be certified, when such requirements could be implemented, and how many persons would need training and certification. Several commenters believed that OSHA should not require training or certification of shipyard competent persons. For example, the Shipbuilders Council of America (SCA) (Ex. 6&hyph;3) and Newport News Shipbuilding (Ex. 6&hyph;6), commented: The vast majority of confined space entry incidents are the result of poor application of confined space entry procedures. There are few, if any, confined space incidents involving errors by a competent person. The criteria for designating competent persons in the present standard in §1915.7 are sufficiently specific and rigorous to ensure qualified individuals, and should be retained. SCA (Ex. 6&hyph;3) additionally suggested that, OSHA should continue to offer and support Shipyard Competent Person training courses. However, the fact that an individual has taken the course alone does not ensure competency. Other commenters urged OSHA to institute mandatory training and certification (e.g., Ex. 6&hyph;14, 6&hyph;24, 6&hyph;31). For instance, NIOSH recommended that OSHA require and take responsibility for the certification and training of shipyard competent persons (Ex. 6&hyph;14). The U.S. Navy's Environmental Health Center (Ex. 6&hyph;31) related the issue of shipyard competent persons to their Gas Free Engineers by stating that: OSHA should adopt a formal policy on this issue. Naval shipyards currently have a 3 week Gas Free Engineer (GFE) course which is given to Navy personnel so that they may perform as Gas Free Engineering Technicians. Another commenter, Independent Testing and Consulting, Inc. (Ex. 6&hyph;24) expressed this viewpoint: The NFPA in conjunction with OSHA has re-introduced a voluntary training program for Competent Persons *␣*␣*. The provision of training by outside agencies lifts a burden from the employer and the benefits outweigh the costs. The requirements of 1915.7 are adequate but every effort should be made to provide employers with the opportunity to send personnel to training courses which should be OSHA approved. Such approval should require that persons be recertified periodically, say every 3&hyph;5 years. This would assure that competent persons keep abreast of changes in technology, law etc. OSHA received support for periodic re-training and many suggestions with a variety of time limits (Ex. 6&hyph;4, 6&hyph;12, 6&hyph;14, 6&hyph;21, 6&hyph;22, 6&hyph;27, 6&hyph;28, 6&hyph;33, 6&hyph;36). For example, the U.S. Coast Guard MIONY (Ex. 6&hyph;4) and the Navy's Sea Systems Command (Ex. 6&hyph;12) believe that competent persons should attend initial training and then attend refresher training each year thereafter. NIOSH (Ex. 6&hyph;14) recommended that annual training of the competent person be required for recertification. Several commenters, however, believed that the criteria for designating a competent person should remain the same as the previous standard. The NFPA (Ex. 6&hyph;10), for example, stated : *␣*␣* Emphasis should be placed upon enforcement of existing requirements (the performance requirements to be designated for a competent person) and that formal training be directed toward the existing duties and responsibilities of a competent person. And as expressed by Delta Laboratory and Gas Testing, Inc. (Ex. 6&hyph;35): *␣*␣* the present system provides a tried and tested system of confined space entry and work *␣*␣*. To change the basic format of the system would be sheer folly and would benefit the few at the expense of many.
