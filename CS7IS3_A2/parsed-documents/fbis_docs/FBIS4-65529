But it does seem likely to remain, in our country too, a discipline having its own rules, its own "fundamental articles," and its own internal codes. A discipline in which we are not all equally expert. Moreover, a discipline whose professionals reveal their real capabilities when everything seems to militate against them. And they are forced -- as in the case of Umberto Bossi, as Lucio Colletti highlighted in this newspaper Saturday [7 May] -- to perform tightrope acts to try to get out of a very dangerous predicament. Let us be clear about this. In such an act, the business of the Interior Ministry was just an initial step; further very dangerous steps lay ahead for the League's acrobat, starting with the imminent European elections. But it was undoubtedly a crucial test. If, as seems to be the case, in the list of ministers that Silvio Berlusconi will submit to the chief of state today, the Interior Ministry will be allocated to Roberto Maroni, the League will deserve some congratulations, and it is pointless to deny it. This, if only from those who have never believed that the demise of the First Republic entailed the inevitable shelving of politics. For days and days, in the crude -- to say the least -- language to which the League itself has greatly helped to accustom us, we have wondered whether, to what extent, and how Bossi had "adopted a posture of submission" after Berlusconi's rejection of Maroni's candidacy, for reasons which, curiously, the prime minister- designate deemed too delicate to convey to the public. We wondered about the actual likelihood that [Judge] Antonio Di Pietro -- perhaps in response to an improbable demand by [President] Scalfaro -- had acted as a "deus ex machina." An ever longer and vaguer list was drawn up of other authoritative magistrates who could have replaced Di Pietro, after his refusal. We paid serious heed to the League leader's latest diversion tactic, his suggestion of the Milan police chief [Achille Serra] as a possible interior minister. Sooner or later, and rather sooner than later, we will discover the real background to this incredible performance. However, even now we must acknowledge that Bossi has proved to be the most skillful in this game of names. Committed not only, and not so much, to securing for the League the ministry that was once the symbol of the eternity of DC [Christian Democratic Party] power, but also, and above all, to demonstrating what an arduous task it will be for Berlusconi to transform himself from the unquestioned winner of the elections into the authoritative prime minister of the Second Republic. On the basis of the way things have turned out, Bossi could say that he has succeeded in this latter, and for him more vital, operation, even if at the last moment Maroni himself were to fall victim to the hail of intersecting vetoes. We are talking about tactics, of course. About the certain amount of totally unscrupulous tactics which, with apologies to the proponents of new-style ethics, the formation of a coalition government necessarily entails -- and this, not through any unavowable sin on the part of the coalition partners. Strategy is another matter, of course. Even for that tightrope walker, Bossi. Let him make the most of things while he can. But he is probably the first to realize that he needs to resort to something more than clever maneuvering and perhaps some half-baked fellow-feeling with the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] in order to impart a new boost to the League.
