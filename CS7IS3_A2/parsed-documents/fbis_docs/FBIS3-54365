[Al-Tufayli] I do not have an official position in Hizballah. As is known, I have given up official positions for some time. However, I am with them through thick and thin. I am always their brother. I prefer not to go into details. It is an internal affair. [Shuqayr] It is said that you secluded yourself before the parliamentary elections? [Al-Tufayli] I avoid talking about that issue in the media. I had my own view, and my brothers had their own view. It was an exceptional case. At any rate, please allow me not to address this issue in press statements. [passage omitted] [Shuqayr] What is your position on the post-peace stage? [Al-Tufayli] In order for us to be in the picture the question should be seen from all angles. There are a group of proposals in the region about the post-peace stage, like the question of resisting normalization peacefully. Some quarters are dealing with this question and setting conditions for it. What is important is not for me to look at the issue, program it in my mind, and form a beautiful picture of it. What is important is reality. The question of resisting normalization through peaceful means and nonconfrontation with the Arab regime is not practical. Because the Lebanese regime clashed with those opposed to the Gaza-Jericho agreement at a time when it was opposed to this agreement. It killed and wounded many of them without any justification. It has ignored the case, not bothering to investigate it, despite its promise to do so. I was right in my position toward the regime and the government, and there is no need for me to reiterate it. As for the second point, resisting normalization peacefully means in practice economic, informational, and diplomatic competition, and so on. Competitiveness between the Arab and Western markets is nonexistent, especially if we note that the U.S. economy serves the Zionist economy. And the United States has on several occasions reiterated its promise to guarantee prosperity for the Zionist economy and fight any Arab boycott. This means that competitiveness -- even in its weakest forms -- is not possible, because we do not have anything with which to compete with the Western economy. We daily wait for the sea to feed our children, that is what the West sends us.... Thus resisting normalization after peace -- and in such a manner -- is impractical. [passage omitted] [Shuqayr] What do you mean by saying that resisting normalization will lead to clashes with the regimes? [Al-Tufayli] For example, in the form of a demonstration in an Arab street condemning a political sin, and, as a result, the authorities confront it. Or in the form of an article by a writer, which the authorities may regard as a threat to its security, stability, and peace with the enemy, hence they resort to punishment, pursuit, and judgment, especially as we know that our regimes cannot accept criticism, so how can they be expected to allow major opposition to take place? I would like here to point out that I do not mean military opposition, because I do not believe that there should be military opposition to the existing policy in Lebanon, because that would not serve the issue of liberating Palestine and our country. On the contrary, it would thwart the liberation march. I say that it is our duty to bear all psychological and physical pressures the regime may exert and to focus on the confrontation with the enemy, whatever the price. Even if that leads to formal trials, executions, and so on. I am for carrying out operations against the Zionist entity and the symbols of this entity, even if the price is the execution and killing of the mujahidin by Arab regimes. That should not prevent them from continuing their resistance. [Shuqayr] How can a peace in which Lebanon is a partner alongside Syria be reconciled with your call for launching military resistance? [Al-Tufayli] We as a people are entitled not to comply with any treaty by which the Lebanese regime abides. We must continue to resist our enemy by all military means despite the Lebanese regime's opposition. Even if the entire world joins the peace process. Our duty and task is to complete the march of confrontation and liberation against the Zionist entity. [passage omitted] [Shuqayr] This position may cause a clash with the allies, specifically Syria. [Al-Tufayli] I am not talking about the present situation and conditions. I am talking about an assignment for all Arabs and Muslims inside and outside Lebanon. I am saying that these should be assigned to continue the liberation march. We in Lebanon are part of this march. I do not claim that we can liberate Palestine, let alone southern Lebanon, on our own. I say that continuing the march in Lebanon and elsewhere represents a start for a big tendency in the long term, in order to reunite ranks in the framework of a major liberation operation. That requires a great deal of work and changes. This is what I meant. [passage omitted] [Shuqayr] So you are for a new form of armed struggle? [Al-Tufayli] Of course, I am for armed struggle anywhere. [Shuqayr] But conditions are not favorable? [Al-Tufayli] I believe they are, and they will be more favorable after peace is established. Egypt remains the biggest proof of this. In my view, the anger and bombings the Arab world is experiencing are the natural result of the stage of peace and normalization with the Zionist entity. The more the regimes move toward peace, the more the peoples move away from them and toward liberation. [Shuqayr] So you are for returning to the situation that existed in Beirut in the past. [Al-Tufayli] I do not mix up questions, and we must distinguish between what is Western and what is Zionist, which remains a target for us as fighters, militarily, diplomatically, economically, or informationally. [Shuqayr] Even if it is decided to establish diplomatic relations? [Al-Tufayli] Of course we will resist that diplomatic presence. But we should not touch the other diplomatic missions or communities. Nor should any establishments -- except those belonging to the Zionist entity -- be hit. [passage omitted] [Shuqayr] But you will in the end clash with Syria, on the grounds that it will support legitimacy to prevent operations after liberation? [Al-Tufayli] When I see a Zionist target, I will hit it. And if the price for that is my martyrdom, so be it. I will not cause any problem with anyone. I have caused a problem for myself. I have never fought against the Lebanese Army or the Syrian Army. I fought against the Jews and patiently withstood the results. [Shuqayr] Is that a personal opinion, or does it represent Hizballah's position? [Al-Tufayli] True, these are personal views. [Shuqayr] Did you not raise this opinion in Hizballah? [Al-Tufayli] That issue should not be discussed through the media. [passage omitted]
