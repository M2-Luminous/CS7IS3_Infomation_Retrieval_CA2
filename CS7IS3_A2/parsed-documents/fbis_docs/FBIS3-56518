"When we get the timetable, we can say whether we agree to it or not," he said. "But, it shouldn't affect the final deadline of troop pullout, which we are in principle prepared to accept." The head of the Estonian delegation noted that Estonia's chief requirement is that Russian combat units should leave Tallinn. The next round of Estonian-Russian negotiations was scheduled to begin tomorrow near Moscow, but it was postponed due to Russia's top negotiator Vasili Svirin's sickness. Reinart said the new date will be set within a week. Reinart affirmed that his appointment as head of the Estonian delegation is not going to change the delegation's work. "The general direction of the talks is anyway set by the foreign minister, and we work closely together with (Estonian Foreign Minister) Juri Luik," Reinart told BNS. Reinart was appointed head of the Estonian delegation last week. He succeeded former Defense Minister Juri Luik, who was appointed Foreign Minister.
