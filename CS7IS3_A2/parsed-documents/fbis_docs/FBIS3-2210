The State Administration for Industry and Commerce has launched a trial programme to ensure the business is handled only by designated advertising companies . The programme began last Tuesday [1 March] in the Guangdong cities of Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, Foshan and Zhanjiang. The administration said the rules and regulations now prohibited the cities' media units from seeking or meeting clients for their own advertising business. Domestic and foreign enterprises in the six cities who want to put ads in magazines and newspapers or on radio and television must use government-approved advertising agencies to deal with the media. Officials with the administration said the trial in Guangdong Province was likely to pave the way for a similar programme nationwide. "It aims to give a fair chance of competition to the country's advertising companies," said one who declined to be named. At present, media units are monopolizing their own advertising trade, which is often handled by so-called circulation or advertising promotion departments, instead of by government-backed agencies. The official said overseas enterprises, including foreign advertising companies, must also consult domestic agencies about any work they require. The reason is simple, the official said, as competition heats up companies are advertising more and more. If things are left to develop uncontrolled, there will be chaos, he added. Domestic companies are also keen to use celebrities as the heavy artillery in the battle for a slice of the market. Many film, television and sports stars are lighting up commercial breaks across China. Chinese companies spent 13.4 billion yuan ($1.56 billion) on advertising last year, an incredible 13.3 billion yuan ($1.54 billion) more than 13 years ago. The figures have rocketed as stronger competition forces enterprises to seek every means possible to make their brands stand out. At the same time the government has come to realise the need to reinforce the management of the advertising market. It is still in its infancy, and while the State sanctioned specific ad agencies, anyone could still set themselves up to sell space or air time around the country. This potentially lucrative business has already attracted more than 310,000 people in terms of the employed workers around the country. China has 31,000 advertising agencies--15,000 more than at the beginning of last year.
