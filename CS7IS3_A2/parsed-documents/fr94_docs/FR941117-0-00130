(g) The FCC may waive specific distance separation requirements of paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section if the applicant submits an engineering analysis which demonstrates that terrain effects and/or operation with less effective radiated power would satisfy the applicable minimum desired to undesired signal strength ratios at the Grade B contours of the protected TV stations. For this purpose, the Grade B contour of a TV station is deemed to be a circle with a 89 kilometer (55 mile) radius, centered on the protected TV station location, and along which the median TV signal field strength is 64 dBμV/m. In any showing intended to demonstrate compliance with the minimum desired to undesired signal ratio requirements of this section, all predicted field strengths must have been determined using the UHF TV propagation curves contained in part 73 of this chapter. §22.659 Effective radiated power limits. The purpose of the rules in this section, which limit effective radiated power (ERP), is to reduce the likelihood that interference to television reception from public mobile operations on these channels will occur. The protected TV station locations specified in this section are the locations of record as of September 1974, and these do not change even though the TV stations may have been subsequently relocated. (a) Maximum ERP. The ERP of base transmitters must not exceed 100 Watts under any circumstances. The ERP of mobile transmitters must not exceed 60 Watts under any circumstances. (b) Co-channel protection from base transmitters. The ERP of base transmitters in the New York-Northeastern New Jersey urban area must not exceed the limits in the tables referenced in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section. The limits depend upon the height above average terrain of the base transmitter antenna and the distance between the base transmitter and the nearest protected TV station location in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. (1) The protected TV station locations are as follows: ␣ 1Base transmitter frequency range 1Protected TV station location 470&hyph;476 MHz Washington, DC 38 ○57 ’17 ’ ’ 77 ○00 ’17 ’ ’. 476&hyph;482 MHz Lancaster, PA 40 ○15 ’45 ’ ’ 76 ○27 ’49 ’ ’. (2) Tables E&hyph;8 and E&hyph;9 of this section apply to base transmitters in the New York-Northeastern New Jersey urban area that transmit on channels in the 476&hyph;482 MHz range.
