FR940630-1-00012 FR940630-1-00004 Discussion of Specific Rules Section 1.412(c)(6), if added as proposed, would reflect that the United States Receiving Office, where it is not a competent Receiving Office under PCT Rule 19.1 or 19.2, could transmit the international application to the International Bureau for processing in its capacity as a Receiving Office. Section 1.421(a), if amended as proposed, would clarify that applications filed by applicants who are not residents or nationals of the United States, but who are residents or nationals of a PCT Contracting state or who indicate no residence or nationality, will, upon timely payment of the proper fee, have their application forwarded to the International Bureau for processing in its capacity as a Receiving Office. Section 1.445(a)(5), if added as proposed, would establish a fee equivalent to the transmittal fee in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for transmittal of an international application to the International Bureau for processing in its capacity as a Receiving Office. Section 10.9, if amended as proposed, would add a new provision to be consistent with the change to PCT Rule 90.1, clarifying that an attorney or agent having the right to act before the International Bureau when acting as Receiving Office may represent the applicant before the U.S. International Searching Authority or the U.S. International Preliminary Examining Authority. An individual who has the right to practice before the International Bureau when acting as Receiving Office, and who is not registered under §10.6, may not prosecute patent applications in the national stage in the Office. Other Considerations The proposed rule changes are in conformity with the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., Executive Order 12612, and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for the purposes of E.O. 12866. The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration, that the proposed rule changes will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities (Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b)), because the proposed rules would affect only a small number of international applications and would provide more streamlined and simplified procedures for filing and prosecuting international applications under the PCT. The Patent and Trademark Office has also determined that this notice has no federalism implications affecting the relationship between the National government and the States as outlined in Executive Order 12612. These rule changes will not impose any additional burden under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. The paperwork burden imposed by adherence to the PCT is currently approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 0651&hyph;0021.
