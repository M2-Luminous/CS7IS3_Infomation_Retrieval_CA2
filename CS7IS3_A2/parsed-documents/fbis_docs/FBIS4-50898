The management personnel who work in these enterprises -- including the Chinese management personnel hired by the enterprises -- are not state work personnel who discharge public duties according to the law, so when they embezzle enterprise property their actions do not meet the important conditions of subject or object regarding the crime of corruption, as stipulated in the current criminal law, even though their behavior may correspond to the features of corruption. Therefore, in the process of judicial practice, it is difficult to mete out punishment on corruption charges. Some investors in solely foreign-funded enterprises in Shanghai have called for the perfection of legislation, prompt handling of the embezzlement of "private" and solely owned enterprises' property, and protection of the legitimate rights and interests of investors. In light of this situation, I have interviewed Ni Hongfu, Shanghai's chief procurator. Number of Cases of Embezzlement of Enterprise Assets Increases [subhead] According to reports, more and more foreign businessmen have established enterprises in Shanghai. Up to the end of last year, registration approvals had been granted to 6,939 foreign-funded enterprises, of which 774 are solely funded by foreign businessmen, and these sole enterprises have invested $2.244 billion in Shanghai. At the same time foreign-funded enterprises were developing in Shanghai, there emerged some cases of law-breaking, in which some personnel who managed money and materials in these enterprises abused their positions to embezzle enterprise property. According to statistics, Shanghai's procuratorial organs have received 14 complaints, and the tendency is on the rise. Ni Hongfu said that the main features of these complaints are: Management personnel in solely foreign-funded enterprises abuse their positions to steal and sell property belonging to enterprise owners, illegally embezzle the money and property of enterprise owners, transfer enterprise funds to make personal investments, or use enterprise funds to speculate on the stock market. Legal Protection Is Urgently Needed [subhead] He said frankly that there is a question of which law is applicable to the handling of these embezzlement cases. These cases, which have emerged in enterprises solely funded by foreign businessmen, are new conditions and new problems emerging since the reform and opening up. According to Ni Hongfu, the current criminal law was promulgated in 1979, and was drafted under the highly centralized planned-economy system of that time, so it would be impossible to have clear stipulations concerning criminal activities in which internal personnel embezzle private property of enterprises solely funded by foreign businessmen. However, whether the legitimate rights and interests of the solely foreign-funded enterprises can be protected has a bearing on the legal environment for foreign businessmen coming to invest in Shanghai. Therefore, these embezzlement cases also have caused great concern in procuratorial organs. Not long ago, the municipal procuratorate and the municipal society of legal studies held a joint seminar on the protection of the lawful property of foreign-funded enterprises, and leaders from the municipality's public security department, procuratorate, and law courts, as well as well-known legal experts and scholars carried out thorough discussions on the application of the law to deal with this kind of embezzlement case. He disclosed that the participants in the seminar had reached a consensus that protecting the legitimate rights and interests of foreign-funded enterprises is the demand of our country's "Constitution" and of the "Law on Protection of Foreign-Funded Enterprises," and that the embezzlement cases occurring in solely foreign-funded enterprises already have infringed on the lawful property ownership of citizens and foreign businessmen protected by law in our country, and have done obvious harm to society. At a time when calls are made for strengthening legislation and perfecting the relevant criminal rules and regulations, it is necessary to actively cite the crimes already prescribed by the current laws so as to mete out punishment. Regarding criminal activities that indeed cannot be punished by directly citing the crimes prescribed by the current laws, Article 79 of the Criminal Law can be cited for purposes of deduction so as to mete out punishment. Judicial organs must coordinate efforts and enthusiastically handle and investigate criminal activities in which personnel abuse their positions to embezzle the lawful property of foreign-funded enterprises. They must steadily, precisely, and harshly hit those who infringe on the rights and interests of these enterprises. It Is Effective To Punish According to Criminal Law Ni Hongfu briefed the reporter on the example of a case in which a crime prescribed by the current criminal law was cited to handle and crack down on embezzlement. The Minnesota Mining Industrial Company Limited, an American company, has established a solely-owned 3M Company Limited in Shanghai. Its manager complained that one of his employees, Zhou Yu, while serving as a warehouse assistant, used the method of dispatching amounts of goods which were larger than the amounts he recorded in the delivery record, thereby stealing 600,000 yuan of telecommunications equipment from the warehouse which he later sold. Initially, the public security organ thought that Zhou abused his position to embezzle, so the procuratorate should handle the case as a corruption crime, but the procuratorial organ thought that to have a corruption case, the stolen goods must be public property, whereas the 3M Company is a solely foreign-funded enterprise, so it was difficult to handle the case as a corruption crime. After the seminar on protection of the lawful property of foreign-funded enterprises, the public security organ and the procuratorial organ reached a consensus, according to which Zhou's behavior met the theft crime prescribed by the current criminal law, and the current criminal law can be cited directly in order to punish him. The municipal sub-procuratorate then prosecuted him on a charge of theft, and the municipal intermediate court conducted the preliminary hearing in late March, sentencing Zhou to death, with a two-year suspension. In conclusion, Ni said that the procuratorial organs will take active measures to handle and crack down on embezzlement in foreign-funded enterprises, and will spare no effort to optimize the legal system environment and protect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign businessmen according to the law.
