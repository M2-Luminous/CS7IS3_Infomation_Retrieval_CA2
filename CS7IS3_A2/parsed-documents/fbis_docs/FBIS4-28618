The purpose of sanctions is to attain a certain "strategic goal" by controlling commodities trade between states and blocking the flow of capital. Discussion of sanctions against North Korea that the UN Security Council undertook on a full scale this week is to pursue the same strategy. Its strategic goal is to work out measures to ascertain North Korea's nuclear transparency. The question is whether economic sanctions have practical effects or not, in other words, whether one can achieve the strategic goal of the sanctions, namely "making the leaders of the Pyongyang regime give in." In the event that measures to implement sanctions against North Korea are finalized in the UN Security Council, sanctions by the international community, including the discontinuation of trade of weapons and other commodities and blockade of the flow of various capital, will be implemented. Nevertheless, it is not clear whether North Korea will give in to such sanctions and allow the "nuclear inspection" demanded by the international community. We remember a historical fact that the state power traditionally uses outside pressure as a means for consolidating unity of the people at home. This holds more true for dictatorial states. In view of this, the Pyongyang regime may shift the pains it will suffer from pressure of the international community onto the powerless North Korean people and may implement policies for its own survival. Needless today, the effects of sanctions against North Korea will not end only in the "North Korean people." In other words, there is a great possibility that such pains will be extended to South Korea. The negative impact of sanctions will be felt by the common people in South Korea more seriously than by the rulers. Even at the initial stage of discussions of sanctions at the United Nations, the price of "ROK stocks" already showed an indication of uneasiness in the international financial markets. When the sanctions are actually implemented, our business firms have to bear economic pains. Needless to say, such pains will extend to the common people in the ROK. No one can be optimistic about the extent of the damages. The processing-on-commission-trade between the North and the South, though it is still negligible, will be suspended, and external credit rating of business firms will be lowered. As a result, export-import activities will be drastically reduced. Even if one makes the North Korean regime surrender through sanctions, the actual damages the people in the North and the South may suffer will not be compensated.
