"This is the basis for continuing reform, an end to the crisis through economic restructuring and creating conditions for economic, political and social stabilisation", Chernomyrdin said. "We see no ground and no possibility for radical changes in the course we are pursuing. The government will take guidance from the programme adopted last August and approved by the president. We shall stick to this programme and implement it no matter how difficult it may be," Chernomyrdin said in the meeting with ministers, leaders of state committees and other federal executive bodies, parliament chamber speakers, faction leaders and heads of local governments, as well as the leaders of interregional associations and public organisations, which is being held in the Kremlin to discuss the state and prospects for the development of the Russian national economy and road safety law," Chernomyrdin said. The Russian Government is satisfied with neither the speed nor intensivity of reforms, nor is it satisfied with the quality of the work being done by management bodies on all levels, from the federal to the local. The government in full shares the president's alarm and the society's worries about the country's economic position, Viktor Chernomyrdin stressed. However, he noted, there are no foundations for the drawing of hasty conclusions that a catastrophe is iminent or that reforms have stopped and it is necessary to turn back to 1992 in order to "renew" radical restructuring. It is permissible and necessary to argue about what has and has not been done and why. But it is not permissible to overlook the obvious: a market economy already exists in Russia. Now, the premier considers, the country needs to move on, taking into account the fundamental differences in the economic and political situation which has formed at the beginning of 1994, and paying attention to the lessons contained in the government's mistakes and programmes. Summing up the year 1993, Chernomyrdin noted that the country was able to undertake significant steps towards the furthering of reforms despite the difficult internal political situation. The reasonably strict financial and monetary policy made it possible to control, and towards the end of the year, seriously lower the rate of inflation. Privatisation was carried out dynamically, and additional measures were taken to liberalize Russia's foreign economic activities. Nevertheless, the country's economic situation remains alarming. The decline in industrial production grew towards the end of the year. We have stepped right up to the line, beyond which lies the irreversible destruction of our scientific and technical potential. The country's external economic position likewise remains tense. The problem of non-payments has again became more acute. According to Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia's budget was not able to fully pay for the goods produced for government needs or for several other obligations, including the payment of salaries in the budget sphere. Instead of searching for additional ways to strengthen the income base and rationalize expenses, "emergency" measures were undertaken. Talk about the destructive effects of nonpayments on the financial status of enterprises, the budget, and the country as a whole has been going on for more than a year. In the end, there is still no full and operational account of mutual debts in the national economy. This problem is undoubtedly very complex, but, the premier stressed, at times the impression is produced that neither the Finance Ministry, the Economics Ministry, the State Property Committee, nor the Central Bank of Russia wants to deal with the issue. In the meantime, the situation is getting more complex every day. Speaking about the trade ministries and departments, Viktor Chernomyrdin emphasized that it sometimes seems that their main goal is to wring more money and privileges for their enterprises, as though state policy and the government's realistic capabilities do not concern them. Last fall, an action plan was adopted for the implementation of the first stage of the government programme. An analysis of the plan showed that of 88 assignments, only one half were actually carried out. Principally important decisions have not been put into practice, such as decisions on agricultural co-operative societies, on the develepment of agricultural loans and insurance, and the practical use of mortgages. Viktor Chernomyrdin expressed his opinion that ministry and department heads must look at the economy as a whole and carry out truly national policies. However, he stressed, far from all of these heads have been able to withstand the pressure from special interest lobbies, especially when these attacks were accompanied by a lot of noise, which contained political implications as well. In what kind of state, the premier asked rhetorically, are possible instances where electricity is turned off not only for television programmes, but even for civil flight monitoring. "democracy or no democracy, we will react to such things in the future very severely", Viktor Chernomyrdin noted. The premier expressed his confidence that it is impossible to carry out reforms looking at the country and the people from the top down, without explaining anything or asking for the agreement of those, for whose sake the government is working. Summarizing not only 1993, but the past two years connected with reforms, Viktor Chernomyrdin emphasized that, "it is necessary for us to first of all look at the new problems which the Russian economy is facing today". First of all, he noted, there is a new situation regarding prices. Internal prices for the majority of goods and services (excluding energy sources), have approached world levels. This, on the one hand, has contributed to the saturation of the market, the unhindered establishment of new economic ties, and the development of trade and normal market relations. But, on the other hand, more and more enterprises have been exposed as unprofitable, ineffective, and incompetitive. Second, the reasonably strict financial and monetary-credit policy has nevertheless brought certain benefits, although it was not able to stop inflation. The inflation rate, if one does not count january 1994, has noticeably decreased. It will be no more than 13-15 per cent in february, meaning, it will remain on the same level as the November-December, 1994 period. However, Viktor Chernomyrdin pointed out, the government is worried by the asymmetric reactions of the national economy to strict monetary policies: on the one hand, the increase in the money supply gives inflation a strong push, but, notwithstanding expectations, has not led to the stabilisation of production, and holds back the much-needed proccesses of essential restructuring in the production sphere. At the same time, he noted, the lowering of the rate of increase of the money supply, without significantly effecting the level of prices, causes a sharp fall in production and increases enterprises' financial problems. This in particular is the result we have gotten from the tight control held over the money supply in the June-October, 1993 period. Third, the premier said, the production decline in 1993 and the first months of this year has turned out to be more than was expected. Effectiveness is falling, we are faced with the threat of massive unemployment and the reduction of the means of production. In several sectors, the current level of production is no more than 50 per cent of the january, 1990 level. The crisis has reached not only those sectors for which a large decline in production was predicted, but also those who produce competitve goods. In such conditions, the premier pointed out, it is obvious that the question goes deeper than the "more money, less money" level. Without a fairly strict financial and monetary policy, it will be impossible to do anything. While we will not at all costs weaken efforts in the sphere of financial stabilisation, Viktor Chernomyrdin noted, we must act on the other aspects of russia's economic life no less decisively. The answer, according to the government's opinion, lies in the solution of the following tasks: the strengthening of state power and the introduction of order into all areas of the economy and social life; the implementation of a balanced, reasonably strict financial policy; the decisive activation of the structural investment policy; significant changes in privatisation policy to aim it at not just transferring state property, but at improving the effectivene of production, at stimulating investments, and at the activation of basic restructuring; the use of all possibilities for the strengtheningof social policy to make reforms answer the people's needs and to neutralize the basic sources of dissatisfaction among the people; the consolidation of all the healthy forces in society to resolve the tasks of the new stage in refroms and to achieve national accord on that platform. A special concern of the government remains the strengthening of the legal guarantees of market reforms, in connection with which the Cabinet of Ministers has sent the State Duma more than 60 bills. Turning to the problems faced by the agricultulral sector, the prime minister admitted that, "subsidies to agricultural producers are necessary, but now they are a burden on the budget and often ineffective". At the same time, he emphasized that agricultural subsidies create a threat to the other sectors of the economy. Viktor Chernomyrdin refuted press reports alleging that he is planning to give the farmers 34 trillion roubles in credits. "There is no such plan, and there will not be", he announced. Support of the agrarian sector will remain at the same level in 1994 as it was at in 1993, and money will be handed out only when results are guaranteed and the purpose is completely clear, the head of the Cabinet of Ministers assured. Then Chernomyrdin turned to the tasks which demand solutions in the next two or three months. The most important is the "creation of a mechanism for the resolution of the mutual non-payments problem in the national economy". Several means of battling this problem were named, including the compulsive registration and calculation of all the accounts of a given enterprise, including its foreign accounts, and stricter administrative and financial responsibility for the concealment of income sources. The introduction of a practical bankruptcy mechanism for those enterprises which cannot pay their debts is also envisaged. The premier expressed his opinion that the economic situation requires "the decisive strengthening of the effectiveness of financial policy: we cannot afford the luxury of living a second year without an approved budget". As work on the draft budget for 1994 is being wrapped up, the main task remains that of not allowing the budget deficit to grow. However, Viktor Chernomyrdin named a different figure approximating inflation at the end of the year than President Yeltsin did in his introductory address. While Boris Yeltsin named an orientation figure of 5 per cent, the premier brought forward 7-9 per cent. In doing so, Viktor Chernomyrdin hedged his words by saying that the government intends to conduct an active search for reserves, "which would allow us to consistently approach the 3-5 orientation figure for inflation at the end of the year, which was mentioned in the president's address". Financial stabilisation is impossible to achieve without an effective tax system, the speaker declared. Among its top priority jobs, the government is bent on simplifying and organizing the tax collection procedure, refusing enterprises and districts in their requests for individual privileges, and strengthening the tax collection service. At the same time as these measures are being carried out, the tax regulations will be perfected. Reporting that the federal budget in 1993 did not recieve 7.5 trillion roubles, or about 30 per cent of the income which it had forecast for itself, Chernomyrdin demanded that the internal revenue personnel, which number 135 thousand, improve the effectiveness of their work. Viktor Chernomyrdin paid special attention to the fundamental reorganization of mutual budget relations between the center and the regions. At the base of the new system of budget federalism will lie common rules on the allocation of state expenditure and income between the federal budget and the budgets of the Russian Federation's many component parts. The main principles and purposes of the budget relations reform were defined in the president's state-of-the-federation address and his order from December 23, 1993. The 1994 budget will be based on the actual state of affairs. "Our choice is fairly limited", the premier noted, "if we let inflation have its head, we will end up in a spiral fall which we will not be able to get out of. If we stop production, we will end up with a seething country, collapse, and chaos. Today's most important question is to walk literally along the edge of a razor, without falling to one side or the other". Structural investment policy was named as one of the priorities of economic reform. Chernomyrdin noted that the government is going to adopt a radical re-allocation of budget means, increasing the amount of government investments. They should amount to three per cent of the gross national product. Three-quarters of the over-all budget means ear-marked for capital investments are proposed to transfer to the financing of the construction of federally-important projects envisaged in current government programmes. Taking this into account, the government is correcting its investment programme for 1994. Of the 86 federal programmes which have already been approved and presented to the government, about 40 will be implemented. The mechanism of extending subsidies and credits is also being reviewed. Their share as a percentage of all budget allocations will be lowered from 9 per cent to 7.4 per cent. The government is beginning to get tough on ineffective businesses, many of which will have to be shut down. Along with these steps, the government will assist the implementation of large-scale investment projects which have importance for the future of the Russian economy and are being carried out with the help of foreign capital. According to Chernomyrdin, government money will bring the most profit if it is allocated on a commercial basis through banks and other financial institutions. The government head urged entrepreneurs, bankers, and the heads of large joint stock companies to increase their participation in investment projects and attract more capital to the Russian market. Chernomyrdin called privatization one of the most important methods of fundamentally restructuring the economy. He noted that the voucher privatization programme must be finished by the first of July. A new stage in the government's privatization policy is due to begin in the second half of this year. Its basic form will be commercial and investment competitions with strict regulations which are to ensure the reorganization and restructuring of enterprises and the inflow of investments, including from abroad. In 1994 privatization should become a sort of locomotive of reforms on the local level. Viktor Chernomyrdin called social policy the weakest part of the government's work. The government has recently been working hard on the formation of a more active social policy. First of all, direct aid to the needy will be increased and and the financial base of the corresponding funds will be reinforced. From April first, the amount paid out in existing pensions will be recalculated. The next step will be a new pension law, the draft of which will be presented for discussion to the Federal Assembly. Speaking about the gradual restoration of citizens' savings, Viktor Chernomyrdin stressed that this will be done first of all for veterans. Part of their savings will be restored by the transfer of pieces of state property, such as stocks in state enterprises or land. The premier judged that unemployment has begun to make itself felt. Open unemployment is still not very large, but already almost four million people are being forced to work on a part-time basis. He said it is now necessary to think about the organization of social projects, such as the construction of living accomodations, roads, bridges, and other socially important things. Touching upon the question of the activation of income policy, Chernomyrdin stressed, "we are going to begin a stricter progressive tax policy on high and extra-high incomes, require the declaration of incomes when making large purchases, and change the real estate tax policy". The regulations concerning enterprises' expenditure on wages are also changing, he said. One more step will be the introduction by the government of an official minimum living standard, to which will be tied the minimal wage and minimal pensions. Chernomyrdin called the sharp increase in housing a nation-wide task. He reported that the government has already adopted a packet of regulations on the development of the credit system in the housing sphere and on subsidies for the construction and purchase of living quarters. The subsidies would go to those who have been waiting in state lines for years, military personnel, and other "privileged people". Non-budget ways of financing housing construction are also to be developed. Chernomyrdin admitted that the government cannot afford to give the sciences, education, and culture all the finances from the federal budget which these spheres deserve. The science and higher education systems cannot survive without rationalising their activities, wisely redistributing their resources, and getting rid of extra organizations. The premier said the government is worried about the battle against crime. He reported that there are still very few concrete, effective measures which would decrease the tension around the growing threats to society and peoples' safety. The government is determined to undertake severe steps towards freeing state structures from the influence of mafia elements, organized crime, and corrupt people, no matter what position the suspect holds. As far as the political aspects of Russian society's life go, Chernomyrdin expressed his hope that the political amnesty will "all the same become a step towards reconciliation and not towards a new round of confrontation and destabilization". "The president and government will act as sure guarantors so that events do not take such a turn", the prime minister announced. Chernomyrdin sharply condemned exaggerated rumours about his presidential aspirations. "I am not one of those handymen who are ready to go right from manager to minister and then to president", he said. He considers it "unethical to carry on any conversations on the presidential theme while the current president is still functioning". In his conclusion, Viktor Chernomyrdin called for all the branches of power to reach an agreement, which would be helped by the new constitution and the basic conceptions of national security as expressed in the president's address. Russia has a parliament and a government, and it has, finally, the general desire of its peoples to restore their country to its status as a great, powerful, and prosperous state, the head of the Cabinet of Ministers emphasized.
