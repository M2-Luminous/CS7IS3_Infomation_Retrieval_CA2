Today he is regarded as a kind of "spiritual father" to the Brazilian Analysis and Planning Center (Cebrap), an organization that he helped establish along with a group of "progressive" scientists and intellectuals in 1969. Fernando Henrique headed Cebrap until 1982, when he resigned to fill a vacancy in the Senate (he was Franco Montoro's alternate, and Montoro was elected state governor in that year). His wife, anthropologist and retired USP [University of Sao Paulo] professor Ruth Cardoso, is still one of Cebrap's coordinators. As Cebrap's president, Fernando Henrique was threatened with imprisonment and torture. He was helped during that period by Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns, Archbishop of Sao Paulo, and the two of them are still close friends today. "They even threw bombs into the organization's offices," the cardinal recalls. "I went to defend him and was very happy to put my life in danger to save the members of that research association -- the most important in the country -- from torture." Divided support: Ruth Cardoso feels that Cebrap will respond to FHC's [Fernando Henrique Cardoso's] candidacy in the same way that it has always responded when any of its members has sought elective office. According to her, Cebrap will discuss his proposals "in a critical manner" and, as an institution, will not take a stand "either for or against." The minister does not enjoy unanimous support today among Cebrap's coordinators. He is supported by his wife and coordinators Elza Berquo, a demographer, and Jose Arthur Gianotti, a philosopher. The institution's current president, economist Francisco de Oliveira, and historian Luiz Felipe de Alencastro are voting for Lula. In the union movement, Fernando Henrique obtained support in his campaign for the Senate in 1978 from Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva (PT [Workers Party]), the man who took him to the factory gates back then to win the workers' support and who is now his opponent. "The minister needed votes badly," recalls Djalma Bom, a former director of the Sao Bernardo Metalworkers Union and former PT deputy who was one of the top comrades leading the historic strikes in Sao Paulo's ABC region. "He was out of his element. He was always quiet, watching and observing. The ordinary workers thought he was strange and would ask: `What in the hell kind of candidate is that who comes here and doesn't say anything?' But we got a lot of votes. If he had been bolder, he would not have lost the election," says Djalma Bom. Fernando Henrique received 1.2 million votes and became Franco Montoro's alternate. Atheist: His second electoral experience was a disaster. In 1985, when he was running for mayor of Sao Paulo on the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] ticket, he lost the election to Janio Quadros after being branded an "atheist" because he refused during a televised debate to give a straight answer when asked whether he believed in God. While the votes were still being counted -- he was ahead at the time -- he even sat down in the mayor's seat to be photographed and then had to face a humiliating defeat. After the military coup in 1964, Fernando Henrique, along with such intellectuals as Florestan Fernandes and Mario Schenberg, was indicted in a Military Police Investigation. He was teaching at the University of Sao Paul (USP) at the time. He was retired from his post as university professor and immediately went into exile in Argentina, Chile, and France. He returned to Brazil in 1967 and went back to the USP. His political rights were taken away again in 1969 for political reasons on the basis of AI [Institutional Act] No. 5. After being considered for the post of minister of foreign affairs in the Collor administration, he was named to that office during Itamar Franco's administration in October 1992. He has been at the Ministry of Finance since May of last year.
