Churkin informed Milosevic about the results of the recent ministerial talks in Geneva on the resolution of the conflict in the Balkans. After the talks with Milosevic, which lasted for 90 minutes, Churkin said in a statement to reporters that he has come to Belgrade after a very important ministerial meeting in Geneva, "where we set the framework for what is -- I hope -- the completion of the process to resolve the conflict in Bosnia." Churkin said that the participants of the Geneva talks are in contact "with all sides" to explain the possible effects and the essence of the decisions taken in Geneva. In that context he recalled that he has already held talks with Bosnian Muslim Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, but did not specify what response he received from him. He did, however, stress that "President Milosevic and Belgrade fully support the Geneva decisions on the ending of hostilities in Bosnia." What after Geneva? The Russian envoy said that he will recommend to Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary general's special envoy for Yugoslavia, that talks be arranged between the parties to the Bosnian conflict as soon as possible to try to achieve at least one target of the Geneva agreement-- an end to hostilities.
