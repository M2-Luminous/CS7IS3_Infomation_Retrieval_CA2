That pressure is being manifested in many ways. In one, Israel wants Jordan to sign a peace treaty without settling the thorny issues of land, water and refugees. Unless our borders with Israel and Palestine are demarcated and fixed there cannot be progress; and unless the issues of water and refugees are solved to the satisfaction of all parties no peace treaty can stand the test of time. Palestinian refugees in Jordan, who number no less than 30 per cent of the population, will turn into a destabilising factor to the country's security unless and until their plight is solved once and for all. As far as water is concerned, Jordan's population, which is growing at about three per cent annually, is already running short of it but due mainly to the uneven sharing of the water resources with Israel. In another way, the U.S., which seems to be all the time going along with whatever policies Israel advocates, is putting pressure on Jordan on at least two fronts. The first is the naval blockade against al-'Aqabah, and the second is in the realm of Jordan-Arab relations. On the first count, Jordan can only see the blockade as a punishment for Jordan's position during the Gulf crisis. Since only al-'Aqabah-bound traffic in the whole of the Near East and the East Mediterranean region is being checked, the U.S. cannot continue to claim that it is merely enforcing the regime of sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council against Iraq. Jordan is right to ask whether the same is being applied to goods destined to Iraq through Syria, Turkey or Iran. The blockade against al-'Aqabah can only be interpreted as a cruel tool of pressure on Jordan mandated by Israel and implemented, with arrogance, by the U.S. and its erstwhile allies in the Gulf war. On the Arab front, Jordan cannot understand why it is being boycotted by other Arab states in the region, especially Saudi Arabia. Jordan has proven it had nothing to do with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. its position on foreign intervention in the crisis has been vindicated. Some Arab members of the 30-nation U.S.-led coalition that fought against Iraq are admitting that the whole treatment of the conflict was a sham. Perhaps because the Saudi leadership knows very well that the Saudi people themselves were against foreign intervention, King Fahd has decided not to "forgive" Jordan for pointing to that since the very beginning of the crisis. The prime minister, Dr. 'Abd al-Salam al-Majali, said recently that the West was not contributing as much as it could to Jordan's attempts to mend fences with the Saudis. Well, if the U.S. truly cannot help that cause, Washington can at least show goodwill by lifting the al-'Aqabah siege right away. Good intentions by the Americans, translated into a practical gesture this time, will not only help boost U.S. standing among Jordanians. it will also serve America's best interests in the region.
