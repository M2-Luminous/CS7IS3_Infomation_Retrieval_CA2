The Luxembourg-based institution believes that the EU's flagship research programme has problems with its managerial approach, could be more innovative technologically and is too closely wedded to the concept of pre-competitive research. The report also points to a lack of speed and an insensitivity to the needs of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Whilst recognising the contribution that ESPRIT has made to the information technology industry in Europe, it feels that some of the programme's internal procedures are inadequate and that this must be highlighted. The auditors' report is critical of the failure to fully exploit ESPRIT's results, pointing out that this is what, in essence, funds the programme. Attempts to redress this fundamental flaw in ESPRIT III, by means of "targeted projects," do not go far enough, the report claims. The EU's financial watchdogs are concerned about the lack of continuity between the pre-competitive research level and the point at which results are used. The Court points out that the Commission is willing to devote significant resources to market-led activities such as technology transfer, etc, when they are clearly separate from research, but are unwilling to do the same when it is a matter of extending a research activity to a competitive level. The Court of Auditors firmly believes that the pre-competitive issue has to be looked at to prevent it from undermining the EU's research efforts. The auditors also believe that further thought must be given to the relationship between other aspects of policy, such as competition and industrial policy and research, as well as consideration of worldwide developments and the strategies of Europe's industrial rivals. Moreover, it is felt that SMEs should be better facilitated within the ESPRIT programme. Procedures for contractors are considered to be too slow and complex. Payment periods are also said to be too slow. It is suggested too that the Commission should look more closely at the selection of coordinators for leading research consortia.
