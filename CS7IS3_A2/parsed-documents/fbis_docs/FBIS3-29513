Kim Chong-il's conspicuous absence from nationwide celebrations of his 52nd birthday on Wednesday has triggered wild speculation ranging from rumors that he had been wounded in an assassination attempt to reports of his being placed on good behavior by his father. "Such speculation was probably prompted by his absence from celebrations of his own birthday," the official said. "But it has been their (North Korean) custom that Kim Chong-il doesn't show up for such occasions." The official, who declined to be identified, noted that Kim Chong-il was also absent from last year's celebration of his birthday. "As far as we know, the theory that something happened to Kim Chong-il is groundless," he added. A similar line of thought was expressed in Moscow, where most Russian officials in charge of collecting external information reacted to the reports on Kim Chong-il with incredulity. "As of this moment, we have not received any information that something has happened to Kim Chong-il," one official said. "Moreover, the report that he was gravely wounded in a shooting appears to have no foundation whatsoever," he said. The ITAR-TASS News Agency said it has contacted its Pyongyang bureau to confirm the reports but was unable to receive any information. "A reliable report is bound to come out if we wait a little longer," one official said. Meanwhile in Los Angeles, Korean-Americans who have close contacts with North Korea also said they have not heard anything untoward had happened to "the dear leader," as Kim Chong-il is commonly called in North Korea and by pro-Pyongyang ethnic Koreans abroad. [passage omitted on background] Separately, it was reported in Beijing Thursday that Kim Chong-il was placed on good behavior by his father over North Korea's nuclear policy. This report, which quoted an unidentified source in Beijing, could not be confirmed either.
