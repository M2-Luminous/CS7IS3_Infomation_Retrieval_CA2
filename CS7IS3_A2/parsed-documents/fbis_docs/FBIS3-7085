Mr Surin met Minister of State for National Rehabilitation Keat Chhon and Under-Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs Ung Sean and Pok Marina shortly after arriving here for a three-day visit. Mr Surin did not meet Foreign Minister Norodom Sirivut yesterday as planned because the prince had left suddenly for Beijing on Tuesday to brief King Norodom Sihanouk on the situation in Pailin, a diplomatic source said. But Prince Sirivut is expected back in Phnom Penh today and the two may still meet here before the prince pays a visit to Bangkok next week. The Khmer Rouge yesterday said Pailin remained under their control. Mr Surin stressed to those he did meet here yesterday that the refugee situation at the Thai-Cambodian border is now under control. He maintained there is no need to call for international help since Cambodia now has a government that could look after its own people. Mr Surin on Tuesday inspected the border village of Ban Pakkad where an estimated 25,000 Cambodians fleeing from fighting in nearby Pailin have sought refuge. Mr Surin reiterated Thailand's readiness to discuss with the Cambodian Government overlapping claims in the Gulf of Thailand before launching any joint development projects. "If they are ready to talk, we're ready. It would be good if (they) have a delegation to Bangkok as quickly as possibly to begin the discussion," he said. "The same message will be given to Prince Sirivut when he visits Bangkok on Monday," Mr Surin said. Mr Surin said he noted during yesterday's discussions that Thailand would like to discuss fishery issues in a separate forum. He also requested an extension of the March 31 deadline set for the transport of felled logs and mining equipment from Cambodia to Thailand. "Because of the fighting, the removal is very difficult. We hope Cambodia will reconsider the deadline and hope the issue will be discussed when Prince Sirivut comes to Thailand," Mr Surin said.
