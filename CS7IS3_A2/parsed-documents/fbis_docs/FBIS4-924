The decision of the Central Committee was further made conditional upon the final formulations for provisions for the existence of the Zulu Kingdom and the role of His Majesty being agreed to through mediation. In a series of meetings which took place on Sunday, Monday and today final agreement was reached securing the Kingdom of KwaZulu and the role of His Majesty. I therefore am pleased to announce that the Inkatha Freedom Party will contest elections at the national and the provincial levels. The entry of the IFP into national and regional levels will be made possible by suitable amendments to ballot papers and there will be certain relaxations to the procedures laid down for the registration of parties and the publication of electoral lists. I am pleased to announce that the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] and the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] have promised their full co-operation to make the IFP's entry into elections possible. The Inkatha Freedom Party has decided to make the kind of compromises which will make its entry into elections possible in order to avoid a great deal more bloodshed and carnage which we have been witness to in recent months. Only the IFP held firm to principles right until the very last moment and did everything in its power to eliminate the very worst elements of the 1993 constitution. The best in the constitution can be attributed to the IFP's interventions and the long struggle it waged to ensure that the country benefited from a constitution which will lay the foundations for a democratic future. Central to the IFP's concerns were the need to ensure viable regional government with the minimum interference by the state. It is to this end that the IFP finally managed to negotiate a secure role for His Majesty the king of the Zulu nation and the guarantee of the future existence of the Zulu Kingdom. In securing these things the IFP has guaranteed that provincialism in the kwaZulu-Natal province will set standards which other provinces will be encouraged to adopt in their own search for their provincial constitutional futures. The IFP had previously succeeded in securing amendments to the 1993 constitution which will enable provinces to adopt constitutions of their own choice. The IFP also secured the right of provinces to adopt constitutions which will not be confined by the structures laid down for provinces in the 1993 constitution. The IFP's negotiation victory in securing the role of His Majesty the king of the Zulu nation and the continued existence of the Kingdom of kwaZulu is therefore a victory for the principle of self- determination from which the whole country will benefit. I wish to convey my deep gratitude to Professor Washington Okumu for the role he played in making it possible to reach the agreement which will result in the IFP entering elections. He was an additional appointment as adviser to the international mediating team and remained on in South Africa when the other mediators left for their various international destinations. It was his personal intervention which made the final negotiation breakthrough possible. When my spirits were down after the international mediation had been aborted, and I was leaving Johannesburg for Ulundi on Friday, April 15, I received a message at the airport from Professor Washington Okumu that he wanted to meet me at the airport and would be there in 20 minutes. I have known Professor Okumu for more than 20 years having met him at a prayer breakfast in Washington and we have kept in touch on the basis of Christian fellowship. I waited at Lanseria Airport for as long as I could on the morning of April 15th for Professor Okumu but as two of my colleagues had an appointment with His Majesty the king I had to leave. However, the aircraft has been air-borne for only a few minutes when I was told there was a problem and we had to turn back. Fortunately Professor Okumu was still there and I said that it was as though God has prevented me from leaving, and I was there like Jonah brought back. I told Professor Okumu that my forced return was a God-send. He insisted that everything should be done to try and see if lost mediation could be retrieved and that I should do everything I could to negotiate even at this late hour the IFP's participation in elections. I shared with Professor Okumu the IFP's problems--the fact that the IFP took a decision not to participate because of its serious concerns regarding His Majesty the king which had not been met, and that I could not disregard that. If I did so, I would be committing treason. Professor Okumu said that everything notwithstanding, he was going to see Mr Mandela, whom he has known a long time as well as President de Klerk. I had hardly arrived back in Ulundi on Friday when Professor Okumu telephoned and said he had been in touch with the government who said they were quite prepared to look at the concerns I expressed. Professor Okumu was very firm and said I should telephone the state president at 3 o'clock that afternoon. Before I did so, the state president telephoned and asked me what it was I wanted to say to him. I said that I gathered from Professor Okumu that he wanted to talk to me and I gave him the background. The state president told me that the issue of the IFP's participation was sympathetically looked at by the government. They were prepared to look at participation on a regional level but I told the state president that there was no way the IFP would participate at regional level only--the IFP had support all over South Africa. The state president said he was quite prepared to look at the possibilities. I said the only way this could be done was if the issue of His Majesty the king was addressed. The state president said a special session of Parliament could be called to effect amendments to the 1993 constitution. I reminded the state president that His Majesty said he wanted matters dealt with before elections. On Saturday Professor Okumu telephoned again. On Sunday we met in Durban where we both were attending the Jesus rally organised by Africa Enterprise. Professor Okumu gave me a draft of a proposed agreement which could be entered into between myself, the president of the ANC and the South African Government. The draft incorporated many of the answers to our needs and I gave my provisional approval to it. Professor Okumu said he was flying to Cape Town to talk to Mr Mandela. I showed the draft to Mr Jacob Zuma and Minister Danie Schutte who were also at the rally, before I put it before the Central Committee&because that is the way I exercise my leadership--referring all crucial matters to the Central Committee which is the final decision-making body between general conferences. By arrangement with the state president I met him in Pretoria yesterday the 18th April. I was pleasantly surprised to find the draft agreement had been shown to Mr Mandela who said he wanted to study it for clarification. After further negotiations the draft agreement with the necessary amendments was accepted by myself, Mr Mandela and Mr de Klerk. I wish to pay tribute to Professor Okumu. He is a really remarkable man who studied under Dr Kissinger at Harvard. I pay tribute to the shuttle diplomacy he initiated and what has been achieved through it. I wish also to pay tribute to both President FW de Klerk and Mr Mandela for the fact that they were receptive to the suggestions made to the three of us by Professor Okumu. I believe that as a result of the signing of this memorandum of understanding, South Africa may well have been saved from disastrous consequences of unimaginable proportions and has been put on a course which I hope will lead to longlasting peace, democracy and meaningful federalism.
