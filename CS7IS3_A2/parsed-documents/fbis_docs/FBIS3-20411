The 3d Plenary Session of the 14th National CPC Congress was held in Beijing. An important document was adopted by the plenary session. That was the "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Some Issues Concerning Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure." If it is said that the reform is aimed at building a grand mansion of socialist market economy, then we may definitely say that the "decision" is the magnificent blueprint in building this mansion. For more than one month since the convocation of the 3d Plenary Session of the 14th National CPC Congress, many people at home and abroad are asking: How was such a magnificent blueprint and such a program of action born to help us forge ahead toward the new century? I China spends a decade to relieve its 100-year distresses and worries. The socialist market economy, something controversial which was tried out long time ago, was finally regarded as the correct orientation and written into the Party Constitution and the Constitution of the People's Republic of China after Comrade Deng Xiaoping gave his important talks during his South China tour last year and the convocation of the 14th National CPC Congress. To establish a socialist market economic structure has become a arduous task assigned to all CPC party members and all the people in China by the history and the times. After the 14th National CPC Congress put forward the general task and principle in establishing the new system, people earnestly hope to have the following questions answered: What does the socialist market economic structure look like after all? How can we establish such a structure? What kind of magnificent scene will prevail in China after the establishment of the socialist market economy? We should and must answer these questions. This is the trend of the times... People have heard a great deal about the saying that, "Cross the river by feeling the rocks." During the early stage of the reform, we were not even clear about the targets and focal points of the reform, the internal relations among all the sectors of the economic system, the complexity and the risks of the reform program and the difficult points in carrying out reform. We need to watch each step when we move forward. By relying on this kind of ideological guidance of boldly exploring things and carrying out practice, we have accumulated a great deal of experiences and learn many lessons after paying the necessary prices, and use them as our references in forging ahead. Right now, the internal relations among various sectors of the system and the specific target and pattern in carrying out the reform have become clearer after 15 years of efforts and practice. The focal point has become obvious and the risks and the degree of complexity can be estimated. Under this situation, there are conditions in carrying out reform, and we should have more rational guidance in observing the times and sizing up the situation. This is the voice of the people... Let us look back at the history in carrying out reform. During the past few years, we promote this reform program spontaneously from the lower level to the higher level, and develop this program consciously from the higher level to the lower level by using the experience of the former to do work in the latter. Some of the reform measures are popularized in an overall manner after they have been spontaneously and successfully carried out by the masses and reaffirmed by the leadership departments such as the contract responsibility system which links remuneration with output in rural areas, the enterprise contract responsibility system and the share-holding system. The people call for more rational guidance so that they can consciously follow such guidance. They hope that they may be able to make plans, forecast the future and pre-fulfill their targets in carrying out reform. This is something inevitable in carrying out reform... We have achieved a great deal after we worked hard to explore things for 15 years. On the one hand, the pattern with the publicly owned economic sector constituting the mainstay while various other economic sectors developing simultaneously has taken shape. and the role of the markets is rapidly expanding in the allocation of resources. A certain foundation has been laid for us so that we have the conditions to carry out the reform in an overall manner. On the other hand, progress has been insignificant in certain major realms in carrying out reform. This becomes a weak link in the entire chain of the economic structure, and affects the deepening of our reform program and the healthy development of our economy. We urgently need to carry out our reform and planning in an overall manner, paying attention to overall design, and to system and policy standardization. Our unshirkable task is to keep pace with the development of the society and the times, meet the requirements of the people, and draw up a programmatic document which will specifically guide us to further deepen our reform, open up even wider to the outside world and establish a socialist market economic structure. Just like what the report of the 14th National CPC Congress pointed out that, "To establish a socialist market economic structure involves China's economic foundation and many aspects of the superstructure. We need a series of relevant system reform and policy adjustments. We must pay full attention to working out an overall plan, and implement this plan in a planned manner and step by step." It was precisely under this background that the "Decision" arose at the historic moment. II The series of theses written by Comrade Deng Xiaoping on developing socialism with Chinese characteristics, particularly his real knowledge and deep insight reflected in his important talks which he gave during his south China tour in the spring last year, and the goal on building a socialist market economic structure explicitly put forward by the 14th National CPC Congress have pointed out the orientation in providing a solid theoretical foundation to draw up the "Decision." In May of last year, the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held a plenary session and decided to convene the 3d Plenary Session of the 14th National CPC Congress in Beijing during the second half of 1993. The main theme of the plenary session is to discuss issues on building a socialist market economic structure and work out some provisions for the development of such structure. The team for drafting the "Decision" formed by personages of all spheres was established on 31 May. General Secretary Jiang Zemin delivered an important lengthy speech at the first meeting of the drafting team, putting forward a series of requirements concerning the framework, main contents and issues to be resolved. He emphatically pointed out that in drafting this "Decision," it is necessary to regard Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guideline laid down by the report of the 14th National CPC Congress as the guiding ideology and supply a programmatic document for the establishment of a socialist market economic structure. This "Decision" is of great significance in carrying out reform and opening up to the outside world and promoting the modernization program. It involves developments in China to the end of this century and even into the next century. We must fully demonstrate a high sense of responsibility and concentrate our efforts in drafting this document, said Jiang Zemin. On the basis of General Secretary Jiang Zemin's views, the drafting team, first of all, prepared an outline of the document which contained 10 chapters and 53 articles. Soon after that the standing committee members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee listened to a briefing by the drafting team on the drafted "Decision," and agreed with the outline in principle. They asked the drafting team to begin drafting this document officially. While the drafting team began to write the manuscript of the "Decision," the CPC Central Committee organized 16 special subject investigation and study groups composed of comrades of relevant departments in various localities to tour various localities to extensively investigate and study issues concerning the establishment of a socialist market economic structure, collecting data and laying a foundation to draft the document. The drafting team and the various investigation and study groups maintained close contacts, and continuously exchanged views. They repeatedly carried out debates on each subject and gradually agreed with one another on some issues. The first, second, third, and fourth manuscripts were completed one after another. Whenever a manuscript was completed, the drafting team invariably solicited opinions from all relevant departments for study, deliberation, and revision. Comrade Jiang Zemin emphatically pointed out more than once that this document must go on advancing and developing. There must be a long-range target in carrying out reform, while we must achieve our goal in implementing this document. We must proceed from our actual situation at present and take into consideration China's reality, he said. The standing committee members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee once again listened to a briefing made by the drafting team, and studied the fifth manuscript of the "Decision" at a meeting held on 9 September. General Secretary Jiang Zemin and various comrades of the standing committee expressed their views on firmly establishing a modern enterprise system, quickening the pace in reforming the financial system, the fiscal and taxation system, the investment system and the social security system and attaching importance to work in the fields of science and technology and education. Participants of the meeting endorsed the fifth manuscript of the "Decision" in principle and asked the drafting team to revise it and make further improvements. A plenary meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee was held on 20 September at the Huairen Hall. Participants at the meeting discussed the revised sixth manuscript of the "Decision." They believed that this manuscript confirms with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and tallies with the guideline laid down by the 14th National CPC Congress, and that it had brought forth new ideas and made breakthroughs. They endorsed this manuscript in principle, and put forward their views to make further revisions. The establishment of a socialist market economic structure is a pioneering undertaking unprecedented in history. In despite of the fact that there are experiences in developing market economy, on which we may draw on, there are still many aspects that we must develop by ourselves. There is no ready-made pattern that we may copy indiscriminately. Nor is there any shortcut that we may take. We can only find out a way suited to China's actual situation by conducting investigations and studies, drawing on collective wisdom and absorbing all useful ideas and keeping on improving. In the course of drafting the "decision," the party's general secretary, standing committee members and regular members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and all staff members of the drafting team had earnestly and meticulously carried out their work with a high sense of responsibility to the party, the people and history. Jiang Zemin and other comrades presided over a total of four meetings and solicited views from various special subject investigation and study groups. The standing committee members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee also heard briefings made by various special subject investigation and study groups on financial affairs, taxation, pricing, marketing, and modern enterprise system. The Central CPC Committee held a forum of nonparty personages on 15 October, soliciting views from the responsible persons of the All China Federation of Industry and Commerce and other nonparty public figures on the draft "decision." These personages who have cooperated and worked with the Communist Party of China for a long time offered many valuable suggestions on building a socialist market economic structure and revising the draft "decision." During that period, the comrades of the standing committee of the CPC Central Committee also held a symposium of senior party members and another forum of experts in the economic field to solicit their opinions and listen to their suggestions. Moreover, the CPC Central Committee also printed and distributed copies of the sixth manuscript to various provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central government and various departments and units under the central authorities and the State Council to solicit opinions. Members and alternate members of the party's 14th Central Committee, responsible cadres of the party, government and army at the central level and responsible comrades of the party committees in various provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central government and various major military districts took part in debates and expressed their views on the "decision." While approving the draft "decision" in general, they made as many as 1,050 suggestions to make revisions. They suggested to make major revisions involving the structure and contents of the document as well as minor ones on wording and even punctuation. These suggestions fully reflect their serious attitude and lofty sense of responsibility. On the basis of the suggestions from all sectors, the drafting team once again made 270 revisions on the manuscript for solicitation of opinions, forming the seventh manuscript. The third meeting of the Political Bureau Standing Committee was held on 3 November to study the request for instructions submitted by the drafting team on several major issues concerning the revision of the draft "decision." The standing committee members earnestly carried out debates on these issues and made clear-cut decisions. In accordance with the recommendation made by this Political Bureau Standing Committee meeting, the drafting team once again made some revisions on the draft "decision." The Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held its second meeting on 6 November to study the revised "decision." The meeting endorsed this manuscript in principle and decided to refer some portions of the manuscript to the forthcoming Third Plenary Session of the 14th National CPC Congress for discussion. After extensive discussions and repeated revisions, the 17,000-odd word eighth manuscript of the "decision" was presented to the members and alternate members attending the Third Plenary Session held on 11 November. During the plenary session, the members and the alternate members once again earnestly studied and made discussions, and made nearly 100 revisions. Only then, did the final version of the "decision" take shape. For a period of five and half months, the work of drafting the "decision" was tense and arduous. The comrades of the drafting team had worked hard. Reviewing the process of drafting the "decision," we clearly see that this process is one of bringing democracy into full play and drawing on collective wisdom of the whole party. The work of drafting the "decision" was carried out under the direct collective leadership of the third generation with comrade Jiang Zemin as the core. The "decision" draws on the collective wisdom of the whole party and reflects the common will of the entire party and the people of all nationalities throughout the country. III The 3d Plenary Session of the 14th National CPC Congress adopted the "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure" at the dignified Hall of the People on 14 November. Just like a huge rock hitting the water, the "decision" has created a strong impact at home and abroad. An influential foreign press commented: "The 3d Plenary Session of the 14th National CPC Congress which adopted the "decision" is of tremendous significance. Its significance is only next to the important talks given by Deng Xiaoping during his inspection tour in South China in spring last year and the party's 14th National Congress in the fall. If these three important stages are likened to a triple jump, then the Third Plenary Session is the last jump." This document clearly portrays the basic framework of the socialist market economic structure. It is the overall plan and program of action in building our new system. It systematically works out the details of the reform targets for the development of a socialist market economic structure as put forward by the 14th National CPC Congress. It not only fully reflects Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory, thinking and viewpoints in building socialism with Chinese characteristics, but also makes new developments and breakthroughs on the basis of what was achieved at the 14th National CPC Congress. The establishment of a socialist market economic structure is a pioneering undertaking and a kind of historic exploration. What helps us to decide on reform measures and judge their advantages or disadvantages are the "three conducive's" -- whether or not these measures are conducive to developing the productive forces in a socialist society, to enhancing the overall national strength of a socialist nation and to raising the people's living standard. All our reform measures are basically aimed at emancipating and developing the productive forces to the greatest extent. All the guidelines and policies laid down by the "decision" and its point of departure and final goal are also aimed at further emancipating and developing the productive forces. It is precisely for this reason that we are able to explicitly put forward the need to "establish a modern enterprise system which meets the requirements of the market economy and in which the property rights as well as the rights and responsibilities of enterprises are clearly defined, government administration and enterprise management are separated and scientific management is established." It is precisely for this reason that we are able to clearly put forward the need to "establish a nationwide integrated and open market system to closely combine the urban market with the rural market and link the domestic market with the international market, so as to optimize the allocation of resources." It is precisely for this reason that we are able to boldly put forward the need to "transform the government functions in economic management and establish a sound macro-economic control system which chiefly relies on indirect means so as to ensure the healthy operation of the national economy." It is precisely for this reason that we are able to repeatedly stress the need to "establish an income distribution system which takes the principle of `to each according to his work' as its mainstay, gives priority to efficiency while taking fairness into account so as to encourage some localities and people to become prosperous first and adhere to the road to common prosperity." It is precisely for this reason that we are able to clearly point out the need to "establish a multi-layered social security system and provide both urban and rural people with a degree of security commensurate with China's reality so as to promote economic development and social stability." The aforementioned five aspects particularly emphasized in the "decision" constitute the main contents in developing the socialist market economic structure. If we liken the socialist market economic structure to a mansion. The aforementioned five aspects are like the five major pillars of the mansion. The foundation of the mansion is the structure of the ownership system with the publicly owned economic sector constituting the mainstay and various other economic sectors developing simultaneously. The basic aim in building this mansion is to emancipate and develop the socialist productive forces to the greatest extent. We have noted that in drawing the outline of the framework, the "decision," first of all, emphasized the principle of regarding the public-owned economic sector as the mainstay with various other economic sectors developing simultaneously. The framework of the socialist market economic structure set by the "decision" represents the organic integration of the basic socialist system with the socialist market economic structure and it is imbued with the distinctive features of China's socialism at its preliminary stage. It constitutes a major breakthrough made by the 14th National CPC Congress and an important contribution to the theory of socialism. Another breakthrough of the "decision" is to put forward the need to transform the government functions with the aim to establish a sound macroeconomic control system. Right now, more and more people have realized that a sound macroeconomic control system is a general requirement in developing the market economic structure. It is an important component part of the socialist market economic structure. Showing great foresight, the "decision" put forward the need to establish a sound macroeconomic control system and emphatically pointed out the need to "rationally delineate the powers of the central and local authorities over economic administration and bring into full play the initiative of both the central and local authorities." It is precisely on this foundation that the "decision" explicitly put forward the major reform measures to be adopted in the near future. Either in promoting the reform of the monetary and taxation system, quickening the pace to reform the financial system or deepening and accelerating the reform of the investment and planning system, the "decision" invariably tried to make breakthroughs in establishing and improving the macroeconomic control. The "decision" also rendered a brilliant exposition on developing the legal system. It pointed out that the socialist market economic structure internally includes the development of a legal system. Only in the legal form can comparatively matured and good systems be reaffirmed, and only by forming a system, can legal measures be consolidated. While trying to establish the market economic system by the end of the century, it is necessary to set up a legal system which meets the requirements in developing market economy. In carrying out all types of reform, the "decision" invariably placed emphasis on the development of the legal system. It explicitly pointed out that many reform measures must be carried out "according to law." Some people say that the "decision" is an important document in Marxist political economy. It is vast in knowledge and rich in contents. It has made not only breakthroughs and developments in the aforementioned aspects, but also new proposals of great significance in theory and in practice on socialist economic theories and policies. The "decision" put forward a new point of view that "with the fluidity and reshuffling of property rights, there are more and more economic entities with mixed ownership. This will bring forth a new structure of ownership." This point of view will become an important trend of development in China's economic realm in the future. The "decision" put forward that, "The state should create conditions for economic sectors under different kinds of ownership to compete in the market on equal terms, and should deal with the various types of enterprises without discrimination." To create conditions for competition on equal terms is an important function of the government under the conditions of market economy. It is a requirement in ensuring the healthy development of market economy and promoting system and policy standardization. With regard to the system of income distribution to individuals, the "decision" put forward the principle of giving priority to efficiency while taking fairness into account." It attached more importance to efficiency. It pointed out: "It is necessary to permit the distribution of earnings by capital and other production factors belonging to individuals." This is a requirement for all economic sectors and all forms of income distribution to develop simultaneously. With regard to the reform of the rural economic system, the "decision" put forward that the term for contracting cultivated land may be extended, the inheritance of contracts for the management of explorative undertakings and the compensated transfer of the land-use rights be allowed. The "decision" also made new breakthroughs in building small cities and townships and reforming the household registration system....[XINHUA ellipsis] Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory in building socialism with Chinese characteristics has, for the first time, systematically answered the series of questions on how to build, consolidate and develop socialism in economically and culturally backward China. With a scientific approach of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, the "decision" which was born under the guidance of this theory has scored new achievements in integrating Marxism with China's reality today, and once again demonstrated the courage and creativeness of the Chinese Communists in continuously opening up and keenly seeking advancement. It will definitely play a significant role in guiding and promoting the development of the reform and opening up program and the undertaking for socialist construction. For the past 15 years, we have scored universally acknowledged glorious achievements. During the last seven years of this century, we will preliminarily establish the socialist market economic structure. This constitutes a great pioneering undertaking unprecedented in the history of mankind, another trans-century achievement in carrying out China's reform and opening-up program and another major and profound change in the Chinese society. "Solid ice has been broken, the navigation channel open to traffic, and the road clearly pointed out." We are filled with confidence in face of the new century!
