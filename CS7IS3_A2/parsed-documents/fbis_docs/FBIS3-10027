The drug traffickers now are crossing through the town of Tres Lagoas in eastern MS on the Sao Paulo State [SP] border. As a result of an investigation of fast fortunes, Federal Police discovered a gang of Tres Lagoas farmers and businessmen. The head of the gang, Osvaldir Garcia, belongs to one the town's established families. Police received information about the drugs but could not seize the first cargo of 338 kg, which was delivered a month ago. The seized cocaine was bought in Bolivia for $2,000 per kilo and hidden in a secret compartment in the chassis of a dump truck with license plate FV-4435 from Andradina (SP). The truck, which was being towed because its engine was ruined, had been assembled in the Bolivian town of Puerto Quijarro, on the MS border. Part of the cocaine was being sent to Rio de Janeiro, where it would be sold for $7,000 per kilo, and also to Europe, where it would be sold for $40,000 per kilo. Police arrested truck driver Claudio Goncalves, 39, and tow truck driver Benedito Cardoso Filho, and are holding them at the Federal Police Superintendency in Campo Grande. Osvaldir Garcia and three other drug traffickers escaped, but their preventive arrest already has been decreed.
