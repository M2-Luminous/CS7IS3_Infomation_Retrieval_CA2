This was confirmed in time with the Hebron massacre, which revealed that the issue of settlements, which under the Oslo agreement had been postponed, should have been listed as a priority issue on the agenda. The issue of Jerusalem also emerges as a real obstacle in the UN deliberations. How do you assess the status of the Palestinian cause after what happened? ['Arafat] The Hebron massacre has confirmed that they do not want to implement what they agreed to in Oslo. This was clear when Rabin said that there are no sacrosanct deadlines. This is in addition to the influence the Israeli Army has on the political leadership. The military does not want to implement the Oslo agreement or the Gaza-Jericho First agreement as you call it. The Gaza-Jericho First agreement is part of the agreement and the agreement is an integrated one comprising a preliminary stage to be followed by a final one, and it was agreed to call it the Gaza-Jericho agreement because the Israelis are supposed to withdraw from Gaza and Jericho first. The Oslo agreement covers all the Palestinian territories that were occupied in 1967. Here, I would like to clearly point out that the Hebron massacre was not a massacre against a group of Palestinians that was committed by a Zionist settler. The Hebron massacre is a scheme in which Israeli Army units participated. This clearly resembles what our brother Algerians faced from the French Secret Army Organization [OAS] which sought to obstruct the French-Algerian agreements. As Palestinians, we now face the same situation in the occupied territories. This only shows that the extremist Zionist mentality views the Palestinian Arab presence in the occupied territories as a very serious issue. From this premise, the withdrawal of the settlers from Hebron is essential. We have reached the conclusion that Israel does not want to implement the Oslo agreement. It is not the Gaza-Jericho First agreement as you call it because the Gaza-Jericho agreement is part of a more comprehensive agreement made up of two stages; a preliminary one to be followed by a final one. First, they are supposed to withdraw from Gaza and Jericho and then from all of the occupied Palestinian territories that were occupied in 1967. [Na'na'] You referred in previous statements to the involvement of Israeli military units in the Hebron massacre. Do you mean that there are forces within the Israeli Army that do not agree with the behavior of the political leadership and that they seek to undermine this leadership's Oslo commitments? ['Arafat] Yes, the Hebron massacre is not an individual action, nor an action carried out by a psychopath, as the Israelis like to say. The Hebron massacre is part of an ongoing scheme in which Israeli Army units participate. This situation is exactly like the one our Algerian brothers had faced at the hands of the OAS prior to Algeria's independence. They sought to obstruct the French-Algerian agreements, the Evian talks, and General de Gaulle's commitments. The Palestinian people in the occupied territories are now experiencing the same situation. These forces have no interest in the establishment of peace, what interests them is to continue establishing greater Israel on Palestinian land and the land of other Arab countries. That's why we should be very alert about the developments. [Na'na'] Was the issue of settlements and the threat they pose to the peace process discussed in Oslo? Don't you think that this issue should have been a priority, the objective of which is to separate the settlers and the Palestinians in order to prevent any friction that would place mines in the road of the peace process? ['Arafat] The issue of settlements was discussed in Oslo and an agreement was reached on several points in this regard. The most important points are: First, the building of new settlements is totally prohibited. Second, the expansion of current settlements is totally prohibited. Third, the confiscation of new territories is totally prohibited. The final decision on the fate of the settlements was mentioned in the Oslo agreement. The issue of settlements will be discussed as soon as possible within a period of no more than two years. The formed committees are supposed to start work after an agreement is reached on the final stage. We formed a committee to discuss the issue of Jerusalem, a committee to discuss the issue of refugees, a committee to discuss the issue of evacuees, a committee to discuss the issue of settlements and settlers, and a committee to discuss the issue of borders. [Na'na'] If the issues contained in the Oslo agreement are so clear, then how do you explain the U.S. stand at the UN Security Council, which now rejects discussing the Jerusalem issue or referring to it as part of the occupied territories, which has led to postponing the vote on the agreement many times? ['Arafat] The Security Council is currently discussing a resolution that condemns the Hebron massacre and calls on Israel to take measures, including the confiscation of settlers' weapons to prevent them from carrying out illegitimate acts. The text of the resolution will demand measures to protect Palestinians through an international presence in the occupied territories. Herein lies the differences between the United States and us. While the United States talks about the presence of international observers in the Palestinian territories, we say that the agreement stipulates an international presence in Palestinian territories. We demand an immediate international presence in the Palestinian territories to protect our people and holy places at this difficult time. (The telephone rang and the speaker on the other end was Dennis Ross. From the course of the conversation, it seemed that there was a new negotiable offer. I heard Mr. Yasir 'Arafat say to Ross: Wait for a couple of hours and I will come after I meet with my comrades in the Executive Committee.) [Na'na'] It has been said that there is a new offer by the United States that seeks to expedite the process of withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho and expand the Jericho area in return for not discussing the issue of Jerusalem in the Security Council resolution, accepting civil observers instead of international emergency forces, and dismantling a number of settlements and evacuating about 500 settlers from Hebron. How true is this? ['Arafat] No. This was not what I just discussed with Dennis Ross. It is not currently an issue of Jericho's area, of expediting the withdrawal process, or dismantling the settlements. It is more serious than that. It is an issue of international protection for our people to make them feel safe and secure in light of this multilateral conspiracy, involving the settlers, members of the Israeli Army, and gangs which call themselves organizations such as "Kakh," "Kahane Hay," and other such racist organizations. These organizations are proven to be financed from New York, specifically Brooklyn, and are being fed with weapons, men, and money. The Israeli settlers are carrying out joint patrols with the Israeli Army. This a violation of the Oslo agreement. The Israeli Government should bridle the settlers because the continuation of the current situation will destroy the peace process at its roots. [Na'na'] Is it possible to conclude from what you are saying that you will not return to the negotiations unless effective international presence; that is, military protection, is provided for the civilians? ['Arafat] The most important thing to us now is to provide an international presence. This should take place through a resolution on which the Security Council votes so that it will be obligatory to its members and all parties concerned with the peace process. Russia and the United State -- the cosponsors of the [Madrid] conference -- are supposed to take measures to adopt a similar resolution. [Na'na'] What form of international protection do you envisage? ['Arafat] A military one, of course. Otherwise, who will protect Palestinian civilians from the armed settlers? There are international forces in southern Lebanon, on the Golan, and in Sinai. Why is it so strange to have international forces in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip? It is true that I am not asking for guns and tanks. But I am asking for international forces that are capable of protecting the civilian inhabitants from attacks by the settlers and others. [Na'na'] The Russians have returned in force to the international arena after the Hebron massacre and made several proposals, such as the need to convene a new international conference similar to the Madrid conference on the Middle East crisis. Do you believe the Russian proposals could be implemented? ['Arafat] We fully welcomed the Russian initiative. We have been in constant contact with Russia. I received many envoys and finally Foreign Minister Kozyrev. [Na'na'] What about Arab coordination. Do you expect an Arab summit in reply to what has taken place? ['Arafat] I wish an Arab summit would convene. However, this requires intensive efforts. The Arab state of affairs is difficult and complicated. I hope that as Arab leaders we can overcome the Gulf crisis so that the new world order will not be established at our expense and that of our children. [Na'na'] Within the framework of Arab coordination, have you and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan reached an advanced stage of political and economic coordination? ['Arafat] Yes, we have made large strides in the field of coordination with the Jordanian brothers. We signed an economic agreement. We held meetings of the security committee and the refugees committee, and meetings of other committees on other levels. All this took place in implementation of what we and his Majesty King Husayn had agreed during my last visit to Jordan after signing the Cairo agreement when I handed King Husayn a copy of that agreement. [Na'na'] After the massacre, French Defense Minister Francois Leotard visited Israel. Does this visit signal a change in the French stand? Do you not believe it would have been more appropriate for a defense minister of a country that is a friend of the Palestinians to have postponed his visit in the wake of the Hebron tragedy? ['Arafat] The French stand has not changed. In the United Nations, this becomes apparent through the president of the UN Security Council, the French representative. The French stand is good, solid, sympathetic, and forceful. We had hopes that such a visit would not take place at that time so that it might not be interpreted as France approving of the massacre and supporting the Israeli stand. [Na'na'] President 'Arafat has been a hero in the eyes of his people. He has been a symbol, and a struggler. However, support for you in the occupied territories has been dwindling for some time. Of course, you notice from the pictures transmitted on television and the information you receive that following the Hebron massacre, the people now oppose the Oslo agreement and the peace process, and that their support for you has greatly diminished. ['Arafat] I have said this more than once. Patience has its limits. Everyone, both far and near, should realize this. Our people welcomed the peace agreement. But, the Israeli maneuvers and Rabin's obstruction of the implementation of the agreement have made the peace process lose its credibility in the eyes of our people. I do understand the Palestinian people. The world at large should also excuse them if they lose their faith in peace. Our people suffered two massacres in 15 days. The first took place in the Ibrahimi Mosque by armed settlers in collusion with the Israeli Army. The second massacre was the one committed against our people in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip where dozens of martyrs fell, many were wounded, and more than 1,000 were arrested. It is true that they released 1,500 detainees of those whose prison terms had nearly ended, but they arrested 2,000 others. This state of affairs that our Palestinian people has been experienced has led, among other things, to their dwindling support for the peace process.
