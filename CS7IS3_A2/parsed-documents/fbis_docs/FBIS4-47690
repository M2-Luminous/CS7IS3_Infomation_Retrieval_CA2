Speaking at Gallagher's Estate in Midrand on the counting of ballots in the PWV region, she said she doubted whether the results would be out before midnight tonight. Mrs. Suzman said she'd visited the Nasrec [National Exhibition Center] Counting Center, and that dozens of ballot boxes had not even been opened yet. She jokingly referred to her job as commissioner as the most terrible job she had ever had. She said that although it was the smallest province, it was the most densely populated, and she'd only received the assignment three weeks before the election had started.
