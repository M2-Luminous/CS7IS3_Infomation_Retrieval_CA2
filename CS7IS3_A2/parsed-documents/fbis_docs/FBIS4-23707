The court interdict was to prevent the paper from publishing information about former members of the defense force's Directorate of Covert Collection. The information concerned allegations that certain members of the ANC alliance, the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] and others had acted as informants of the apartheid state. Mr. Joe Modise said the information can be published as it doesn't pose a threat to the democratic transition. In a statement, the minister reiterated his commitment to the principle of press freedom.
