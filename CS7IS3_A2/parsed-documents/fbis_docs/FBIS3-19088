The Nordic prime ministers all emphasized that the Nordic Council is now working under a new constellation of stars. It was almost as if it were possible to see the blue and gold banner of the EU fluttering alongside the eight Nordic flags in front of the Riksdag building. According to Prime Minister Carl Bildt, the Nordic area will be a strong voice, but not a bloc in European cooperation. No Scandinavian politician was prepared to say on Monday precisely how this would be achieved, for the enlargement of the European Union to include three of the Nordic countries is still an open question. On 1 March Sweden and Finland concluded their negotiations with the EU, whereas the Norwegian negotiations on fisheries became deadlocked. When the session began, Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland was absent. She was in Brussels with many members of her government in a final, all-out attempt to try and catch up, and bring the Norwegian negotiations to a successful conclusion before the end of the EU meeting, which ends on Tuesday. Iceland Out in The Cold It fell to Prime Minister David Oddsson of Iceland -- the only Nordic country that is neither a member of the European Union nor an applicant for membership -- to deliver the five prime ministers' joint introductory address at the session's ceremonial opening in the Riksdag building. The presidency of the group of prime ministers rotates, depending on which Nordic country will host the next session. In 1995 it will be Iceland' s turn. At a press conference the prime ministers developed their ideas about continued Nordic cooperation in a new and unfamiliar situation. Carl Bildt seized the opportunity to have a dig at those members of parliament who are worried that the prime ministers are assuming too much power: "We view the criticism as recognition of the fact that the prime ministers have accomplished something, and perhaps also as a relection of a fear that we have succeeded far too well. I think the members of parliament should regard it as a challenge for themselves." Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho, a long-standing member of the Nordic Council, went on to say that over the last 10 years the Council had failed to achieve anything new. Bildt thought that time and time again Nordic studies had reached the conclusion that the necessary preconditions for making further progress in many areas do not exist. Nonetheless, the prime ministers agreed that Nordic cooperation is now heading toward a brighter future within the framework of European integration. Bildt mentioned the fact that recently cooperation has been more intensive than anything he had experienced before. Aho thought he could see guarantees for the Nordic dimension also being able to function within the EU. And Denmark' s Poul Nyrup Rasmussen felt that Nordic parliamentarians have a future at European level. Nyrup Rasmussen also consoled the Norwegians by saying that there is no such phrase as "the breakdown of negotiations," and that he is among those who believe that Spain should give way in the fisheries dispute. Esko Aho took the opportunity to point out that this proves it is possible for any member state to fight for its own national interests, despite its EU membership. There will be referendums on EU membership in all three Nordic candidate countries, and Finland has indicated already an interest in 18 September, the same day as parliamentary elections in Sweden. Carl Bildt reported on the Swedish situation following the chaotic meeting of party leaders on Friday: "There are two conceivable times -- mid-June or the end of November. A majority seem to be in favor of mid-June. However, that does not mean to say that it will be held in mid-June. At least two meetings of the party leaders still have to be held before the issue can be decided." Domino Effect The Norwegian Government is counting on a domino effect, for Norwegian opinion polls show that the prospects for a "yes" will increase significantly if Finland and Sweden hold their referendums first. In response to a question as to when Norway would hold its referendum, the Norwegian minister of labor and municipal affairs, Gunnar Berge, answered cryptically: "Does the sun not move from east to west?" When the 87 elected members of parliament from the five countries plus Aaland, Greenland, and the Faeroe Islands took their seats in the session chamber it was the second time that they tested a new arrangement that was introduced last year -- that is, that it is the prime ministers, rather than the ministers of Nordic cooperation, who outline their priorities and plans for Nordic cooperation. Foreign policy, which used to be such a taboo subject at the sessions of the Nordic Council, now has its allotted place in the introduction to the prime ministers' opening address. The situation in the Baltic states, democratic developments and uncertainty in Russia, and the anxiety concerning the disintegration of Yugoslavia were central issues. The tone was more cautious on the subject of internal Nordic cooperation. New TV Attempt David Oddsson raised the topic of TV cooperation, where -- after decades of failure -- attempts are now being made to open up the way for cross-border broadcasting, but where the problems of copyright still remain unresolved. He mentioned the plans for a Nordic environmental strategy for the years 1994-1996, and the data network that will now be linked up to all schools in the Nordic area with a view to improving language teaching. Preparations are also underway for a Scandinavian year against xenophobia. "When one sees how comprehensive Nordic cooperation is, it is impossible not to wonder at how little the citizens of Scandinavia know about it," David Oddsson complained, adding: "For a long time we have been talking about a single Nordic market. Thanks to the EEA [European Economic Area] agreement this has finally become a reality." At the press conference, Carl Bildt said that in four or five years it will be time for a reassessment of the Nordic Council.
