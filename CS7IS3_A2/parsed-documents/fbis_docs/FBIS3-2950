Will Baghdad find a Normandy to make a flank breakthrough of the oil embargo? Observers here noted that Iraq's latest move signaled a new strategy in its anti-sanction drive, namely, to open a flank battlefield outside the U.N. resolutions framework by selling oil profits to certain states in private. When U.S. President Bill Clinton took office at the White House in January 1993, Iraq changed its early post-Gulf-war policy toward the U.N. which was characterized by passive cooperation and positive resistance, pinning great hope on the new commander-in-chief of the pro-sanction coalition. However, Iraq turned back to the U.N. again following the U.S. missile attack against Baghdad in June and adopted a new policy of "weapons for oil." As a result, the country in November accepted U.N. Resolution 715 which calls for long-term monitoring of Iraq's weapons industries. While asserting its full compliance with all relevant U.N. resolutions, in particular Resolution 687, Iraq has been launching a campaign to press for a U.N. commitment to Article 22 by closing the chapter of weapons destruction and monitoring and opening a new one to allow Iraqi oil exports. The U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) charged with the weapons issues, however, answered that there are still doubts about Iraq's weapons-related information and that an observation of the monitoring mechanism was a must for an indefinite period. In addition, the U.S. and its Western allies tried to attach to the precondition for lifting the sanctions Iraq's recognition of Kuwait's sovereignty and boundary and resolving the issues of the Kurds and Shiite Moslems. Disappointed at the futility of its sacrifice in the main battle field, Iraq began earlier this year shifting its focus to a flank battlefield in an effort to break the sanctions, which are pushing Iraq to an endless abyss. It resumed oil sales to certain ex-partners. Observers said that such an action is well based on Iraq's abundant oil reserves and on the contradictions between the anti-Iraq coalition members. The basic reason for maintaining the sanctions is not Iraq's failure in fully compliance with the U.N. resolutions, but the West countries' failure in compelling Baghdad to guarantee their post- sanction interests in the Gulf region and particularly in Iraq, which possesses the second largest oil reserves in the world. The United States, which has gained great profits from the oil-rich Gulf states since the 1991 Gulf war, is facing ever-increasing economic conflicts with the West European countries, which are not content with their status quo in the Gulf. In fact, the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Russia, Italy, Japan, South Korea and others have never stopped their secret deals with Iraq, each planning to gain great profits from the post-sanction Iraqi oil exports and economic reconstruction. Choosing France, whose oil imports from Iraq after the sanctions accounted for one-third of its total, as the Normandy for opening the second battlefield, Iraq hoped to lure more to follow and finally disintegrate the pro-sanction coalition. Iraq's strategy is to take concerted actions in both battlefields. If it succeeds in the flank battlefield, the U.N. sanctions will collapse automatically, if not, the potential benefit gainers will intercede for an early lifting of the sanctions against Iraq. On the other hand, Iraq has also enhanced its efforts in the main battlefield. Iraqi President Saddam Husayn Sunday [13 March] called for an immediate lifting of the sanctions or Iraq will end them on its own. Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Riyad al-Qaysi is on a mission to Russia, China, France and other members of the Security Council. And Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz is expected to hold Tuesday a new round of talks with UNSCOM chairman Rolf Ekeus on ending the sanctions. However, the U.S. will not allow an easy flank breakthrough of the sanctions to happen in the near future. It will coordinate its stance with the West European allies to guarantee their long-term interests in Iraq and the Gulf region at large. Moreover, Iraq's Gulf neighbors will inevitably stand in the way of an early lifting of the sanctions, not only because the potential threat to their safety has not been eradicated, but also because Iraq's re-entry into the oil market will reduce their profits. It can be predicted that Iraq still has a difficult way ahead.
