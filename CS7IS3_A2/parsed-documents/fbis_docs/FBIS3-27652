I firmly believe that both China and Britain should be sincere and open to reach an agreement through talks. For this reasons, I hope that you, Mr. Governor, can respond to several questions first, which perhaps have been answered in your statement; that is: Are the Britain and Hong Kong side still willing to talk with the Chinese side? [passage omitted] If the Legislative Council and the future legislature can have most seats returned through elections and abide by the principle of being fair and open, then can you not consider adopting a proportional representation [PR] voting system? Thank you. [Governor Patten] The honorable member raised a number of issues. Some of them are a little complicated. But let me try to respond as clearly as possible. First, on willingness to talk. In, I hope, as factual and unprovocative a way as possible, let me remind the council that we proposed talks in October 1992, that we went on saying that we wanted to talk for the next six or seven months while we were not, frankly, getting a very warm response from Chinese officials. We were pleased when talks eventually got underway in April 1993, only sorry that they had taken so long to get underway. We would have liked to go on talking even after time had pressed us to put in the second of the three bills which the Legislative Council is going to have to consider. But, alas, Chinese officials insisted that we withdraw the second bill, the partial legislation that was passed yesterday, before they were prepared to come to the table. Our door is never closed, and we want to talk on a whole range of issues and talk constructively and creatively. We would like to see more constructive and creative talks in the Joint Liaison Group. We would like to see an early meeting of the Airport Committee to resolve an issue, which I think the whole community thinks has dragged on too long. So, as far as we are concerned, cooperation remains something on which we are particularly keen. But, I do have to point out that we had 17 rounds of talks, and I think when honorable members, including the distinguished honorable member who has just spoken, see the account of those 17 rounds of talks in the White Paper, they will be surprised how much time was spent discussing so little agreement. [passage omitted] This council has voted pretty decisively now on at least a couple of occasions on the question of the voting method for geographical constituencies, and I think the arguments for proportionality, if I may say so, are somewhat lessened when you would seek to achieve proportionality, or you seek to achieve balance by having three different sorts of electoral process. If every member of this Legislative Council was to be elected directly -- as some honorable members would like, as I am sure some honorable members will press for during the debates that lie ahead -- if every member was directly elected, then I think the argument for a proportional voting system would be that much stronger. But since we had tried to achieved balance through the functional constituencies, through the election committee, I think the arguments for PR are much less considerable. And so, I notice, does the Legislative Council. If the honorable member was able with his powers of eloquence to persuade his colleagues differently, then it would require, of course, overturning several votes which the Legislative Council has already taken. I hope I have responded in some detail to the honorable member's question. [Ha Wing-ho, in Cantonese with simultaneous translation into English] Mr. Governor, after the release of the White Paper, if we read the White Paper and feel that the British side should score a higher mark, it does not help us to solve the question; that is, in 1995, there may be a new Legislative Council, but by 1997, all the Legislative Councillors returned in 1995 may have to climb down the tree. Mr. Governor, can you solve this problem for us? [Patten] I cannot solve unilaterally the question of how we secure a through train. I think that the council will see from the White Paper that unfortunately we were not able to secure Chinese agreement to a through train during 17 rounds of talks, though we tried, I think imaginatively and sensibly to do so, with the proposals we put about oaths and about other matters. But let me just deal briefly with the question of what happens in 1997. I choose my words carefully, they do not in any way reflect on Chinese sovereignty, they do not in any way change the historic fact of 30 June and 1 July 1997, but I do not believe there is any reason -- I stress that word -- I do not believe there is any reason why China should seek to overturn arrangements in 1997 which are entirely in compliance with the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. The assertion that they are not has been made on a number of occasions, but the assertion has been made more frequently than any evidence has ever been adduced. It goes on being said, but nobody ever demonstrates how it happens to be the case. And I say one other thing as well, using, since I noticed that metaphors were from the beginning of the debate yesterday in much evidence in the chamber, using a metaphor to make the point: If my next-door neighbor says that in three and a half years he is going to come round to my house and break all the windows, that does not seem to me to be a very persuasive argument for me breaking all the windows this afternoon. [Mrs. Elsie Tu] Thank you, Mr. President. Mr President, may I ask the governor, through you, something that has been puzzling me for a long time. The proposed political package is always referred to as being democratic. Can the governor explain to me how it is democratic to give two votes to every person who works in a workplace, but only one person, one vote to those who work in other places, such as housewives, or elderly persons retired, and adult students? I find it very difficult to understand how it is democratic. It means that the ones who are not working in a workplace are only half a person. [Patten] Well, I am sure the honorable lady, whose vigorous eloquence I salute as the Legislative Council has, I am sure that the honorable lady would not want me to take that argument to its conclusion, because the conclusion of the argument is that the proposals that are being put forward in the bill that will be published tomorrow are a great deal more democratic than the present system. Under the present system -- and perhaps the honorable lady wishes to argue the case against functional constituencies, perhaps that is her argument -- under the present system, only a few people have two votes because of functional constituencies and geographical constituencies. Of course, some have a lot more than two votes. Some, because of corporate voting in constituencies have -- oh -- votes into double figure, and that is a situation that we are anxious to eliminate with the introduction of individual rather than corporate voting. It is perfectly true that because not everyone is at work the extension of votes as we have proposed in the nine new functional constituencies does not mean that everyone in the community has two votes, but that is because of the nature of functional constituencies, and I would not want to challenge the Basic Law in having the number of functional constituencies of 30, which are proposed for 1995 through to 1999. [passage omitted] [Elsie Tu] I think the present system is quite right, the present system does give two votes to some people, and I disagree with that. I think people should have a choice, but to make it work does not seem any more democratic. Is it not less democratic to give more people two votes? [Patten] I think it is an argument which few would accept that extending the ability to vote is less democratic than limiting the ability to vote. I really cannot follow the argument that by ensuring more people are able to vote in functional constituencies, one is going down a less democratic path. That seems to me to be a considerable contradiction in terms, but if the honorable lady is arguing the case in principle against functional constituencies, which she may well be, all I can say is that we are committed to trying to introduce arrangements which are in compliance with the Basic Law, and the Basic Law proposes 30 functional constituencies. The question is whether those functional constituencies, for example, in line with the 1988 White Paper, represent economic and professional sectors of substantial importance, and the question, secondly, is whether, following I think it is Basic Law 68, pursuing matters in an orderly way, whether we try to deal with some of the real problems which have arisen in functional constituencies in the last few years. Honorable members are well aware of some of the problems that have arisen in those functional constituencies. They may disagree with the proposals that we have brought forward in trying to deal with them, in which case they will be able to debate this in this Legislative Council. It is very, very difficult to devise nine new functional constituencies, and I think that some of the inherent difficulties will be demonstrated to all those honorable members who read the White Paper and the account of our negotiations with our Chinese colleagues on this point. [Reverend Fung Chi-woo, in Cantonese with simultaneous translation into English] [Passage omitted] Will the governor lobby the councillors to accept your proposals to make sure they will go through smoothly. What will you do? [Patten] We will do what we did in the run-up to yesterday's debate. Argue our case with all that gentle eloquence for which members of the Hong Kong government are renowned. We do not have any of the instruments which are perhaps available elsewhere in other communities. We recognize that this council has to make decisions, and that this council has 60 independent-minded members who are not going to be pushed around by a government, and I hope are not going to be pushed around by anybody else in Hong Kong or outside Hong Kong. So we will argue our case, but if by lobbying you mean making threats, if by lobbying the honorable member means seeking, of course metaphorically, to break arms and legs, that is not our way. We put these proposals forward in good faith. We will argue the case for them and hope that they provide an acceptable basis for the electoral arrangements in Hong Kong. I have to say if I look back to yesterday, we were told at the beginning of the week that we would just scrape through with our bill yesterday. Well it proved to be, I am pleased to say, rather better than that. And I would like to add one point about it. I think it was an extremely important day for Hong Kong. I think it was an extremely important mature moment in Hong Kong's history. Nobody can wipe it out. Nobody can pretend it did not happen. Nobody can turn the clock back on what happened. Not just the particular decisions about electoral arrangements that were made, but the whole process: what was actually happening in this chamber. And happening with considerable maturity, with of course, a lot of polite vigor, but happening I am sure in the case of every honorable member, happening in a way in which honorable members hoped would secure the best interests of the people of Hong Kong. And it is entirely right that this Legislative Council should be involved in the process in the way it was yesterday. [Mr. Howard Young] Mr. Governor, the gazetting and tabling of the 1992 version of the second-stage reforms is, as you described, without an agreement with China. However, on the other hand, British Government says that it is willing to continue negotiations. Although slim as they are the chances of such happening, has it gone beyond the stage yet where, during the legislative process, should there be agreement reached in one form or another with China -- not necessarily in negotiations, agreements can even be reached by diplomatic letters of exchange -- if during that process has it gone beyond the stage where the government might even bring up amendments to what is being gazetted tomorrow to conform with any such agreement that could be reached before the legislative process has ended? [Patten] I repeat, in a way, what I said earlier, that our door has never been closed, and will never be closed. And if, in the course of the next few months, we thought there was the chance of an agreed way forward with China, which was also acceptable and which secured the objectives which I think the community has, then we would of course have to present that to the council, even if it meant amending what was already being considered by the council. That is, I hope, an earnest of our sincerity. But again, I say, time does close in. It is not because we wish it were that way, it is part of the ineluctable movement of the calendar, and the elections that we have got, are, for reasons which the whole council knows are extremely complicated, and do involve complicated arrangements. But I repeat, it has never been our position that we declined to have talks. [Christine Loh] Thank you, Mr. President. I welcome the release of the 17 rounds of talks by both the British and the Chinese Government. It will at least give the people of Hong Kong a change to protest against compromises made in their name. What I would like to ask is: Traditionally, the British Government's position has always been that these are diplomatic issues and they should be kept confidential, but now that since both governments are going to release the information, is that not really now a signal of the end of Sino-British negotiations over electoral reform. And also my second question is: If we were to pass these legislations -- and I certainly hope that we will pass them before July -- there is no opportunity really to ever return to discuss these issues with China, is that correct? [Patten] Well, it is perfectly correct that we would not have taken this step, which as the honorable member says has already been taken by, in a way, by Chinese officials, if we thought there was a rosy prospect of keeping negotiations going. But I am an experienced enough politician never to say never. There may be a prospect down the road of reviving some sort of, within time, some sort of dialogue on electoral matters. The whole community, I am sure, hopes that's possible. At the same time, my reading of the community is that they would like to get this debate over and done with and out of the way, and get on with other matters. [passage omitted] [Jimmy McGregor] Governor, it is my impression that the two proposals yet to come before us in the form of legislation are the two critical proposals in your packages of seven or eight proposals, which you started with. It is also my impression that one of these proposals may undergo very considerable change in discussion in this council. If that proves to be the case, and remembering that the British Government has already compromised both of these proposals to some extent by entering into negotiations and modifying the proposals to become somewhat less democratic as far as we can make out, will you be able to accept, in good faith, the modification of at least one of these two major proposals, and the possible modification of the other to some extent, and accept that in good faith this council would reach that conclusion and that you will be able to bring legislation in to give effect to these changes which, this council in its wisdom, requests? [Patten] [Passage omitted] We are not simply going to come down to the Legislative Council, put the bill on the table, and then scarper. That is not our intention, and it would not be honorable to behave in that way. But the Legislative Council has an important function. The Legislative Council has to consider legislation, and if necessary, the Legislative Council has the power to amend legislation. That is true today, and it will be true, according to the Basic Law, after 1997. So, if the Legislative Council changed the proposals which are put to them, then at the end of the day that is a reality which we have to accept. I would just add this one point. That I would be put in a difficult position, the government would be put in a difficult position, the British Government would be put in a difficult position, if the Legislative Council appeared to have agreed with arrangements which were not fair and which were not open and which did not seem to be acceptable to the community. But I don't think that is a remotely likely possibility, since I think the community's views are extremely well-represented in this council. Though, in good faith, if the Legislative Council changed the proposals, the government would accept them. [Martin Barrow] Governor, you mentioned earlier other issues on the agenda for discussion with China. Could you comment on the government's strategy for discussing economic issues, such as the airport? [Patten] Yes. Our strategy is to press as courteously and constructively for a dialogue on these matters as possible. There are discussions going on this week, as I think the council knows on the difficult but important issue of the future of defense lands. That has an economic aspect as well as other aspects as well. We would like to have the opportunity of discussing with Chinese officials, sooner rather than later, the proposals that we have put, the fourth set of proposals that we have put, on financing the airport. There are a lot of other proposals touching on Hong Kong's economic well being that we would like to carry forward. I was encouraged by what the Chinese prime minister said last December about Chinese officials being determined not to let any political argument affect the livelihood of Hong Kong and to continue to work for the interests of Hong Kong. So I hope that we can see a dialogue develop rather more constructively than perhaps as happened not just for the last 18 months, but for the last three years. In the meantime, we continue with the support from time to time, when expenditure decisions are necessary, we continue to do what we believe is in the long-term interests of Hong Kong. That has been, so far I am pleased to say, a beneficial process. And the latest round of those benefits will be made public when the financial secretary announces his budget next week. [Emily Lau] I want to ask the Governor a question about electoral arrangements which may be in breach of the Basic Law, because earlier this afternoon he kept talking about putting in place arrangements which are in line with the Basic Law. But of course, when we saw the foreign secretary last year, he said the importance is that they are in line with Britain's international obligations. As the Governor rightly pointed out just then, certain people, including myself, will be moving an amendment for 60 seats in the council to be directly elected in 1995, and that I guess the governor would say, is not in line with the provisions of the Basic Law. Mr. President, I want to ask the governor, what will he and the British Government do then? If it is blatantly in breach of the Basic Law, will the British administration move to block it or will you still say that it is line with the Joint Declaration, also in line with Britain's international obligations, so you would support it. Thank you. [Patten] Well, I am of course an unqualified and unabashed admirer of the honorable lady's political and rhetorical talents. But I think I would like to see her majority before I answer the question. I know that the honorable lady has an unshakable and wholly honorable commitment to a totally democratic system in Hong Kong well before 2007, and preferably next week. I respect the honorable lady's courage in arguing for that and consistency in arguing for that. But I do not honestly think that the honorable lady is going to be.... [changes thought] she may prove me wrong, she has proved British politicians wrong on occasions in the past and asked difficult questions of British politicians. I do not think the honorable lady is likely to secure the outcome in the next few months which she understandably and honorably has said. If she does, I will answer the question. [Emily Lau] The governor has not answered my question. My question is whether he will block it? If he blocks it, then it cannot even be introduced. If it is given a chance, maybe it will be defeated by my colleagues, maybe it will be carried. If it is not even allowed to be introduced, how can I prove to you? [Patten] Nobody, I will keep my decibel count down, nobody is actually saying the honorable lady cannot introduce her argument and her ideas. It would be an extremely brave woman, an even braver man, who ever tried to stop the honorable lady developing a political argument. The political argument she has got is one which many people in this community and outside the community would regard as wholly reasonable. But I do not think that it is ever sensible to answer very hypothetical questions in the way that the honorable lady is inviting me to. I answer sometimes partially hypothetical questions, but the more hypothetical they are, the less sensible I think it is to answer them. And just to add one point, I think that it is a strength of our proposals, the government's proposals, that they are not only in line with the Joint Declaration but also wholly in line with the Basic Law. And I think that it is a matter of strength as well, that despite the rain forests that have been cut down over the last year and a half to try to demonstrate that we have violated the Basic Law and the Joint Declaration, no evidence which convinces anybody has ever been adduced for that. I do not think that we would be in a stronger position if we had put forward proposals such as the honorable lady advances, which go against the Basic Law. What we are trying to do is build as broad a base of support in the community as possible. But somebody with my background could not help but admire the objectives which the honorable lady has set herself and for which she has argued with, as I said, such consistency and passion often to the embarrassment of politicians from Britain and elsewhere.
