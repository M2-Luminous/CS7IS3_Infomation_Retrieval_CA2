FR940712-2-00021 FR940712-2-00016 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;310&hyph;000] Carnegie Natural Gas Company; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff July 6, 1994. Take notice that on July 1, 1994, Carnegie Natural Gas Company (Carnegie) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, the following revised tariff sheet, with a proposed effective date of August 1, 1994: Fifth Revised Sheet No. 7 Carnegie states that it is filing the above tariff sheet pursuant to ยง32.2(c) of the General Terms and Conditions of its FERC-approved tariff as a Periodic Transportation Cost Rate (TCR) Filing to reflect a change in the calculated projection of the costs of unassigned upstream pipeline capacity held by Carnegie on Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern) in excess of $0.10/Dth. This filing reflects a revision to the projection Carnegie made in its Mid-Cycle TCR Filing, which was filed on March 31, 1994 and accepted by the Commission on April 29, 1994. The filing reflects a change in the Gas Supply Realignment surcharge charged to Carnegie by Texas Eastern, which will be effective July 1, 1994. Carnegie states that copies of its filing were served on all jurisdictional customers and interested state commissions. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with 18 CFR 385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before July 13, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room.
