He left the Angolan capital without disclosing anything substantive concerning the talks. As always, in his few contacts with the press he reminded everyone of the information blackout [preceding word in English], but the truth is that everybody's attention is turned to Lusaka at this stage. Observers believe that talks may gain new impetus in the wake of UN Special Representative Blondin Beye's contacts with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, in Luanda, and Jonas Savimbi, in Huambo. Before leaving the Angolan capital, Blondin Beye held talks with Catholic Cardinal Alexandre do Nascimento, who expressed the hope that there will be a happy ending to the Lusaka peace talks.
