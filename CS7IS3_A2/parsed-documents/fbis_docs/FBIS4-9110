Mary McLauglin, who comes from Cork, is in a building in the town after travelling there to arrange medical evacuations before the violent Serb offensive began. She described, just hours before 10 patients were killed by a direct hit on the main hospital, how she and the other eight UN workers were "chronically frightened" and suffering daily from acute anxiety attacks. Dr McLauglin also spoke of her feelings of helplessness in the face of the tragedy suffered by the people of Gorazde. A despatch sent by the group after today's shelling said they were "running out of words to describe what is going on ... It seems the Serbs are prepared to level east Gorazde house-by-house in order to gain control over it". The doctor said: "Yesterday at 6 PM shells landed at the United Nations Military Observers building with four of them rocking it and spreading debris into the rooms upstairs where the refugees shelter. One blew a hole in the side of the building adjacent to us and a little boy lost both his legs. We cannot go to the assistance of such cases as it would be suicidal to face direct fire ... How many others were injured we do not know, but the fire raged in the building all night as a grim reminder to us of how close we come to direct hits." [passage omitted] For Gorazde residents and refugees, she said conditions were "appalling". "They have no food and have to risk their lives to get water. Most shelter in badly-damaged buildings and the wet, foggy weather is no help. But worst of all is the constant shelling of the town and few have cellars suitable to protect against this. We feel so helpess in the face of the great tragedy for the people of Gorazde. Not a family has escaped death."
