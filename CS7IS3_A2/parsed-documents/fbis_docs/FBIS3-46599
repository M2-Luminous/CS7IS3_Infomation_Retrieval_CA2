Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed pointed out that many things have yet to be done by that country before it could be accorded recognition. The prime minister said this at the news conference after a visit to Angkasapuri [Ministry of Information]. He hopes that Israel would make progress towards this end. Although he regarded the agreement between Israel and Palestine as an outstanding development, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir felt that the agreement alone is not adequate. This is because there is no declaration on the part of Israel for a Palestinian state. Besides, there is no declaration from Israel that they will not resort to terrorism in effort to achieve its national objective. Whereas the Palestinians are required not to use terrorism. Malaysia has to wait before it takes action to accept the state of Israel. The prime minister also warned that the problem is still not over due to the attitude of the Gulf states themselves which are at loggerheads with each other. The situation has resulted in some parties not supporting the accord.
