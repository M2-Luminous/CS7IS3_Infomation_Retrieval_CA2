Hojjat ol-Eslam 'Ali Nateq-Nuri, who was reelected yesterday as speaker of the Iranian Majles, said that his country has been informed of Syria's plans in this connection, "and we know the motive behind its choice of this course." Nuri pointed out that signing a peace treaty with Israel would be a "grave mistake" by Syria and could "harm its reputation." However, he stressed that that "would not lead to the severance of diplomatic relations between Tehran and Damascus." Analysts describe Nateq-Nuri's remarks about the Syrian position as the beginning of a marked transformation in Iranian policy. [passage omitted]
