Chihana, who is on a two-day private visit to Zambia, told reporters in Lusaka on Wednesday [9 February] that at no time did he say he would seek the re-definition of the border between Zambia and Malawi. "It should now go on record that I have never and will never make such demands unless I am mad", he said. He attributed what he called, the misleading reports to the Malawian Government and fellow opponents who, he said, had teamed up to malign him before the Zambian Government. "Zambians are our brothers and sisters and I should assure you that my intentions are that when the need arises, Malawians and Zambians should meet to consider breaking the border so that the two peoples could mix freely. We are one and the same people,"Chihana said.
