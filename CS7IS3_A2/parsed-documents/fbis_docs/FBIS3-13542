In an interview with AL-NAHAR, Mirhij said the security operation targets no individual. It covers all parts of the country. Referring to the so-called siege on Samir Ja'ja', he said there is no siege on Ja'ja'; the proof lies in his receiving people and making statements. He added that the barriers laid around Ghidras could be for the purpose of preventing suspects or wanted people from going to or leaving Ghidras. Responding to remarks by Ja'ja' that he has no wanted persons, the interior minister said that in this case there is no problem, because the barriers are not against Ja'ja' personally. Why then is every security incident being utilized for political purposes that are contrary to the country's interests? There is an attempt to make the people feel that they are a target of attack. This is wrong. The security operation aims to maintain the security of the citizen, not to harm him. Mirhij said that reports about legal violations during the detention operations are unfounded speculation, because the security authorities operate under the law. Asked how long the security measures in Ghidras will continue and whether they are concrete, Mirhij said: When the Army wants to enter, it will enter Ghidras and the home of Ja'ja'. Every Lebanese house is a house for the Army. We will bring out the criminals and security violators from any figure or official's house. He added that talk of making Ja'ja' a hero is supposition. If people go to him, it means he is not under siege. There is no one we would want to cancel out politically unless he cancels himself out. Let everyone abide by the laws and national accord and no one will cancel him out. Answering a question, Mirhij denied that the authorities overlooked events in Ba'labakk. He said: We are pursuing the perpetrators. What happened there has been exaggerated to make the state appear biased.
