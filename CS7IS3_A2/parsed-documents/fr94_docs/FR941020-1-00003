FR941020-1-00003 FR941020-1-00001 The basic purpose of the tenure system has changed too. The original intent was that an employee would gain the full benefits of the system only after working continuously in the career system for a certain period. A lengthy continuous service requirement, however, is too burdensome in today's society where workers, many of whom are from dual income families, are highly mobile and subject to relocation (which often results in breaks in service in Federal careers). Furthermore, over the years, we have added exceptions and new rules to accommodate changing employment conditions. In the process, the body of rules for career tenure has become complex. The relationship of probation and career tenure is also a confusing aspect of the appointment system. Most individuals view completion of the probationary period as the most significant change in an employee's status. Once employees complete probation, they acquire the adverse action rights under 5 CFR part 432 and 752. Despite having these rights, most employees continue for an additional 2 years as career-conditional before reaching career tenure. Career Tenure Currently, 5 CFR 315.201(a) requires 3 years of creditable service for an employee to receive a career appointment. Section 315.201(b) provides that OPM will publish in the FPM the conditions under which service may be credited in meeting the 3-year requirement. These conditions are in subchapter 2 of the provisionally retained FPM Chapter 315. An employee's 3-year period of service must begin with one of 16 different categories of employment, be substantially continuous (with nine categories of exceptions), and total 3 years (with special rules for less than full-time service, credit for time in nonpay status in four situations, credit for time off the rolls in six situations, and credit for certain intervening service in seven situations). As a result, making a determination of an employee's eligibility for career status can be confusing and time consuming. To simplify these rules and to link career employment to the significant event of completing probation, OPM proposes that acquisition of career tenure rest on completion of the probationary period. Generally, an individual's first permanent appointment in the competitive service would be a career-conditional appointment. Upon completion of probation as provided in 5 CFR 315, subpart H, the employee would automatically become a career appointee. (Certain authorities specifically exempt appointees from probation. Individuals employed under these authorities would be hired under career appointment. Example: employees noncompetitively converted from a Veterans Readjustment Appointment to the competitive service are not subject to probation, so they would be converted to a career appointment upon satisfying requirements.) At present, the probationary period on appointment is 1 year. However, the National Performance Review and the National Partnership Council have recommended that legislation be sought to enable probationary periods to be set for up to 3 years, based on the requirements of the position. Therefore, this proposal anticipates that at some time in the future, employees may be subject to differing probationary periods and may acquire career tenure after varying periods. OPM recognizes that this proposal to simplify the appointment system could impact the outcome of any reduction in force (RIF). This is because tenure is one of the four factors required by law to determine retention standing in a RIF. Under this proposal, employees would acquire career tenure and move to tenure group I, the highest tenure group, sooner than they do under current rules. This would result in relatively fewer employees in tenure group II than there are now, reducing opportunities for tenure group I employees to displace, or bump, employees in lower tenure groups. If this proposed rule is adopted, OPM would make the change mandatory for all RIF actions effective 6 months after publication of the final rule. Under this proposal, current career-conditional employees who have completed probation would be changed to a career appointment. Upon reinstatement, a former career-conditional employee who had completed probation would be reinstated to a career appointment; if probation had not been completed, reinstatement would be to a career-conditional appointment. In revising ยง315.201(c), we dropped the term ``conversion'' as redundant; this term simply indicates that an employee was changed from one type of appointment to another appointment, without a break in service, while on the rolls of the same agency. 5 CFR 2.2(a)(2) provides that a current or former career employee who is appointed from a register must be given a career appointment, even if subject to a probationary period. (Therefore, OPM is not proposing any change in the tenure groups defined in the reduction in force rules at 5 CFR 351.501(b).) Rule 2.2(a)(2) can be amended only by Executive order. OPM welcomes comments on whether it should seek an amendment to this provision so that all current or former career employees who are reappointed subject to probation would be hired as career-conditional employees. This would not lessen their rights since, even now, current and former career employees who accept an appointment with a probationary period are placed in the same tenure group with career-conditional employees.
