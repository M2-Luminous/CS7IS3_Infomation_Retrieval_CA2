Since successful completion of the combustion test of the core engine recently, the Japan-U.S.-European partners will make a final decision on allocation of responsibilities for development and design of the details, and begin the design process. Future prospects for development are somewhat grim, having been slowed down by budget cuts. But now that the overall design finally has been approved, the project seems to be a step closer to commercialization. To date, various basic technology research, including that related to turbojets and measurement control systems, has been conducted. Successful combustion testing of the ``core engine,'' including the compressor, combustor, and high pressure turbine, persuaded the researchers that their fundamental technology research has met their goals, and prepared them to proceed to the overall design phase. The design phase is estimated to last two years, from FY94-95. The HYPR includes three Japanese companies, Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries, Ltd., Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd., and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd., plus United Technology (UT), GE, from the United States, Rolls Royce from the UK, and Snecma from France. Together they have been developing an engine for hypersonic transport planes. Before the overall design phase begins, the companies which are responsible for different components must consult one another in order to coordinate the interface between their respective components and finalize allocation of their responsibilities at a general meeting in May. One example of this coordination problem is found in development of the ``ramcombustor'' located at the rear of the engine which must operate during flight at over Mach 3. KHI, which is in charge of developing the combustor's ``flame holder'' and UTC which is in charge of a portion of exterior plate around the combustor, must agree upon the joint structure and the number of holes for bolts. Production of components based on the overall design plan is scheduled to begin in FY96 at the earliest. While overall design work is under way a number of combustion tests also will be conducted to verify its reliability. In November, the first combustion tests of the overall turbojet with a low pressure turbine installed in the core engine will be conducted.
