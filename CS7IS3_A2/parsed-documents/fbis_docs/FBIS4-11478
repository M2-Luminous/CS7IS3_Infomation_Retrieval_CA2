The PS presented its criteria on the subject and described the proposed Code of Conduct that the party intends to apply to all of its members who are employed in public service during the current administration. The document states that the PS will apply maximum sanctions to all public officials who are PS members and who become involved in any kind of corruption. The UDI, meanwhile, through Deputy Juan Antonio Coloma, proposed several specific measures to deal with the problem, among which he mentioned exhaustive background investigations of persons who are appointed to public service, and a change in the regulations on the creation of investigative commissions in the Chamber. The proposed Code of Conduct for Social officials was described by the secretary general of the PS, Gonzalo Martner, who said that the party would make its observance obligatory for all public servants who are party members, after the document is submitted for the approval of the next General Council on 16 and 17 April. The document states that in the event of any evidence of corruption on the part of any member of the PS in the performance of his public duties, the PS Directorate will send all the evidence to the Supreme Tribunal of the party, with the express request to apply the maximum sanctions provided by the statutes. In addition, the proposal establishes the obligation on the part of all PS members in public office to respect rigorously the Basic Law of Administration of the State, which requires them to execute their orders faithfully and to observe the principle of administrative probity, with preeminence of the public interest over private. It also states that the Socialists must orient their activities toward the satisfaction of civic demands and respect for the user as the foundation of public service. Gonzalo Martner said that it was the aim of the PS to conclude a series of legislative debates in the ordinary session of Congress next 18 September, that had already been presented on that subject by ex-Senator Laura Soto (PPD [Party for Democracy]) and Congresswoman Olga Feliu, in addition to the initiative for a model law on official probity presented last week by the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Jorge Schaulsohn. PS Vice President Ricardo Solari said that honesty and the fight against corruption are indispensable components in modernizing the state. The PS leader said that his party will promote a series of initiatives aimed at preventing corruption. He mentioned among them legislation that would punish influence peddling, as this is not considered punishable under current legislation. He added that his party wants to begin a discussion on the subject of granting the opposition the faculty to constitute investigative commissions because, at present, the decision to create a body of that type can only be taken by a majority of deputies. Nevertheless, the Socialist leader said that at the same time ways must be sought to prevent that function from being used for calumny or for gratuitous attacks on individuals or officials. Ricardo Solari also spoke of the need for legislation to make a clear distinction between the exercise of public functions and the administration of private business. The PS vice president said that, in his opinion, the financing of political and electoral activities should have an important public contribution component. He said that donations to political campaigns should be characterized by transparency, assigning them a spending ceiling and providing equal access to political financing for all participants. He believed that a public component in financing political activities would be a way of preventing corruption. Solari said that the salaries of senior and middle grade government officials should be compatible with current conditions in a modern Chile. He stressed the importance of improving salary levels, because otherwise the state administration could be faced with a flight of talent to the private sector. UDI Deputy Juan Antonio Coloma called for a change in the regulations that establish that a Special Investigative Commission of the Chamber can be formed only by agreement of a majority of deputies. He called for the requirement to be lowered to a third of the votes, and that members of the commission be designated by lottery and not by the political parties. He said that it would be appropriate for the presidency of each such commission to go to the congressman making the accusation. With regard to administrative probity and corruption, the congressman advanced a series of proposals on behalf of his party designed to deal with the problem. Coloma appealed to the country's leaders to make government appointments based on candidates' qualifications and abilities, and not on their political affiliations. In the opposition congressman's opinion, many recent appointments have been made according to political quotas, although the new government had said publicly that it would do the opposite. The congressman spoke of the importance of fighting against the state bureaucracy, as he believes it represents a source of corruption. Coloma called for greater transparency on the part of members of Congress, so that all votes on legislation be public and by roll call vote, thus preventing congressmen from promising one thing and doing another when it comes to voting. In addition to calling for specific solutions to the problem, Coloma said that a year ago the government was denying that corruption existed and was accusing the opposition of using the issue for electoral purposes. He said that President Frei recognizes that there is a real danger of corruption. Coloma also dismissed statements by DC [Christian Democratic Party] Senator Jose Ruiz de Giorgio, who said on Friday that the opposition had refused last year to create an ethics commission in the Senate. Coloma said that the senator's words were a serious blunder that confused public opinion and were an attempt to hide serious weaknesses inside Concertation. The principal leaders of the Democratic Party of the Left (PDI) emphasized the need yesterday, at the Ministry of Interior, to coordinate initiatives to prevent and combat corruption. The President of the PDI, Deputy Fanny Pollarolo, together with party leaders Antonio Leal and Pablo Mecklenburg, met at La Moneda with Minister German Correa to offer their support for the new responsibilities that he has just assumed. The PDI representatives took advantage of the occasion to exchange views with the secretary of state on corruption, a subject of great concern to the political community. "We reaffirm our decision to work very hard on this matter, to put an end to a problem that exists in our country, and to which we cannot close our eyes," declared Congresswoman Pollarolo. The political leaders discussed with the minister the advisability of coordinating the various anticorruption measures proposed by all sectors of the country. Included among the proposals are the appointment of an "ombudsman," who would gather accusations of corruption and the strengthening of the investigative powers of the Comptroller's Office. Fanny Pollarolo called for the creation of a governmental body that would collect and systematize all of the initiatives in this area. In any case, she announced, she has been considering this matter and is preparing to form a ministerial coordination working group on the problem of corruption.
