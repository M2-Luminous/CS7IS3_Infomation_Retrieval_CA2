[Begin Kaljumae recording] Today the fourth session of the Baltic Assembly ended in Jurmala. A whole string of documents were prepared in the course of three days and today Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian representatives signed them. Ulo Nugis, the Estonian delegation's leader, which of the adopted documents -- and there are about a dozen of them -- is the most important in your view? [Nugis] I would not underestimate any of them, but it seems to me personally that the most important documents are to do with the topical political issues, in particular relations with Russia and the Russian troop withdrawal. I would rate the Baltic Assembly's statement as number one, on the Russian Federation's statements of pressure on the Baltic states. In essence, let us say, it amounts to support from two Baltic countries -- Latvia and Lithuania -- to Estonia. Its preamble states clearly that the Russian defense minister has threatened Estonia with additional troops, and the Baltic Assembly states that, both at present and in the future, threats or exertions of pressure to any one Baltic state, whichever form they take, will be viewed as a threat to the security of all three Baltic states.
