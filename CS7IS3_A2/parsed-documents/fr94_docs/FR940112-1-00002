FR940112-1-00002 FR940112-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;CE&hyph;58&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives: Piper Aircraft Corporation Models PA34&hyph;200, PA34&hyph;200T, PA34&hyph;220T, PA44&hyph;180, and PA44&hyph;180T Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) that would apply to certain Piper Aircraft Corporation (Piper) Models PA34&hyph;200, PA34&hyph;200T, PA34&hyph;220T, PA44&hyph;180, and PA44&hyph;180T airplanes. The proposed action would require repetitively inspecting the main landing gear trunnions for cracks, replacing any trunnions found cracked, and eventually replacing the landing gear trunnions with parts of improved design as terminating action for the repetitive inspection requirement. Several reports of the main landing gear trunnions cracking on the affected airplanes prompted the proposed action. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent collapse of the main landing gear caused by cracked trunnions, which could result in airplane damage. DATES: Comments must be received on or before March 14, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;CE&hyph;58&hyph;AD, room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106.
