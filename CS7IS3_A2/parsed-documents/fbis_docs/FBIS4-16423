He noted that the successful solution of the problem of guarding the external borders of the CIS testified to a new understanding of the idea of the commonwealth's unity. "It can already be said that we are nearing the finishing line. A joint memorandum on the participation of CIS members in the protection of the external borders in the Central Asian region and also a memorandum on the protection of external borders with Ukraine and Belarus has already been signed. Corresponding documents are ready to be signed." "Thus," Kostikov said, "the system of a single guarded border is being restored. Moldova is expected to join this memorandum." Asked about Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev's initiative to set up a Euro-Asian Union, Kostikov said with certainty: "As far as I known, this problem was not raised in any of the speeches as it was formulated by the Kazakh president." Kostikov said that President Yeltsin rounded off the summit meeting by saying: "Let's take upon ourselves as much cooperation as it is in the interests of our states."
