They also called on the member parties of the Brasilea Agreement [not further identified] to totally ban this trade from industrialized countries to developing nations. ``The dispatch of waste from First World countries for processing or recycling has been transformed into a mechanism that in practice camouflages the uncontrolled and indiscriminate transfer of dangerous waste,'' the experts stressed. The participants agreed in indicating that Latin American and Caribbean countries do not have the capability to process their own toxic wastes, thus making it very difficult for them to take charge of toxic waste from other areas.
