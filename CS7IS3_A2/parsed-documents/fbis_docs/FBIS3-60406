Nearly 1,000 clinical tests showed that the drug was 98 percent effective. The medicine, "Weixue Chongji," which is taken mixed with boiling water, is made from traditional Chinese medicine ingredients. It is said to be more easily absorbed and to have no side-effects on the stomach or intestines, making it an improvement on medicine made from ferrous sulfate that iron-deficiency anemia patients in China use at present, said medical experts at a symposium on women and health care held here. Iron-deficiency anemia is a disease with high incidence worldwide, said the experts. In China, the incidence of this disease is about 40 percent among children and 20 percent among women.
