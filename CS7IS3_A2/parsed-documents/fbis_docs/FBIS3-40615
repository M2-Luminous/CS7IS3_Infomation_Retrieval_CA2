The finance minister for the present government, who was also the PPP [Pakistan People's Party] finance minister in 1988, has given us the good news that the nation's foreign exchange reserves have doubled since the PPP government's rise to power because of its better economic policies. By following instruction to reduce the deficit from eight percent to three percent over the next three years, the rate of inflation at the time he took over the ministry has fallen from 15 percent, to nine percent through its efforts. It should be remembered that international financial organizations were hinting at reducing the deficit to five percent. Madam Bhutto, by ordering a reduction of the deficit to three percent, has made a strong decision to help the common people. Within a short period her government has decided to borrow money to a limited extent. According to V. V. Jaffery, the amount of government loans from the State Bank has been reduced, and this may help bring down the loans from 35 billion to 11 billion rupees. There is no doubt that during the previous government no prudence was practiced in the economic area. However, we should keep in mind that it was not only Nawaz Sharif's government that had ruined our economy. His teacher, Ziaul Haq, was so indecisive in financial issues that the dangerous results are still in front of the people now. The caretaker government had openly admitted that because of the actions of the previous government, the country was on the brink of insolvency. It is the responsibility of the present government, seeing the economic misappropriations that have happened, to work hard to put our economy on a strong footing. Their efforts will also help the country's work force. Not only the government, but every person in the nation must participate in this effort. They do not have to follow the example of the previous government and try to push the country's economy into a blind well. Instead, it must take steps to build a bright economic future. It is the responsibility of the Central Bank to maintain economic stability in the country. But Zia never understood this responsibility, because the Afghanistan war made Ziaul Haq a favorite of the United States. It gave foreign aid to Pakistan without any restrictions, and Ziaul Haq continued to increase internal and foreign debts because of his unskilled economic policies. The Nawaz group also followed this path, and control of the Central Bank remained in the government's hands. Because of this, prices, inflation, and the budget deficit continued to increase, and the Nawaz government tried to avoid the problem by printing additional currency notes. By keeping the State Bank under government control, he had the National Bank issue huge loans to his favorite people at nominal interest rates. He also caused an economic crisis in the country by allowing these people to open new banks without approval from the State Bank. The caretaker government studied the whole situation and issued an ordinance to make the State Bank independent in October 1993. The present finance minister has followed this decision, saying that old loans must be returned to the banks, and that the process to collect taxes must be accelerated. This is a good, solid plan by the government, and, if its claims prove to be realistic, the people will see stability in Pakistan's economic system. Inflation and the budget deficit will also be controlled. Therefore, it is imperative for Madam Bhutto and her economic experts to follow the ordinance of the caretaker government, which had given autonomy to the State Bank, approved in the National Assembly, so that the country follows the path of economic discipline. This way our national economy will be able to stand on its own feet without depending on anyone else, and government workers will be able to take a sigh of relief and be proud that they are working for the government. This will reduce inflation. Madam Bhutto's goal is still far away because she wants to reduce inflation to below nine percent. However, these efforts are paving the way for attaining it. The industrial sector could use various tricks to avoid paying taxes because they were close to Nawaz Sharif, and this hurt the country's economy very badly. They put the whole burden of their crime on the low-income salaried people. In 1977, the people that Ziaul Haq had gathered around him came mostly from industrial families. After 1985, new institutions emerged in front of the people, and the balance of power went in favor of the business and industrial sector after the army's priority. Money became more important than faith and religion in the country. These people used this power to gain important political clout. They played with the rules and declared some areas industrially frozen and tax-free zones. Investors purchased huge acreage there and then sold them for large profits. They earned huge amounts, but did not give one rupee to the treasury in taxes. They profited in many areas this way. The State Bank instructed banks and financial institutions that they must receive an OC for any loan over one million rupees. In addition, they are not to issue new loans until old ones are paid. If we follow these steps strictly, then the causes of unemployment will die their own death in our country. We should start plans that make it necessary for our government to take loans from inside or outside the country. Programs, as decided by President Leghari, should be started to develop the backward and underdeveloped areas of the country. In order to alleviate the problem of insufficient health services, we must make sure that every citizen has access to medical services. If the government takes strict action to take back the loans worth 59 billion rupees from various industrial organizations, it would be a welcome development for the people, and the plans and projects started with this money would provide additional employment to the people. The previous government passed the limit of a 100 billion rupee budget deficit during its tenure. It will be reduced by the return of these debts.
