Nevertheless, Russian President's Envoy Kazimirov believes, this negotiations were a great success since Azerbaijan has already declared its acceptance of the agreement in general. Azerbaijan didn't sign the agreement because of "several poorly developed and incorrect topics." The experts were amazed by the unexpected harsh approach of Russia to this problem. The commander of peace-making forces Kondratyev declared that Russia is not going to organize another meeting for Ministers of Defense. Continuing the declaration he said that if Azerbaijan refuses to sign this agreement, Russia will stop its mediation efforts for peaceful resolution of the problem. Azerbaijan still didn't join the agreement by yesterday late in the evening. Nevertheless, it's clear that Baku will have to accept the agreement despite "several omissions," and most probably, Mamedrafi Mamedov will put his signature on this document in Baku. According to "YERKIR", the Azeri Councillor on external policy Vafa Gulizade declared on 17 May that "the Azeri position is the same, and Karabakh conflict is to be resolved within CSCE framework." According to "ITAR-TASS," Gulizade rejected the information on Azerbaijan only accepting the Russian project, which stipulates stationing Russian troops in the conflict zone. He said this information is baseless, and commented on this as an attempt of pressing on Azerbaijan. "We are not against collaboration with Russia, but the Armenian-Azeri conflict became international, and can only be resolved within CSCE framework, which member Russia is," Gulizade said.
