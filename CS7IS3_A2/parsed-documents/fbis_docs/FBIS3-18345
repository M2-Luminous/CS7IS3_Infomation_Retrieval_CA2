Mr. Reynolds told the Dail [Irish parliament] this afternoon the document published by Jim Molyneaux represented the road to nowhere and a cul-de-sac in political terms. Replying to opposition questions he said the government would not accept for one moment any question of talks on an internal settlement. The government believed the three strand talks process was the only basis on which to proceed and they were waiting to hear the British Government's view. Our political editor, Donald Kemp. [Kemp] Two weeks ago, after their meeting in London, the Taoiseach and the British prime minister committed their governments to a resumption of the three strand talks process. But yesterday the Ulster Unionists published their proposals for a devolved northern assembly and said they would not talk with Dublin until it was established. However, in the Dail today that position earned them a strong rebuke from the Taoiseach. [Begin Reynolds recording] The Irish Government will not entertain a one-sided approach that downgrades the Irish dimension and makes any discussion of it contingent on the prior achievement of an internal settlement.
