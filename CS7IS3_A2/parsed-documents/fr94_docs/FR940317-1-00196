ACTION: Proposed amendments to Rule 10b-10 and proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission is publishing for comment amendments to Rule 10b-10 and proposed Rule 15c2&hyph;13 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The proposed amendments to Rule 10b-10 are designed to clarify the operation of the Rule, particularly in light of changes in the securities markets and the development of new securities products. The amendments and new rule are designed to enhance the disclosure given to customers so that customers can better evaluate their securities transactions. The Commission is seeking comment on the function of the confirmation in the context of a three day settlement period, and the adequacy and readability of customer periodic statements. DATES: Comments should be received on or before June 15, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be submitted in triplicate to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Mail Stop 6&hyph;9, Washington, DC 20549. Comment letters should refer to File No. S7&hyph;6&hyph;94. All comment letters received will be available for public inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Room, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert Colby, Deputy Director, (202/272&hyph;2790), Catherine McGuire, Chief Counsel, (202/272&hyph;2844), or C.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') proposes to amend the confirmation requirements under Rule 10b-10 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') 2 to strengthen its investor protection function. Generally, Rule 10b-10 requires a broker-dealer that effects transactions for customers in securities, other than U.S. Savings Bonds or municipal securities, to provide a written notification to the customer, at or before completion of the transaction, that discloses information about the transaction. 3 Confirmation of a securities transaction provides basic customer protection, the importance of which was recognized by the Commission as early as 1937. 4 1 17 CFR 240.10b-10. 2 15 U.S.C. 78a et seq. 3 A broker-dealer has an obligation under Rule 10b-10 to send its customers an immediate confirmation with respect to each transaction the broker-dealer effects. In the case of a customer account managed by a fiduciary of the customer, it is important to note that the account is the customer, rather than the fiduciary. See generally Letter regarding Merrill Lynch, Broadcort Capital Corp. and Wagner Stott Clearing Corp. (March 25, 1991)[available on LEXIS]. Accordingly, under Rule 10b-10, a broker-dealer must send an immediate confirmation to the account holder, in addition to any confirmation it may send to an account fiduciary. The Commission believes, however, that an account that has given discretionary authority in writing to its fiduciary may agree in writing with the broker-dealer effecting its trades to waive the receipt of an immediate confirmation required by Rule 10b-10 if: (1) The broker-dealer sends an immediate confirmation to the account's fiduciary, and (2) a broker-dealer sends the discretionary account a statement no less frequently than quarterly containing all the information required to be disclosed on the immediate confirmation. The customer may not waive this quarterly statement. 4 Rule 15c1&hyph;4, 17 CFR 240.15c1&hyph;4, an earlier confirmation rule, was adopted by the Commission in 1937. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 1330 (Aug. 4, 1937). This rule, which solely applied to transactions in securities in the over-the-counter market, was replaced in 1978 by Rule 10b-10, which extended the Commission's confirmation requirements to trades conducted on a securities exchange. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 15219 (Oct. 6, 1978), 43 FR 47495. Rule 10b-10 initially was adopted in part in May 1977. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 13508 (May 5, 1977), 42 FR 25318 (``Adopting Release''). The proposed amendments to Rule 10b-10 would: (1) Require confirmation disclosure of mark-ups and mark-downs for riskless principal transactions in debt securities; (2) require disclosure of the fact that a debt security is not rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization; (3) require confirmation disclosure of mark-ups and mark-downs in Nasdaq and exchange-listed securities; (4) require disclosure regarding whether broker-dealers are not members of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation; (5) modify the disclosure requirements with respect to certain collateralized debt securities; (6) add a preliminary note to the Rule indicating that the Rule's disclosure requirements do not limit disclosures necessary under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws; and (7) restructure the Rule. Proposed Rule 15c2&hyph;13 would require brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers (1) to disclose mark-up information in riskless principal transactions in municipal securities; and (2) to disclose when a particular municipal security is not rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. The confirmation serves several functions: it acts as a customer invoice; informs investors of the details of a transaction, allowing the investor to check for errors or misunderstandings; provides consumer information, allowing investors to evaluate the cost and quality of the services provided by broker-dealers; discloses to investors possible conflicts of interest between them and the broker-dealer; and acts as a safeguard against fraud, by permitting the customer to detect problems associated with a transaction. Implementation of a settlement period of three days (``T+3'') may alter the confirmation's utility as a customer invoice because normal confirmation delivery and the transfer of customer funds and securities may not be possible within the three day settlement period. Under the previous settlement period of five days, confirmations generally reached customers in time for the customer to review them prior to transferring funds or securities to the transacting broker-dealer. Under T+3, the customer frequently will not receive the confirmation through the mails by day three; 5 thus, shortening the settlement period may require broker-dealers either to demand funds or securities from the customer earlier than at present or to cover the cost of the transaction for a longer period of time. 5 Broker-dealers may alleviate the concerns of mail delay, for example, by sending confirmations by facsimile.
