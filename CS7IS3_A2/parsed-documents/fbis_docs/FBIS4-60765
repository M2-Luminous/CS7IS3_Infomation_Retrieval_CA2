Maj. Gen. Aleksander Einseln in remarks to reporters about his last week's visit to Moscow and talks with Russian army leadership said that Estonia wants to buy high-quality weapons at a low price. "If it is possible for us to get them from Russia, we'll buy weapons from there," he said. Einseln quoted the chief of Russia's General Staff, Col. Gen. Mikhail Kolesnikov as reconfirming that Russia will pull its troops from Estonia. "But we didn't talks about dates at the meeting," he said. The Estonian commander in chief, who visited Moscow on Apr. 20- 22, also proposed to the Russian Defense Ministry to set up a joint work group that would be able to quickly resolve all problems that may emerge in connection with the withdrawal from Estonia. Kolesnikov had said the proposal would be taken for consideration. Also discussed at the meetings were prospects for military cooperation between Estonia and Russia after the Russian troops will have left Estonia. "We don't think that our contacts with the Russian military will end after the troop withdrawal. We must also look into the future and make clear the possible directions of working closely," Einseln said. The Estonian commander in chief has earlier said that the country could start sending its cadets to be trained for officers at Russian military colleges.
