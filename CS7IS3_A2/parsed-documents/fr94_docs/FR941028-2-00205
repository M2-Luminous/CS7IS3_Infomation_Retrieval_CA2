FR941028-2-00205 FR941028-2-00109 The facility's risk assessment may identify a limited number of selected settings (e.g., bronchoscopy performed on patients suspected of having TB or autopsy performed on deceased persons suspected of having had active TB at the time of death) where the estimated risk for transmission of M. tuberculosis may be such that a level of respiratory protection exceeding the standard criteria is appropriate. In such circumstances, a level of respiratory protection exceeding the standard criteria and compatible with patient-care delivery (e.g., negative-pressure respirators that are more protective; powered air-purifying particulate respirators [PAPRs]; or positive-pressure airline, half-mask respirators) should be provided by employers to HCWs who are exposed to M. tuberculosis . Information on these and other respirators may be found in the NIOSH Guide to Industrial Respiratory Protection (55 ). C. The Effectiveness of Respiratory Protective Devices The following information, which is based on experience with respiratory protection in the industrial setting, summarizes the available data about the effectiveness of respiratory protection against hazardous airborne materials. Data regarding protection against transmission of M. tuberculosis are not available. The parameters used to determine the effectiveness of a respiratory protective device are face-seal efficacy and filter efficacy. 1. Face-Seal Leakage Face-seal leakage compromises the ability of particulate respirators to protect HCWs from airborne materials ( 154&hyph;156 ). A proper seal between the respirator's sealing surface and the face of the person wearing the respirator is essential for effective and reliable performance of any negative-pressure respirator. This seal is less critical, but still important, for positive-pressure respirators. Face-seal leakage can result from various factors, including incorrect facepiece size or shape, incorrect or defective facepiece sealing-lip, beard growth, perspiration or facial oils that can cause facepiece slippage, failure to use all the head straps, incorrect positioning of the facepiece on the face, incorrect head strap tension or position, improper respirator maintenance, and respirator damage. Every time a person wearing a negative-pressure particulate respirator inhales, a negative pressure (relative to the workplace air) is created inside the facepiece. Because of this negative pressure, air containing contaminants can take a path of least resistance into the respirator_through leaks at the face-seal interface_thus avoiding the higher-resistance filter material. Currently available, cup-shaped, disposable particulate respirators have from 0 to 20% face-seal leakage ( 55,154 ). This face-seal leakage results from the variability of the human face and from limitations in the respirator's design, construction, and number of sizes available. The face-seal leakage is probably higher if the respirator is not fitted properly to the HCW's face, tested for an adequate fit by a qualified person, and then checked for fit by the HCW every time the respirator is put on. Face-seal leakage may be reduced to less than <10% with improvements in design, a greater variety in available sizes, and appropriate fit testing and fit checking. In comparison with negative-pressure respirators, positive-pressure respirators produce a positive pressure inside the facepiece under most conditions of use. For example, in a PAPR, a blower forcibly draws ambient air through HEPA filters, then delivers the filtered air to the facepiece. This air is blown into the facepiece at flow rates that generally exceed the expected inhalation flow rates. The positive pressure inside the facepiece reduces face-seal leakage to low levels, particularly during the relatively low inhalation rates expected in health-care settings. PAPRs with a tight-fitting facepiece have <2% face-seal leakage under routine conditions ( 55 ). Powered-air respirators with loose-fitting facepieces, hoods, or helmets have <4% face-seal leakage under routine conditions ( 55 ). Thus, a PAPR may offer lower levels of face-seal leakage than nonpowered, half-mask respirators. Full facepiece, nonpowered respirators have the same leakage (i.e., <2%) as PAPRs. Another factor contributing to face-seal leakage of cup-shaped, disposable respirators is that some of these respirators are available in only one size. A single size may produce higher leakage for persons who have smaller or difficult-to-fit faces ( 157 ). The facepieces used for some reusable (including HEPA and replaceable filter, negative-pressure) and all positive-pressure particulate air-purifying respirators are available in as many as three different sizes. 2. Filter Leakage Aerosol leakage through respirator filters depends on at least five independent variables: (a) the filtration characteristics for each type of filter, (b) the size distribution of the droplets in the aerosol, (c) the linear velocity through the filtering material, (d) the filter loading (i.e., the amount of contaminant deposited on the filter), and (e) any electrostatic charges on the filter and on the droplets in the aerosol ( 158 ). When HEPA filters are used in particulate air-purifying respirators, filter efficiency is so high (i.e., effectively 100%) that filter leakage is not a consideration. Therefore, for all HEPA-filter respirators, virtually all inward leakage of droplet nuclei occurs at the respirator's face seal. 3. Fit Testing Fit testing is part of the respiratory protection program required by OSHA for all respiratory protective devices used in the workplace. A fit test determines whether a respiratory protective device adequately fits a particular HCW. The HCW may need to be fit tested with several devices to determine which device offers the best fit. However, fit tests can detect only the leakage that occurs at the time of the fit testing, and the tests cannot distinguish face-seal leakage from filter leakage. Determination of facepiece fit can involve qualitative or quantitative tests ( 55 ). A qualitative test relies on the subjective response of the HCW being fit tested. A quantitative test uses detectors to measure inward leakage. Disposable, negative-pressure particulate respirators can be qualitatively fit tested with aerosolized substances that can be tasted, although the results of this testing are limited because the tests depend on the subjective response of the HCW being tested. Quantitative fit testing of disposable negative-pressure particulate respirators can best be performed if the manufacturer provides a test respirator with a probe for this purpose. Replaceable filter, negative-pressure particulate respirators and all positive-pressure particulate respirators can be fit tested reliably, both qualitatively and quantitatively, when fitted with HEPA filters. 4. Fit Checking A fit check is a maneuver that an HCW performs before each use of the respiratory protective device to check the fit. The fit check can be performed according to the manufacturer's facepiece fitting instructions by using the applicable negative-pressure or positive-pressure test. Some currently available cup-shaped, disposable negative-pressure particulate respirators cannot be fit checked reliably by persons wearing the devices because occluding the entire surface of the filter is difficult. Strategies for overcoming these limitations are being developed by respirator manufacturers. 5. Reuse of Respirators Conscientious respirator maintenance should be an integral part of an overall respirator program. This maintenance applies both to respirators with replaceable filters and respirators that are classified as disposable but that are reused. Manufacturers' instructions for inspecting, cleaning, and maintaining respirators should be followed to ensure that the respirator continues to function properly ( 55 ). When respirators are used for protection against noninfectious aerosols (e.g., wood dust), which may be present in the air in heavy concentrations, the filter material may become occluded with airborne material. This occlusion may result in an uncomfortable breathing resistance. In health-care settings where respirators are used for protection against biological aerosols, the concentration of infectious particles in the air is probably low; thus, the filter material in a respirator is very unlikely to become occluded with airborne material. In addition, there is no evidence that particles impacting on the filter material in a respirator are re-aerosolized easily. For these reasons, the filter material used in respirators in the health-care setting should remain functional for weeks to months. Respirators with replaceable filters are reusable, and a respirator classified as disposable may be reused by the same HCW as long as it remains functional. Before each use, the outside of the filter material should be inspected. If the filter material is physically damaged or soiled, the filter should be changed (in the case of respirators with replaceable filters) or the respirator discarded (in the case of disposable respirators). Infection-control personnel should develop standard operating procedures for storing, reusing, and disposing of respirators that have been designated as disposable and for disposing of replaceable filter elements.
