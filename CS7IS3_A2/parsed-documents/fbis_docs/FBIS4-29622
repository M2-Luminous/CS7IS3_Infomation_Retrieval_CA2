Samdech: I would like to reassure you that I have no desire to become the prime minister of Cambodia. I am an old man and suffering serious illnesses. This year I must stay in the Beijing Hospital for two or three months. After leaving the hospital, I must continue receiving medical treatment until January 1995. I must get this medical treatment in Beijing and Pyongyang. In 1995 I hope to be able to visit my most beloved children, grand children, and great-grandchildren, that is, my esteemed Cambodian people. Moreover, in 1995 and the years to come, I have no desire to control the state power. Please, H.E. Samdech Hun Sen, accept my highest regards. [Dated] Beijing, 18 June 1994 [Signed] Norodom Sihanouk
