According to the document, 50,000 military cadres (including armed police officers) will be transferred to civilian posts this year. They will mainly be assigned to work in the forefront of economic construction, especially in the judicial and law-enforcement, industrial and commercial, administrative, taxation, and financial institutions. In order to mitigate difficulties in arranging housing for demobilized military cadres and their families, the State Council's Work Group for Placement of Demobilized Army Officers [WGPDAO], the Ministry of Personnel, and the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army [PLA] have worked out a set of rules for this year's work. The rules specify that with the exception of municipalities, provincial capitals, and some cities with independent budgetary status, demobilized military cadres who lived with their spouses during active service should, in principle, be assigned civilian jobs locally. If job placements need to be made in other provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, a plan should be drafted by the local department for the placement of demobilized military cadres and delivered to the Work Group for Placement of Demobilized Army Officers for coordinated arrangements. Demobilized military cadres who are willing to work in remote and difficult areas specified by the state should be appointed to corresponding positions in addition to being given preferential treatment, and their housing should be guaranteed first. The document on this year's placement of demobilized cadres also points out the need to adopt measures to attract demobilized cadres to work in tertiary industry and to encourage them to seek jobs on their own. Those who work with foreign-funded enterprises, township and town enterprises, joint ventures, private urban enterprises, and those going abroad to study may maintain their cadre status and their original wage levels in their personnel dossiers [dang an gong zi 2909 2714 1562 6327]. Priority job placements should be given to cadres at the division and regiment level. Enterprises and other civilian institutions should give priority to placing cadres transferred from the military according to their own personnel systems, as well as the political and professional merits of the cadres, and should place them in posts which correspond to their posts in the Armed Forces. During their period of employment, demobilized cadres should not be laid off at will.
