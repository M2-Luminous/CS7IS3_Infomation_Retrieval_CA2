This amount is sufficient for priority consumers, and there will also be some distributed to the general public, insofar as this can be done through the very badly damaged distribution network. Repairs are under way on two more facilities to provide Mostar with electricity. At the same time work is under way on repairing the street lights and the first light bulb has already started to illuminate Mostar.
