The motion, if adopted may produce a Legislative Council with no directly elected members, according to one of the delegates who supported the proposal. Hong Kong NPC delegate Victor Sit Fung-shuen, who supports the move, said the proposal could demonstrate the determination of the Chinese Government in setting up the second stove, while Britain sets out the framework for the pre-1997 Government. The motion reads: "In view of the lack of cooperation from the British side and the absence of a through-train arrangement [the NPC] urges the Preparatory Committee to form the first SAR government in due course under the principles set out in the Basic Law so as to facilitate the takeover of Hong Kong on July 1, 1997." It is expected that the proposal will be raised in the current session of the NPC to supplement a 1990 resolution on the formation of the Preparatory Committee as stipulated in the Basic Law. However, Mr Sit would not reveal the identities of supporters behind the proposal but said at least 10 delegates from Hong Kong and Guangdong had given their backing. Under the Basic Law, the SAR Preparatory Committee is to be set up in 1996 to prepare for the establishment of the SAR and the formation of the first post-1997 government. This will include election of the first chief executive and the so-called "through-train" arrangement for legislators elected in 1995 to continue to serve in the first SAR legislature. But, under the proposal, the Preparatory Committec would be empowered to pick the first Chief Executive, "elect" the first SAR legislature and make preparations for the executive authorities well before the handover. Under such circumstances, the first SAR may not include any directly elected legislators, according to Mr Sit. He claimed the first legislature should not include any directly-elected members considering the heavy workload of the SAR government immediately after the sovereignty handover. But he refused to disclose details of the arrangements.
