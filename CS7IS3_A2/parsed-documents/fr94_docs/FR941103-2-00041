SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with 10 C.F.R. 205.282 (b), notice is hereby given of the issuance of the Decision and Order set out below. The Decision and Order sets forth the procedures that the DOE has formulated to distribute to eligible claimants $100,697.87, plus accrued interest, obtained by the DOE pursuant to a June 21, 1982 Remedial Order. In the Remedial Order, the DOE found that, during the period August 1, 1979 through March 31, 1980, Beacon Bay had sold motor gasoline at prices in excess of the maximum lawful selling price, in violation of Federal petroleum price regulations. The OHA has determined to distribute the funds obtained from Beacon Bay in two stages. In the first stage, we will accept claims from identifiable purchasers of gasoline from Beacon Bay who may have been injured by overcharges. The specific requirements which an applicant must meet in order to receive a refund are set out in Section III of the Decision. Claimants who meet these specific requirements will be eligible to receive refunds based on the number of gallons of gasoline which they purchased from Beacon Bay. If any funds remain after valid claims are paid in the first stage, they may be used for indirect restitution in accordance with the provisions of the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA), 15 U.S.C. 4501&hyph;07. Applications for Refund must be postmarked by May 1, 1995. Instructions for the completion of refund applications are set forth in the Decision that immediately follows this notice. Applications should be sent to the address listed at the beginning of this notice. Unless labelled as ``confidential,'' all submissions must be made available for public inspection between the hours of 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, except federal holidays, in the Public Reference Room of the Office of Hearings and Appeals, located in Room 1E&hyph;234, 1000 Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20585. Dated: October 27, 1994. George B. Breznay, Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals.
