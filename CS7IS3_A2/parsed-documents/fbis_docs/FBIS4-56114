I respectfully welcome you in the studio. [passage omitted] About the immediate future, if you will allow me: You very often emphasize that you wish to hand over the departments to the new government members in an extremely careful and respectable manner. Why is it important to stress this? [Boross] I make no secret of the fact that I would like to create a tradition with this. [passage omitted] So I have prepared appropriate materials, reports--reports containing data for information as well--at the various ministries, and this kind of thing is being prepared in the office of the prime minister, too. It surprises me....[pauses] Perhaps it was Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman Gyula Horn who last night said to you first of all: I would like to see the handover report now. Well, all I can reply to this is that one should wait and see who becomes prime minister. We have to have the election, then an agreement. I will not now hand it over to two, perhaps three, or even four people--because that is how many there are, at least, of those who wish to be, or might be, prime ministers. Then naturally, I will begin contacts with them, and naturally also with the parties, after 29 May. [Announcer] You mentioned the parties. How do you see the stakes in the second round? [Boross] That the total number of deputies of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] and the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] should not reach two-thirds. For me it is less important whether the MSZP exceeds 50 percent or not; on the other hand it is very important--and everywhere I try to say this, to persuade the voters to vote but not to vote for these two parties--that they do not achieve the two-thirds majority. Two-thirds is a very dangerous threshold. In various debates these gentlemen, that is those of the SZDSZ and the MSZP, say that they will wish to cooperate with the opposition on the basis of negotiation even if they have this kind of majority. But politics has shown that it is better if guarantees remain within legal frameworks, and to overstep the two-thirds threshold is very dangerous. About 40 deputies will be needed for the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], the Christian Democrats, the Smallholders, and the Federation of Young Democrats out of the 174 individual constituencies still undecided so that there will not be a two-thirds majority. I am trying to persuade the voters, perhaps even those who voted for the two seemingly victorious parties, that it is now in their interest to vote for the above, and mainly for the candidates of the MDF. In that way there will be a healthy parliamentary life. [passage omitted]
