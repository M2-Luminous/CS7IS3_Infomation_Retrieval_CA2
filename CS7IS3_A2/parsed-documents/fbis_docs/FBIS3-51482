The committee threatens to invest an executive [words indistinct] if its demands are not taken into account. After 28 months of murderous crisis, says the committee, the solution is the streets, asserting that it is possible to have the unfair punishment inflicted by the international community on the Haitian people stopped through nonviolence. According to the committee, it is not good to witness the collapse of our social and cultural life, of our national economy, and of the actual and daily sacrifice of many thousands of Haitians. The committee hopes to mobilize all vital forces of the nation throughout the nine geographic departments of the country.
