Abizanda: "Army Will Reinforce Its Rapid Action Force With Armored Vehicles"] [Text] Madrid -- The Army will reinforce the Rapid Action Force [FAR] by including a cavalry group in this unit. Although it was not initially planned that the FAR would have this kind of unit, confining itself to light infantry forces, the experience of participation in the UN mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina has shown the feasibility of including these new resources. The FAR's final makeup will be determined following the approval of the Force's mission, depending on the redeployment plans that are currently being drafted by the three services' staffs and are at their final stage of completion. With the document approved by the defense minister 25 January -- the new Strategic Concept -- it will in turn be incorporated in the final Joint Strategic Plan, which, according to the Defense Ministry's forecasts, could be approved before the summer. The Army wishes to reinforce the FAR through the Master Plan with cavalry equipment -- especially cavalry reconnaissance armored vehicles -- in order to provide it with semiheavy equipment capable of carrying out reconnaissance missions and equipped with a gun of at least 25mm calibers. The experience of the various battalions in Bosnia-Herzegovina has shown the need for these resources, to such an extent that it is stated in military circles that Operation "Alfa Bravo" has marked the rediscovery of the cavalry. For this reason, the FAR will have a cavalry group comprising two groups (battalions) charged with reconnaissance and protection tasks. The sources consulted stated that this group will almost certainly have its base in Valladolid, although Valencia was initially chosen for its location. Two cavalry regiments belonging to the Jarama Brigade, destined to become at the most a territorial defense unit -- that is, with personnel not exceeding 30 percent of its potential, in accordance with the Master Plan -- currently have their base in Valladolid. In the latest drafts of this plan it is ruled out that the FAMET (Army Airmobile Forces) will be completely incorporated into the FAR -- the main unit to be deployed in the event of a crisis or for participation in international missions. The aforementioned sources stated that only a proportion of their six battalions will be assigned. In addition, it is confirmed that the FAR's three main units will be the paratroopers' brigade, the legionnaires' brigade, and the light airborne brigade, although some changes in their deployment have been envisaged. In the case of the legionnnaires' brigade, the idea of moving the 4th Corps from Ronda to the Viator base in Almeria seems to have been dropped. The military chiefs believe that it would be a waste to abandon its current facilities there. In this event, only the 3d Corps in Fuerteventura will move to Almeria, to be joined by an artillery group as well as a logistical unit. Units outside the peninsula in Ceuta and Melilla will remain in their current locations. The idea is that, within the FAR itself, the paratroopers' brigade and the Legion will be the initial-reaction group, while the airborne brigade, with bases in Galicia and Asturias, would be the second echelon to be deployed. In addition, the FAR's staff, under the command of General Victor Suances, remains in charge of Operation "Alfa Bravo," although the Cordoba Group's units belong not to that unit but to the Southern Operational Command and to the brigades within the Reaction Force.
