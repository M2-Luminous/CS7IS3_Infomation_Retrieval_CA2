Elsewhere, it has been announced in Baghdad that senior Iraqi officials have joined a new military and political organization called the "Saddamites Union" led by the Iraqi president's son 'Udayy. The National Congress (the Iraqi opposition's main apparatus) held an expanded meeting in its headquarters in Salah al-Din, north Iraq, last Tuesday. A statement issued by the congress, a copy of which AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has received, said that the meeting was attended by Mas'ud Barzani and Major General Hasan al-Naqib, members of the congress' presidential council, in addition to the chairman of the executive council and a number of its members and some members of the consultative constitutional council and the national society. The meeting discussed critical domestic conditions, ways of bringing about change, international developments affecting the Iraqi scene, and ways of toppling the dictatorial regime in Baghdad. The congress' statement pointed out that the meeting condemned the regime's repressive practices, which have been stepped up recently in the center and the south. [passage omitted]
