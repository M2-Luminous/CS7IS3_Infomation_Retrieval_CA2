The government should not bow to a U.S. request for setting "objective criteria" as a way to gauge the openness of Japan's markets, Kazuo Ueda, a professor of economics at the University of Tokyo, told a press conference. The United States should retract such a request and Japan should reject it and express a strong determination to protect the free trading system as "a public good of the world," Ueda said. The move came against increasing U.S. demands for Tokyo to take action to break the stalled trade "framework" talks. Ueda's group prepared a report in which they oppose what they view as the U.S. policy of managed trade. Ueda said allowing the bilateral framework talks to fail would be a better alternative for Japan than making "an easy compromise" under U.S. threats such as trade sanctions. Motoshige Itoh said the blame should be put more on the Japanese Government for "erroneously" accepting a 20 percent foreign market share target in its chip trade talks with the U.S. "That was very dangerous for free trade," said Itoh, who is also a professor of economics at the University of Tokyo. Ueda said it was "strategically" a mistake for Japan to have accepted "sets of objective criteria, either qualitative or quantitative or both" in the July 1993 summit between then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton. Ueda said the position paper, prepared last week, has already been distributed to about 170 Japanese scholars nationwide, of which 154 supported it and one opposed it. The paper will be sent to U.S. President Bill Clinton as well as the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) and the Treasury Department, he said. Japan's agreement to numerical trade targets would not serve its interest in any case, the paper said. If the step results in an import rise in one trade area, the U.S. may seek a similar request in other sectors, escalating government-led managed trade practices in order to meet the new demands, the paper said. In the event of failure to meet a pledged goal, a probable result would be punitive measures by the U.S., the paper said. To improve foreign access to Japanese markets, the paper proposed removing various government controls that hamper competition, such as restrictive business deals and unnecessary administrative rules and permits. Strict enforcement of the Antimonopoly Law, along with an easing of these regulations, would help reduce the prices gap between Japan and abroad, eventually serving the interest of Japan and foreign countries, it said.
