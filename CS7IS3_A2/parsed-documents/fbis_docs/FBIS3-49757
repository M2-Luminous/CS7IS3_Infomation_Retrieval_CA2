Good evening, General Roso. [Roso] Good evening, Madam. [Correspondent] Welcome to "Picture vs. Picture." [Roso] Thank you. [Correspondent] If I am not mistaken, this is your first public appearance since you became HVO commander two months ago. Why have you waited so long? [Roso] I was rather busy. [Correspondent] General, you had a meeting yesterday with Gen. Rasim Delic, commander of the Bosnia-Herzegovina forces, in order to agree upon the modalities of the cease-fire that should come into effect on 15 January. All that is in line with the Bonn agreement between Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic. What specifically did you agree on? [Roso] It seems to me that many things have been interpreted wrongly. We have not agreed on anything. We are waiting for basic political documents, that is, certain specific political guidelines. Consequently, we only agreed that we can proceed to establish specific modalities of the cease-fire. Nothing else was agreed upon, and nothing was signed. [Correspondent] President Izetbegovic indicated yesterday that he would not accept the Croatian president's proposal. Will that have an impact? What impact will it have on further cease-fire agreements? [Roso] You see, as long as we are talking about the political behavior of the Muslim side, it is unpredictable. This means that I am not a prophet, and I cannot tell you exactly whether or not there will be a cease-fire, whether or not we will achieve anything because there is nothing concrete. We have nothing concrete on which to base our statements as to what is really going on for the public, or even for the Army and everyone else. It is very difficult to interpret such behavior. [Correspondent] If I am not wrong, you had a meeting with Gen. Delic in Visoko on 17 December last year, and you agreed on a cease-fire that was to last from 23 December to 3 January. It was exactly then that the Muslims launched a fierce offensive on the Lasva valley. Can you comment on this and describe the situation now? [Roso] You see, we only talked about things in Visoko last time. Nothing was signed, and there was no official document. All we asked for was to spend the Christmas and New Year holidays in peace. As you know yourself, that verbal agreement was not honored, and we drew specific conclusions from such behavior. We heightened combat readiness, and the HVO was then ready to respond to any attack or surprise. We waited for the holidays and New Year in a state of readiness. [Correspondent] What is the situation like now? Where is the fiercest fighting taking place? [Roso] The situation now is relatively complex. Fighting is going on more or less everywhere--mainly in central Bosnia--where the intensity of armed clashes has reached a climax that could turn into a larger-scale escalation. More precisely, when I returned from Sarajevo yesterday, the Muslim army was continuing its offensive in the Vitez area from three directions, as well as against Novi Travnik. Thank God, all the attacks have been repelled, and the Croat nation, as well as the army, has retained its positions, . [Correspondent] General, some newspapers in Croatia are speculating about the fall of Vitez, the withdrawal of the HVO forces, and a possible fall of the arms factory in Vitez into the Muslims' hands. Is that possible? [Roso] You see, talking about the fall of Vitez, I would like to tell those eggheads that they are a bit abstract. That is out of the question as long as we are alive here, and as long as there are Croats in central Bosnia. This is not only my own stubbornness, or my own determination, but the will of the people whom I have seen recently. I even had the honor to meet some of them. It is out of the question that a part of Croat territory where the Croats in central Bosnia live should be brought into question at all and at any moment. We will surely not only fight, but also keep control of the territory. Concerning Vitez itself and the industrial plant, I personally issued a written order that the explosives factory in Vitez be destroyed if necessary, regardless of the consequences. Of course, we will take care of the people and so on, and provide maximal safety during such an operation. It is certain, however, that we will hand over the factory in one piece to no one other than the Croatian Defense Council. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Tell us, what is the role of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] in Bosnia-Herzegovina? To what degree are they impartial? [Roso] You see, I personally believe that in such a complex environment as Bosnia-Herzegovina, ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina, is in, it is very difficult to treat everyone in a fair way. I perfectly understand that side. I think that UNPROFOR's neutrality is questionable. The contacts between the HVO and UNPROFOR are relatively fair. We honor what we have pledged to honor, which is the free passage of humanitarian convoys and certain relations of a more or less technical and military nature. We have had no other relations with them. [Correspondent] There has been talk recently that the blue helmets could withdraw from Bosnia-Herzegovina. From the military point of view, what would happen if they did withdraw? [Roso] In my opinion, if the UN forces withdraw from the territory that they are occupying now, nothing special would happen. That is my personal opinion. I am more than convinced that this is nothing spectacular, but simply a way of exerting pressure on all three sides. I believe that it is not difficult to predict what would happen in the field if they withdrew. [Correspondent] What, in your opinion, is the likelihood of NATO's military intervention? [Roso] I think that is fiction. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Then, of course, the questions arise: How satisfied are you with the situation within the HVO ranks? Are there any groups which are evading your control? What kind of situation did you find when you took up your post, and what is it like now? [Roso] You see, I usually say: an event is not a process; the situation is as it is; we cannot create everything at the same time and have a perfectly formed, elite army in legal and military terms. The army is being formed gradually; it is the reality of the people in this small area, the people who displayed more than just courage, who had to sacrifice a lot for this reality and freedom, and who are continuing to make sacrifices in a chivalrous and brave manner. We are undergoing an administrative and legal reorganization of the armed forces on this part of Croatian territory. The HVO, like any other army, is embarking on its restructuring. The role of the commander, it seems to me, does not mean all that much. He only partially plays the role of an intermediary, while the army as a whole, as a culture, as a defense, is a whole process. It does not depend only on me, or on my successor or predecessor. The creation of the armed forces in the Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna will take time, but it is an interesting period in the history of this people. [Correspondent] Of course, journalists [words indistinct] that we lack information. But the fact is that there seems to have been some kind of information block recently, because, prior to Krizeljcevo Selo, the world was only concerned about the suffering of the Muslims but not of the Croats. What do you think about that? [Roso] It is very simple. Justice can have a bad roll. Everybody seeks it, but nobody really wants it. It appears when someone needs it. These are certainly orchestrated topics with set scenarios, and that should not bother us too much. We had great difficulty in breaking the information blockade as regards the Croats, as always. We have too much experience with such things. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] I must not forget to ask you: What is happening with the HVO members in Sarajevo? [Roso] The HVO members in Sarajevo have been disarmed and they are no longer -- for the time being -- an active official part of the HVO. You yourself know that there are several versions of events, but there is one realistic -- that they are completely disarmed and deprived of their rights as regards the Croatian national, ethnic body of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. [Correspondent] What is the likelihood -- in your opinion and based on your experince so far -- of re-establishing a military alliance between the Croats and the Muslims? [Roso] This is a complex question. I think that no Croat today can give you a definitive answer. But everything is possible in human life and in the life of a country. For example, France and Germany were at war for centuries and today, as far as I know, they are relatively close allies. I think that the time is not yet ripe to talk about an alliance. But we can talk about certain relations, at least human relations. We have to communicate, we have to live, we have to keep going further as a human community because others are observing us. Consequently, we will treat the Muslims as we would any other people. [Correspondent] You are a soldier with truly rich military experience. From the military viewpoint, how do you anticipate developments and the military balance in the next few months? [Roso] I think that the problem in Bosnia, particularly, and in Herzegovina, has to be taken very seriously for several reasons. One reason is that this is a question of the survival of our people, of the Croatian people, on its legal, historic, ethnic territory. We cannot raise any obstruction to this, apart from reality. [sentence as heard] We have to survive there. There is no Bosnia without the Croats. Everybody must understand this, and this must be completely clear to everyone. [Correspondent] But the front is very large. Excuse me, will this be possible without the intervention of the military forces of the Republic of Croatia. [Roso] We do not need the Croatian Army. I deeply respect it, but we have enough people and technical equipment and we know how to use it. We have technologically mastered the use of certain materials. We have certainly introduced some up-to-date military technology, some new types of equipment, and if necessary we will use it. I think that we have not yet reached that option, but I can guarantee this before God: We will use anything to preserve the Croatian people's territory in Herceg-Bosna.
