[Begin recording] [Skok] Mr. Sovic, what will Slovenia do if Croatia takes 50 percent of the electricity produced in the Krsko power plant for its own network? [Sovic] The mutual agreement that has been applied for some time, which governs the operation and exchange of power between the Croatian and Slovene electrical power systems, envisages that the so-called schedule is coordinated, and that coordination of the schedules is in fact the basis of cooperation of the two networks. In the case of the Croatian side failing to respect the Slovene quota of electricity, that is, if the schedule proposed by the Slovene side is violated, it is envisaged that, in the case of minor differences of up to 20-30 megawatts, it could be corrected within the system, but if the differences go over this limit, then the Croatian side will be warned that there is a violation of the schedule, of the available quantity. So far, international practice has shown that, in such cases, solutions have always been found, that a joint agreement has been found. If this does not happen in this case, it would be a precedent that will present the behavior of an energetic system in an unusual light. [Skok] The Krsko power plant should resume work today after 1500. In order to operate fully, it would need some four days. What would that mean regarding the dispatch of electricity to neighboring Croatia? [Sovic] The fact is that the Croatian Electricity Board has not reduced, and even less settled, the debt to the Krsko power plant. However, one should tell the public that the reports we have heard to the effect that these are debts from before 1991 are not true. The nuclear power plant says that what are involved are debts that were incurred from June to November 1993, that is, last year. The report for December will be presented soon. So far, the Croatian side has not denied this. If the Croatian side uses the electricity, that is, if the schedule is not respected and a disproportion occurs in the system, decisions will be made accordingly. [end recording]
