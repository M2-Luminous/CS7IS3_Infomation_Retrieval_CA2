The Minister of Public Health, Mr. Chen Minzhang, said that the key work in this sector will lie in the prevention of accepting "red pockets" and commission while at the same time curbing charging at one's own will. The correction of wrongdoing was put at the top of the agenda at the first national meeting held by the ministry this year. The goal set for this year is to achieve a confidence rate of 90 percent by patients in terms of the treatment they receive in hospitals. The goal for satisfaction at the medical skill shown by medical personnel and the manner they render their services is set at 80 percent by patients while the rate of settling cases involved in malpractices is also set at 80 percent. Mr. Chen stressed that hospitals of various kinds had to adopt effective measures this year to halt the paying and receiving of commission resulting from the transfer of patients to another hospital. Medical personnel found to have received commission for transferring patients to another hospital for treatment will be seriously dealt with. Administration of the financial system in a hospital must be put under strict control in a bid to ban the practice of receiving commission by medical personnel. Mr. Chen added that regulations on the charging of fees had to be observed. Hospitals in various places which set up their own system of charging had to stop such practices at once while other hospitals which charge a fee higher than the stated standard fee had to correct their practice as soon as possible. Adjustment of charging of fees must follow certain procedures in accordance with stated regulations and approval by higher authorities is absolutely necessary. Work on tackling the acceptance of "red pockets", commission and the practice of random charging proved a success to a certain extent last year. Public health bureaus in Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai handed down disciplinary measures or economic punishment to nearly 300 persons guilty of the above-mentioned practices. Incomplete statistics from 20 provinces show that cases involving random charging by various hospitals were put at 500 and 170 of them whose fees were randomly charged were cancelled.
