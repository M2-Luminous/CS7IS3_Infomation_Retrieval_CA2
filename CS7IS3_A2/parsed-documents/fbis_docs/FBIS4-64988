He said he wanted to observe a reserved attitude as president of the European Commission during the French European election campaign. During the presentation of Europe Day at the Odeon yesterday, organized by the European Movement, the outgoing Commission president nonetheless seized the opportunity to express his "anger" and "disappointment" at the "timidity" of the pro-Europeans who do not dare "admit" that "the European idea transcends political divisions." On the other hand, the anti-Europeans are much more aggressive, producing numerous "glaring inaccuracies" and spouting "nonsense" about Brussels. This lack of combativeness in France among those who claim to believe in Europe is, in his opinion, unique in Europe: "There is not a single country in the rest of the European Union in which things are going as they are in France." What about the European crisis? At most, it is "a crisis of growth" but not a "regression." He also warned those who, "forgetting the past," run the risk of new "wars of religion." And yet, the example of Bosnia proves, he thinks, that Europe is less protected than ever from a tragic "confusion between ethnic group and nation." As for the Maastricht Treaty, it did not take account of the reservations expressed by the Commission. A treaty which he nonetheless defended in retrospect because "Europe's progress was at stake."
