The government's bill on the new defense model is just seven articles long. [Defense] Minister Cesare Previti read in a single breath the text destined to reducing the draft substantially over time, giving birth to an army consisting solely of professionals. He then signed and commented with satisfaction: "This is a liberal reform. What we save will be reinvested in the interests of Italy's international role." But in this interview with IL GIORNALE, the first granted to a daily newspaper, in which he speaks about defense problems, Previti does not renounce discussing "pure" politics. For example, about Forza Italia, his own party. "No, I do not personally believe that it will become a new DC [Christian Democratic Party] as under the old system. The pivotal point of the majority, yes. No danger of recycling. The important thing is that Silvio [Berlusconi] continue his path undaunted. He must avoid compromises on two fundamental items: free trade and the majority principle, which means that the person in power should not make easy agreements with the opposition. [Guiglia] Minister, why do you not completely abolish useless military service? [Previti] The draft remains an essential factor of national cohesion and of morality, because it brings the people closer to and ties them indissolubly to the Armed Forces. The solution in the Italian case, also based on the work of my predecessors, is that of a mixed model. What we are looking for in the future is to have 60,000 to 75,000 long-term volunteers and 70,000 to 85,000 draft soldiers. We are also expecting to reduce the overall number of soldiers from the present 335,000 to 250,000 officers and noncommissioned officers included. [Guiglia] The Army, the Navy, and the Air Force. Which comes off worst? [Previti] During the past three years the budget cuts have affected in particular the technological part of the Armed Forces. I would say that the Navy and the Air Force have been severely penalized. But, in any case, it would be a mistake to make a classification of past policy. Right now the important thing is to recoup part of the old budget cuts and to pay for the reform, in part also with the money which is saved. [Guiglia] Are you for or against [former President] Cossiga's proposal to unify the Sismi [Intelligence and Military Security Service] and Sisde [Intelligence and Democratic Security Service]? [Previti] I do not agree. Just last Tuesday [31 May] I visited SISMI's headquarters at Forte Braschi. I was impressed by the efficiency and the high technological preparedness of the people I met. Perhaps the fact that military people predominate at SISMI gives the feeling of greater organization and a very professional approach. Their tasks seemed to me to be very well defined. [Guiglia] Regularly, someone calls for the demilitarization of the Carabinieri. Can you tell us in advance what your reply will be? [Previti] Please. I am the first to want renewal, but not mental agitation, which is what the demilitarization of the Carabinieri would end up being. In the reform which the government is right now presenting to parliament there are more than a few genuine novelties. I am thinking of the introduction of voluntary service for women. But I am also thinking of the tens of thousands of people who turn around the so-called defense industry and who can set themselves in motion again to give birth to the new model of the Armed Forces, based more on quality than on quantity. We are also studying the possibility of involving schools in the museums which testify to Italian military history. And it would not be a bad thing to freshen up the 2 June [Festival of the Republic] or 4 November [Italian Armistice Day] celebrations. In short, the objective is to increasingly integrate civilian society and the military world. [Guiglia] It is only in politics that "partnership" does not apply? [Previti] To the Left as well, the logic is gaining strength of a healthy distinction between government and opposition. Cacciari, Salvi, and Napolitano [all Democratic Party of the Left] are already of this opinion. I would add that anyone who has had key positions in the First Republic, the partnership republic, should hand in his resignation. It is not for this reason that the "old hands" will be marginalized by the new majority. Beware of purges. But beware of not clarifying things. [Guiglia] Also for the Senate presidency? [Previti] Better to be defeated because one has failed to give birth to a majority than to win because of a hidden agreement with the opposition. Journalist.
