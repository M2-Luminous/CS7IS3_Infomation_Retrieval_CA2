The first threesome of probable victors consists of Leonid Kravchuk, Ivan Plyushch, and Leonid Kuchma. Of course, a fascinating spectacle awaits us--the "bear fight under the rug" promise to be super-entertaining, better than the Western preelection shows. Indeed, only the results are known beforehand--no matter how you shuffle our far from saintly threesome, things will not be improved. Each of them has made a worthy contribution over the past two years or so to "getting the government mired down in communist dogma and corruption, while the words 'Ukrainization' and 'Ukraine' resound as synonyms for economic impoverishment, collapse, and resistance to reforms." But let us take a closer look at their prospects. Leonid Kravchuk It would seem his political star has faded. Though as recently as January his ratings were high. His base--the old Communist Party nomenklatura, established structures in the localities, the "party of power"--seemed to be powerful and unshakeable. But on the very eve of activity of the Supreme Council, "at the signal" as chessplayers say, Ivan Plyushch somewhat unexpectedly outplayed that skillful grand master of political intrigue, Leonid Kravchuk, confronting him not only with the prospect of the presidential elections, but with the dismantling of the organs of executive authority. Like last year, this year has not been most successful for the current president. Especially during the spring, in April. According to all assessments, the elections to the parliament did not have to be held. A great deal of effort was expended to this end. Wily maneuvers were plotted, districts were "stuffed" with deputies, and "his" people worked tirelessly. But despite the predictions, the people of Ukraine went to the elections even on a more massive scale than was the case in December in Russia, where the campaigning was quite heavy. We will risk making the conjecture that if the presidential election is in fact held, L. Kravchuk will lose. It is possible he will not even make it to the second round. Naturally, all the actions of his team--the "party of power"--will be aimed at postponing the election. The newspapers, radio, and television, devoted to L. Kravchuk, have already set about accomplishing this (at the same time they are attempting to resuscitate the fairly shaken prestige of L. Kravchuk, to ideologically dust off his somewhat worn political image, publishing all kinds of tales of the variety that appeared in KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI, and not only there). To the extent I am aware, an address by L. Kravchuk to the parliament and the people on the need to postpone the time frame for the presidential election is in the preparation stage. I believe every possible alternative will be employed, up to and including a referendum--to which, incidentally, the president has the right. In other words, the tactics are simple--prevent the election even if it kills him. Here like never before another wave of anti-Russian hysteria will come in handy, as will the search for enemies of sovereign power, the "fifth column" headed by that ardent enemy of L. Kravchuk and of the nation--Leonid Kuchma. Well, such is the logic of the struggle for power. And as yet no one has ever voluntarily rejected it--power. Except perhaps for Nikolay II, and he was actually coerced. Standing behind L. Kravchuk is the giant mass of today's managers and administrators. They will do everything in their power to see to it that no one else is allowed to get near the feeding trough, pretty heavily depleted though it is. The ideological refrain of the "party of power" and national-democratic forces connected to it: "To date there is no guarantor of sovereignty and statehood in Ukraine other than Leonid Kravchuk." This is all quite sad, for in maintaining our present situation, our economic, political, and spiritual crises will become irreversible. Ivan Plyushch Candidate Number One. His popularity among the people is legendary and anecdotal. "Wait, wait,"--they told me in one village, drowning out the loudspeaker. "We had a stableman like that in our crew who would stir everything up. Could this be him?" Hidden behind a somewhat feigned simplicity, at times with excessively painstaking effort to mispronounce his speech--not overly literate to begin with--is a keen, shrewd mind, phenomenal memory, and the ability to listen and to hear. Ivan Plyushch is a 100-percent "crafty Ukrainian," and rural residents constitute his electorate. Just the appearance of Plyushch on the television screen is enough to elicit a grimace of skepticism on reflective city intellectuals. Which he realizes, incidentally, and answers representatives of this "narrow segment" in the same vein. As if to say--you know what they are all about, writers... His base is the powerful agrarian lobby of large kolkhoz and sovkhoz owners, the diversified system of rural soviets, etc. This system remains intact probably only in Ukraine, and is named not in jest the party of Plyushch. From director of a poultry farm--to leader of parliament, and then president of the state. Those who have decided to vote for him see their own--the Ukrainian dream, personified in this manner. Open and direct, from the lower classes, he speaks simply, like most of those raised in the rye and wheat. Everything about him is clear. His language is strong if need be, and he can be scolding. But he can withdraw just as quickly, forgive and forget. And he will share his piece of bread and butter. He will be a fair president, and perhaps will give some land. God grant him health! Meanwhile, the latest steps and actions of Ivan Plyushch show that he has become significantly more skilled in politics, where the simpleminded and somewhat eccentric are left in the background. "I do not change my position time and again, as others do. Incidentally, those who do change their position, who adjust it--have many opponents. Leonid Makarovich likes this very much. He believes a politician is one who does all this. I always disagree with him here. He once said that a politician is a person who is able to discern the mood of the masses. But I believe a politician takes a mood to the masses and then leads them behind it, behind himself. Otherwise the politician is not moving ahead of the masses, but is instead following--which is dangerous." We will risk making the conjecture that if the election is held, and if Plyushch and Kuchma make it to the finish line, Plyushch will be the victor. He is the more "pro-Ukrainian" candidate. Leonid Kuchma One leader of the national-democratic movement made a dreadful attributive comment with respect to the former Komsomol organizer, party organizer, and Yuzhmash director, stating that he destroyed the government and then left with extremely high standing. Here is the opinion of a former comrade-in-arms. "He was conniving with the mafia behind my back, and I--fool that I was--trusted him." His current rival for the post says: "A model protege of the military-industrial complex and mafia structures." This in no way completes all the "gingerbread" attributed to Leonid Kuchma, an outwardly calm and intelligent man with pleasant manners and measured, quiet voice, the person who first spoke of the existence of a mafia at the highest levels--selling out the country wholesale and retail. At that time his words aroused the people, and the hope emerged that perhaps everything would change, that life would become at least a little bit better and less dangerous. They called Kuchma's Cabinet of Ministers the government of last hope. Alas time passed, and the nomenklatura openly blocked and perverted the reforms. The procuracy "delayed," the Ukrainian Security Council and Ministry of Internal Affairs found themselves as always "outside the loop," and mafia clans rallied, "knocking" the supporters of reforms out of the government--I. Yukhnovskyy, V. Pynzenyk, Yu. Ioffe--while Kuchma gave into them all too obediently. We know full well how everything turned out. But his memory among the people is a kind one. Perhaps because--to the same degree as Plyushch--he responds to the expectations of a fairly large number of average citizens of the eastern region. He speaks Russian better than Ukrainian, is not hurrying towards relations with Russia but is not shying away from the issue either. He is trying to clarify, at least for himself, exactly what it is we are trying to build--whether it is a market with capitalism, or socialism with rationing for some and special distribution for others. Though it would seem no one else in Ukraine knows either. The "red" directors, military-industrial complex, and Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs are behind Kuchma. Against him are all the national-democrats, the "party of power," and Plyushch's group. The alignment is clearly skewed in their direction. However, sociologists assert that were the election held today, he would gather the most votes (15.2 percent--twice as many as L. Kravchuk). Who will gain the upper hand? Vladimir Lanovyy A hopeless reformer and market advocate. He has his own concept of extricating Ukraine from its economic crisis, but no one has ever asked for it. Under pressure from democratic forces, he was brought into the conservative government of V. Fokin as deputy prime minister and minister of economics. A "strange bird" there, time and again he escaped the attacks of experienced apparatchiks, but was soon dismissed by edict of the president. Why--we do not yet know. In ordinary life he is an intelligent, soft-spoken, likable individual, an outstanding family man. He is an analytical storehouse of knowledge, more a theoretician than a practical organizer. He is hindered by a lack of experience in apparatus work. Following his departure from the Cabinet of Ministers, he founded the Center for Market Reforms, where he assembled bright minds. He is stubbornly biding his time, polishing up his economic concepts. I am firmly convinced that Lanovyy's time will come and his theories will prove useful. Many entrepreneurial circles support him, people for whom it is already too late to stop or ponder about where we are headed. They believe him and have fallen in line. Now guarantees by the state are needed. Guarantees which, in their opinion, may be obtained if Lanovyy becomes president. All the same, I believe his chances of victory are not great. It is not yet Lanovyy's time. Aleksandr Moroz, Petr Simonenko, and Others Nor is it the time of Moroz or Simonenko. In fact their very nomination is somewhat strange. On the one hand, yesterday's second and even third-rank Communist Party functionaries are all too fervently thirsting for power. They are displaying their former eagerness, not ashamed of elbowing aside not only inveterate Rukh people, but each other as well. "We have certain grievances against the Ukrainian Communist Party which, despite agreements reached previously, has nominated candidates in districts we already occupy. There has not been such action on the part of the socialists." Maybe in revenge the communists conducted their own conference behind closed doors, discussing "intra-party matters." Incidentally, as we know, a parliamentary-presidential structure is set into the program of the socialists, and so their claims of victory are understandable. It is another matter with the Communist Party of Ukraine, which rejects out of hand the presidential form of rule. "But look, we have decided to participate, taking into account the circumstances of the present moment." There will be some laughter if they come out and take the election--what do they do with the presidency? But then again, no problem. You can always adjust the statutes a bit--it would not be the first time! Of course, neither the socialists nor the communists have any chance of winning the presidential election--so painfully importunate are their slogans and the deceitful actions we are so sick and tired of. I believe they too understand this and will therefore use the present election round, which holds no prospects for them, in the vein of the well-known sporting principle--the main thing is to participate, "to get exposure." And so, we have three clear leaders from among the nominated candidates, those same familiar faces--L. Kravchuk, I. Plyushch, and L. Kuchma. Leonid Kravchuk will most probably not register as an official candidate, but instead propose to the parliament that the election be postponed. In that event, whether the election is postponed or not, the most probable contenders will be down to two--Leonid Kuchma and Ivan Plyushch. I will state quite frankly that the choice is not very great. And for Ukraine, this is a major catastrophe. P.S. When this issue was going to print, it became clear that the number of candidates for the office of president had increased. Among those additionally seeking the post: former Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Pynzenyk and Nikolay Rud, associate at a Kiev institute of higher education. It cannot be ruled out that the ranks of contenders will be further augmented in the coming days, to the extent that the presidential election ballots may have to be printed on two sides. But, we are familiar with this kind of thing...
