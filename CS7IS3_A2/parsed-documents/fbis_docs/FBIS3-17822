At 0430, following 17 hours of difficult talks in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb, an agreement was signed envisaging a cease-fire and the withdrawal of weapons and troops from the demarcation line in the areas of Croatia under UN control. In accordance with the document, which comes into effect on 0900 on 4 April, heavy weapons are to be withdrawn 20 km, light weapons 10 km, and troops 1,000 meters away from the 300-km long demarcation line. In an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, Vitaliy Churkin, representative of the Russian Federation president, stressed the high degree of coordination of the actions of the key members of the international community taking part in the settlement of the Yugoslav crisis -- Russia, the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations. At key moments in the talks, representatives of these countries and organizations acted from united positions, making it possible to nudge the sides in the direction of accords. This was an extremely important experience of Russo-American interaction in tackling complex critical problems. It could be said that the preparation of the Serb-Croat agreement would be a good model for continuing work on other aspects of the Yugoslav settlement, Vitaliy Churkin stressed. The Zagreb agreement is of very great significance for the normalization of Serb-Croat relations. We expect that in two weeks' time there should follow a similar Serb-Croat meeting on economic questions, connected with vital supplies for the regions under UN control and adjacent territories. Then it will be possible to gradually go over to tackling the most difficult questions concerning their political status, Vitaliy Churkin said. The high-ranking Russian diplomat recalled that the UN Security Council resolution extending the mandate of peacekeeping forces in the former Yugoslavia stipulates the possibility of air support for the "blue helmets" in case of attacks. Since the UN troops are stationed on territories controlled by the Serbs, who have repeatedly been attacked by the Croatian side, this provision serves as a certain guarantee that incidents of this sort will be avoided in the future. Russia has its own interests here, since its peacekeeping battalion is deployed in one of these areas, and we want the interests of its safety to be met, V. Churkin noted. The Russian Federation president's special envoy did not rule out the possibility that the next round of Serb-Croat talks on economic issues will also be held in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb.
