This is the second group of state bonds issued this year. The first issuance of five billion yuan in six-month bonds occurred a week ago, on January 23. Both offerings are in the paperless form, that is, the purchase, trading or interest payment on the bonds will be done through computer networks of the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The one-year bonds carry an interest rate of 11.98 percent while the rate on half-year bonds is 9.8 percent, one percentage point higher than the bank deposit rates for the corresponding periods. The 15 billion yuan in bonds have all been sold to 35 primary dealers, namely banks and non-banking financial institutions, according to an official with the Ministry of Finance. This year's issuance is two months earlier than usual, and the short-term bond is being tested for the first time in China. The early issuance is mainly intended to lay the groundwork for the central bank's open market operation, which will formally begin in early March in Shanghai. It will also help to cover the huge financial expenditure during the peak time of Spring Festival, which falls on February 10 this year, the financial official noted. The bonds can be held by banks, enterprises and individuals. However, the Shanghai Stock Exchange can only open accounts for individuals who buy at least 10,000 yuan worth of bonds. But the state will soon set up a treasury bond fund for the convenience of small investors, he said. He said the total amount of this year's state bonds will be discussed and approved by the National People's Congress in March. Nonetheless, more than 70 percent of this year's total issuance will be conducted in paperless bonds. The state will still issue some amount of paper-note bonds, mostly in three-year and five-year terms to sell in small cities and towns which cannot be covered by the computer networks in the Shanghai Stock Exchange, as well as in rural areas.
