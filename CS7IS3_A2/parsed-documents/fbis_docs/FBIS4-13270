In his debate on the issue of social justice, Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani referred to subsidies paid by the government, and said: The situation regarding subsidies during recent years has in effect constituted a kind of injustice. This has of course been alleviated. Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani then set out to describe the details of this year's budget, and said: During the current year [ending 21 March 1995], 600 billion tomans will be paid in form of various subsidies. Of course, a large proportion of these will be distributed in a fair manner. However, this system must undergo a comprehensive reform. The president added: About half of the said sum will be earmarked to basic commodities, so that the people can obtain cheap edible oil, rice, and sugar. Of course, in a healthy economy, only those with a low purchasing power should be able to benefit from such subsidies. Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani, moreover, announced the sums allocated to payment of various subsidies, and added: In sectors such as agriculture, culture, education, and purchase of medicine and dried milk, payment of subsidies to the deprived strata who are covered by Imam Relief Committee or other organization is fair. However, payment of bread subsidies does not constitute a fair system. This system should be revised according to a systematic plan, with a view to political and social prerogatives, so that the said subsidies may be available only to certain strata. One must also do something about fuel, so that by regulating the method of payment of these subsidies, fairness can be introduced into this system. This is because every year around 20 trillion rials of the country's reserves are spent on fuel without any considerable return. The situation in other countries, however, is clearly different. The president stressed: The present situation, under which everyone, even the well-off strata and those without a real need, benefit from subsidies, is an injustice to the really needy people. This situation should be changed. The president then referred to the occasion of Army Day, 29 Farvardin [18th April]. He praised the services of the army of the Islamic Republic of Iran during the years after the victory of the Islamic revolution. He said: The role of the army during the war was highly worthy of praise. Alongside the sacrifices of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps, Basij and other defense institutions, the army was a highly reliable entity. He then said that solving the problems of military personnel is in harmony with solving the problems of society's other strata. On Bosnia, the president said: Because of apathy and the weak attitude of the United Nations, and other organizations, the Serbs' impudence has reached a level that they even express an opposition toward the forces of that [UN] organization. The interim Friday imam of Tehran added: This ugly attitude of the West has, in fact, caused disgust among human society; since the experience of the Iraqi attack on Kuwait has shown that Western powers, if they wish, can stop the Serbs' aggression. Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani described the continuing clashes in Afghanistan as regrettable and called on the leaders of jihadi groups to show forgiveness and refrain from seeking power so as to reach a solution to the existing problems. The president said: The continuation of this situation has, in practice, made it impossible to help the Afghan people.
