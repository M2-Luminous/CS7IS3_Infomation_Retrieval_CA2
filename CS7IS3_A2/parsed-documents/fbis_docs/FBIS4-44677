ARTEMIS is the first ESA [European Space Agency] program in which the Italian company [Alenia Spazio] is project leader. It will be used to test new technologies for links between space vehicles and between space vehicles and earth in preparation for the activities of the future DRS [data relay satellite] system. This will include -- via the Silex system developed by the ESA, CNES [National Center for Space Studies], and MMS -- high-density (50 Mbps [megabits per second]) digital transmission between satellites using optical frequencies, or by laser beams. One of the terminals will be installed on ARTEMIS and the other on the French remote-sensing satellite SPOT-4. The images photographed by the latter, and the signals transmitted by the Japanese satellite OICETS, will be retransmitted to earth by ARTEMIS. For ARTEMIS, Alenia Spazio had already ordered repeaters in the S (2 GHz [gigahertz]) and Ka (23 GHz) bands from Alcatel Espace whose suppliers are Italy's FIAR, Germany's ANT, Canada's Comdev, and its own Belgian and Spanish subsidiaries.
