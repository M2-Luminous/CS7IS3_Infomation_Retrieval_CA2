He also said the president spent yesterday conducting business as usual, as any president would, including attending some meetings. One of the meetings was with the boy who will be the poster child for this year's telethon. The president later met with the finance minister and then worked on a message he will address to the nation, possibly today, because he could not do it yesterday, given several priority commitments, Loarca Guzman emphasized.
