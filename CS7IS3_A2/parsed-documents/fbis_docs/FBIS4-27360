It has decided to cultivate as an external sales enterprise the software business, which previously had been kept to a minimum and was centered on that for the group. It has also begun to put effort into scouting overseas software. Moreover, the fully financed NEC Home Electronics (NEC-HE) will jointly own software for high-performance game machines that will go on sale at the end of the year along with the NEC personal computer "PC 98," and support establishment of the external sales business of the software itself. While the poor earnings rate of hardware continues, the NEC group plans to expand the software business of the whole group from the two sections of personal computers by the main company and game machines by NEC-HE. NEC established the "C&C Multimedia Business Promotion Division" on 25 April to develop the multimedia business for the whole group, citing the slogan, "Multimedia NEC." (President Tadahiro Sekimoto) The "Personal Software Business Division" that was established on 8 April will be in charge of the software business. The policy is to cultivate external sales of software of about several billion yen in the first fiscal year and about 30 billion yen after three years. However, the personal computer has a low popularity of 12 percent and users are limited. For this reason, NEC-HE, which has been selling game machines for home use since 1987, "has increased in the importance it occupies in the multimedia strategy of all NEC" (Seiji Nakano, NEC-HE director). Under these conditions, NEC-HE will put on sale in the latter part of November the high performance game machine "FX (tentative name) carrying a 32-bit MPU (microprocessing unit). The company was the first in the industry to put on sale a CD-ROM (read-only memory using compact disks) game machine in 1988, but it was not compatible with the personal computer "98 Multi" previously carrying an NEC CD-ROM drive and its software. That is considered "a link in the all NEC multimedia business" (NEC-HE president Tomoo Miyawaki) with the FX, and software for the FX can also be used on the PC 98. "We plan a multiplier effect by promoting development and sales of software from the business aspect for NEC proper and from the games and other personal user side for NEC-HE." President Miyawaki, who is concurrently appointed to managing director in charge of the NEC Personal C&C Business Group, thus relates the aim to promote fusion of the FX and PC 98 series. In addition to being able to use it on the PC 98, software for the FX can be connected as a CD-ROM drive device of the 98. Behind compatibility for FX software is the intense 32-bit game machine sales war. Matsushita Electric Industrial already has put on sale the "Real." In the same time period as NEC-HE, Sony will put on sale the "Play Station," and Sega Enterprises, the "Saturn (tentative name)," respectively. For that reason, there is a sense of crisis that "we must make effective use of the market for the PC 98 which has about 7.67 million machines distributed" (Director Nakano). Furthermore, since it takes money and time to produce 32-bit CD-ROM software, software companies look at the state of popularity of the manufacturer's hardware. For this reason, being able to jointly own the best-seller personal computer 98 and software is a strategy that will promote software production by "making it a plus for software company earnings" (President Miyawaki). President Miyawaki always asserts that "if a game character can be skillfully incorporated into software for the personal computer, it will sell." For this reason, by having compatibility between FX software and the 98, they expect it to be linked to increases in external software sales of NEC proper, and not just the FX. Along with the importance of the software business being greater than ever in the multimedia era, its multiple applicability will be necessary. The framework for the system in charge of development and sales within the group has already been created. Moreover, NEC Avenue (Kawasaki; president, Seiji Nakano) has embarked on strengthening game music CD's. With the FX on sale, and personal computers and game machines, a system will be provided enabling use of software on three types within the group. How this organization operates in the future will hold the key to the success of the software business for the whole group and the realization of the ideal that "the sales ratio of hardware and software inherently should be one to one" (President Miyawaki).
