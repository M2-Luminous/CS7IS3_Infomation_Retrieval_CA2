Recap of Election Results, Geographical Distribution Warsaw GAZETA WYBORCZA in Polish on 21 June in a page 1 article devoted to the local election results reports that there is no decisive winner in the self-government elections. Among the parties that won majorities of the mandates, are the Freedom Union (UW), the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), and some right-wing coalitions. On 20 June, the State Electoral Commission obtained results from 36 out of the 50 existing voivodships (large administrative units). The average turnout was 36 percent, and it was higher in rural areas (38.5 percent) than in municipalities (29.2 percent). The highest turnout was recorded in Leszno and Poznan Voivodships (43, and 42 percent, respectively), while the lowest turnout was in Lomza, Gorzow, and Slupsk (23-24 percent). GAZETA WYBORCZA states that "In the majority of big cities, there are no definite winners, but SLD, the right wing, and UW, predominate. The Confederation for an Independent Poland (KPN), the Union of Labor (UP), and the Polish Peasant Party (PSL) scored poor results. SLD gained the largest number of mandates in 17 voivodship cities. That was the case in Lodz, Kalisz, Czestochowa, Olsztyn, Suwalki, Koszalin, Slupsk, Legnica, Szczecin, Radom, Kielce, Ciechanow, Bydgoszcz, Sieradz, Ostroleka, Plock, and Zielona Gora." GAZETA WYBORCZA reports that "Right-wing parties gained the largest number of votes in six voivodship capitals: Bialystok, Lomza, Rzeszow, Krosno, Siedlce, and Lublin. UW won in six voivodship cities: Warsaw, Gdansk, Poznan, Krakow, Bielsko-Biala, and Wroclaw. PSL does not count in big cities. KPN was defeated in places where it did not form a coalition with the center right-wing. UP also received poor results." The daily adds that "The conclusion from election arithmetic is that the winners will be in power on their own only in a small number of cities, and therefore coalitions will be required almost everywhere." Politicians Comment RZECZPOSPOLITA on 21 June reports on page 2 that in cities, the number of voters was generally lower than in rural gminas (small administrative units), and the low turnout is bound to have an impact on the composition of future councils. According to politicians, only the most disciplined voters and those with clear political values, decided to vote on 19 June. The daily notes that according to UW's Henryk Wujec, supporters of SLD and PSL are the most disciplined members of the electorate. Wujec also says that the two parties have enough money, as well as the appropriate structures to conduct elections, enabling them to partially regain the positions they had lost in the 1990 elections. But that does not mean that it will be easy for PSL or SLD to establish gmina councils, since their prevalence is not that big. As for UW, it won the elections in the cities, which is where it has always enjoyed high support. RZECZPOSPOLITA quotes Wujec: "The voters were deprived of information regarding the meaning of the elections themselves, as well as the candidates. That is the reason for the low turnout. Among others, this demonstrates that society does not feel like a participant in a democratic system." According to the paper, PSL's Dobrosz describes the low turnout in cities as follows: "It means that 70 percent of society does not want to bear responsibility for power sharing. It is a very bad trend that should be understood as a vote of no confidence for everybody." The 21 June edition of ZYCIE WARSZAWY on page 3 cites SLD's Aleksander Kwasniewski who points out that his party is "quite satisfied, having obtained 10 times more councillors than we had before the elections." Kwasniewski adds: "The trend from the parliamentary elections, was maintained." The daily notes that according to Pawel Piskorski, a member of the UW Presidium, "the post-"Solidarity" parties did not repeat their mistake from the parliamentary elections -- they were united this time." Kazimierz Ujazdowski of the Conservative Coalition -- which ran in the elections under "Alliance for Poland" -- describes the elections as a "success." "The right wing has its natural, substantial electorate, and when united, it scores a success," Ujazdowski notes. In his view, the turnout was better in towns, with their efficiently functioning municipal councils. Romuald Szeremietiew of the Movement for the Republic expresses the view that the local elections should strengthen some uniting tendencies present in the right-wing camp. He is glad the elections had "a political character" and that those unassociated with political parties were not successful; he sees this as "a good future sign for Polish democracy." ZYCIE WARSZAWY continues its report, pointing out that Rafal Zienkiewicz, a representative of the Union for Real Politics, is less enthusiastic about the election results, which "did improve the party's standing but did not meet its expectations." He is surprised by the low turnout among the young generation, and he maintains that none of the existing parties are able to "win people's souls." "We need new faces in politics, and a new vision for Poland," says Zienkiewicz. Newspapers Comment GAZETA WYBORCZA on 21 June carries a page 1 editorial by editor in chief Adam Michnik. Michnik notes that "local governments have slipped out of the control of the ruling coalition comprised of SLD and PSL." Since there is no decisive winner, everything now depends on who will enter into what kind of arrangement with whom. Michnik places major responsibility on UW's behavior in seeking coalition partners for itself, stating: "Everything depends on UW, and on whether it is able to find the best partners in the right- or left- wing bloc, since only UW is in a position to talk to both sides." Michnik also stresses that "specific issues and pragmatism, as well as persistently rational programs and real abilities, must outweigh ideological arguments" in the process of forming the newly-elected self-governments. RZECZPOSPOLITA on 21 June on page 2 under the "Observations" rubric carries a commentary by Bozena Wawrzewska noting that in the elections, party tickets prevailed over coalitions of residents, self-governmental activists, and citizens' groups. According to Wawrzewska, there could be several possible reasons for such an occurrence: A weak self-government mentality or a poor understanding of the essence of local authorities as opposed to central authorities, clear trends toward a centralization of the state demonstrated by the governing coalition, social disappointment with those self-government structures that have been in office thus far, or finally, a lack of clarity regarding the present situation, the programs, or of who is who in the political scene. Wawrzewska predicts that the parties forming the governing coalition will gain the largest number of mandates but she also notes one important difference between these elections and the September 1993 elections: This time, the victory will not be as overwhelming since the right wing has now marked its presence much more clearly. It is possible that in forming the various coalitions, right-wing parties drew the proper conclusion from last year's defeat when each right-wing party ran separately. Wawrzewska also notes that UW most probably confirmed its place on the political scene -- despite unclear programs and ambiguous behavior -- while UP's poor results are a real surprise, especially since it proclaims itself to be a "modern left-wing" party. TRYBUNA on 21 June carries on pages 1 and 2 an article by Dr. Jacek Raciborski, a Warsaw University sociologist, where he notes: "It can be presumed preliminarily, that both the coalition and the opposition electorates have demobilized themselves by quite equal parts. This is demonstrated by the configuration of votes in Warsaw, which was similar to those of the parliamentary elections." Dr. Raciborski believes that "The election campaign was not intensive enough, there was not enough civic education to mobilize people to participate in the elections. But one must also emphasize the weak reflection of the configuration of the political scene in the social mentality. In addition, local councils are not perceived as important elements of the power structure. It is part of the crisis in citizen mentality. "I suppose the coalition will strengthen its position in many cities but it will fail to gain a dominant influence over local councils. In my view, the coalition will lose the elections, for instance, in the Malopolska region. Regional authorities will not be a direct reflection of the Sejm arrangement," adds Dr. Raciborski.
