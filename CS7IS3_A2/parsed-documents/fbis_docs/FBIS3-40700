Their monthly salaries range between 16,000 shekels (for a manager) to 3,000 shekels (for a "common" laborer). But the kibbutzniks' wages do not go into their pockets. Most of them do not even bother to look at their amounts. In any event, it cannot affect their standard of living. Abarot's turning to the stock exchange about a year and a half ago, together with an external partner, necessitated implementing several "capitalistic" upheavals in the plant: establishing a graduated wage also for the kibbutznik workers; organizating a "Corporation B.M."; the appointment of a board of directors, on which representatives of the public also sit; and the implementation of a complete separation between the plant and the administrative and financial system of the owners--that is, the kibbutz. The plant has ceased being just one of the kibbutz's branches. Today, the economic situation of the kibbutz is not reflected in the situation of the plant, and the kibbutz treasurer cannot withdraw monies from the plant in order to fill the kibbutz coffers. If one of the two entities--the plant or the kibbutz, goes bankrupt--those who seize its assets will not be able to touch the assets of the other. Today, in Be'erot Yitzhaq, no one wants to go backwards. The manager of the industrial branch in the kibbutz, Eli'ezer Shafir, is responsible for three local industrial plants. According to him, it is already clear that, thanks to the turning to the stock exchange, Abarot's production has gone up (in 1992 it exceeded 40 million shekels) and that the management and the control methods have become more professional. "Now we are forced to insist on quarterly financial reports, and we have brought to the plant a director-general brought in from the city, 'Amos Benada." But Shafir admits that there are also squeaks: kibbutz members feel that the plant was expropriated from them entirely; they argue that the management and the board of directors do not share information with them. Today it is already forbidden to report in the bulletin or in the kibbutz assembly doubts concerning planned transactions. Thus, for example, the report on the purchase of 50 percent of the shares of the "Fibertek" plant was given to the members only after the deal had already been completed. The Abarot plant, the pioneer of the kibbutzs on the stock exchange, differs from the seven kibbutz plants that followed it in the last half year. All seven are "net" kibbutz plants, without any external partners. About a year after Abarot went to the stock exchange, Kineret's "Hopit" plant for the manufacture of plastic containers went to the exchange. After it came "Spencrete" of Palmahim, "Ortal" and "Tal" of Neveh-Or and Mishmarot. Shares of "Kafrit" of Kfar-'Aza, "Gan-Shmu'el Preserves Manufacturing," and "Ma'abarot Products" were issued in the wave of flotations of recent weeks. The chairman of the kibbutz Industry Association, Micha Hertz of Nir-Yitzhaq, estimates that 20 to 25 kibbutz plants will go to the stock exchange during 1994. In five of them, this has already been approved by the kibbutz assembly. According to him, on the kibbutzs' road to the stock exchange it will be necessary to overcome ideological inhibitions and evil images. Many kibbutzniks still link the stock exchange with phoney, fictitious businesses and and speculation. Not to speak of the veterans, who view the whole affair as ideological bankruptcy. Hertz: "We explain in the kibbutzim that this time we are not going to "play" on the exchange and to buy shares. They became entangled in the 1980's because of such "games." This time we are talking about the sale of shares. It must be remembered that today the kibbutzs are having difficulty obtaining capital from the banks due to their tremendous debt, which comes to approximately 12 billion shekels." The Kibbutz Industry Association today comprises more than 360 plants. Only a small portion of them are ready to go to the exchange from the viewpoint of their stockholders' equity and their economic strength. The breakthrough into the capital market involves, as was stated, complicated considerations. The legal adviser of the Kibbutz Industry Association advises the kibbutzs that are weighing this step to take into account that they will have to relinquish the traditional kibbutz style of management. That is, it will no longer be possible "to settle things within the home." The Securities Law requires a public corporation to publish all the information that is relevant to the investor. On account of this law, internal kibbutz questions are exposed to the audit of the Securities Authority. For example: Why is a handicapped kibbutz member placed next to a central machine? And why "are they wasting money" on the installation of air conditioning in a production area that is manned by only four workers? And how is it that the main operator of a machine is absent because the kibbutz has decided to make him responsible for preparing a Purim party? [Box, p 14 by Hadar Horesh] They Do Not Have A Good Reputation The kibbutzs do not have a good reputation at the stock exchange. David Bal'as's affair presented them as naive businessmen at best. The kibbutz crisis of the 1990's proved that most of them do not know how to adapt themselves to the modern business world. This year the "Tekhen" affair exploded: a company that was established by the Takam [United Kibbutz Movement] in 1988, which raised 40 million shekels by issuing bonds to the investing public. The company passed on the money that it raised to the kibbutzs of the Takam, as loans. As was expected from the start, the kibbutzs could not pay their debts, and they are now seeking money from the government. After the successful flotation of Abarot last year, many believed that a wave of flotations was coming from the kibbutz movements, but most of the planned flotations got bogged down en route: the management of the stock exchange presented severe requirements to the kibbutzs, including a series of arrangements that were intended to prevent the possibility of the kibbutz members benefiting from the revenues of the plant at the expense of the investors from the public at large. Some of the kibbutz plants were found "not ripe" for a flotation. More than a year afterwards, kibbutz Kineret--one of the richest in the kibbutz movement--floated the "Hopit" plastics factory. In the last two months, the wave of flotations strengthened. In all, the kibbutzs raised approximately 120 million shekels on the stock exchange. Three more kibbutzs are in advanced stages of an issue, and it appears that they will raise capital at the beginning of the next year. [end box]
