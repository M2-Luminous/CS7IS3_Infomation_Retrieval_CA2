The state-owned Credit Lyonnais is seeking security for $220 million of debts owed it by Tapie and earlier this month moved against his four-master luxury yacht, the Phocea, the world's biggest sailing boat and the symbol of the tycoon's financial and political success. Bankers seized the 13-million-dollar yacht owned by Bernard Tapie on June 1. Tapie, an MP for Marseille, told AFP he wanted to keep his National Assembly seat and would therefore reject all accusations in parliament. He was to give a news conference at the National Assembly, the French lower house, before the parliament debate. The Credit Lyonnais' subsidiary, SDBO, won a court ruling to block movement and use of Tapie's 74-metre (240-feet) vessel from Marseille after it decided to call in Tapie's debts alleging he had failed to honour the terms of a debt rescheduling agreement. The yacht remains Tapie's formal property until the bank's dispute with the 51-year-old politician has been resolved, but the seizure means he cannot dispose of it. The yacht is estimated to be worth between 70 and 90 million francs ($11.6 and 15 million). Tapie, a former minister close to socialist President Francois Mitterrand, also won a seat in the European Parliament at the head of a centre-left list of candidates on June 12. Tapie's popularity has not been affected by an array of embezzlement charges against him involving companies in his Groupe Bernard Tapie, the Olympique Marseille football club accounts, and the Phocea.
