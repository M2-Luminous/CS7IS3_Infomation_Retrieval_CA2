His appointment was counterbalanced with the naming of Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic, a Moslem, to the same office in the new federation. Zubak, who has been the Croat leader since January when he replaced the extreme nationalist Mate Boban, is untainted by charges of ethnic cleansing against Moslems. A moderate, he was chosen by Zagreb to put some order into Croat affairs in Hercegovina and to make peace with the Moslems. Haris Silajdzic, Bosnia's current prime minister, was nominated premier of the new federal government. Croats will occupy six of the 17 ministerial posts: defence, finance, justice, trade, health and one minister with no portfolio. The new federal institutions will not replace the existing ones of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, whose president remains Alija Izetbegovic, as long as peace negotations with the Bosnian Serbs continue. The federation agreement was negotiated in March and April in Bonn, Vienna and Washington under the auspices of special U.S. envoy for ex-Yugoslavia Charles Redman. The new federation is to consist of cantons with a high degree of autonomy over decisionmaking.
