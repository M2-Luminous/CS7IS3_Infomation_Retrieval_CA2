A business source said on Friday that a visiting Iranian Central Bank delegation and representatives of South Korean creditors agreed on Thursday that the debts will be paid in three years and six months on an installment payment basis after two years' grace. The outstanding debts Iran owed to major Korean firms totaled 360 million dollars as of the end of last year. Toward the end of last year, the two sides agreed on the payment of the debts in two years after a year's grace period. When the 70 million dollars maturing this year are included, the total outstanding debts would total 430 million dollars, the source said. This amount represents the debts Iran owes to those 16 major industries which maintain branch offices in Iran. When those owed to small Korean industries are counted, the total outstanding debts would easily run to more than 500 million dollars, he said.
