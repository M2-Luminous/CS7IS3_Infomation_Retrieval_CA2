[President Fujimori originally censored the contents of this letter. See item PA2610034493 in 5 November 1993 Terrorism Report] Text of Letter APPEAL COMRADES OF THE PERUVIAN COMMUNIST PARTY FIGHTERS OF THE PEOPLE'S GUERRILLA ARMY COMRADES AMONG THE MASSES As communists, applying our specific ideology of Marxism, Leninism, Maoism, and the thoughts of Gonzalo and reflecting almost exclusively and intensely on these problems for the past year, we have reached the following conclusions in the preparation of a "concrete analysis of the concrete situation." For more than 13 years, we have carried on a people's war as the greatest social movement in Peruvian history. As a result, Maoism has been defined as the third, new, and higher phase of Marxism. The prestige and impact of the party has been raised to the highest point. We have gained immense and mainly positive experience in the service of the World Proletarian Revolution. We have achieved this, like everything in life, through great and heroic efforts and have had our successes and failures. Nevertheless, we must look clearly and profoundly at the situation which we face at present and its foreseeable prospects. The facts show that the present government has made objective progress in carrying out its tasks, especially since the events of 5 April 1992, which clearly was necessary for the Peruvian state to do. Thus, it has established foundations for the economic process and has carried out adjustments in the state. And, what applies to us more directly, it has prepared a systematic, coherent, and well-developed strategy at different levels, particularly in the field of intelligence, achieving real successes, principally through the capture of cadres and leaders, among them myself. Clearly, this is the most important success achieved by the Peruvian state during the past 13 years of war. In this way it has favorably prepared the course which the present government is following. Meanwhile, on our side real problems have been growing. New, complex, and very serious problems have arisen in world politics, in the situation in which the country finds itself, and in the war which is unfolding. All of these questions have raised fundamental leadership problems for the Peruvian Communist Party. Nevertheless, the party has been dealt its hardest blow in terms of its leadership. As proletarian revolutionaries we know very well and must keep in mind the fact that a people's war, starting from the realities facing it, requires certain, essential conditions to succeed. It needs proletarian leadership, a mass base, strategic centralization, a prolonged war, a new type of army, and a favorable international situation. It is clear that this last condition does not exist. However, the first condition is the principal one and from it flow the others. Therefore, a people's war is essentially a question of political leadership. The question of leadership is decisive. In our case this question cannot be resolved in a timely way. Consequently, the facts show that the prospects facing the people's war are not its expansion but simply keeping it going. On the basis of what has been said above and under the present circumstances, the party and principally its leadership are being faced with the need to make a new and great decision. In the past we carried on our struggle by beginning a people's war. Today, with equal firmness and determination we must fight for a peace agreement as an unavoidable, historic necessity. This also makes it necessary to suspend activities related to the people's war, except those involving self defense. There is a corresponding requirement that the Peruvian state suspend its military activities and not make reprisals of any class or kind. Once this previous question is resolved, we can proceed to drafting a Peace Agreement, whose implementation will lead to the end of the 13-year war which the country has been waging. These are historic decisions which the party must make now, particularly considering that peace has become a necessity for the people, the nation, and Peruvian society as a whole. Peace will serve to unite the people, for the people, notwithstanding the differences among them, are united by a profound, common interest. We are taking this extremely important step in carrying out our responsibilities. We are absolutely certain of the need for doing this, as communists, as maoists, and as soldiers of the proletariat, even committing ourselves to serve as one of the parties guaranteeing the implementation of the peace agreement. We call on all party comrades, and particularly on its cadres and leaders, on the fighters, on the masses, and principally on the left wing of the party who seek, in close union with us, to hold high and to apply this new, just, and correct decision. It relates to the position of the proletariat and to the interests of the working class and the people. 22 September 1993 PRESIDENT GONZALO On Friday afternoon, 8 April, a videocassette and the typewritten text of a document reached the editorial offices of SI. According to those who sent it, this was the third letter of Abimael Guzman Reynoso. This was the letter whose public distribution was announced by President Alberto Fujimori on several occasions shortly before the referendum of 31 October 1993. However, this letter was never published and nothing further was said about it. Some six months later in April 1994, sources identified as relatives of Shining Path [SL] personnel held in prison sent to certain publications, including SI, a document which, they state, is a true copy of the third letter of Abimael Guzman Reynoso. The document, together with a video recording in which two hooded SL members appear reading it, presents some problems in terms of timing. The document is dated 22 September 1993, or prior to the date of the second letter (6 October 1993). As this is a typewritten document, there may have been a typographic error. The first letter was dated 15 September 1993. As far as the rest of the third letter is concerned, the contents appear to be genuine. If the letter is genuine, it would confirm that, in effect, when the president let slip a remark concerning the possibility that there was a third letter from the leader of SL, this letter had already been written. President Fujimori's clear objective at that time was to make the point that Abimael Guzman sent this third letter, not to him, but rather to the SL forces. He wanted the leader of the subversives specifically to admit in the letter that he had surrendered and to call on his followers to lay down their arms. As indicated from a reading of the letter, this third communication from Abimael Guzman, which has now been made public, did not include those conditions and did not satisfy the demands of the president. One of the SL family members said: "Therefore, President Fujimori did not agree with it." And, therefore, the president and the National Intelligence Service (SIN) simply filed the letter. Summary of the Contents In the third letter from Abimael Guzman the following, basic ideas are contained: - It reaffirms and provides a basis for his proposal for a peace agreement. - It reaffirms his Marxist, Leninist, Maoist ideology. - It seeks to vindicate the role played by 13 years of a people's war. - It recognizes that the government has made progress since 5 April 1992, particularly in the fight against subversion. - It points out serious problems on the world scene. - It describes the problem of proletarian leadership as decisive. - It calls the proposed peace agreement a great decision and a national need. - It confirms the fact that the SL movement is wholly committed to the search for a peace agreement. However, it says nothing about SL surrendering and laying down its arms. A Shining Path spokesman states that conversations with the government have been broken off. It is known that they were cut off after the referendum of 31 October 1993. The spokesman added that the "representatives" of the SL leadership who were sent to the leaders in prison have returned to the original places where they were being held. The SL spokesman said: "The government is going to continue to do everything possible to prevent a peace agreement from being drafted. A peace agreement does not suit its interests. The idea was used for election purposes. However, we see it as a necessity, not only for us, but for the country." Everything seems to indicate that, after contacting its leaders in prison, the supporters of Abimael Guzman in SL have gone out into the streets. Outside the walls of the prisons the most stubborn and recalcitrant elements of SL, who reject the idea of a peace agreement, control most of the organization. The Metropolitan Committee of SL [in Lima] holds a contrary view, as do the higher leadership bodies, which are effectively controlled by Comrade "Feliciano." Family members of those in prison, trade union officials, or isolated leaders outside the leadership bodies are distributing the peace proposal. According to our SL informant, they are finding a positive reception, particularly among the rank and file members who have participated directly in the war. The "intellectuals" are most opposed to a peace agreement. We asked if this term refers to SL members in the universities. We were told, "Yes." The SL cadre seems to have a clear understanding of their position. He admitted: "The boss has been captured. The rest are easy meat. The organization right now is like a boat without a rudder. And to resume an active life again, there has to be another person, equal to or more capable than the leader who is in prison, to take over this responsibility." (He was referring to "President Gonzalo.") A family member who spoke in the metaphoric language of a SL cadre stated: "The waters have to be constantly in motion. If they quiet down, everything falls apart. We have to expand, but now we are just keeping up the present level of activity." He concluded: "The war has to be ended, because now it leads nowhere." Despite the fact that President Fujimori does not show the same interest in a peace agreement as he did before the referendum of 31 October 1993, fighting for this proposal (which is too general) is a new contradiction which SL is discussing.
