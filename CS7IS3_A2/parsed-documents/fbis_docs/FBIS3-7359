Noting that to establish an independent and democratic government in South Korea is the main goal of the struggle for independence and democracy, the author of the article says: It will be a government based on the anti-U.S., anti-fascist united front and a coalition government made up of representatives of various classes, strata, political parties, groupings and political forces joining in the struggle for independence and democracy. Only when an independent and democratic coalition government is established on the grave of the colonial fascist dictatorship, is it possible for the South Korean people to bring about a historical turn in saving their livelihood from distress and defending human dignity and national independence.
