FR940725-1-00033 FR940725-1-00009 (10) revise §31.303(f)(4) to provide for expansion of the non-MSA exception to jail and lockup removal to address adverse weather and distance/lack of ground transportation; (11) revise §31.303 (f)(5) to require that States must, in completing their annual monitoring report, report as violations of the section 223(a)(12)(A) deinstitutionalization requirement the number of status offenders (including those status offenders accused of violating a valid court order) and nonoffenders held in secure custody in an adult jail or lockup for any length of time. This proposed policy-based revision is effective for, and must be reflected in, State monitoring reports due by December 31, 1995, and subsequent monitoring reports; (12) delete §31.303(f)(6)(iii)(A) related to substantial compliance with the jail and lockup removal requirement and redesignate subsequent paragraphs; (13) revise §31.303(f)(6)(iii)(C), as redesignated, to allow States that have reduced the number of status and nonoffenders securely detained or confined in jails and lockups to less than 9 per 100,000 juvenile population in the State, and can demonstrate meaningful progress in removing juvenile criminal-type offenders, to qualify for a waiver of termination for annual fund allocations through Fiscal Year 1993, when full compliance with the jail and lockup removal requirement has not been achieved. This section is also revised to require that a State seeking a waiver of termination demonstrate an ``unequivocal'' commitment to achieving full compliance; (14) revise §31.303(f)(6)(iii)(D), as redesignated, to increase the maximum number of waivers that may be granted to a State from three to four; (15) revise §31.303(f)(6) to provide that failure to comply with the subsection (a)(12)(A), (13), (14) or (23) mandates for any fiscal year beginning with 1994, will result in the State's Formula Grant allocation being reduced by 25% for each such failure; (16) revise §31.303(h) to require the submission of annual performance reports by June 30, beginning with calendar year 1995; and (17) revise §31.303(j) to enhance State requirements for demonstrating compliance with the section 223(a)(23) mandate on disproportionate minority confinement, and to establish timelines for compliance. Application Deadline Section 31.1 currently requires that Formula Grant applications and related plans or plan updates for each fiscal year should be submitted to OJJDP by August 1st (60 days prior to the beginning of the fiscal year) or within 60 days after States are officially notified of each fiscal year's Formula Grants Program allocation. A number of States have submitted applications sufficiently late in recent fiscal years to impede orderly and timely application processing by OJJDP. This has resulted in an increased number of special conditions and a need for time consuming follow-up by State Relations and Assistance Division staff. The submission requirement would be changed to require that Fiscal Year 1995 applications and all subsequent applications shall be submitted to OJJDP no later than March 31 of the fiscal year for which the funds were allocated. This submission date would allow OJJDP adequate time to conduct a full review of each State's plan or plan update, give States the opportunity to address any deficiencies in the application, plan or plan update, or budget prior to award, and assure complete application processing and award of funds prior to the end of the fiscal year. State Agency Structure_Staffing In addition to the current ``adequate staff'' requirement of §31.102 for the State agency administering Formula Grant funds, the Regulation is revised to provide that a participating State agency must, at a minimum, assign one full-time Juvenile Justice Specialist to manage the Formula Grants Program. OJJDP's experience indicates that the complexity of the Formula Grants program justifies the attention of at least one full-time Juvenile Justice Specialist in each State to perform and oversee required planning and administration activities including: developing, announcing, competing, packaging, awarding, evaluating, and overseeing subawards, developing programs to address disproportionate minority confinement issues and provide for effective use of Indian tribe pass-through funds; providing for program and project monitoring; playing a central role in preparing the three year program plan and annual plan update; providing staff support to the State supervisory board and/or the State advisory group; and overseeing the reporting of State progress in achieving and maintaining compliance with the deinstitutionalization, separation, adult jail and lockup removal, and disproportionate minority confinement requirements.
