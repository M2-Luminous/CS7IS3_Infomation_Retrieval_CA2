FR941219-0-00029 FR941219-0-00014 In the laboratory, delta smelt eggs hatch in 10 to 14 days (Randy Mager, University of California, pers. comm., 1993). Laboratory observations indicate that delta smelt are broadcast spawners that spawn in a current, usually at night, distributing their eggs over a local area (Lindberg 1992, Mager 1993). Eggs attach singly to the substrate, and few eggs were found on vertical plants (Lindberg 1993). Lindberg (1993) found that yolk-sac fry were positively phototactic and negatively buoyant. After hatching, larvae are transported downstream toward the mixing zone where they are retained by the vertical circulation of fresh and salt waters (Stevens et al. 1990). The pelagic larvae feed on phytoplankton until day 4, begin to feed on rotifers on day 6 and Artemis nauplii on day 14 (Mager 1992). Juveniles feed exclusively on zooplankton. When the mixing zone is located in a broad geographic area with extensive shallow-water habitat within the euphotic zone (depths less than 4 meters), high densities of phytoplankton and zooplankton are produced (Arthur and Ball 1978, 1979, 1980), and larval and juvenile fish, including delta smelt, grow rapidly (Moyle et al. 1992, Sweetnam and Stevens 1993). When given the opportunity, delta smelt remain in Suisun Bay even after the 2 ppt isohaline has retreated upstream (Herbold 1994). In general, estuaries are among the most productive ecosystems in the world (Goldman and Horne 1983). Estuarine environments produce an abundance of fish as a result of plentiful food and shallow, protective habitat for young. When the mixing zone is contained within Suisun Bay, young delta smelt are dispersed widely throughout a large expanse of shallow-water and marsh habitat. Dispersal in areas downstream from the State and Federal water pumps and in-Delta agricultural diversions protects young delta smelt from entrainment and distributes them among the extensive, protective, and highly productive shoal regions of Suisun Bay. In contrast, when located upstream, the mixing zone becomes confined in the deep river channels, which are smaller in total surface area, contain fewer shoal areas, have swifter, more turbulent water currents, and lack high zooplankton productivity. Vulnerability to entrainment in the State and Federal pumping facilities and in-Delta diversions increases. Erkkila et al. (1950) collected young delta smelt near Sherman Island, at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, in July and August of 1948. In studies by the California Department of Fish and Game, California Department of Water Resources (DWR), and the Bureau, larval and juvenile delta smelt were collected from Roe Island in Suisun Bay north to the confluence of the Sacramento and Feather Rivers and east to Medford Island on the San Joaquin River (Wang 1991). These studies were conducted during the months of April through mid-July in 1989 and 1990. Through these distribution surveys, Wang (1991) was able to document the movement of juvenile delta smelt from the Delta to Suisun Bay in late June and early July. In 1990, young delta smelt were taken at the Tracy Pumping Plant at the end of February (Wang 1991). The delta smelt is adapted to living in the highly productive Sacramento-San Joaquin River Estuary (Estuary) where salinity varies spatially and temporally according to tidal cycles and the amount of freshwater inflow. Despite this tremendously variable environment, the historical Estuary probably offered relatively constant suitable habitat conditions to delta smelt, which could move upstream or downstream with the mixing zone (Peter Moyle, University of California, pers. comm., 1993). Since the 1850's, however, the amount and extent of suitable habitat for the delta smelt has declined dramatically. The advent in 1853 of hydraulic mining in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers led to increased siltation and alteration of the circulation patterns of the Estuary (Nichols et al. 1986, Monroe and Kelly 1992). The reclamation of Merritt Island for agricultural purposes in the same year marked the beginning of the present-day cumulative loss of 94 percent of the Estuary's tidal marshes (Nichols et al. 1986, Monroe and Kelly 1992). In addition to this degradation and loss of estuarine habitat, the delta smelt has been increasingly subject to entrainment, upstream or reverse flows of waters in the Delta and San Joaquin River, and constriction of habitat in the less productive, deep-water river channels of the Delta (Moyle et al. 1992). These adverse conditions are primarily a result of the steadily increasing proportion of water diverted from the Delta by the Federal and State water projects (Monroe and Kelly 1992). Water delivery through the Federal Central Valley Project (CVP) began in water year 1940. The State Water Project (SWP) began delivering water in 1968. However, the proportion of fresh water being diverted has increased since 1983 and has remained at high levels (Moyle et al. 1992). A relationship has been found between the number of juvenile delta smelt salvaged at the State and Federal pumps and both the percent of inflow diverted and total Delta outflow (California Department of Water Resources and Bureau of Reclamation 1994). The high proportion of fresh water exported has exacerbated the already harsh environmental conditions experienced by the delta smelt during the recent 6-year drought (1987&hyph;1992). The March 5, 1993 (58 FR 12854), final rule listing the delta smelt as a threatened species describes in detail the factors that have led to this species' decline. Previous Service Action In the January 6, 1989 (54 FR 554), Animal Notice of Review, the Service included the delta smelt as a category 1 candidate species. Category 1 includes species for which data in the Service's possession are sufficient to support proposals for listing. On June 29, 1990, the Service received a petition dated June 26, 1990, from Dr. Don C. Erman, President-Elect of the California-Nevada Chapter of the American Fisheries Society, to list the delta smelt as an endangered species and designate its critical habitat. The Service made a 90-day finding that substantial information had been presented indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted and announced this decision in the Federal Register on December 24, 1990 (55 FR 52852). On October 3, 1991 (56 FR 50075), the Service published a proposal to list the delta smelt as a threatened species and to designate critical habitat. This proposed rule constituted the 12-month petition finding in accordance with section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act. Critical habitat was proposed for areas of all water and all submerged lands below ordinary high water and the entire water column bounded by and contained within Suisun Bay (including the contiguous Grizzly and Honker Bays), the length of Montezuma Slough, portions of the Sacramento River, portions of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, portions of the San Joaquin River, and the contiguous water bodies in between (a complex of bays, dead-end sloughs, channels typically less than four meters deep, marshlands, etc.), contained in the State of California. The public comment period opened on the date of publication of the proposed rule (October 3, 1991) and closed on January 31, 1992. On December 19, 1991 (56 FR 65877), the Service published a notice of public hearing on the proposed rule to be held in three locations in California. Public hearings were conducted on January 9, 1992, in Sacramento; on January 14, 1992, in Santa Monica; and on January 16, 1992, in Visalia.
