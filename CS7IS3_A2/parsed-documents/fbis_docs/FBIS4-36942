We have received additional information that the number of demonstrators reached into the hundreds of thousands, raising slogans praising our party and reiterating the genuineness of this Kurdish city. Many of the girls and women of al-Sulaymaniyah, who were leading the peaceful procession, were martyred, and hundreds, including a large number of women, were wounded. Yesterday, the PUK continued to chase and arrest the citizens who took part in the procession or those suspected of being loyal to our party. The most serious issue is that the life of those under arrest is in danger. We now appeal to the friends of our people, world public opinion, the United Nations, the Kurdistan Front forces, the Iraqi opposition, and personalities to intervene swiftly to save the lives of the thousands under arrest, to release them immediately, and to respect the processions during which at least 51 martyrs will be laid to rest.
