Now, on a bright morning in January 1994, the time has come for the DC [Christian Democratic Party] -- the last of Italy's major parties -- to acknowledge that it can no longer remain united. In other words, that the miracle is over for the Great White Whale, too. By one of the paradoxes of history, it fell to the mild Martinazzoli, the Hamlet-like Mino, to certify the death of the miracle, to certify that as of today, while some people remain in, others are out. In other words, to say that only he and his supporters are heirs to the DC, and that Mastella, Casini, D'Onofrio, and the rest are already "another party." It is up to him to guarantee that from now on those we have hitherto called Christian Democrats will each stand on their own side -- albeit involved right away in already familiar struggles over the name, symbol, and assets of the DC. The dramatic event that [DC founder] De Gasperi's heirs have tried desperately to avert for months suddenly took place in a little more than a minute. That is, as long as it took Mino Martinazzoli to emerge from DC headquarters and to enter the Brescia-registered BMW belonging to his trusted friend, Domenico Berterici. He was intercepted by three agency reporters: "So, Mr. Martinazzoli, are you still angry with the centrists, after yesterday's meetings with Maroni, [Radical leader] Pannella, and the nondenominational parties?" He turned round with an expression of surprise and averred that he was not angry: "It seems clear to me," he said deliberately, "that the neo-centrists have taken their leave. And I acknowledge the fact." There ensued an icy silence appropriate to such an important occasion. Martinazzoli went on: "This is not simply my opinion: When they behave like a party, with their own government program and their own strategy and when they hold talks with other political interlocutors, I acknowledge the fact. I do so calmly." And he calmly went on: "I only know that they are another party. Apart from that, if they want to talk about the succession to the DC, I am willing...." That was all there was to it. Martinazzoli, the last secretary of the DC, closed the car door and left. But it was not long before the "little" that he did say became news. And when it did become news it immediately elicited a torrent of responses from a party that has now realized that it has reached the end of the road. Martinazzoli was immediately granted support by those with whom the secretary met yesterday morning -- Franco Marini, Pierluigi Castagnetti, and Rosa Russo Jervolino, even though when she arrived at DC headquarters she called Pierferdinando Casini to attempt a final mediation, in order to organize a meeting at the end of the week. Then there were Forleo, De Rosa, and the "40." Not to mention Rosy Bindi, of course, who remarked "splendid!" to welcome this "act of great openness," as she put it, whereby Martinazzoli "is confronting the so-called neocentrists with their responsibilities." Those who followed the approaching storm with bated breath, and who, now that it has broken, are in danger of being overwhelmed or swept away by it, are saying nothing for the present. Mariotto Segni is saying nothing, having based his swing to the center in the summer on the axis with Martinazzoli, but who now, with him alone and with Bindi and Mattarella -- having already initiated accords with the League and perhaps Berlusconi -- can no longer build his Grand Center. And there is an anxious silence, too, from the soft underbelly of the DC -- the great DC in the South that hates Mastella but does not trust Martinazzoli. And that trembles with fear when it sounds out its voters. For De Mita, Mancino, and Gargani, any path will be a difficult one to take.... On the other side, however, it will take very little to prompt Casini and Mastella to resume busy discussions about what is to be done. In Bologna, Rome, and Ceppaloni rapid progress is being made by the idea of turning the final days under the common roof of the DC into days of battle. Francesco D'Onofrio issued an immediate response. He admitted right away that Tuesday's tour of the seven moderate churches [reference to traditional Easter pilgrimage to Rome's seven most important churches -- scathingly, a wild-goose chase] was "a deliberately provocative initiative, barely legitimate, designed to achieve a political clarification." He said "Martinazzoli should have conducted these meetings." He harped on the issue on which he knows the secretary to be weak, demanding an immediate National Council session to establish "who is in the majority and who in the minority." The major attacks on the DC came soon after that. The first was a document signed by Casini, Mastella, D'Onofrio, Fontana, and Fumagalli-Carulli -- that is, the "splittists." It had the flavor of a challenge being taken up. We too are "calm," the five announced. We too "acknowledge" that the discussion of a program with other forces "is becoming for the secretary the demonstration of our desire to form another party." Gorrieri did not receive such firm treatment, they told the secretary sarcastically, "but we are not surprised," because what the DC leadership "clearly cannot accept is our idea of creating a moderate electoral cartel alternative to Occhetto's." Let us convene the National Council, they concluded, and see whether the conditions exist for us to cover some ground together or, as Martinazzoli says, in order to establish the details with regard to the succession to the DC." These are the outlines of an unprecedented political challenge -- a door left open to the hope that a spectacular internal upheaval could bring the largest sector of the DC to occupy the place within the moderate alignment that "we," as they put it, "have in any case already firmly occupied." Their sights are set mainly on Formigoni and Buttiglione, the neo-centrists. That is, on two former CL [Communion and Liberation] members who have never severed relations with the League, who have never attacked Berlusconi, and who, together with Bianco, are attempting a mediation, simultaneously condemning the "error" and "imprudence" of Mastella and his friends, and Bindi's haste to break away. They are siding, albeit cautiously, in favor of a National Council session before the "constituent" assembly on 18 January at which the People's Party will be established. But this is a very slight hope, little more than a move demanded by political protocol. The rest, the real essence of the conflict, came in the second attack, in the letter already making its way to Martinazzoli's desk, without too much publicity. It is a lengthy document in which 35 National Council members warn that they are prepared, on the basis of party statutes, to convene the Council themselves in order to discuss "considerations concerning the continuation or cessation of the DC, and the consequences." It carries a postscript that constitutes an outright challenge: There must be no changes meanwhile to the "name, symbol, and assets of the party." This because otherwise the DC's final moments would be lived out in still less exalted surroundings -- not only at DC headquarters but also in attorney's offices and gloomy courtrooms....
