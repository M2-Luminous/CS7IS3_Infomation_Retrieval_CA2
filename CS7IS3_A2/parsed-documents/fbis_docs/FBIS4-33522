This is the largest drug seizure ever made in Brazil. The operation began yesterday at a farm in the municipality of Guarai in Tocantins State. The Federal Police have been closely watching this area in Tocantins State, where the drug traffickers own a 750 hectare farm whose sole purpose, according to police, is to receive drugs. The trucks loaded with cocaine were intercepted near the Belem-Brasilia highway. They had been planning to travel directly to the port of Santos [Sao Paulo State], where the drugs were to be shipped to the United States. The police are surprised at the organizational level of the drug traffickers. The drugs were hidden inside tobacco bundles purchased in Rio Grande do Sul, and brought here through operations carried out by ghost firms. After weighing the drugs the police confirmed a surprising 7 tonnes of cocaine. [passage omitted] According to the police agents who commanded this operation, the cocaine was brought into Brazil by Colombian drug traffickers, to some as yet unidentified point in Rondonia State. From there, it was flown in small Brazilian airplanes to their probable refueling base in the city of Alta Floresta in Mato Grosso State, from where the cocaine was flown to the farm in Guarai, Tocantins and unloaded. Following a shootout at the farm, the police arrested seven drug traffickers. The leader, a Lebanese who had become a naturalized Brazilian citizen, Nasrat Jamil Hazul, is a businessman from Foz do Iguacu and Paraguay. According to the police, the drug traffickers expected to earn a lot of money because they spent nearly $1 million bringing the drugs from Colombia. [passage omitted] In making a final control of the weight of the drugs, the police found an additional half tonne of cocaine. This means that the police seized 7.5 tonnes of cocaine. The police found and arrested three other drug traffickers. The gang members confessed that last year they sent 2 tonnes of cocaine abroad using this same route. The police arrested two men that were in charge of the bureaucratic procedures of the drug trafficking gang. All the documents that the gang needed were forged on the fifth floor of this building downtown in Sao Paulo. Today here, the Federal Police arrested forwarding agent Sergio Ricardo de Souza, who already had a police record for forging documents. The police likewise arrested business administrator Jacques Juarez Minicozky. Souza was in charge of forging the lading bills, while Minicozky had found a way to have them legalized. This bill of lading, for example, was made in December of last year, probably to cover another cocaine shipment. It was made in the name of the In-Out Comercial Exportadora Lta., a ghost company created by the two men. The police also confiscated several seals and documents, including this passport which was to be used by the man responsible for receiving the drugs in the United States. Minicozky told the police he would receive $10,000 for forging the bill of lading and for looking after the bureaucratic proceedings for shipping the containers. Minicozky and Souza are under arrest for using false documents, and a Tocantins judge has asked for their temporary imprisonment.
