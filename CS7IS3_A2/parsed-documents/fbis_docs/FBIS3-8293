Did the shift to the left that occurred on 19 September of last year and the bitter defeat by Solidarity-derived parties result from mistakes by new political elites, were they a price that was paid for the radical reforms, or were they linked to broader processes occurring in postcommunist countries? What will Poland's political and economic future be like? What will happen next? And, above all, how did it happen that political parties deriving from the period of the Polish People's Republic [PRL] managed to return to power? These are the topics we would like to be the subject of common reflection. So far, the following people have spoken out: Jerzy Holzer, Zdzislaw Najder, Tomasz Lubienski, Kazimierz Orlos, Jan Maria Rokita, Aleksander Hall, Stefan Bratkowski, Jerzy Surdykowski, Kazimierz Dziewanowski, Jozef Oleksy, Jerzy Giedroyc, Krzysztof Kozlowski, Aleksander Luczak, Slawomir Siwek, Aleksander Jerzy Wieczorkowski, and Marek Garztecki. Our interviewee today is General Wojciech Jaruzelski. [Lukasiewicz] Did you expect a change of guard on 19 September of last year, and do you think that society, by voting, really was motivated by a yearning for the lost communist paradise? [Jaruzelski] Let us begin with the paradise aspect. I do not know how it is up in heaven, but, as far as earth is concerned, nobody has ever succeeded in establishing a paradise here, nor will anybody succeed in doing so in the future. And that also applies to a capitalist paradise. It is precisely the illusion that the rejection of "communism" will make life better almost automatically for everybody and regarding everything that became one of the main reasons for social frustration and discontent. Disappointment is the kind of feeling that has the traits of a boomerang. But this time, it was a yearning not so much for the past as for the different. Nobody has any doubts anymore that the so-called real socialism is a closed chapter. To make it look better in an artificial manner, to try to erase mistakes, deformations, or anachronisms, would be both immoral and make no political sense. On the other hand, to ascribe all of the world's sins to real socialism would be false and opportunistic, and would also bring results that are the opposite of what had been intended--among other things, last year's 19 September election results are an example of that. Every extremism must lose sooner or later. I knew that once the pendulum had made its move to one side, it was only a question of time before it began moving back to the opposite side--that is almost a regular phenomenon in democratic regimes. What I did not expect was that it was going to happen so quickly. Was that, as you put it, a "change of guard"? Not quite. I would rather call it a half-turn. It is true that the current government is, as people often say, center-leftist. A center-leftist coalition has a big advantage in parliament. But there is also the president of the Republic of Poland who, although he tries to maintain a balance and be a patron to all Poles, clearly has been showing signs of being in favor of the "right-wing option," especially recently. Also, it is not the government or the parliament but the president who has a dominating impact on such key ministries as Defense, Internal Affairs, and Foreign Affairs. One must also add to that the so-called fourth power--that is a majority of the mass media--which rather tends not to have the left wing in its good books, to put it in subtle terms. The future will show to what extent the current governing configuration will turn out permanent or constructive. That will also be a test of a feeling of responsibility for the country and of democratic manners by all participants of the political scene. I am hopeful that this Polish train of ours, although squeaking while moving and recently even with sparks flying, will eventually manage to avoid a derailing. [Lukasiewicz] Postcommunists are returning to power also in other countries of the former Soviet bloc; their return is also expected in Hungary in the immediate future. What are the reasons for that phenomenon, and do you think the postcommunists will manage to bear responsibility for a consistent process of continuing with democratic and market reforms? [Jaruzelski] The term "postcommunist" is currently a titular kind of phrase, one that is used more as an invective than as a substantive evaluation. The fact that somebody used to be a member of a communist party does not have to mean an uncritical "going back to the sources." Moreover, today many former members of the Polish United Workers Party [PZPR] are distancing themselves from the past in a vigorous manner. What is characteristic in that process is the spectacularity of the various personal transformations and conversions. As it turns out, a majority of them havealways been reform-oriented. That is perhaps not a nice thing from the perspective of political aesthetics. But, on the other hand, thanks to the wonderful nature of human memory, I think it is probably also frank. In that sense, it is also a positive phenomenon because the return to power of the so-called postcommunists is not something directly linked to political and economic systems. This is even more so because the leadership of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] and the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic [SdRP] derives in most cases from a reform-oriented trend within the former PZPR. My view is that the same, with modifications taking the party's nature into account, applies also to the leadership of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL], which derives from the United Peasant Accord. After all, they are all definitely in favor of principles of parliamentary democracy, the market economy, and guaranteeing all civic freedoms. There is just the issue of the right instruments, the right proportions, and the rate of implementation of the process of political and economic transformations. By the way, from that standpoint, there are major differences also in the right-wing camp. On certain issues, some of the right-wing factions are outrightly populist and extremely left-wing. The real left wing must be itself. There are certain socially universal, socialist values that are conformant with the spirit of a given time and that left-wing parties cannot abandon if they do not want to lose credibility or commit a historical discredit. The point is that, while implementing the necessary and, alas, painful economic reforms, while paying determinant attention to economic development, which means a prevalence of creative attitudes over ones that are about making claims, the point is to at the same time "keep your ear to the ground," not to overdo it with the reforms, and to constantly have the supreme social goal in view. That is why I think it is precisely left-wing, or center-left-wing, forces that have the biggest chance for an effective implementation of the reforms. After all, the biggest problem is social resistance. By the way, that resistance is understandable. The joyous anesthetization of 4 June 1989 is over. The ongoing pain inflicted by the operation of reforms caused society to have rejected the "surgeons" in charge up to now, and also their elites, which, by the way, also suffered from infighting. Polish society has a great deal of grievance against the left wing, especially historical grievance. But society also knows that the left wing is, by definition and by virtue of the doctrines it is based on, at the same time more socially sensitive. That is why the West's reception of the election results was also quiet. For the West, the most important thing is stability in this part of Europe. It is precisely the center left wing that has the greatest chances to alleviate social unrest linked to the difficult process of transformations. A decomposition and a premature fall of the center left wing could bring various solutions to the surface, including extreme right-wing, populist, autocratic, or even exotic ones. Would that contribute to a widening of the social basis for the transformations and, consequently, to increasing the efficiency of the reforms? I doubt that. [Lukasiewicz] But how would you assess, generally speaking, the four years of rule by the "surgeons"? What do you consider to be the biggest achievement of Solidarity-derived cabinets, and what do you think were their biggest mistakes? Also, could they really have avoided the mistakes, when you bear in mind that we were the first and that there had been no past cases of "leaving the [communist] system"? [Jaruzelski] I do not want to sound grandiose or moralizing. I am a politician of the past, and I am aware of the very serious deficiencies of the past type of political and economic regime. I am also aware of my own responsibility, which I have never tried to evade, nor do I now. I appreciate the historical meaning of the changes that were accomplished during the four years. So much has been written about that, both in Poland and abroad, that it is not easy to say something original on the topic. Therefore, I will just mention two achievements that in my view are especially significant. In the social and political area, it is civic freedoms, broadly speaking. In the economic area, it is the convertibility of the zloty and the main consequences of that fact. Words of my highest appreciation, though, go to the activity of the Tadeusz Mazowiecki government, which, in essence, was of a pioneer nature, and also to his personal contribution and his serious approach. I cannot imagine his making a statement that the communists ruined Poland more than the Nazis did, or showing the kind of doctrinal nonchalance toward social problems that was displayed by [former Prime Minister] Jan Krzysztof Bielecki. I also cannot imagine Mazowiecki being capable of waging the kinds of revenge-oriented emotions and file-checking brawls that were effected by the government of [former Prime Minister] Jan Olszewski. Finally, I also cannot imagine Mazowiecki displaying the kind of amazingly self-satisfactory frame of mind, faced with a difficult situation of social tensions, that was displayed by Hanna Suchocka's government. On the other hand, my view is that, all in all, the biggest mistake by Solidarity-derived governments was this specific mixture of arrogance and naivete (by the way, from that perspective, these governments turned out to have a lot in common with many governments in the PRL). We all know the kind of message it was based on: We know how to do things best, there is no alternative to our ideas; only we, from the Solidarity-derived basis, have the right patent for reforms, and everybody else is genetically predisposed to be antireform; that is the line of thinking in a nutshell. At this point, I would like to take a stand on the view that we [the Polish people] were the first, and there had been no past experiences of "leaving the system." As a matter of fact, we were the "second" in the years 1944-45, inasmuch as the events of 1917 had taken place before that. And it was precisely the transfer of those 1917 experiences that was the main reason for our failures, even if the extent to which those experiences were implemented in Poland was small and kept getting ever smaller. Still, recently, when we turned out to be "the first" this time around, the temptation of imitating someone else is what prevailed. True, the models were different and better this time, but still not all of them were implementable in Poland's situation. The syndrome of a "late comer" had its toll on the trend to imitate that I just mentioned, and also a desire to just skip some of the phases and achieve the standard of living and the way of life being applied in countries that are more developed than Poland--in particular, in economic terms. That is how all of the mindless following of somebody else came about--from Jeffrey Sachs's prescriptions to the clownery of Valentine's Day. But it is not possible to ascribe all of the deficiencies exclusively to the governing elites. After all, these elites operate within the framework of a social and psychological situation, to the formation of which they also have contributed in some way--that must be said. And what was the situation like? Well, to use a columnist's style for a moment, the common bread-eaters expected luxury because, after all, the "communists" are no longer interfering this or that way, or stealing. Many people had the illusion that a moral revolution would take place in "our own house," that social pathologies would subside, and that people would just be better because, after all, the "communists" are no longer trampling on freedom, cheating, or showing bad moral examples to the nation. Many of the so-called independence-oriented activists were convinced that, once sovereignty was gained, one would be able to teach Moscow a lesson, while the West would take very good care of us in political, economic, and military terms. But that did not materialize. It could not have. And that is one of the necessary costs of the systemwide transformation, of that "earthquake" that took place in this part of the globe. Was it possible to avoid these disappointments? Partially no, and partially yes. As far as I can recall, it was Schopenhauer who said that people who complain about their lot should remember that their fate was mainly shaped by stupid things they themselves did. It is beyond doubt an extreme view and one clearly biased toward polemics, but there is something rational about it. After all, how frequently all of us, former and current politicians, like to ascribe all failures to a difficult legacy, a disadvantageous domestic and foreign situation, and mainly to mistakes committed by our predecessors. And, although in many cases such a position is justified, it also has a demobilizing effect in a way and directs our attention to the past, not to the future. [Lukasiewicz] I must ask you to provide some of your own reflections pertaining to your own role and activity: What do you consider the biggest achievement and the biggest failure in your own life story? [Jaruzelski] Is turning 70 years of age not a success? When one has behind oneself the experience of September 1939, a deportation to Siberia, a long war-front road of a sniper officer, and, finally, all of the stress and burden associated with decades of military service and political activity, there are reasons to be able to say all of this is a success. But there is a personal dimension. As far as the greatest political achievement is concerned, which, by the way, was shared by both sides of the political barricade and also by church representatives back then, I regard the "Roundtable" as the biggest achievement. Finally, I treasure in particular my military achievements, including 15 years at the post of national defense minister. It is a source of pride for me that I commanded a good army. I think, even though it may be viewed as immodest, that I contributed to securing the Army's combat capability, taking into account the possibilities and needs back then. On the basis of that structure, in terms of personnel, training, and logistics, Poland's defense system is being built also today (even though the basis has been modified and adapted to contemporary political and international realities). And now as to what I regard to be the biggest failure, or actually a life mistake--speaking in personal terms, it was my decision to join politics. That put an enormous burden on me, and it also brought a lot of bitterness. But I would like to expand my answer a bit here. In my view, in politics one can speak of defeat in historical dimensions, defeat in strategic dimensions, and defeat in tactical dimensions. The last kind of defeat unavoidably accompanies the activity of every government, to a lesser or greater extent. If a government does not commit too many of these defeats, and if they do not manage to become a negative process, they are, of course, not pleasant, but they still tend not to be a major danger. A historical defeat takes place when the defeat's all-national impact is of enormous importance and when it is first of all irreplaceable and also accompanied by a heavy bloodbath. My conscience is not stained with a defeat of this kind. And, finally, a strategic defeat: It does not always have to be linked to a specific decision, act, or fact. In my view, the fact that I failed to lead to a national agreement before 13 December 1981 is such a defeat. I said and wrote a lot about the reasons for that. Right now, I would just like to air what may be regarded as a controversial view, but it is one that has been confirmed by life practice: Martial law was a common defeat. But, however paradoxical that may also sound, martial law was also a common victory. I am saying that because, while not ignoring the tragedy that occurred at the Wujek coal mine or other painful issues and events, we are not divided by an insurmountable abyss. That made it possible, going step by step on a winding and rough road, to come to the "Roundtable" and sign an agreement. What turned out impossible for domestic and external reasons in 1981 became realistic in 1989. [Lukasiewicz] I would like to return to martial law for a moment. You said during a conversation with THE NEW YORK TIMES last year that, if the situation of 13 years ago was repeated right now, you would prefer to commit suicide than introduce martial law again. Why is that? [Jaruzelski] And tell me, would any sane person want to find himself again in the same kind of situation, with all of its nightmare, and be faced with the most dramatic decision of his life? My statement, which you cited, should be interpreted precisely in that sense. The statement was about personal and human aspects. As regards a political assessment of the decision to introduce martial law, I have presented it on many occasions, and I find no reason to change it now. [Lukasiewicz] Some of your colleagues from the past have been proposing a thesis from time to time--in the context of the famous theory of "choosing the lesser evil"--that the "Roundtable" talks and the subsequent changes in Poland would not have taken place if it had not been for martial law. Do you share this view, and, if so, my question is: Could it not have been done sooner? Why did it have to take as long as eight years? [Jaruzelski] Yes, I do indeed share the view you mentioned. After all, the view expresses a knowledge and an awareness of the fact that martial law prevented a multidimensional disaster. It is not my intention to diminish the evil--in particular, the personal harm--that martial law caused. But, on the other hand and objectively speaking, it also created a chance for the gradual development of the right conditions for fundamental changes that occurred later. Attempts to demonstrate that the introduction of martial law was accompanied by an idea of surrendering power and paving the way for capitalism in Poland would of course be ridiculous. But it is true that the extraordinary measures that were undertaken at the time made it possible to reduce the extremely high social tensions that were close to eruption, to maintain the indispensable leadership of the country, and to prevent economic destruction. Various types of reform-oriented measures were undertaken to follow that. It is true that their extent was limited, but it was not a "black hole," nevertheless. In June 1989, not everything started from scratch. Also in previous years there were searches, experiences, embryos, and bridgeheads. We were a heretic island within the [socialist] bloc, in the "pre-Gorbachev" years. In the years of perestroyka, Poland became a testing ground for various tests and measures. Finally, the "Roundtable" and its consequences occurred as an incentive and a model for transformations throughout the region. So one can put it this way: Martial law froze the political and social arrangement that was formed in the 1980-81 period. It transferred the arrangement into a different historical time and a different geopolitical dimension, into a situation where the idea of national agreement became the only way to resolve Polish problems. After all, the "Roundtable" was, in essence, a repetition of the concept of the National Agreement Council, which I had suggested in the fall of 1981. Even what happened in Magdalenka was to a certain extent a reflection of the so-called initiating group that was supposed to come to agreement and suggest the council's structure and functions. However, there is the question of whether it all could have been done earlier, faster, and better. It undoubtedly could have. Today I can see various mistakes and inconsistencies, setbacks, and delays more clearly. However, any "great leap," both for external and internal reasons, was not possible in that reality. If even today, in a new political and international reality, there emerge such great obstacles on the road of thorough economic transformations, one can imagine what the obstacles were in that period. Apart from that, we were very strict about the social duties of the state, which often took precedence over the economy. It is worth recalling how many apartments were built in the martial law period: in 1982, approximately 185,000; in 1983, over 195,000; in the years that followed, until 1989, the numbers were similar. At the same time, I still remember the charge that was leveled at me: One has to wait for an apartment as long as 30 years. Now that we build fewer apartments, such complaints have become less audible. However, I think that the people still remember various social solutions. In the last elections, the Polish people showed that certain achievements, which martial law also protected, are very close to them. I am not saying this from the position of "Now, what did I tell you?," but I am rather encouraging a quiet, sine ira et studio reflection on the entire complexity of the past road. [Lukasiewicz] However, despite the fact that the governing administration has changed, the responsibility for imposing martial law is still a subject of constitutional proceedings. Do you not think that the so-called Suslov documents played a role here? I mean the documents that suggest that you did not rule out the possibility of requesting help from the "Soviet comrades". [Jaruzelski] I already discussed this topic in RZECZPOSPOLITA twice (25-26 September and 6-7 November 1993). No one has refuted the substance of those explanations. How many times must we recall the desperate efforts we made so that our Polish problems would remain ours? This is what happened. This is concrete and palpable proof; it is more important than any sensational news that is contrary to it. It is worth noting that the order for them came from Poland. This was proved by its evident selectiveness and by taking advantage of it in the preelection period. The way the previous management of television used this topic was very significant; it allowed me to present my explanations only two weeks after the elections. The following fact is very important here: Unlike the case of many other documents from the already mentioned Archives, protocols signed by a secretary of the Central Committee [KC], the only pretext for this "sensation" was not a protocol, but an unsigned working note. The fact that the list of people participating in that session did not include the name of Mikhail Gorbachev is characteristic. In several interviews he stated that the Politburo of KC of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union did not take such things into consideration. There are also other arguments in this issue that I have already explained, among others, in RZECZPOSPOLITA. Their meaning has been strengthened by the recently revealed documents from the archives of the former German Democratic Republic. I think that similar materials can also be found in former Czechoslovakia. I must recall again, however, that I never put the external factor in first place. I have often said, also in my book The Martial Law. Why... that it would have been below my dignity as an officer if I had used the pretext of some external disposition or directive. However, it is true that the awareness of the seriousness of the situation hung over us like a black cloud. Such was the logic of the geostrategic division of Europe and the world. Disregarding it would have meant playing with the fate of the nation and the state. Various accusers of the so-called authors of martial law are becoming ludicrous. They claim that we were not threatened by anything at that time; however, today, in a much more advantageous international situation, they feel great anxiety because of every other statement by Zhirinovskiy. We can also say the same about the very nervous reactions to the possibility of decreasing the gas supply from Russia for a time, even though this possibility was only slightly signaled in 1992. Now, how much more dangerous it all looked at the end of 1981. The Soviets almost delivered an ultimatum, announcing that they would drastically cut the supplies of gas, oil, and many other raw materials and commodities. The results would have been catastrophic. Therefore, we must take an objective look at the past, primarily at our common Polish faults. At that time, we, both the authorities and Solidarity, were not mature enough to reach an agreement. Today many activists of the opposition of that time proudly call those events a rebellion, an insurrection. I feel respect for the freedom-oriented, democratic intentions of those activities--all the more so because, as it is said informally, not even one windowpane was broken at that time. However, the economy was destroyed, with all of the material and biological effects of that on the people; the functioning of the state was paralyzed, and confrontation was a real danger. If someone has a poor memory, he will find the confirmation of this evaluation in countless archival materials that illustrated that situation and the consequent circumstances of the introduction of martial law. I also feel that we should recall many confidential and public statements by Western and Eastern politicians, as well as by many foreign publications. In light of all those facts, one can only be surprised at the decision of the previous Sejm, which started proceedings in the Constitutional Responsibility Committee. A dramatically complex problem, which will be disputed by historians for decades, has been subjected to a procedure that is burdened with political emotions. Instead, in line with the wise Spanish model, shortening the distance and linking, we will recreate historical antagonisms and divisions in modern wrappings. This will not be beneficial either to Poland, or even to the political circles that have inherited the oppositional ethos. The hearing of evidence will reveal and recall many issues that I believe the extremist circles of the Solidarity of that period would rather forget. Who, then, needs this? [Lukasiewicz] Let us, however, revert to the present. Do you think the democratic mechanisms, which have no doubt been implemented by the Solidarity governments, are so lasting that the next change of the governing elites will be made in an equally peaceful manner as the one on 19 September? [Jaruzelski] I fully appreciate the role of the Solidarity governments in the process of implementing democratic mechanisms. I think that the Polish people, despite the fact that they are critical of some manifestations of the parliament's activities, have really been bitten by the bug of democracy. Therefore, any nondemocratic moves would have been evaluated critically. Frequent elections and changes of parliaments and governments, even due to the costs of these operations, are not received enthusiastically. There are not many people left who believe in slogans and promises. Tired of the turmoil of not really understandable disputes and conflicts, people want some stabilization. No authorities can enjoy their honeymoon periods for a long time. The popularity of politicians is changeable, all the more so because there is enough fuel for social tensions. The tensions can primarily be found in the difficult living conditions of many people in Poland. The Independent Self-Governing Trade Union "Solidarity" can see a chance for itself there. It is a union that particularly willingly employs the instrument of protests and strikes. The political reality has changed, but they still say "bad government" and "down with communists." The All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement, even though more numerous and often treated as a postsocialist relic, did not create as many problems even to the Solidarity governments as Solidarity is creating now. Its destabilizing moves, politically backed by radically rightist circles, may disturb the rhythm of the functioning and of the normal changes of the democratically elected state authorities. Also, the conflict between the president and the parliament adds to this situation. The statement made by Deputy Jerzy Jaskiernia in the Sejm seemed to me to be more convincing than the arguments put forward by Minister Lech Falandysz. However, it was also wrong and unseemly to reject the president's motion without forwarding it to the committees and without a debate that might have resulted in some compromise solution. Even though the rules of democracy were not slighted, the president may have perceived this decision as an act of disrespect and arrogance. This may have been the reason for such an emotional response, which, however, was rather exaggerated to the rank of the event. However, Lech Walesa is a realist. He plays roughly, to be sure, and not always fairly; he goes especially far in rhetoric. In practice, however, he does not go beyond the playground thatc is called democracy. I am also convinced that the other party to the conflict will have enough composure and restraint. Therefore, we should only hope that the present situation will not turn into a "war in high places," which would be detrimental primarily to Poland. No one can really gain anything in such a war. Everyone will be defeated. [Lukasiewicz] Apologizing right after the elections in rather general terms to all those who suffered under the old system, Aleksander Kwasniewski announced that there would be no comeback either to the communist past, or to the republic of "Solidarity buddies." However, what we have recently been witnessing in the cadre policy does look like the recreation of the "republic of buddies," the only difference being that they are from "a different shelf." What do you think about that? Slogans are only slogans, but a concrete policy is carried out by concrete people. [Jaruzelski] Aleksander Kwasniewski told the truth--there is no going back to the past system, and there is no retreating from the road of democratic and free-market-oriented transformations. This is the most important assumption. It is confirmed by practice. Personnel moves, however important they are, are not able to change the generally accepted direction. Actually, there is no such intention. The differences in views on the transformations concern the technology, not the foundations. Of course, the people in the administration quite considerably influence the implementation process. Therefore, I understand the sensitivity to personnel decisions. Over the four years of the Solidarity governments a thorough change, especially in the people in managerial positions, was made. The substantive criteria were often not taken into account. Apart from justified decisions, most of them were dictated by the political past and membership. This was often accompanied by revenge and looting. This must not be repeated in the new situation. However, I believe that lifelong anathemas imposed on people active before 1989, and consequent nervous reactions to the present personnel moves cannot block the changes. Of course, if the necessary requirements concerning their qualifications, competence, loyalty, and morale are satisfied. I do not know exactly the scale of the personnel changes that are being made now, nor do I know to what extent they can be said to be controversial from the viewpoint of qualifications. I believe, however, that too far-reaching generalizations should be avoided. This does not mean, of course, that we should close our eyes to such moves which, being a play of various pressures, would lead to clique configurations, weaker than their predecessors as far as their competence and functioning are concerned. The most important criterion must be the potential and real efficiency of the persons' activities. [Lukasiewicz] How long do you think the so-called left wing will govern the country, especially after the recent crisis in the governing coalition, and after the increasing differences within the leftist parliamentary clubs have become visible? [Jaruzelski] I am a supporter of the left wing. I hope it will stay in power for a long time, at least until the end of the term. It must be remembered that a complex program of transformations can only be implemented over three or four years; I mean a program of transformations that would harmonize the mechanisms of economic growth with social goals, which is extremely difficult. This coalition has the greatest chance to do this. Both components of the coalition know that a different composition is not very real (PSL) and entirely unreal (SLD). This should also have a soothing influence on internal factional-centrifugal trends within the parties. However, even possible factions do not necessarily have to lead to the disturbing of the fundamental potential of each of the groupings. However, there will be no idyll. The differences are quite considerable in some areas. However, "first, do not disturb." Being in a coalition is an art of compromise, the ability to be above the parochial interests in the name of higher issues. All the more so because after all no one in the coalition will become stronger only because someone else will be weaker--in this way the whole is weaker. I believe in the intelligence, pragmatism, and the feeling of responsibility of Waldemar Pawlak and Aleksander Kwasniewski. These young leaders--age being their great advantage--are quite different, but for this reason they complement each other. I think that in the long run they can gain a strategic victory only if they stick together. This is not easy. However, whoever has agreed to carry the burden of power, whoever treats the interest of the state as the most important thing, must have the courage and wisdom to walk this proverbial line. [Lukasiewicz] Finally, let us go beyond Polish reality. How do you evaluate the recent years of the Polish foreign policy, and do you share the opinion that only the closest possible relations of Poland with the West can assure us security? The Russian elections and the statements not only by Zhirinovskiy, but also recently by Yeltsin himself and persons related to him, such as Grachev or Kozyrev, reveal increasingly clearly the imperial appetites of Russia. It seems that it would have nothing against including us in its zone of influence once again. [Jaruzelski] This is a broad and extensively discussed subject. I will, therefore, confine myself to several general remarks, because I do not feel entitled to evaluate the Polish foreign policy as a whole; I have too little information and up-to-date knowledge. Its most important elements are hidden in the safes of appropriate chancelleries, headquarters, and ministries. However, as I look at it from a certain distance, I can say that my evaluation of the policy pursued by Andrzej Olechowski is higher than the evaluation of the policy of his predecessor, whom I know very well and highly value for his activeness between 1986-89, when he was a member of the Consultation Council of the Chairman of the State of PRL. I think that the communicativeness and dynamics of the present foreign policy are much bigger. Apart from the understandable involvement and anchorage in the West, the activities in the eastern direction have increased; the economic aspect is also stressed. For a few years now Poland has felt the comfort of relations with its great eastern neighbor, relations based on equal rights. I believe that this allows us to lower the temperature of reactions to historical events. There is no doubt that as far as the issues of national security are concerned, one can never stand at ease. However, emotions are a bad adviser as well. In other words, we must open our eyes wider than we open our mouths. Historical-psychological factors should not take precedence over cool, substantive analysis. I have the military, professional habit of getting to the core of a matter; I usually start with the evaluation of the forces, the possibilities, and probable intentions of the other side, let us say. Then one's own forces and possibilities should be evaluated. This is supplemented by an analysis of other accompanying conditions; as a result, by seeing the difference between the possible and the real threat, one can draw the right conclusions: For today, for tomorrow, and for the day after tomorrow. I believe that a quiet, substantive analysis of the international situation, a pragmatic calculation of the gains and losses would allow us to have more options, adequate to the actual and forecast situation. Of course, the problem is extremely important. Therefore, both the official stance of the authorities and the published materials show the world our options and expectations. At the same time they enrich the knowledge and the feeling of joint responsibility of the people for the future of the country. This should be one of the most important levers strengthening the political, economic, and defense condition of Poland. "Hell is paved" with treaties and guarantees. They are really credible only when they are in agreement with the broadly understood interests of the state that issues the guarantees. Adam Daniel Rotfeld, director of the Stockholm Institute of Peace Research (SPIRI), writes that right now no one in the West can see a "danger from the East," but only "danger in the East," and in addition, of an unpredictable character. Only a Poland that is socially stable, economically healthy, and politically predictable will be a valuable and really protected link in the European order and security. One more conclusion is to be vigilant and ready, but, at the same time, to do everything to have friends not only far, but also near.
