[passage omitted] Reports coming into Islamabad today indicated that three senior Indian security officials died and a number of others were wounded in clashes in Srinagar Province. Responding to the Indian charges, knowledgeable sources in Islamabad said today that the Indian threats to launch "a limited war" along the line of control on Kashmir will not force Pakistan to abandon its stand on the Kashmir issue. The Pakistani sources told MENA that if India truly fears that "a limited war" will break out and affirms that there is shooting on the line, it has not informed Pakistan of this officially through the hot line between the directors of military operations in the two countries. The sources stressed that Indian allegations about the Afghan mojahedin infiltrating Kashmir are baseless. They said Indian patrols roam about the entire line and that they mined and erected barbed wire along it. The Pakistani sources explained that the mountainous passages, the only way in for infiltrators all along the line, have been completely blocked by snow and that it is impossible to pass through them. As regards shooting along the line of control, the Pakistani sources said the Indian forces over the past four years have been firing provocatively all along the line in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The sources added that it is estimated that India killed over 600 civilians on the Pakistani side of the border recently, while Pakistan avoids shooting at civilian targets. The sources accused India of waging a war against unarmed civilians in Kashmir and called on India to stop this war immediately. These sources affirmed that Islamabad has no intention of using force and noted that Pakistan does not interfere in Kashmir but supports the just aspirations of the Kashmiri people who are struggling for their right to self-determination.
