Our correspondent Foivos Karzis reports: [Begin recording] [Karzis] The Greek demarche was extremely strong and concerned not only the continuing detention of the six Omonoia leading members but also the new attempt to involve Greece in activities within Albania. Two of the accusations leveled against the six people concerned cooperating with the Greek secret services and conspiring to separate Albanian territory. Acting on instructions from Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, Ambassador Petros Angelakis, head of the Albanian Affairs Department at the Foreign Ministry, summoned the Albanian ambassador in Athens to express Greece's strong concern and protest over these actions. Angelakis pointed out to him that such actions weaken the Athens- Tirana relations. A short time ago, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Konstandinos Bikas pointed out that Tirana's options do not lead to defusing the crisis. [Bikas] The Albanian Government has to realize that with the aforementioned actions it follows a slippery road which exposes it to the appropriate international organizations and does not render trustworthy its efforts to restore the democratic lawful order and the rule of law in the country, nor is it possible for Albania to convince anybody that it respects its international obligations. [Karzis] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos had earlier reiterated the warning to Tirana. [Venizelos] Greece has depended and continues to depend on the improvement of Greek-Albanian relations. Greece pursues the respect for the rights of the Greeks in Albania and the Albanian Government knows this very well. [Karzis] Official opposition leader Miltiadhis Evert approved of Greece's intervention to suspend the EU [Economic Union] grant to Albania while Nikolaos Konstandopoulos, chairman of the Coalition of the Left and of the Progress Party, called for mobilization at all international forums. [Evert] It is a most positive step and proves that when all the parties get together and follow a decisive policy, a coordinated policy, we can really achieve much more. [Konstandopoulos] I believe that in order to defend the Greek minority rights there should be a decisive, cool mobilization by Greece at all the international organizations. [end recording]
