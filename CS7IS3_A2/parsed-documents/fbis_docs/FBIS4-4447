They are fined between [Singapore dollar] $1,500 and $2,000 on each of the charges (?brought) against them. [passage omitted on names of defendants] In passing judgment, Senior District Judge Mr. Richard Magnus said the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt the charges brought against them while the defense had not rebutted beyond reasonable doubt those charges. The offenses arose as a result of a BUSINESS TIMES article in June 1992, which carried a flash estimate for the second-quarter economic growth that year. In making the mitigation plea, lawyers for the accused persons urged the court to impose only a fine and not a custodial sentence. Replying, the attorney general, Mr. Chan Sek Keong, noted that all the five accused persons had distinguished careers. He said he would not go so far as to say that a custodial sentence is a correct sentence.
