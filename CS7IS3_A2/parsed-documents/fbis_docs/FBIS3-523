About 100,000 ANC supporters from all over Venda attended the rally. Mr Mandela answered their numerous questions on ANC policy. He was asked what would become of uneducated Venda government office cleaners -- who earn R140 [rand] a month -- if the ANC came to power. "All temporary government workers, unregistered labourers and low wages will come to a halt," Mr Mandela replied. Males and females with the same qualifications would get equal pay, he added. On education, Mr Mandela said there would be free and compulsory education for all children for the next 10 years. Parents denying children their right to education would be prosecuted. On the Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland] issue, Mr Mandela said Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] leader Gen Constand Viljoen and Conservative Party leader Ferdi Hartzenberg would never see it. "As long as I live there will never be a volkstaat and I assure you that the National Party [NP] will be buried after April 27. Vote for the ANC as the NP and F. W. de Klerk have been rejected by white voters, because when he calls a rally only 30 people attend."
