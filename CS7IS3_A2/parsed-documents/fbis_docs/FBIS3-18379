This absolute reduction of 580,000 employees will, however, not increase unemployment by the same percentage, because retirements, hidden reserves, and domestic policy measures will partly compensate for the job losses. This is the result of a sample inquiry by the Institute for Labor Market and Occupational Research and Infratest Social Research on "employment trends," which was carried out for the first time in the middle of 1993 in 4,500 enterprises and public administrative bodies. Still, employment will not decrease in all branches and sizes of enterprises, and not in all 1.6 million enterprises in western Germany by the middle of 1994, Bernhard Jagoda, president of the Federal Labor Office, said in a news conference. According to his statements, 175,000 enterprises, which account for almost one-third of all employees, are intending to reduce their staff by 0.95 million by the middle of 1994. At the same time, 230,000 enterprises, which offer one-seventh of all jobs, are planning to increase their work force by 0.44 million. Approximately three-quarters of all enterprises accounting for more than half of all employees are expecting stable employment figures by the middle of 1994. Enterprises with decreasing employment exist in all branches. With the exception of credit institutions, insurance companies, the liberal professions, and regional and local authorities, the share of enterprises that expect their employment figures rather to diminish is over 10 percent. Losses are particularly high in the agricultural sector, the manufacturing industry, and the health sector. The slump in employment has mainly been caused by staff reductions in large enterprises. Enterprises with a work force of more than 5,000 intend to employ 11 percent fewer employees than in the middle of 1992. Hopes regarding employment have to be pinned especially on small enterprises. Small enterprises with up to 50 employees in the service sector is the group that least has to expect job cuts in 1994. In his news conference, Jagoda stated that a massive reduction of jobs alone will not solve the problems of the enterprises. The willingness to be innovative and the ability to modernize structures will be increasingly important for a positive economic and employment development and the securing of economic centers and jobs. Here, the survey produced the following result: On an average, 26 percent of the enterprises stated that they improved and further developed their products in the past two years. This rate rises to 58 percent in the case of enterprises with more than 500 employees. Regardless of enterprise size, an average 25 percent of enterprises added new products or services to their offer for which there is already a market. Eleven percent of all enterprises developed completely new products and services, for which a new market has to first be created. All in all, 40 percent of enterprises in western Germany made one of the above-mentioned innovative efforts in the past two years. Despite the general reduction of jobs, there is still a significant offer of vacancies. A total of 260,000 enterprises, or more than one-sixth of all, was looking for a total of 492,000 workers in mid-1993 for employment as early as possible. A total of 187 [number as published] enterprises wanted to increase their work force by 347,000 people at a later time. Jagoda complained that only about one-third of these vacancies were reported to the labor offices, seizing the opportunity to plead for closer trusting cooperation between enterprises and the labor offices in the future. About half of the entire offer were vacancies for skilled workers, and more than one-third for qualified employees. A total of 8 percent of all enterprises in western Germany did not find applicants for their vacancies.
