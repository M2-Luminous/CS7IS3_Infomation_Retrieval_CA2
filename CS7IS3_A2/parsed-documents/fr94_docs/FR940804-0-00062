FR940804-0-00062 FR940804-0-00022 Fourth, if EPA proposes (after month 18, but before the subsequent 6-month sanctions clock expires) to fully or conditionally approve a plan or proposes to find that the State is implementing its SIP, and EPA does not take action reversing such positive action until after the subsequent 6-month clock expires, application of the offset sanction is stayed and application of the highway sanction is deferred unless and until EPA's proposed positive finding is reversed. The offset sanction reapplies and the highway sanction applies on the date EPA's preliminary determination is reversed. (This scenario is provided for in the rule at §§52.31(d)(2)(ii), (d)(3)(ii) and (d)(4)(ii).) The following discussion and Figure 4 provide an example of how this process functions for a SIP disapproval. The process functions in the same way for an initial finding of failure to implement. Suppose EPA makes a SIP disapproval, initiating the section 179 sanction process. Suppose that EPA, after 18 months (but before the subsequent 6-month clock expires), proposes to fully or conditionally approve the SIP. The EPA would simultaneously issue an interim final rule, finding that the State has corrected the deficiency. In that case, application of the offset sanction would be stayed and application of the highway sanction deferred at the time EPA makes its positive finding. Now suppose that, at month 26, EPA reverses its positive finding. The reversal would be a proposal to disapprove the SIP in whole or in part or a final disapproval of the SIP in whole or in part. At month 26 (or, for final actions, on the action's effective date), the offset sanction reapplies and the highway sanction applies.
