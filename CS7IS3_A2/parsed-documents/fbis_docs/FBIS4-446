The "Committee of Zairean Opposition of Forces in Favor of Change" (COZAFAC), whose delegates from France, Germany, the United States, and Belgium met yesterday in Brussels, observed in a communique that Monsignor Monsengwo "betrayed the people by selling out the achievements of the Sovereign National Conference." The COZAFAC called on the Zairean opposition to reconstitute themselves around Etienne Tshisekedi, elected prime minister by the national conference in August 1992 and dismissed by Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko in January 1993. The HCR-PT on 31 March adopted a new "constitutional act," which is supposed to govern the democratic transitional period in Zaire toward a Third Republic. On 8 April, Monsignor Monsengwo announced that an agreement was reached on the procedure for the appointment of a future prime minister.
