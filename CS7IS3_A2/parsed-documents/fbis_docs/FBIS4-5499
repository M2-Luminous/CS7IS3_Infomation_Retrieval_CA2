"The economy is in a delicate stage" with both good and bad indicators, Fujii repeated at a news conference after a morning cabinet meeting. Fujii was referring to a monthly economic report endorsed at the cabinet meeting. The report, compiled by the Economic Planning Agency, said the economy remains sluggish but included a phrase that some bright spots have emerged. Fujii's cautious stance on the economy contrasts with that of Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno and many private economists, who have recently suggested that the economy is showing signs of bottoming out. The finance minister said the political uncertainty "is certainty not favorable" for corporate and consumer sentiment. He called for a settlement as soon as possible of the issue of choosing a successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced his intention to resign last Friday. Concerning tax reform, Fujii said, "the direction and track indicated by the Hosokawa cabinet will be inherited by any new cabinet." "Tax reform should become the mainstay of any new cabinet," he said. The government has pledged to conduct a full tax reform, including permanent income tax cuts, by the end of the year, and promised in its March market-opening package to present details of the tax reform plan in June. Legislators of both the ruling parties and the opposition Liberal Democratic Party attached a provision to include permanent tax cuts in the tax reform when they enacted a single-year tax cut bill in March.
