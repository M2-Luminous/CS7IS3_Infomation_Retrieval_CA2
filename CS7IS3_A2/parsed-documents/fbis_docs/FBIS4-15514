At a news conference in Kishinev today, the head of the Cabinet of Ministers rejected the view that following the Moldavan Parliament's ratification today of the agreements signed by President Mircea Snegur on joining the CIS and the economic union, rivers of gas will flow into the Republic from Russia. We advocate equal cooperation with all countries. No one is giving us anything for nothing today, either from Russia or from Romania, the prime minister stressed. Cooperation within the CIS and the economic union, in his view, make it possible to put on a civilized level the close ties between the former union republics, and to avoid the hard knocks caused when they were unjustifiably broken.
