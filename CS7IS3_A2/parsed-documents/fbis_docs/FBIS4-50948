During the inspection, he pointed out that since the Opium War, the Chinese people have been struggling for over 150 years and they are now faced with an excellent opportunity for development. As long as we resolutely seize this opportunity, follow the direction given in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, handle well the relationship between reform, development, and stability, forge unity, and strive forward, China has great hope for development. Li Peng and his party, accompanied by Chen Huanyou, secretary of the Jiangsu provincial CPC committee and governor of Jiangsu, and travelling along the Grand Canal, inspected commodity grain production bases and state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises in Lianyungang, Huaiyin, Yangzhou, and Zhengjiang, and visited farmers' families and talked with local cadres and the masses. The great land along the Changjiang and Huaihe in early summer is surging with vitality. Li Peng said he had been in Jiangsu several times and had witnessed Jiangsu's development and changes amid reform and opening up. Jiangsu's conscientious implementation of the principle and policies of the CPC Central Committee has brought about rapid economic development and marked improvement in the living standards of urban and rural citizens, and it has positively contributed to the state. He continued, saying that in the course of the economic development, it is not only necessary for localities to take their local interests into consideration, but also to subordinate themselves to the requirements of the state and handle well the relationship between the state and localities. He expressed the hope that Jiangsu would make persistent efforts and score even greater development. The main purpose of Li Peng's current tour is to inspect state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises and village and township enterprises in Jiangsu. Li Peng made detailed inquiries into the production and operations of the Lianyungang Port Affairs Bureau, Yangzhou Transport and Container Limited Company, Yangzhou Passenger Bus Manufacturing Plant, and Zhengjiang Jiangkui Enterprise Limited Company. He noted that operations at many state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises were good. He said they produce marketable products to compete both on the domestic and foreign markets. They possess advanced technologies. They exercise strict management. Their products are very competitive, and their economic efficiency is high. But we should also see to the fact that in the course of deepening the reform and of moving toward a market economy, some enterprises have met with varying degrees of difficulties, resulting in low economic efficiency. This has been caused by many factors. We should not only have full confidence in helping state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises operate well, but also attach importance to existing problems at state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. He pointed out the need for the state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises to face up to market competition; always strive to make their products adapt to domestic and foreign markets' needs; stress marketing; actively develop markets; establish good mechanisms adapted to the socialist market economy; attach importance to technological progress; enhance reserve forces for enterprise development and competitiveness; and to stress national structure and economic benefits in the areas of development. He said it is groundless for some to equate state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises with low efficiency enterprises. We have full confidence and we believe that we will surely help state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises operate well through our efforts. Whether in Huaiyang, located in the hinterland of north Jiangsu, or in Yangzhou and Zhenjiang, on the two banks of Chang Jiang, Li Peng has shown great concern over the problems of agriculture, villages, and peasants. In Yanzhuang Village, Gaogou Town, Lianshui County, he held a forum with cadres at provincial, city, county, town, village levels and cadres from peasants' groups on the issues concerning ways to increase agricultural production, readjust agricultural structure, and improve the living standards of peasants. In Wuan Township, Gaoyou City, he checked the growth of summer grain in the field and visited peasant families. In Longshan Village, Dantu County, he inspected the Longshan United Eel Corporation to learn about the development of the situation. He stressed: Agriculture is a major matter of vital importance to the state's overall economic situation and social stability, and its development must receive attention. Under the circumstance of fairly low agricultural efficiency, in particular, the role of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy must not be shaken. He hoped that Jiangsu would fully display its abilities in developing a diversified economy after stabilizing food production; increase per mu area yield and pay attention to efficiency at the same time after securing land for growing grain; and support the development of the collective economy and village and town enterprises in rural areas, as well as gradually develop optimum scale farming, after stabilizing and improving the household-based system of contracted responsibility with remuneration linked to output. During his inspection, Li Peng came to Huaian -- the hometown of Zhou Enlai, a great proletarian revolutionary. He paid a visit to the memorial hall and former residence of Zhou Enlai and viewed an exhibition of Zhou Enlai's feats. He said: We should emulate Comrade Zhou Enlai's lofty moral character -- his absolute devotion to the cause of revolution and his deep love for the people. After hearing the briefing of the Jiangsu provincial party committee and government, Li Peng emphatically noted: Price hikes have slowed down over the past two months, but stabilizing the market and commodity prices remain an important task of governments at various levels. Discussing the gap between south and north Jiangsu, Li Peng said: Judging from the national standard, Jiangsu is economically developed; however, there is certain difference between the north and the south of the province when the two areas are compared with one another. South Jiangsu, which has become prosperous first, is responsible for helping the north develop economy, so that it will also become rich as soon as possible. North Jiangsu has its own superiority -- in land, resources, and labor, for example -- and its key tasks at present are to further solve the transportation problem and improve its technical and management levels, so as to gradually narrow the difference. Also participating in the inspection tour were Chen Jinhua, He Chunlin, Liu Jiang, Huang Zhendong, Guo Lin, Jiang Yunbao, and responsible persons of relevant departments under the State Council.
