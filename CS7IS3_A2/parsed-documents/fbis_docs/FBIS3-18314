"In Italy there is a slow but constant recovery in the real economy," he announced yesterday during a meeting at the Milan Fair. That was a statement made under the banner of a cautious, yet decisive, optimism on the fate of our economy, which has come out of a disastrous 1993. "The recovery," Abete explained, "depends on the driving effect which the high capacity of Italian businesses to compete on international markets is also shifting onto domestic production." The Confindustria president added that "there is a slight upturn in domestic consumption in Italy," following the downturn in the entire European economy. So there is optimism, but it is tempered by a good shot of caution. "We must not have sudden expectations of growth," Abete added, "but we must be confident that this positive trend will continue and that it should not be disturbed in its evolution." According to Abete, the progress shown by some economic indicators, such as industrial production, "will allow us to have a 1994 that is certainly better than 1993, and to consolidate the competitive ability of our economy, which could bear considerable fruit in 1995." So is the recovery under way? The road is certainly not a downhill one, but a lot will depend on the economic policy measures taken by the next government. Despite the recent reduction in the discount rate to 7.5 percent, the knotty matter of interest rates remains unresolved. In order to assist in the recovery, interest rates "must drop further, not just in Italy but in Europe too." The industrialist leader concluded by saying that "we are waiting with confidence for this to be verified in the coming months." However, there are still other obstacles: such as the public-sector deficit, which this year seems destined to exceed current estimates, and above all, the employment crisis. The ISCO [National Institute for the Study of the Economic Situation] report recently released highlights the fact that the economic recovery will not be enough to guarantee a recovery on the employment front; this year unemployment is to rise another 1.2 percent following the 2.8 percent upsurge in 1993. In the complex profile of Italy Inc., increasingly strong indicators are emerging every day which indicate a revival in the economy as well as signals that suggest caution. It is definitely the former which have prevailed recently: Industrial production grew in the three-month period from December to February and the import/export figure, which in 1993 -- as the Italian Exchange Office pointed out yesterday -- chalked up a credit of around 11 trillion lire, compared with a deficit of 15.8 trillion in 1992. Judging by the most recent data available, industry sales are still stagnant: The data for last October, released yesterday by ISTAT, mention modest growth of around 1.3 percent and only 1.6 percent in the first 10 months of the year -- well below the rate of inflation. Reading these data help paint a picture of the tough 1993 experienced by our economy: Industry sales for the domestic market dropped 2.6 percent in the first 10 months of last year. It was only export sales that rose, i.e., by 15.6 percent. The poor progress made in regulating industry confirms last year's dreadful performance: In the first 10 months, domestic orders dropped 10.2 percent, while foreign orders provided oxygen for demand, chalking up growth of 16.9 percent. Strewn among the light and shadow of 1993, other signs can also be perceived: for example, the massive drop (down 37 percent) in gas consumption by the chemical industry reported by SNAM [National Gas Pipeline Company], which was nevertheless offset by the increase in household consumption. However, Alessandro Cocirio, president of CONFAPI [National Confederation of Small Manufacturers], the association which counts around 35,000 small manufacturers, is resolutely against the optimism of recent days. "Before saying that there is a recovery," he said yesterday, "I would think about it a bit. I would definitely talk about a reversal of the trend. The crisis in Italy began in 1990 and by December 1992 we were in an extremely tough period that followed the exchange rate upheavals and devaluation. So, comparing the data from December 1993 with the data from back then is not a very wise thing to do." Cocirio sees a drab picture for the future too. "The trade balance," he explained, "is also feeling the effect of the drop in imports as a result of the drastic drop in domestic demand. When domestic demand starts to pick up, it will head toward goods which come from abroad. Consequently, Italian businesses will sell less and experience a negative effect." Returning to the annual data on the trade balance and exchange rates, the best results were achieved in the mechanics sector (the credit rose by some 9 trillion), the transport sector (which recovered almost 7 trillion over the sea of red ink booked in 1992), and the metalworking sector. Most prominent from the geographical point of view is the clear-cut improvement in Italian trade with a number of key countries. With Germany there was a spectacular turnaround in the trade balance, which rose from a deficit of more than 3.6 trillion to a credit of 2.4 trillion, while with the United States the credit rose fivefold [as published], from 1.3 trillion to more than 5.6 billion.
