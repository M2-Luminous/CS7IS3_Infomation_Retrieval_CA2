FR940504-2-00060 FR940504-2-00053 Public Land and Resources; Planning, Programming, and Budgeting AGENCY: Bureau of Land Management Interior. ACTION: Notification of resource management planning schedule. SUMMARY: Resource management planning for the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) administered lands is governed by regulations in 43 CFR 1610.2(b). These regulations require that the BLM publish a planning schedule advising the public of the status of resource management plans (RMP's) in preparation. Projected new RMP starts for the three succeeding fiscal years are also identified to provide the public an opportunity to comment on the projected planning schedule and aid in the coordination of the schedule with other agencies. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A limited number of new starts for RMP's are projected. There are currently 34 RMP efforts underway (not including amendments and revisions). It is forecasted that 11 of the RMP's will be completed in fiscal year 1994 and an additional 11 will be completed in fiscal year 1995. These efforts are having a significant effect on BLM capability to initiate new RMP's and complete maintenance/monitoring and implementation of the existing RMP's. Upon completion of a major portion of the current ongoing RMP's, the BLM will start a limited number of new RMP's or RMP revisions within its current capability. A priority ranking system will be utilized to allocate the limited new planning efforts. New RMP starts for fiscal year 1994 include Snake River/Deep Creek RMP (Idaho). New starts for 1995 include Malheur/Jordan RMP (Oregon) and Price RMP (Utah). New starts for 1996 include Andrews RMP (Oregon) and Winnemuca/Surprise (Nevada). The planning process begins with the publication of a Notice of Intent to initiate an RMP. A public notice and and an opportunity for participation in each RMP are provided as required by the regulations (43 CFR 1610.2(f)). Publication of the draft RMP and associated draft environmental impact statement as indicated on the schedule is a key opportunity for public comment. A key to the abbreviations used is provided after the schedule. DATES: Comments on the schedule will be accepted until June 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be sent to Director (760), Bureau of Land Management, Rm. 406 LS, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, D.C. 20240. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jordon Pope or Colin Voigt (202) 452&hyph;5045. Dated: April 20, 1994. Mike Dombeck, Acting Director.
