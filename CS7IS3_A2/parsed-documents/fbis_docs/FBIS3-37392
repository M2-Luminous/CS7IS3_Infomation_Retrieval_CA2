The agreement delineates the two sides' areas of responsibility and defines what they must run together. Speaking at the signing ceremony, Yeltsin and Shaimiyev have both pointed to the significance of the deal stressing that political and economic reforms must be based on civic peace, ethnic harmony and human rights priorities. The treaty is based on "recognition of each other's constitutions without encroaching on their substance", Shaymiyev told Interfax on Monday. The Tatar leader spoke of the country's need to be represented in both houses of the Federal Assembly following a power sharing agreement. "We must get involved in Russian affairs, defend the republic's interests and pursue an overall Russian policy to seek the emergence of Russia as a federal state", he said. (Tatarstan holds elections to the Federal Assembly on March 13 -- IF). He said Tatarstan had never insisted on full independence calling for close bonds with Russia instead. Shaymiyev says Tatarstan has managed to cushion off the effects of shock treatment of the economy and somewhat halt production slump due to the government's economic policy. He says that despite difficulties, Russia has the chance of turning into an advanced state if it goes ahead with reforms and makes less political and economic mistakes. For his part, Minister for Nationalities and Regional Policy Sergey Shakhray who drafted the paper described it as "a substantial breakthrough in the promotion of federal relations". In an interview with Interfax, he said that "for Russia, a federal structure is the only way of retaining the country's integrity and does not amount to a weakening of the state". He said that neither the federal constitution nor Russian laws had been effective in Tatarstan for the past three years adding this could have led to a political crisis if allowed to persist. Shakhray says that a new way of preparing documents has helped towards a success in bilateral talks. "We moved from concrete agreements to drafting an outline treaty. This helped not only flesh out the document but also mechanisms of enforcing it", he said. Shakhray thinks the new method will also enable to strike a similar deal with the Chechen republic though it will be different from that signed with Kazan. The political effect of the treaty is Tatarstan's agreement to take part in elections to the Federal Assembly "which amounts to the republic's recognition of the Russian Federation's sovereignty, laws and constitution", he said. Shakhray does not rule that other parts of the country may want to strike similar deals with the center. In his words, such a process is in line with the federal constitution which says such treaties can help towards economic and regional self-adjustment of the federation. Shakhray believes the Federal Assembly must adopt a law on power sharing as a way of regulating the process. In his view, Tatarstan may also join parts of the federal treaty which coincide with the power sharing agreement signed on Tuesday.
