There are still differences about this issue. UNITA wants the government negotiators to make an undertaking that once a peace accord is signed in Lusaka, the Electoral Law can be reviewed. UNITA does not want a gentleman's agreement, but one in black and white. The government negotiating team is facing a difficult situation because in order to make such an undertaking it has to have the green light from the National Assembly. This morning, the government and UNITA delegations met without the mediator. In the afternoon, the negotiating teams called Alioune Blondin Beye, UN special representative in Angola to join them. Sources close to the mediator said this afternoon that Beye today presented the government and UNITA delegations with a document that contains points advantageous to the two sides. The document deals with the Electoral Law.
