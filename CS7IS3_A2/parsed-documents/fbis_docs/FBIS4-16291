The letter is addressed to the Assembly's Secretary-General Catherine Lalumiere. The letter tells about events in Latvia, connected with Russian President Boris Yeltsin's April 5 order to set up military bases in CIS states and Latvia. The letter says that Latvian people consider the order to contradict the Latvian-Russian initialed agreements on Russian army withdrawal and the Skrunda radar station's status. Latvian people think that Yeltsin's order jeopardizes Latvia's independence, says the letter. Though Russian Ambassador Aleksandr Rannikh apologized for the incident and said that Latvia was mentioned in the list by mistake, Latvia still expects Russia to make an official retraction of the order. While Latvia has not received the official retraction of Yeltsin's order, the planned April 20 talks between Latvian and Russian presidents and the signing of the initialed agreements are postponed.
