FR940720-2-00098 FR940720-2-00068 However, primary containment is not required to be Operable with the reactor in the Cold Condition. As a result, the containment cooling system is not needed to maintain the primary containment Operable with the reactor in the Cold Condition. This change does not affect any safety limits, operating limits, or design assumptions. This [change] provides the benefit of allowing maintenance to be performed on the containment cooling systems during a unit outage to ensure their reliability during power operation. Therefore, this change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The current TS requirement that both core spray systems and the LPCI system be Operable during a refueling outage is being relaxed by the second change to require one core spray subsystem and one LPCI subsystem or two core spray subsystems to be Operable. This [change] does not adversely affect any accident or transient analyses because the change ensures adequate vessel inventory makeup is available in the event of an inadvertent vessel draindown. The long term cooling analysis following a design bases LOCA [loss of coolant accident] demonstrates only one low pressure ECCS [emergency core cooling system] injection/spray subsystem is required, post LOCA, to maintain the peak cladding temperature below the allowable limit. This change will not affect any safety limits, operating limits, or design assumptions. This change provides the benefit of allowing maintenance to be performed on the low pressure ECCS subsystems not required to be operable to ensure their reliability during plant operation. Therefore, this change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The final less restrictive change will allow low pressure injection/spray subsystems to be inoperable during a refueling outage if the spent fuel storage gates are removed and the water level is at the required height over the top of the reactor pressure vessel flange. This is acceptable because the water level requirement provides sufficient coolant inventory to allow operator action to terminate any inventory loss prior to fuel uncovery in the event of an inadvertent draindown. This change will not affect any safety limits, operating limits, or design assumptions. This change provides the benefit of allowing maintenance to be performed on the low pressure ECCS subsystems to ensure their continued reliability during plant operation. Therefore, this change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Description of amendment request: The licensee proposed the following changes to its Technical Specifications (TS): (1) Revise TS 4.3.C.1 to require that each control rod be scram time tested after each refueling outage or after a reactor shutdown that is greater than 120 days with reactor steam dome pressure greater than or equal to 800 psig prior to exceeding 40% of rated power. Scram time testing is not required for control rods inserted per TS 3.3.B.1. (2) Replace TS 4.3.C.2 with the requirement to perform scram time testing with the reactor steam dome pressure greater than or equal to 800 psig prior to exceeding 40% of rated power for only those control rods associated with the core cells affected by any fuel movement within the reactor pressure vessel. (3) Add TS 4.3.C.3 to perform scram time testing for a representative sample of control rods at least once per 120 days of power operation with the reactor steam dome pressure greater than or equal to 800 psig. (4) Add TS 4.3.C.4 to perform scram time testing at any reactor steam dome pressure for individual control rods prior to declaring them operable after work on the control rod or control rod drive system is performed that could affect scram insertion time. (5) Revise TS Bases 3.3.C and 4.3.C to describe: the rational for performing scram time testing with reactor pressure greater than or equal to 800 psig; the rationale for requiring control rods to be scram time tested once per 120 days; what constitutes a representative sample of control rods; examples of work that could affect scram times; and the rational and methods for performing scram time testing following work that could affect the scram insertion times. (6) Add TS 4.3.C.5 to perform scram time testing with the reactor steam dome pressure greater than or equal to 800 psig prior to exceeding 40% of rated power after work on the control rod or control rod drive system that could affect scram insertion time. (7) Revise TS 4.5.K.2 from performing scram time testing of 19 or more control rods on a rotation basis to performing scram time testing of a representative sample of control rods. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: (1) The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes will not involve any physical changes to plant systems, structures, or components (SSC). These proposed changes will not alter operation of process variables or SSC as described in the safety analysis. The proposed changes establish or maintain adequate assurance that components are operable when necessary for the prevention or mitigation of accidents or transients and that plant variables are maintained within limits necessary to satisfy the assumptions for initial conditions in the safety analysis. In particular, proposed change 1 is acceptable based on industry experience with control rod scram time testing coupled with the additional requirement in proposed change 4 that scram time testing of any control rod on which work was performed must be satisfactorily completed before that control rod can be declared operable. The proposed changes will not allow continuous plant operation with plant conditions such that a single failure will result in a loss of any safety function. Therefore, the changes will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. (2) The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes do not alter the plant configuration (no new or different type of equipment will be installed or removed) and will not alter the method used by any system to perform its design function. The proposed changes do not allow plant operation in any mode that is not already evaluated. Therefore, these changes will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. (3) The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Following a refueling outage, control rod scram time testing for all control rods is currently required to be performed during operational hydrostatic testing or during startup prior to synchronizing the main turbine generator. Any control rods not tested during operational hydrostatic testing must be tested at greater than 30% power but less than 40% power. Proposed change 1 will require that scram time testing for all control rods be completed prior to exceeding 40% Reactor Power. This change is acceptable based on industry experience with control rod scram time testing coupled with the additional requirement in proposed change 4 that scram time testing of any control rod on which work was performed must be satisfactorily completed before that control rod can be declared operable. Proposed changes 2, 3, 4 and 6 add some new requirements and make some existing requirements more restrictive. The margin of safety is not reduced by more restrictive changes. If anything, the margin of safety may increase. Proposed change 5 revises the BASES to provide consistency with the previously discussed SR [surveillance requirements] changes. Proposed change 7 is administrative in nature and does not involve any technical changes. Proposed changes 5 and 7 will not reduce a margin of safety because they have no impact on any safety analysis assumptions. Therefore, these changes will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
