On 20 April, Perry held a conference with traitor Kim Yong-sam and discussed measures to jointly deal with the North's so-called nuclear issue and the issue of building up the U.S.-South Korean combined forces. The nation-selling traitor Kim Yong-sam, raving that a close joint cooperation system and arms buildup posture are essential to the solution of the North's nuclear problem, begged his U.S. master to sell more weapons to South Korea. Perry and the Kim Yong-sam ring demanded again our acceding to the additional inspection [chuga sachal] by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the unjustness of which has already been clearly proven, and decided to push ahead with the UN Security Council's sanctions on the North, according to a report. In the conference, the two of them agreed that the South Korean puppets will introduce a mobile ultra-modern radar equipment from the United States soon and that the United States will predeploy heavy weaponry for brigade-scale rapid deployment forces to South Korea. On the same day, Perry held a secretive conference with the puppet defense minister as well. The two of them, raving about the North's fictitious nuclear issue, agreed to maintain a joint cooperation system, to build up arms, and to conduct the criminal Team Spirit war exercise, according to a report. In the conference, Perry explained a U.S. plan to build up the combat capability of the combined forces, including the additional deployment of heavy weaponry to South Korea, and the modernization plan of the U.S. Forces in South Korea. In the talks between Perry and the puppet foreign minister held on the same day, the two of them discussed joint measures for the phase of tension [kinjang kungmyon] and agreed to grope for various measures, including economic sanctions against us, according to a report. On 20 April, while the very dangerous war fever for northward invasion was actively inspired, Perry did not hesitate to make a violent remark threatening someone that the military situation on the Korean peninsula should not be miscalculated. In the meantime, a deputy spokesman for the U.S. Defense Department disclosed that the Patriot missiles deployed in South Korea will soon be positioned for actual combat deployment. The war conference between the U.S. secretary of defense and the Kim Yong-sam ring reveals how recklessly the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets are going wild to accelerate at the final practical stage the preparations for a nuclear war of northward invasion to crush [apsal] us under the pretext of the fictitious North Korean nuclear issue. Because of the frenzied war provocation commotions of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets, the situation on the Korean peninsula is dashing minute by minute to a dangerous brink of war. The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets should be aware of what dire consequences their war frenzy will bring them, refrain from rash acts, and act with discretion.
