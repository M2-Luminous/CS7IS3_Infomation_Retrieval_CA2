FR940418-1-00025 FR940418-1-00005 Since the Kennecott emissions, as established through Multi-point Rollback (MPR), were used in the 1981 SO 2 SIP, EPA's primary concern, with the use of any emission rate in the demonstration of GEP, is ensuring protection of the NAAQS (i.e., to protect health and welfare). The basic concept behind GEP is to prevent sources from using illegal dispersion techniques to avoid emissions controls. Kennecott provided extensive data on its GEP analyses. The reader is referred to 53 FR 48942 for information on the GEP demonstration and BART analysis. To summarize, the GEP demonstration showed that the existing stack height of 1215-foot (370.4m) met the 40% criterion due to terrain effects and an exceedance of the NAAQS at MPR emission rates. (Discussion of the MPR emission rates for Kennecott can be found in 49 FR 10948, March 12, 1983, proposed rulemaking). MPR is a technique designed for sources with variable emission rates (e.g., smelters). MPR allows for a frequency distribution of emission rates which will permit extremely high emissions on rare occasions. The MPR methodology is constructed around the recognition that any control strategy will have a predictable probability of allowing a violation of the NAAQS. The MPR is based upon allowing a 26% probability of recording a violation (Additional information on MPR is found in Appendix A). The GEP demonstration satisfies the excessive concentration criteria in EPA's regulation if MPR reflects the proper emission rates. After review, EPA concluded that Kennecott's analyses were acceptable, since Kennecott performed a fluid modeling study consistent with existing guidance and the study was approved by EPA. The purpose of establishing a BART emission rate in the 1985 stack height regulations was to prevent source owners from using unreasonably high emission rates to justify credit for excessive stack heights. The regulation requires that sources faced with excessive concentrations due to downwash should be required to attempt to reduce those concentrations by reducing those emissions to the degree feasible before seeking credit above the GEP formula. The benchmark for this requirement is the NSPS, or an alternative level of control established through the application of BART if NSPS is found to be infeasible. Kennecott provided responses to all the BART factors mentioned above. The cost-effectiveness ratio and technical infeasibility issues, however, were determined critical to this review because of their relationship to the emission limitations used in the GEP analyses. Application of the level of control required by NSPS would reduce the emissions of SO 2 at Kennecott during the stable process phase, but would not affect emission rates under startup, shutdown, malfunction, and upset conditions. This is because the NSPS emission rate is for normal operations and excludes such process conditions. MPR includes startup, shutdown, malfunction, and upset conditions. From the Kennecott assessment, considering only long-term averages, the cost portion is consistent with the tons of SO 2 reduction expected from similar NSPS applications. In the Kennecott BART analysis, the controlling emissions for the determination of GEP appear to be those under upset, start-up, shutdown, and malfunction. Therefore, while there would be no difference in the emission rates under these conditions as a result of meeting NSPS, there would be a substantial additional cost to control these emissions. In summary, the emissions at the smelter from startups, shutdowns, upsets, and malfunctions are included in the MPR emission limits and could be considered in the NAAQS attainment and GEP analyses. Application of NSPS technology will not affect these emission rates and will, therefore, result in no change in demonstrating GEP. It may be possible to reduce annual emissions by requiring additional controls on the smelter, but such reduction would have no relevance to the limiting case for determination of GEP. Given the above discussion, EPA proposed to approve (53 FR 48942, December 5, 1988) the Kennecott analysis in the Utah GEP SIP submitted on May 2, 1986, with subsequent submittals on October 6, 1986, December 3, 1986, November 13, 1987, and May 17, 1988. However, EPA's review was conducted under a specific assumption: that the emission rate(s) in the SO 2 SIP were sufficient to demonstrate attainment. That assumption followed another critical assumption: that Kennecott owned or controlled the lands in the upper elevation for which no monitoring data exist to demonstrate attainment of the NAAQS.
