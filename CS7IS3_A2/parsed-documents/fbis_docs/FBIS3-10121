Among those dismissed was General Jose Luis Quilo Ayuso, chief of the General Staff of National Defense, a key position within the Armed Forces. [Blanck] You have said that recent changes within the security cabinet will strengthen the country's institutionality and foster unity within the Armed Forces. Why? [De Leon] I know where you are coming from. The rumors that have circulated over the past few days concerning a coup d'etat are just that; rumors. No attempt has ever been made to disrupt constitutional order as in May 1988; there have only been reports concerning movements against the government. All of this has taken place outside the Army and although an attempt was made to approach the military, it did not succeed. [Blanck] Over the past few days more has been said concerning the involvement of several civilians in a conspiracy against you rather than of a coup attempt. A vice presidential adviser, a Parlacen [Central American Parliament] deputy and a former president have been mentioned. Will you prosecute them? [De Leon] If we had names and dates we would have taken them to court already because we would be dealing with actions classified as crimes under the Penal Code. However, we are dealing with rumors that may be well founded. It is said that certain individuals who have a coupist calling have participated in these activities and there is evidence that they have spoken with one another. What we do not have is evidence against them. In fact, the resignation of one of the persons you mentioned, Fernando Andrade Diaz-Duran, was accepted on that same Friday. The message we are sending is very clear. [Blanck] Doesn't the dismissal of Gen. Jose Luis Quilo Ayuso close the chapter initiated with the departure of General Jose Domingo Garcia Samayoa in mid-1993? [De Leon] Top Army commanders were dismissed after 25 May because they led the Armed Forces during a regime that ended with the disruption of constitutional order. In the case of Gen. Quilo Ayuso, he was removed because a new policy had to be coordinated. It was a decision of state for purposes of state. [Blanck] However, this coordination comes eight months after you took office. Isn't that a long time? [De Leon] The first mandate I received from the Guatemalan people was to consolidate the country institutionally. The changes that were made during the first phase of this mandate are the result of this. Furthermore, during the course of these months there was also a battle to purge state institutions, which concluded with the referendum. Having done this I thought it necessary to move one man to achieve consolidation. Yes, eight months have passed, but the president in his capacity as commander of the Army, used them to become acquainted with the situation. [Blanck] What do you expect from Gen. Marco Antonio Gonzalez Taracena, the new chief of staff for Defense? [De Leon] Excellent coordination with the defense minister. I expect Gen. Taracena to transmit the High Command's way of thinking to the officers with his leadership. Also, I have told him and the minister that from now on I will work more closely with the High Command and involve myself with reality. This does not mean that I will encroach on them, but rather that I will engage more in problems dealing with the Armed Forces. I met with them on Saturday and asked them for a list of the Army's problems. [Blanck] Did Gen. Quilo Ayuso maintain the coordination you speak about with the defense minister? [De Leon] There have been rumors of a disagreement between the defense minister and Gen. Ayuso, but this disagreement really did not exist. Nevertheless, an apparent division is not good for the Army. An institution must have leaders who are sure of themselves. There just cannot be any doubts that all of the leaders are following the same course of action. [Blanck] A MIAMI HERALD article says you are restricted by a powerful Army. Is this true? [De Leon] Quite the contrary. The changes announced on Friday prove the Army's support for the president. Certainly, military power is this government's fundamental pillar. This does not mean the president's militarization, however, but absolute support for him and this transition government. I would say that the lion roared again on Friday. [Blanck] On Tuesday, 8 February, you reportedly told a group of friends you would never resign your position as president. Is it true? [De Leon] It has never crossed my mind. Much less now, after the referendum, not because it represents a victory -- I do not want to blind myself on this -- but because this page is a closed chapter in history. [Blanck] The climate of confrontation between Congress and the Executive Branch persists, however. What will happen if the deputies fail to make good their pledges with the Executive Branch? [De Leon] The approved reforms are irreversible. In view of this reality, the political parties are aware of the risk involved if they fail to behave properly. This means they must carry out the Electoral and Political Parties Law and debate the three basic points: participation of civic committees, reduction of the number of deputies, and the supervision of the use of funds. We are not sure whether or not we will be able to do the latter. [Blanck] Has a channel of communication been opened between the two state branches after the rapprochement between you and Congress President Vinicio Villar in Salama? [De Leon] No, that was a chance encounter. I agree with the Congress president on the need for unity. I am after a Great National Agreement, GAN, and will talk with the political sector from an institutional point of view. [Blanck] What about the labor union sector, which has refused to participate in GAN from the outset? [De Leon] GAN began to be criticized even before its nature became known. What the various sectors say here is different from what they say out of the country, however. GAN will work because the various sectors have no but to reinforce the government and participate. Either we reach the agreement that history demands or else everything will go wrong. [Blanck] One of the government actions that has disturbed the people and the trade unions more is the issue of privatization. How are you going to settle that? [De Leon] More than privatization, I have spoken of breaking up monopolies, something I am determined to do because it is advisable for the government. I am aware that we must convince the unions that breaking up monopolies does not go against them. What the government wants in this transition period is to prepare the people, particularly the workers, for a new step. Wonderful things are coming up, such as NAFTA which will be of benefit to the country. NAFTA is a fact; we have not made it up. Guatemala is the only country neighboring the most powerful economic bloc in the world. That has its benefits and we must take advantage of them. We must make the people understand the benefits. We must try it, although there are some groups who do not like this at all. [Blanck] Nonetheless, this is happening in all groups. You say you have attained a commitment inasmuch as the private sector will comply with its fiscal obligations. However, who guarantees this will be the case? [De Leon] We have two great challenges. One is obtaining the revenue for meeting the goals outlined in the budget, particularly after the Constitutionality Court ruling which declared unconstitutional withholding 5 percent. That means we might not be able to collect 600 million quetzales. The finance minister has the serious and grave responsibility of achieving that, instead of 8 centavos, we collect 10 centavos for each quetzal. One of the ways to do that is to resort to private enterprise, with whom we are holding conversations. [Blanck] And how about the other challenge. [De Leon] To improve the financial situation of the state, which is critical. We will continue with the austerity program. We are also going to seek the help of friendly governments, availing ourselves of the fact the government enjoys credibility at present. Lastly, we are going to sell everything that is not operating well. [Blanck] Does that request for help from abroad entail more debts? [De Leon] No, I am referring to the renegotiation of the debt. To mention a specific case, we are about to solve the problem of CELGUSA [expansion unknown], as Spain has agreed to pardon part of the debt, at least 50 percent, without the government having had to pay a centavo for that renegotiation. [Blanck] One last question. Your apparent indecision has deteriorated your image. How do you plan to counter this? [De Leon] As president, I have had to make decisions, such as the one I made last Friday. Some say I am undecided because I did not pull the deputies by the hair or because I did not close Congress. I cannot do that. My problem is that my prestige as human rights ombudsman created great expectations with regard to my actions. I only hope that the decisions I make when I implement my policies will help me to recover my image.
