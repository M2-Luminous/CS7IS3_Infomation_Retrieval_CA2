Ago Tiiman, secretary of the Estonian delegation for the talks, in his comments to BNS today said the new round was to deal with the four traditional series of topics -- humanitarian, economic, military and border issues -- and that no substantial changes were expected when compared to the previous rounds. Also to be discussed is the issue of taking out nuclear fuel from two reactors located at a Russian naval base in the Estonian small town of Paldiski. It is possible that a technical protocol on the issue will be signed, after which work on taking out the fuel from the two reactors can begin, Tiiman added. The main obstacle on the way to progress in the talks is the issue of retired Russian army officers, who Russia wants must be granted guarantees that they will get permanent residence permits in Estonia. Estonia's chief negotiator for the talks, Vaino Reinart, told BNS the main controversy between the two sides in the talks was that Russia wants to fix the categories of persons who will start applying for residence permits in Estonia, whereas Estonia insists that the circle of these persons is not to be established in the agreement. Estonia says the document should just establish the rules under which the retired officers will receive their pensions and pay for medical services in Estonia. [passage omitted]
