Escovar agreed that the country must make an effort to achieve national unity but rejected the possibility of de facto coups as hinted by the Copei leader. In Escovar's opinion, the country wants peace and trusts the current president. [Begin Escovar recording] There is absolute normalcy throughout the country. There is no destabilization risk at this time. The people want peace and tranquility, and the government is willing to offer it. The initiative to reach a consensus and make commitments is a very important one. I do not want to comment on the Copei proposal yet because we need to study it. I do want to say that any conciliation proposal is welcome, because the country is hungry for national unity. The country wants an atmosphere of national conciliation and understanding. [end recording] Escovar also reacted to legislators' questions regarding his speech on state security policies. He pointed out that they criticized its form and not its substance. The minister also said he will give a more detailed explanation of this issue in the future. Meanwhile, Federal District Governor Asdrubal Aguiar discussed the public security problem at Miraflores Palace. He said that the prompt promulgation of a social security and citizen safety law time is indispensable to allow the Executive Branch to act against crime in the cities. Aguiar admitted that although he was a critic of the Vagrancy Law, it is the sole instrument that allows him to take actions that go beyond mere police operations. The governor added that in his meetings with the mayors [prefectos] of Caracas and Vargas, he recommended that this law be enforced without violating the right to defense and without committing the injustices that have been regularly committed in the enforcement of this law. As for the death toll in the metropolitan area over the weekend, Aguiar said that even though the figure has dropped, it is still alarming.
