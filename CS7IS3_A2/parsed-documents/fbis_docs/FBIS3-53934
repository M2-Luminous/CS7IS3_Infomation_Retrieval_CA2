Limited small-arms fire was exchanged along the frontline and pro-Rabbani gunners fired the occasional rocket at rival forces. The lull followed the announcement in Pakistan overnight by the anti-Rabbani front that it had decided to observe a ceasefire unilterally in response to a proposal from a mediation commission of mojahedin commanders. The front linked its decision to what it called "guarantees" from the Kabul commanders that its demands, including Rabbani's resignation and installation of an interim government, would be implemented. The announcement was issued from the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar by Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan], on behalf of the so-called Supreme Coordination Council of the Islamic Revolution of Afghanistan (SCCIRA). The anti-Rabbani alliance threatened to resume fighting to deal a "final blow" if the president did not resign. Ex-communist general Abdol Rashid Dostam's Junbish movement is part of SCCIRA along with the Hezb-e Eslami, the National Islamic Front of Afghanistan (NIFA) of former Afghan president Sebghatollah Mojaddedi and some other groups. Defence Ministry officials acknowledged that a 45-man delegation of mojahedin commanders from the Kabul area had put forward an independent peace proposal. Presidential spokesman Aziz Morad said the state concurs with the delegation's demands for a ceasefire and the removal of the armed groups from the capital but not the resignation of Rabbani. Both Morad and Defence Ministry officials loyal to the president's military strongman Ahmad Shah Mas'ud said while rapproachement was possible with Hekmatyar, none was possible with Dostam. Morad said the state was prepared to negotiate a ceasefire with Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami faction, but only on the condition that Hezb cut its ties with Dostam. Dostam's forces launched an attack against Rabbani 20 days ago but failed to grab key posts in the capital and were pushed back to their Bala Hissar and Maranjan Hill strongholds, where they have been joined by Hezb-e Eslami. The nearly three weeks of fierce rocket and artillery duels left hundreds dead and thousands injured, besides triggering a flood of refugees to safer areas. "The state is ready to accept a ceasefire with Hezb, but no way with the militia and ex-communists," the presidential spokesman said. "The militia must surrender their heavy weapons to the state, and their lives will be gauranteed, otherwise they will be smashed in their posts," Morad said. The declaration of a "Jihad" or holy war against the militia is clear evidence that Rabbani is holding firm and will not bow to rival demands that he must resign. "The people of Afghanistan are the only ones to decide on Rabbani's leadership as they elected him," Morad said, noting that as Rabbani, elected for two years in December 1992, he still had one year left to run. In the downtown old bazar area of Kabul, which sits at the foot of Bala Hissar fortress, hundreds of residents took advantage of the de facto ceasefire and the sunny weather to flee with their possessions, transported mostly in carts hired especially for the job. There was some looting of private houses and shops which had been badly damaged in the heavy bombardment between the rival factions.
