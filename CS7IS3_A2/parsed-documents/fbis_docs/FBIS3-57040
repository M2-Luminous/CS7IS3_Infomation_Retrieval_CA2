The enemy, who undertook an onslaught in the directions of Ter-Ter and Fizuli- Beylagan has been eager to set up control over railways of Goradiz in order to prevent Azerbaijan to provide food stuffs and fuel to the blockaded Nakhichevan. According to the information available, in several sectors of the front the Azeri armed forces could repulse the enemy from the earlier occupied territory and take more advantageous positions. The Defence Ministry of Azerbaijan considers that the recent failures of Armenians forced them to spread rumours about firing, which has ostensibly taken place between the units of the Azeri army.
