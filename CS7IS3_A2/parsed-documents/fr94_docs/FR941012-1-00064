FR941012-1-00064 FR941012-1-00012 To date, 46 chemicals have been delisted from the EHS list in previous rulemakings because they did not meet the toxicity criteria for the list and were originally listed under section 302 in error. 1. Regulatory Background The list of extremely hazardous substances and their threshold planning quantities is codified in EPA regulations at volume 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 355, appendices A and B (40 CFR, Part 355, Apps. A & B). EPA's explanation for the methodologies used to determine whether to list a substance as an extremely hazardous substance and for deriving the threshold planning quantities is found in preambles to the Federal Register notices which promulgated these rules. The relevant notices were published in the Federal Register on November 17, 1986 (51 FR 41570&hyph;41592), and April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13378&hyph;13410). In the November 17, 1986 notice EPA, as required by EPCRA section 302, promulgated an interim final rule which, among other things, included a list of extremely hazardous substances and established their threshold planning quantities. While the interim final rule established enforceable requirements, the Agency simultaneously solicited public comments, as explained in a Federal Register notice issued on the same day (51 FR 41953&hyph;54). EPA received public comment on the interim final rule and issued a final rule on April 22, 1987, which responded in its preamble to the public comments. The April 1987 final rule made a number of revisions to the interim final rule. Among other things, the April 1987 rule republished the extremely hazardous substance list, with the addition of four new chemicals, and revised the methodology for determining some threshold planning quantities (52 FR 13381). Details of the methodology used to determine whether to list a substance as an extremely hazardous substance and for deriving the threshold planning quantities are found in the November 1986 notice at 51 FR 41573&hyph;41579 and 41580 (Attachment 1), in the April 1987 notice at 52 FR 13387&hyph;13392, and in technical support documents in the rulemaking records. 2. Summary of petitions In this notice EPA is responding to seven petitions requesting action on substances listed as extremely hazardous substances. EPA received petitions from the Elemental Phosphorus Ad Hoc Solid Waste Group to delist phosphorus pentoxide (CAS # 1314&hyph;56&hyph;3); from SmithKline Beecham to delist diethylcarbamazine citrate (CAS # 1642&hyph;54&hyph;2); from Sumitomo Chemical America, Inc., to delist fenitrothion (CAS # 122&hyph;14&hyph;5); from ICI America's, Inc. to delist or change the threshold planning quantity for paraquat (CAS # 1910&hyph;42&hyph;5); from Huls America, Inc., to delist isophorone diisocyanate (CAS # 4098&hyph;71&hyph;9); and from the Selenium Tellurium Development Association (STDA) to delist tellurium (CAS # 13494&hyph;80&hyph;9). EPA also received a petition from Miles, Inc. requesting that the threshold planning quantities for azinphos-methyl (CAS # 86&hyph;50&hyph;0) and fenamiphos (CAS # 22224&hyph;92&hyph;6) be increased from the current 100 pounds to 10,000 pounds. Today's notice proposes a rule to amend 40 CFR, part 355 (Appendices A and B), to delist phosphorus pentoxide, diethylcarbamazine citrate, fenitrothion and tellurium from the list of extremely hazardous substances and to revise the threshold planning quantity for isophorone diisocyanate from 100 pounds to 1,000 pounds. EPA is denying the requests to delist paraquat and isophorone diisocyanate and the request to change the threshold planning quantities for azinphos-methyl and fenamiphos. These decisions constitute final agency action. II. Proposed Modifications EPA is proposing to remove the four chemicals noted above from the extremely hazardous substance list because review of the available toxicity data shows they do not meet the listing criteria. EPA believes these four chemicals were incorrectly listed. EPA is proposing to revise the threshold planning quantity for isophorone diisocyanate from 100 to 1,000 pounds, based upon the Agency's own review of the physical and chemical properties of the chemical, even though revision of the threshold planning quantity was not requested in the petition. Phosphorus pentoxide was listed on the basis of an abstract of a study of smoke from burning red phosphorus that gave LC 50 values for guinea pigs of 0.061 mg/liter/1 hour and for mice of 0.271 mg/liter/1 hour (Ballantyne (1981)). An LC 50 is the air concentration dose at which half the animals studied die. As explained in the November 17, 1986 (51 FR 41574), Federal Register notice, EPA listed a substance as an extremely hazardous substance if inhalation studies showed an LC 50 value in tests of the most sensitive mammalian species of less than 0.5 mg/l over a period of exposure of eight hours or less.
