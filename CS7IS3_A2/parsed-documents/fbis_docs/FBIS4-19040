Can you refute this? [Ngarukiyintwali] Now, listen, in this tragic situation, particularly with regard to this issue, let us remain calm. Let us wait for the results of the investigation which already has begun. This investigation, which already has begun, must be an objective exercise which will determine who was responsible. [Correspondent] You were summoned by the Belgian foreign minister yesterday. What did you tell him in particular about how this anti-Belgian campaign, which currently is ravaging Rwanda, should be stopped? [Ngarukiyintwali] I admit that I was summoned to the Belgian Foreign Ministry, where I met with that ministry's cabinet director. He has informed me about the considerations and worries of his government, and it is my role as ambassador to transmit these to my government for its review and consideration. But, in principle, I can tell you that the Rwandan Government has asked me to do everything possible to avoid irritating Belgian-Rwandan relations. [Correspondent] You distributed a note here from the [Rwandan] minister of foreign affairs and cooperation that accuses the [Belgian] blue helmets, who were entrusted with guaranteeing the airport's safety, and which says that the president's plane could have been downed by criminals because of the Belgians' failure. Do you believe that the blue helmets were responsible? [Ngarukiyintwali] You say that I think...[changes to] thought I only gave you a document for your information which our Foreign Ministry submitted to the UNAMIR [UN Mission in Rwanda].... [Correspondent, interrupting] You represent this government. [Ngarukiyintwali] I represent this government. So, this document was submitted to UNAMIR, and you will have to wait for the UNAMIR's answer.
