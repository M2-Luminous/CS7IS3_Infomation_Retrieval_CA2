FR941031-1-00003 FR941031-1-00001 Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866. The primary impact of this proposal will be on U.S. importers of horses from Spain, none of whom can be considered a small entity. These importers will no longer be required to quarantine horses from Spain for 60 days at the New York Animal Import Center in Newburgh, NY. The proposed rule would allow horses from Spain to be shipped to and quarantined at ports designated in ยง92.303, and would reduce the quarantine and testing period to an average of three days to meet quarantine requirements specified in ยง92.308. The number of horses imported from Spain each year is extremely small. In 1993, the United States imported 20,715 horses, mules, and burros, of which only nine came from Spain. Removing the requirement for a 60-day quarantine at the New York Animal Import Center in Newburgh, NY, for horses from Spain will make the importation of these horses less expensive and logistically easier. We anticipate that the number of horses imported from Spain may slightly increase. However, with the very small number of horses imported from Spain, we anticipate the overall economic impact on businesses and individuals would be minimal. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12778 This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If this proposed rule is adopted: (1) All State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule will be preempted; (2) no retroactive effect will be given to this rule; and (3) administrative proceedings will not be required before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule. Paperwork Reduction Act This proposed rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). List of Subjects in 9 CFR Part 92 Animal diseases, Imports, Livestock, Poultry and poultry products, Quarantine, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Accordingly, 9 CFR part 92 would be amended as follows: PART 92_IMPORTATION OF CERTAIN ANIMALS AND POULTRY AND CERTAIN ANIMAL AND POULTRY PRODUCTS; INSPECTION AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN MEANS OF CONVEYANCE AND SHIPPING CONTAINERS THEREON 1. The authority citation for part 92 would continue to read as follows: Authority: 7 U.S.C. 1622; 19 U.S.C. 1306; 21 U.S.C. 102&hyph;105, 111, 114a, 134a, 134b, 134c, 134d, 134f, 135, 136, and 136a; 31 U.S.C. 9701; 7 CFR 2.17, 2.51, and 371.2(d). ยง92.308 [Amended] 2. In ยง92.308, paragraph (a)(2) would be amended by removing ``Spain,''. Done in Washington, DC, this 26th day of October 1994. Lonnie J. King, Acting Administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26905 Filed 10&hyph;28&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;34&hyph;P
