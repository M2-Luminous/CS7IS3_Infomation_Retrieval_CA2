The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the decision would create favorable conditions for the two governments to solve issues of common concern and was in the interests of the two peoples for achieving peace, stability and development in the region. The move follows a decision in February this year by U.S. President Bill Clinton to officially lift his country's 30-year-old trade embargo against Vietnam. On May 20 and 21, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord and Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai exchanged letters about the final decision on setting up the liaison offices. They agreed that the offices will perform their roles under the Vienna Convention regulations which specified consular relations, signed by the U.S. and Vietnamese governments in 1963.
