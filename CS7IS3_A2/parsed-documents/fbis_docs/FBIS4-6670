He thus indicated that the possibility remains that emergency legislation may become necessary. With regard to the increase in the consumption tax rate, this source criticized the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], saying: "The SDPJ is terming administrative reform the source of revenue to cover tax cuts. This is nonsense if you do not have any concrete proposals."
