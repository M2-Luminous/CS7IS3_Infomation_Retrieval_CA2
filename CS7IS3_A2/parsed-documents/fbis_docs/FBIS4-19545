He could have added, without being wrong, that is is also the greatest American-Russian failure since the breakup of the Soviet Union. Washington and Moscow, which in January urged the Europeans to allow them to handle the Bosnian crisis immediately after NATO's ultimatum to the Serbs to secure the lifting of the siege of Sarajevo, have in fact allowed themselves to be misled by vague Serbian promises which have been immediately repudiated on the ground. The fall of Gorazde, an area theoretically protected by the United Nations but in which there were only four UN observers at the start of the Serbian offensive, is the result of this bluff whose consequences will not go unnoticed outside Bosnia: Russia, which flattered itself on having returned to the forefront of the international stage thanks to its last-minute intervention in the lifting of the siege of Sarajevo, now seems like a rather unreliable partner. As for President Clinton's United States, it will have to add Gorazde to its failures in Somalia and Haiti unless there are later favorable developments. It is likely that the lesson will not go unnoticed in Baghdad and Pyongyang. The biggest mistake on the part of the Americans was probably to have underestimated their power to intimidate the Serbs by trying to destabilize them before recognizing them as unavoidable interlocutors. The first act in this play was the formation of the Croatian-Muslim federation of Bosnia, which implied a cease-fire between the two sides and hence the possibility for the Bosnian Serbs to face a Muslim offensive aimed at forcibly recapturing some of the territories under Serbian control. The second act in the scenario consisted of Washington not demanding that the Muslims give details of their territorial claims, which was bound to increase the fears of the Bosnian Serbs who were invited by the Americans, unrealistically, to join the Croatian-Muslim federation. It is in this situation of expectation that the Serbs -- those in Belgrade and those in Pale, according to the French and British intelligence services -- decided to test the Americans' resolution by launching an offensive against Gorazde at the end of March. No doubt to their great surprise, they then heard the American chief of staff and defense secretary explaining that Gorazde could not be saved by force. That was a huge mistake, reminiscent of the one made by President Truman when he forgot to mention Korea in the list of areas representing a vital interest for the United States. What came thereafter is well-known: A few air strikes frighten the Serbs no more than President Clinton's statements trying to erase the blunders of his aides. [Bosnian Serb Army commander] Gen. Mladic's troops are continuing their advance on Gorazde, while clearly showing the UN forces that they are merely potential hostages. It was known in Pale and in Belgrade that the United States is not credible because it refuses any presence on the ground and that UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force], just a few thousand strong, does not have the means, the will, or the international mandate necessary to halt the offensive. Moreover, last Friday Bill Clinton admitted that by saying he was hostile to an extension of the war and a modification of the "military balance" by international forces. Clinton, like Yasushi Akashi, [UN Secretary General] Butrus- Ghali's representative, was counting on the presumed moderating influence of the Russians to persuade the Serbs not to take an irrevocable step in Gorazde. Assurances of this came from Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev who was in Belgrade on Saturday and Sunday morning, and from Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian negotiator, who was in Pale at the same time. But, as early as Sunday, these assurances seemed groundless. Is this incompetence or bad faith? Despite the accusations made on Monday by Vitaliy Churkin against "Serbian extremists in Bosnia," we do not yet know for sure whether the two Russian diplomats were simply objective accomplices of the Serbs or whether they deliberately put up a smokescreen to conceal the Serbs' double-dealing. In either case, their credibility has been largely undermined. "We have returned to the situation which prevailed in Bosnia at Christmas, but it is worse because we no longer have the threat of air strikes up our sleeve," a French official commented on Monday evening. "No abandonment or escalation," [French Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe said for his part. That therefore leaves the diplomatic path, which is no longer bilateral but multilateral, grouping Americans, Russians, and Europeans in a first phase, and Croatians, Muslims, and Serbs in a second phase. But these are Serbs intoxicated by their victory and, in particular, by the destruction of a British plane.
