Ozolas made several statements which, in our opinion, deteriorate Lithuania's interstate relations, the development of friendly ties with neighboring countries, and instigate ethnic minorities residing in Lithuania. The assessment of separate foreign ambassadors [reference to Polish and Belarusian envoys] working in Lithuania is another attempt to complicate our relations with neighbors, the process of negotiations, and the signing of agreements on friendship and cooperation. The Presidium of the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP] Council and the LDDP Seimas [parliament] faction categorically disagree with the moves of Seimas Deputy R. Ozolas. We believe that such actions not only fail to protect the interests of the state and the nation, as they are often interpreted, but are even damaging to them. Nationalism and the scoring of historical accounts are outdated matters in today's Europe, impeding the construction of a common European home.
