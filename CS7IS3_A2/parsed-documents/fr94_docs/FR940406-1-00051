FR940406-1-00051 FR940406-1-00012 Therefore, it is proposed that 48 CFR part 15 be amended as set forth below: PART 15_CONTRACTING BY NEGOTIATION 1. The authority citation for 48 CFR part 15 continues to read as follows: Authority: 40 U.S.C. 486(c); 10 U.S.C. chapter 137; and 42 U.S.C. 2473(c). 2. The heading of section 15.810 is revised and the text is removed, and sections 15.810&hyph;1 thru 15.810&hyph;3 are added to read as follows: 15.810 Should-cost review. 15.810&hyph;1 General. (a) Should-cost reviews are a specialized form of cost analysis. Should-cost reviews differ from traditional evaluation methods. During traditional reviews, local contract audit and contract administration personnel primarily base their evaluation of forecasted costs on an analysis of historical costs and trends. In contrast, should-cost reviews do not assume that a contractor's historical costs reflect efficient and economical operation. Instead, these reviews evaluate the economy and efficiency of the contractor's existing work force, methods, materials, facilities, operating systems, and management. These reviews are accomplished by a multi-functional team of Government contracting, contract administration, pricing, audit, and engineering representatives. The objective of should-cost reviews is to promote both short and long-range improvements in the contractor's economy and efficiency in order to reduce the cost of performance of Government contracts. In addition, by providing rationale for any recommendations and quantifying their impact on cost, the Government will be better able to develop realistic objectives for negotiation. (b) There are two types of should-cost reviews_program should-cost review (see 15.810&hyph;2) and overhead should-cost review (see 15.810&hyph;3). An overhead should-cost review may be performed independently, or in conjunction with a program should-cost review. The scope of a should-cost review can range from a large-scale review examining the contractor's entire operation (including plant-wide overhead and selected major subcontractors) to a small-scale tailored review examining specific portions of a contractor's operation. 15.810&hyph;2 Program should-cost review. (a) Program should-cost review is used to evaluate significant elements of direct costs, such as material and labor, and associated indirect costs, usually incurred in the production of major systems. When a program should-cost review is conducted relative to a contractor proposal, a separate audit report on the proposal is required. (b) A program should-cost review should be considered, particularly in the case of a major system acquisition (see part 34), when_ (1) Some initial production has already taken place; (2) The contract will be awarded on a sole-source basis;
