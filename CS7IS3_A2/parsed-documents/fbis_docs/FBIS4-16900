Kravchuk said that it should be made stipulated as soon as possible that the Black Sea Fleet is a Russian fleet with Russian laws and that Russia takes responsibility for its actions, while Ukraine takes responsibility for the actions of its own fleet. Noting that at present certain statements made by participants at the April 15 talks in Moscow on the Black Sea Fleet were being interpreted in different ways, Kravchuk said that there was one official position -- to resolve the question of the Black Sea Fleet, in particular the question of its base, its division, and the payment to Ukraine for the part handed over to Russia. Kravchuk went on to say that Ukraine was sticking to the terms of the four document on the subject -- those prepared in Yalta, Zavidovo, Massandra and now Moscow. "I would like the fifth document to be the least [as received] -- then we will have a magnificent five," said Kravchuk. He said he supported the idea that Sevastopol should become a naval base for the Russian fleet and that it should be leased on terms recognized around the world. "I support this idea because I do not see another option. I cannot imagine that other, Ukrainian naval forces would lie side by side with Russian ones. The Ukrainian navy should have its own base." He said that Sevastopol should not become a Russian town, but rather the base of the Russian fleet. "The wording should be carefully defined," he said.
