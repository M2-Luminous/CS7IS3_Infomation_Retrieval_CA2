"Some international humanitarian organizations were in a rush to make the Prijedor events into a spectacle, with the clear intention of accusing the authorities of the Srpska republic of attempting to carry out a systematic eviction of the Muslim population," Lukic said. He added that although there have been some excesses, the civilian and military authorities of the Srpska republic have been doing everything to minimize their number. "It is regrettable that the international humanitarian organizations do not see the real state of affairs on the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is a fact that the human rights of Serbs living in Muslim and Croat territories are under much greater threat," Lukic said, citing as an example the position of the Serbs in Sarajevo, Konjic, Zenica, and Tuzla. He stated that the best confirmation of the situation regarding human rights and the rights of national minorities is the fact that many Muslims do not wish to leave the territory of the Srpska republic, because they feel completely safe and protected.
