Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said that in 1993 Brazilian exports to the Czech Republic totaled $7 million while its imports totaled $5 million. Klaus said these amounts were small following the separation of the Czech and Slovak Republics and the economic reform the Czech Republic has been undergoing. Under the agreements, the governments of Brazil and the Czech Republic commit themselves to increase trade and to diversify their export and import items. They also agreed to undertake a joint cooperation effort in the areas of machinery production and professional training. During his visit to Brazil, Klaus is also conveying to Brazilian officials the experience earned by the Czech Republic in the area of privatization. The Czech Republic has had the most expeditious privatization process in history. As late as 1989 nothing had been privatized in the Czech Republic, but today the private sector already accounts for two-thirds of the country's GDP.
