The reactor was shut down after detecting radioactive steam leaking from an air-tight compartment. Experts established that the steam leaked through some worn-out parts of a control valve. Plant officials said the leak was considerably smaller than permitted by reactor operation rules. The incident did not affect the radiation background inside and outside the plant, officials said. Ignalina's leadership said the first reactor will be shut down April 4 for maintenance repairs. The reactor might be turned off several days earlier or later, depending on the situation in the Lithuanian energy system.
