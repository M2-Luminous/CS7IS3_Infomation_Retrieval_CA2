"The process leading to the stability pact must encourage those countries which have been offered the chance to prepare to join the EU by concluding reciprocal good-neighborliness agreements," Claes stated in a speech given to the plenary conference on stability in Europe, which is being held in Paris over a two-day period. In so doing, the Belgian foreign minister was implicitly sweeping aside the reluctance on the part of some Central and Eastern European countries that could view such a pact as nothing more than an extra condition imposed on their entry to the Union. "The stability pact is intended to serve as an instrument of dialogue (...) between the countries concerned and the EU. Future accession in fact necessarily presupposes close, constant contact between all those involved," Willy Claes underlined. Furthermore, the Belgian foreign minister reiterated that the deepening of European construction should not be called into question by the EU enlargement. "If Europe has become a pole of stability, it is primarily because its members have concluded mutual political agreements," he said. Consequently, the EU is calling upon the future candidates for accession (the three Baltic states, the four [as received] Visegrad countries: the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria -- BELGA editor's note) to settle their potential differences peacefully. It is also prepared "to play an active role in helping them to bring their friendship and good-neighborliness agreements to a successful conclusion," Willy Claes continued. Meanwhile, French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur traced out the broad outlines of his plan, which "is clearly shaped by a vision of Europe that aims to reconcile the wish to join the EU, as harbored by many countries, with the need to maintain the unity of our continent and consequently develop very close relations with Russia," he said during his speech which opened the conference. Mr. Balladur also took pains to calm the fears of certain countries regarding borders. The negotiations that are supposed to lead to good-neighborliness agreements will be based on legal principles that are "clear and recognized by everyone," namely territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders," he affirmed. "Let us be very clear about this: We want to see stable European borders. So let us make sure that there are no ulterior motives regarding them," he added.
