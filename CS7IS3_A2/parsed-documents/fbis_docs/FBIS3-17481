The next step in the removal is the Estonian Government's decision to give permission for extra Russian military personnel to come to the former Russian naval base town of Paldiski for the dismantling of the two nuclear training reactors located there. Prime Minister Mart Laar said after a government meeting that the permit had been issued for "a small group of military." Mr. Laar said "no problems or obstacles" with Russia had emerged over the issue of the nuclear reactors' removal.
