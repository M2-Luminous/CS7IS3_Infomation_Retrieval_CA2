After emphasizing the fact that, owing to the self-willed and rigid stance adopted by the ruling coalition, the political dialogue is currently blocked, Constantinescu pointed out that there are only two ways to overcome this situation, namely either the establishment of a new parliamentary majority or the holding of early elections. Talking about the first alternative, he asserted that the CDR will solely participate in the government together with the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] if the latter political grouping gets rid of the extremist parties and adopts a concrete anticrisis program. Related to the issue of holding early elections, Constantinescu said that this represents a constitutional and democratic method to solve the crisis caused by the lack of confidence in the current state power. If that solution will be really selected, that will be a direct consequence of the policy totally lacking imagination that is being promoted by the ruling party and its allies. Constantinescu mentioned the fact that, tomorrow, the CDR Executive Council will meet in a conference to debate issues related to the current political, economic, and social situation in the country in view of the talks that are to be held on Tuesday [11 January] at Cotroceni Palace among President Ion Iliescu and CDR leaders.
