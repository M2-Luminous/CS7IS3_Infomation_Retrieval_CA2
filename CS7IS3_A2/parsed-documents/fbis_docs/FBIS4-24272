[Begin recording] [Unidentified official] In fact, three traditional leaders were abducted by FLEC-FAC recently. I do not know what the causes of the abduction are. I cannot say anything else because I am still investigating the issue. It is only known that they have been detained. Maybe it is because they are traditional leaders linked to the government. [Unidentified correspondent] According to reports you have, are they in a good health? [Official] Well, recently we received a message from the Belize District administration saying that they are being ill-treated and run the risk of being killed. Two days ago, however, I received a report from the Belize administrator saying that they are in good health and have a limited freedom, but they are still in the hands of FLEC. [end recording]
