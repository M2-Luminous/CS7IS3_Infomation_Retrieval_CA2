FBIS4-36567 "drnes112_k_94005" FBIS-NES-94-112 Daily Report 9 Jun 1994 IRAQ KDP Advocates UN Protectorate, Demilitarization KDP Advocates UN Protectorate, Demilitarization PM1006123794 London AL-HAYAH in Arabic 9 Jun 94 p 6 PM1006123794 London AL-HAYAH Arabic BFN [Text] London, AL-HAYAH -- The Kurdistan Democratic Party [KDP], led by Mas'ud Barzani, has stressed that the "initiative" taken by the Kurdish leader Barzani for the declaration of Iraqi Kurdistan as a "UN protectorate" is "of a temporary nature linked to the downfall of the Iraqi regime, and would not affect the issues of democracy for Iraq and federation for Kurdistan." A KDP spokesman in London has told AL-HAYAH that the initiative "is based on Chapter 12 of the UN Charter, defining UN protection and trusteeship." He emphasized that the Iraqi Kurdish region "requires a definition of status under international law on which dealings with the Kurdish administration would be based." Barzani had linked his proposal to the "failure" of the Kurdish administration experiment, especially the powersharing between his party and Jalal Talabani's party (Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK]). He particularly underscored the demilitarization of Iraqi Kurdistan. The spokesman pointed out that the proposal-initiative has "political, economic, and humanitarian dimensions and, at any rate, it is up for discussion locally (in the Kurdish areas), at Iraqi resistance level, and at the international level. There is an urgent need for a stable political situation in northern Iraq." He said that "one point in the initiative's favor is the regime's violation of international law and the fact that it has completely blockaded Kurdistan, thereby isolating it from the rest of Iraq." He drew attention to the importance of "securing a more stable economic situation in that the international community should take more serious measures to tackle the two blockades: the local and the international." He affirmed that "there should be a more stable political situation after demilitarization." It is worth noting that Barzani's proposal calling for the demilitarization of northern Iraq and for making it a UN protectorate came after a month of fighting between his party's forces and the forces of Talabani's party. The KDP spokesman confirmed that future meetings between the two leaders "would be devoted to the discussion of ways of ending the crisis and finding alternatives to this experiment." He emphasized that the KDP did not take part in the fighting which broke out the day before yesterday in the area of Qal'at Dizah near the Iranian border. He said the fighting was between Talabani's forces and forces of the Islamic Movement. PUK sources have denied yesterday's IRANIAN NEWS AGENCY report that the KDP and the Islamic Movement's forces seized control of Banjwin and Qal'at Dizah. The sources did not say how many casualties fell in the fighting of two days ago. The agency had quoted an Islamic Movement official as saying that the PUK suffered a large number of casualties. It also expected the leaders of the three parties to meet in Irbil yesterday to try to contain the fighting.
