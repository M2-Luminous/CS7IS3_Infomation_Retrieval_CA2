FR941019-2-00207 FR941019-2-00114 (1) Undergraduate, graduate, and health professional school tuition expenses; (2) Other reasonable educational expenses required by the school(s) attended, including fees, books, supplies, educational equipment and materials, and laboratory expenses; and (3) Reasonable living expenses, including the cost of room and board, transportation and commuting costs, and other living expenses as determined by the Secretary. Repayments will be authorized for direct payment to lenders, following receipt of (1) the supervisor's verification of completion of the prior period of obligated service and (2) lender verification of the crediting of prior loan repayments, including the resulting account balances and current account status. The NIH will repay loans in the following order unless significant savings would result from repaying loans in a different priority order: (1) Health Education Assistance Loans (HEAL); (2) other loans guaranteed by the Federal Government; and (3) other qualifying loans. The following loans are NOT repayable under the Clinical Research LRP: (1) Loans not obtained from a Government entity or commercial or other chartered lending institution, such as loans from friends and relatives, or other private individuals; (2) Loans for which contemporaneous documentation is not available; and (3) Loans, or those portions of loans, obtained for educational or living expenses which exceed a ``reasonable'' level as determined by a review of the standard school budget or additional contemporaneous documentation for the year in which the loan was made. In addition, for other programs which provide loans, scholarships, loan repayments, or similar awards in exchange for a future service obligation, the NIH will NOT repay any sums that may result from failure to serve as required or conversion of the obligation to a loan under these programs. This includes, but is not limited to the following: (1) Physicians Shortage Area Scholarship Program (Federal or State); (2) National Research Service Award Program; (3) Public Health Service and National Health Service Corps Scholarship Programs; (4) Armed Forces (Army, Navy, or Air Force) Health Professions Scholarship Programs; and (5) Indian Health Service Scholarship Program. Finally, payments will not be made under the Clinical Research LRP for loans which participants have already repaid, delinquent loans, loans in default, loans not current in their payment schedule, or loans for which promissory notes have been signed after the program eligibility date. During lapses in loan repayments, due either to administrative complications or a break in service, Clinical Research LRP participants are wholly responsible for making payments or other arrangements which maintain loans in a current payment status such that increases in either principal or interest do not occur. Penalties assessed participants as a result of NIH administrative complications may be considered for reimbursement.
