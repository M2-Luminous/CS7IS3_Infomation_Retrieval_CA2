FBIS3-59080 "drweu017_k_94007" FBIS-WEU-94-017 Document Type:Daily Report 26 Jan 1994 PORTUGAL * Popularity Poll Result Noted 94P20252C 94P20252C Article Type:CSO [Editorial Report] A recent poll gauged the popularity of various politicians, as well as their political prospects. The 31 December independent Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO published the results of an EXPRESSO/Euroexpansao poll conducted between 21 and 27 December among a nationally representative sample of 481 individuals, with a commentary by Jose Antonio Lima. According to poll results, the thus far consistently popular President Mario Soares lost 12 percent of his positive rating (a drop from last month's 58 percent to his present 46 percent), while his negative rating increased 13 percent (from 5 percent to 18 percent). This loss, certainly worrisome for a president who usually enjoys almost unanimous popular support, stems from the electorate's resentment of his share of responsibility in the "institutional guerrilla" he has waged against the government and the majority, Lima comments. Despite its gains in the recent municipal elections, the Socialist Party (PS) holds essentially the same share of voting intentions as the governing Social Democratic Party (PSD), 37.0 percent and 36.8 percent respectively. Similarly, PS leader Antonio Guterres' popularity is only slightly higher than Prime Minister Cavaco Silva's (35 percent and 32 percent respectively). Respondents were also queried about the opposition's prospects for 1994. Some 31 percent thought that Guterres will be a "good" leader in 1994, 41 percent expect him to be "reasonably good," and 17 percent to be "bad." Center Social Democratic Party (CDS) leader Manuel Monteiro is expected to be a "good" leader by 32 percent of the respondents, "reasonably good" by 36 percent, and "bad" by 19 percent. Communist Party (PCP) leader Carlos Carvalhas will be a "good" leader according to 28 percent of the respondents, "reasonably good" according to 38 percent, and "bad" in the opinion of 21 percent.
