[Krol] The prime minister's decision was correct. Vice Minister Kawalec was largely responsible for the fact that certain reforms in Poland were not carried out as they should have been--for example, the reform of the insurance and banking systems, and, of course, privatization. Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] voters expected to see dynamic changes: They hoped that all the factors leading to pathological changes in our economic life would be firmly and energetically identified and eliminated. Unfortunately, they suffered bitter and rather extensive disappointment, and now they view the apparent continuation of the damage done by the previous teams with mounting irritation. For example, privatization of the Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy [Wielkopolski Credit Bank, WBK] has demonstrated clearly that not all solutions are equally acceptable. The bank's share prices were artificially depressed when they were offered for sale on the Stock Exchange, and as a result they rose considerably more than tenfold in a very short time. Those who profited most from this operation were the Western strategic investor and the WBK's own employees, especially its management cadre, who had been offered the opportunity to buy many more shares, and on vastly more preferential terms, than ordinary outside investors. It was not through their own work aimed at improving the WBK financial situation but through an unearned privilege that those people became very wealthy virtually from one day to the next. And now we have just seen the same maneuver being applied, under the rule of, of all things, a left-wing government team, in the privatization of the Bank Slaski [Silesian Bank]. Forgive me, but we must neither condone nor permit such practices. [Luczak] I understand you are making your statement in the interest of so-called social justice? [Krol] Precisely. We do not interpret that social justice, of which you speak with ever so slight irony, as the principle of distributing goods to everyone on a rigidly equal basis. We believe that the differentiation of material circumstances within society is a perfectly natural thing. We support development of the free market economy, privatization, and reprivatization. However, the differences we have just mentioned should be first and foremost the result of the hard work, enterprise, inventiveness, and talent shown by people, rather than administrative decisions which give tremendous material advantages to some while forcing others downward into even greater poverty. Even in the capitalist system we should observe certain principles of social justice and fair play. Both the past and present history of Western states can show us clearly what happens when these principles are violated. Social peace in every country and in every sociopolitical system is based on general public acceptance of a certain minimum of rules and solutions. The reserves of such acceptance are dwindling very fast in Poland now, and that is precisely why we have been calling for changes. To go back to the Bank Slaski affair, I believe that all the circumstances of its privatization should be very thoroughly clarified in the public interest. [Luczak] Recent opinion poll findings demonstrate clearly and unequivocally that the public, in particular the left-voting electorate, is not prepared to approve privatization of state enterprises. Consequently, you should put a stop to the privatization process at once. [Krol] No, we should not. We understand that privatization is vitally necessary. The antiprivatization stance of our voters is not the result of any ideological considerations but the conclusion drawn from observation of the consequences of the privatization process as it has been executed to date. The ordinary man in the street notes very well how some become very wealthy in the process, through being able to buy our public assets not because they like the offer and have the money but because they can pull strings, have access to those in charge of the operations, or know how to push and shove. Such people end up grabbing all kinds of preferential chances not accessible to others. Then your ordinary man in the street is bound to draw the wrong conclusion: Privatization is something evil. That is why, in order to defend the case for privatization, we must restore it to health. There is no justification for repeating old mistakes over and over again. For example, I valued highly the professional expertise shown by the former minister of ownership transformations Janusz Lewandowski, and I appreciated the very hard work he did for the cause of privatization in Poland. Many of his errors and mistakes could be explained by the fact that he was a pioneer in that field, and a liberal in his economic thinking. However, by now we have gained much more experience in privatization, and if ministers from our current ruling government coalition persist in continuing the same mistakes, we can only attribute them to ill will. And that, among other things, was probabaly why it was necessary to recall Kawalec. [Luczak] Was it also because Kawalec refused to approve the project of pouring central capital into the Food Economy Bank [BGZ], which is, after all, associated with the PSL? [Krol] The PSL does not own the BGZ. The BGZ is one of Poland's largest banks offering financial services to the rural sector. Admittedly, it has financial problems, but who has caused them? Not the bank itself but the policies pursued by the previous governments. They dismantled the system of state farms for political reasons, but they did so in a way which destroyed the viability of those large farms. And the state farms were, after all, the BGZ's main borrowers, so inevitably their financial troubles were bound to hurt the bank. State banks have received 10 trillion zlotys [Z] for so-called restructuring, which in practical terms was tantamount to assistance in covering their losses resulting from the high proportion of unrecoverable loans. The state decided that it was not the banks' fault, since they were simply obliged to give those credits in the past. So far so good. However, why should the BGZ, which is a joint state-and-cooperative bank, be treated differently? The BGZ works in cooperation with a great many other cooperative banks, and if they were all to join forces together, they could create a bank with a dominant proportion of cooperative capital. That would change its profile and at the same time restore it to health very effectively. We cannot have situations in which people like Mr. Kawalec keep throwing a wrench in just because they happen to have taken an exception to Chairman Cichosz. It is in Polish agriculture's best interest to assist the BGZ in getting back on its feet. [Luczak] Let us assume that Prime Minister Pawlak had very strong arguments in favor of dismissing Vice Minister Kawalec. But would it not have been both easier and politically safer to present these arguments fist to the SLD leadership and to Deputy Prime Minister Borowski? Instead, Pawlak recalled Kawalec very quickly, as if in an emergency. It looked as if every minute's delay could heighten the danger of Kawalec's grabbing the state's cash box under his coat and making off with it. [Krol] According to my information, the prime minister could not count on getting Deputy Prime Minister Borowski to agree to his vice minister's dismissal, so he was forced to act as he did. [Luczak] But in this way he risked a split in the coalition and an eventual profound political crisis in Poland, did he not? [Krol] I do not believe that the government coalition was or is likely to fall apart. It is far more probable that the SLD group will disintegrate first. Very many SLD deputies agree with us, either openly or covertly, in disapproving strongly of the activities of the group of liberals within the SLD who are gathered around Aleksander Kwasniewski.
