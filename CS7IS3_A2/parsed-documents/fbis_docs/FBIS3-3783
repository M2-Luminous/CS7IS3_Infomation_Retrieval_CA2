Chairman Hsiao went on to say: It is possible to choose Central and South Africa as the destinations of President Li's second round of vacation trips. The CEPD can furnish information for use as reference to the Foreign Ministry at any time. Speaking in the Legislative Yuan yesterday, Chairman Hsiao Wan-chang said: The countries that President Li wants to visit most on vacation are the United States and Japan, which he mentioned emphatically during the news conference upon returning from his southern tour. Hsiao Wan-chang said: The two nations are our country's largest and second largest economic and trading partners; their relations with our country are both the closest and the most complicated. Hsiao Wan-chang added: The CEPD and the Foreign Ministry also have been working hard to plan President Li's next round of overseas vacation trips for diplomatic purposes. However, it is inappropriate to announce the trips before the time is ripe. He also said emphatically: On top of its policy of turning southward, the government is actually moving in all directions to expand and strengthen relations with foreign countries. Any region could be a target of its diplomatic efforts.
