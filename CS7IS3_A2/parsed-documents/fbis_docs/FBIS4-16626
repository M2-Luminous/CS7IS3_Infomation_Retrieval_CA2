"As far as the accusations that I have sold out Belarus or handed it over to somebody are concerned, I can state officially yet again that I made my choice and have no regrets. This was the choice of my life, and I am prepared to sacrifice everything to see it all through to the finish, since I am profoundly convinced that union [soyuz] with Russia will be our salvation and our children's salvation." The prime minister talked in detail about how the agreement had come about. The work began two years ago, he noted, but it has been particularly intensive for the past eight months. The Belorussian side submitted 30 versions of the agreement during this period. Vigorous opposition from certain forces within both Belorussia and Russia had to be overcome. As PRAVDA has already reported, the agreement is in two parts. The first applies to the unification of monetary systems, while the second applies to matters with a direct bearing on customs operations, duties, and the status of Russian troops on Belorussian territory. The articles in part two of the agreement, which envisage the lifting of trade duties and payments to allow Russian goods to transit Belorussian territory or to allow the Russian side to lease strategic installations, come into force 26 April.
