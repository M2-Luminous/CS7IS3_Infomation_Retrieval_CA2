In Obninsk staffers of the organized crime administration of the Kaluga Internal Affairs Administration came across the vice president of one of those commercial firms with a fashionable foreign name and discovered that he had a container of uranium-235 in his possession. It is no secret that this product is used as fuel for nuclear reactors and thus commands a high price. A further search led to the city of Elektrostal in Moscow Oblast, where the vice president's brother was employed at an enterprise. He had 30 times more uranium in his possession than his Obninsk brother. According to one account, this valuable fuel might have been destined for the Near East or Germany.
