Rejecting the charge, acting state prosecutor Sultan Bu-Jarwah adjourned the trial until March 22 to give the lawyers time to answer the prosecution case, judicial sources said. The five defendants, including Shaykh 'Ali Khalifah al-Sabah of the royal family, are accused of having embezzled up to 100 million dollars from the state-owned Kuwait Oil Tanker Company (KOTC). Shaykh 'Ali, who was oil and finance minister in the cabinet formed in exile in Saudi Arabia after Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait in August 1990, pleaded not guilty when the trial opened on January 18. Judge Bu-Jarwah rejected the defence's allegation that the trial had a "political" dimension. He said the prosecution was judging the defendants "not according to their social or political affiliations, but on the basis of equality before the law." The other four accused in the trial are Kuwaitis Hasan Qabazard and 'Abd-al-Fattah al-Badr, Jordanian Nasim Muhsin and Briton Tim Stafford. Defence lawyers argued that the case should be handled by a supreme court of five members, in accordance with a royal decree of 1990 which ruled that any minister accused of crimes must appear before such a supreme body. However, parliament abrogated the decree on January 11 on the grounds that it "obstructed" justice and "protected ministers," particularly in connection with financial scandals which came to light after Kuwait was liberated in February 1991.
