Commission Chairman Yekaterina Lyakhova delivered a report "On the Status of Families in the Russian Federation." The report noted, in particular, that as of 1 January 1994 Russia had a population of 148.4 million people, that is, the Russian population has declined by nearly 1 million from 1992. Mortality has exceeded birth rate. The author attributed this to the worsening of Russian families' social situation. For instance, the new system of child benefits introduced in January 1994 does not ensure even a level of benefits comparable with that of January 1991.
