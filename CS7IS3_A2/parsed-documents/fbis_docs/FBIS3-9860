The first meeting this morning took place with members of the bar of lawyers and then with representatives of the Association of Former Political Detainees, the Civic Alliance, and of the Associations of Former Revolutionaries. After 1030 the rapporteurs met with leaders of nongovernmental organizations in the area of human rights. These first meetings permitted the representatives of those organizations to brief the rapporteurs on their activities and on the way the commitments that our country assumed when it was admitted to the Council of Europe are being fulfilled. Asked by Friedrich Koenig which of these commitments would be given primary importance, Senator Constantin Ticu Dumitrescu emphasized that they were human rights and political rights. At the same time, Ticu Dumitrescu criticized President Ion Iliescu's attitude and the attitude by the majority party, which, in his opinion, after Romania's admission to the Council of Europe, prove that they do not want to renounce the monopoly of power. Ana Blandiana handed a letter to the rapporteurs whereby the Council of Europe is informed about the Civic Alliance's intention to set up an institute of studies on totalitarianism under the aegis of the Council of Europe. Nicolae Stefanescu-Draganesti, LADO [League for the Defense of Human Rights] president, demanded the results of the investigations on the 1990 miners' incursion when, in his opinion, hundreds of people were killed. The meeting between the rapporteurs and the justice minister, the interior minister, the prosecutor general, and the president of the Supreme Justice Court ended shortly before 1300. On this occasion, Justice Minister Gavril Iosif Chiuzbaian presented the progress of the reform process in this ministry and announced that by 13 August 1994 all judges will be granted tenure. Minister of interior Doru Ioan Taracila, presented the stage of the reform process in the ministry he headed affirming that 1,654 people who have committed violations have been removed from the police so far, and that the military magistracy has been notified about other 320 such cases of employees of the Ministry. He also said that he has not noted any cases of censorship by the police or cases when correspondence was opened. He emphasized that, in the shortest time possible, he would provide the rapporteurs with information on cases of censorship reported to him, and that he would take measures to punish all the guilty people.
