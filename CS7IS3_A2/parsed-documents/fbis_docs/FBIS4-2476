The "Reference News" column report in the April issue of CHENG MING said: "The house of Chen Shaoji, chief of the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department, was ransacked by 'thieves' believed to have come from within." The report continued: "One day in early March, Chen Shaoji attended a provincial party committee meeting, all his family members went to visit friends in Foshan City, and his domestic helper returned to Xinhui on vacation. It was reported that this happened at about 1800 and involved two or more suspects. All of the electrical appliances in the house were damaged, clothes were smeared with paint, and a message was left, which read: We visited your excellency's house to check your property; we will announce the results soon. Reports said that bank books showing deposits of 35,000 yuan and gold ornaments were stolen." Chen Shaoji pointed out: The report described the date, people's whereabouts, and the way the ransacking was performed in such a detailed manner that "they seemed to be true" but, as a matter of fact, my house and the houses of other leaders of the provincial Public Security Department have remained safe so far and no burglary has ever occurred. Since the report was published, my family members and I have received many telephone inquiries every day which have been quite disruptive. Deputy Public Security Chief Wu Zeyao said: The provincial Public Security Department feels it necessary to clarify some Hong Kong press reports which have distorted facts concerning Guangdong's public security. The "thieves from within" mentioned by the report refer to public security personnel. This is groundless and means to say that "internal conflicts" have occurred in public security departments. The report on a burglary in the Guangdong Provincial Public Security "commander's" house located in the Public Security Department's compound tried to indicate that Guangdong's social order had deteriorated to an unredeemable degree. In addition, the report also used some words which caused much food for thought, such as "announcing the results soon" and so on, to make a false impression that there was uncleanliness within the leadership. Wu Zeyao said that the report was short and comprised only a little over 100 characters. However, it was meticulously composed and targeted at the public security chief and has ruined the image of Guangdong Public Security Departments. Wu Zeyao said that a lawsuit would be filed against the report if necessary. To further clarify this case, a reporter went to Chen Shaoji's house accompanied by Chen Shaoji's wife and others. Chen Shaoji lives on the top floor of an old seven-story building within the Public Security Department's compound. The building is not equipped with an elevator. The interior of the room is simply decorated. There were no indications that the electrical appliances and furniture had been damaged and the domestic helper was a girl from Guangxi (not from Xinhui, as the report mentioned) who has been in Guangzhou for not more than six months.
