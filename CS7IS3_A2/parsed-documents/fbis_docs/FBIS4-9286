In Zurich a bilateral agreement on the diplomatic staffs of both countries will also be discussed, as stressed in the meeting that President Berisha held on 14 April with German Ambassador Claus Vollers, representative of the troika of the European Union in Tirana. We hope that this act, which expresses Albania's determination for a constructive policy, will serve as a signal for the Greek Government to engage in stopping hostile acts and following a policy of good-neighborliness toward Albania. With this decision, Albania confirms once again its determination to follow a policy of reducing tension and preserving stability in the south of the Balkans.
