The press law, as amended by subsequent regulations, does not stipulate any restrictions regarding the names of periodicals. On the other hand, the name in question is the official name of a state that, as transpires from the Constitution of the Slovak Republic, must not be used by any other domestic or foreign entity. Slovakia is registered under this unique name with the United Nations and other international organizations and was internationally recognized under this name. In other words, the name of the state is protected by international legal regulations, and its use by other entities is out of the question, also because it could be mistaken for another entity--for example, abroad. Speaking about the name of the state having been abused is possible on the theoretical plane only. In the specific case of the daily SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA, such an abuse in the legal sense did not occur. In a letter on 12 May 1994, the Ministry of Culture of the Slovak Republic, as the registering authority, asked the publisher, SALUS Ltd., to register a change in the present name of the daily so as to make the name of the periodical conform with the Constitution of the Slovak Republic and international legal regulations. "Giving a daily or another periodical the name of a state can be considered a precedent that is without parallel in the world," Lubomir Fogos, chairman of the National Council of the Slovak Republic Mandate and Immunity Committee, who is one of our foremost experts on international and constitutional law, said yesterday. In his opinion, the Constitution of the Slovak Republic lacks stipulations that would apply to such instances of the name of the state being used for commercial purposes. He considers it unusual, however, when state symbols, to which the name of the Republic undeniably belongs, are used in ways that actually debase them. [passage omitted] [Bratislava REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 13 May on page 2 carries a 100-word "zl"-signed report on a briefing given by the Democratic Union on 12 May. According to the report, "Democratic Union Deputy Chairman Roman Kovac expressed astonishment at the fact that the Ministry of Culture registered the daily SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA, which carries the name of the state. He said that the government would ask that the circumstances under which this happened be reconsidered and that it would draw conclusions from this."]
