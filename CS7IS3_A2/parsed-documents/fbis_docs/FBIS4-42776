And, with asylum in his pocket, he could say farewell for ever to Milan, the Clean Hands judges, investigations, and possible prosecution. Thus the Tunisian Government would be granting the former Socialist leader -- and former head of the Italian Government -- the understanding that he deserves as someone "persecuted" by Italian justice, and therefore the right to live undisturbed in Hammamet. The possibility of "asylum" being granted to Craxi was publicized yesterday by Italian press agencies, who were reporting a statement made by a "Tunisian Government official source" --not further identified--who was quoted in the last issue of the weekly JEUNE AFRIQUE. The statement in question is very curt, almost resentful, and rather undiplomatic. The official source said the following: "If Bettino Craxi requests political asylum, we will give a response. Tunisia is free to grant political asylum to whomever it chooses, just as European countries are. In such a case, the extradition agreement we have with Italy would not apply." As a matter of fact, Italy and Tunisia maintain rather friendly relations, and these have resulted in bilateral agreements in many fields, including judiciary matters. The offenses for which Craxi is being indicted are all covered by the treaty. The source, whose statements were denied by the Tunisian Government a few hours later, made further "revelations" to the weekly, explaining, among other things, the meticulous and strict security service established around the Craxi family's home, in the following words: "We do not want to have a new Abu-Jahad case on our hands (Abu-Jahad, a key aide of Yasir 'Arafat, was killed in Tunis by an Israeli commando -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note): After all, an assassin might be hiding among the journalists." However, as reported above, the source was disowned almost at once. Tunisian diplomats stressed that, so far, the Tunisian authorities have made no offers of political asylum to Bettino Craxi, nor has indeed the former Italian Socialist Party secretary submitted any such request to this north African country's government.
