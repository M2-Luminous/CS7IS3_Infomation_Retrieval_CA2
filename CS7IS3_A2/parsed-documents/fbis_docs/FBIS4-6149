FBIS4-6149 "dreas075__a94006" FBIS-EAS-94-075-A Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Business Leaders Support Coalition Framework Business Leaders Support Coalition Framework OW1304144694 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 13 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 3--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1304144694 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] Fielding Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign minister, as a successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, while maintaining the current framework of the coalition government is the profile of the next administration that business leaders want to see, according to a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN survey. On 12 April, the paper questioned senior officials at the four major Japanese economic organizations, including Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic Organizations], and top executives of major corporations on the issue of Hosokawa's successor. The results indicate that business leaders are turning away from the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], as well as that they "hope the next administration will be one that will not move back the tide of political, administrative, and economic reforms" (as stated by Masaru Hayami, chairman of Japan Association of Corporate Executives), which Prime Minister Hosokawa has undertaken. However, there still are some business leaders who strongly call for fielding former Deputy Prime Minister Michio Watanabe for the prime ministership on the condition that the LDP split again. In the survey, 20 business leaders responded to questions. Asked "who should be the next prime minister," 10, or nearly half, of 22 votes cast (respondents were allowed to list more than one favorite choice) went to Hata. As to why they endorsed him, some business leaders said "he seems stable and clean," while others said "he will ride the current of reform started by the Hosokawa administration and definitely continue to promote reform efforts." If the current framework of the coalition government were to be maintained, there is strong inclination toward fielding Hata, who currently holds the no. 2 post in the Hosokawa administration, for the prime ministership, as this is considered the most appropriate choice. One top corporate executive explained: "To field Mr. Hata is tantamount to fielding Mr. Ozawa. The survey results prove there are now more business leaders who hold expectations for Ozawa as a man of action." Watanabe ranked second to Hata, collecting a quarter of the votes. Some of his supporters said they chose him because "he is a strong leader," while others did so because "he can be expected to promptly settle budget-related issues, including tax system reform, since he is an economics expert." However, some business leaders say "I cannot stand Mitchie [Watanabe's nickname]," as they are concerned about his style of economic management, which is said to be inflationary. Some business leaders supported Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura (chairman of Sakigake [Harbinger Party]), who distances himself from the Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]-Komeito-Japan New Party bloc. He has been praised by some business leaders who say "his abilities had much to do with deregulation and other economic reform efforts undertaken by the Hosokawa administration." This indicates Takemura enjoys the support of some business leaders who are cautious about Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa's high-handed political style. One business leader endorsed Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Japan, but he said: "It would be only on the condition that he lead a tentative administration that would merely take care of the fiscal year 1994 budget and trade relations with the United States, which are impending issues."
