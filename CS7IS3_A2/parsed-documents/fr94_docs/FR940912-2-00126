FR940912-2-00126 FR940912-2-00088 PANAMA CANAL COMMISSION Agency Information Collection Request submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for clearance. AGENCY: Panama Canal Commission. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: In accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511), as amended, the Panama Canal Commission hereby gives notice that it has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for clearance a SF&hyph;83 (Request for OMB Review) for a currently approved collection of information contained in Subchapter C (Shipping and Navigation) of Chapter I, Title 35, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). ADDRESSES: Comments may be sent to Edward H. Clarke, Desk Officer for Panama Canal Commission, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Room 3228, New Executive Office Building, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For a complete copy of the collection of information or related information, contact Barbara Fuller, Office of the Secretary, Panama Canal Commission, telephone 202&hyph;634&hyph;6441. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Title: Subchapter C (Shipping and Navigation) of Chapter I, 35 CFR. Type of Request: Revision of a currently approved collection. Respondents: Businesses or other for profit. Estimated Number of Respondents: 14,700. Estimated Hours Per Response: 2 hours. Estimated Total Burden Hours: 29,400. Frequency of Response: On occasion. Needs and Uses: On December 24, 1981, OMB approved an information collection proposal submitted by the Panama Canal Commission in conjunction with a revision of its navigation regulations (35 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter C), and assigned it the control number 3207&hyph;0001. The forms required by those regulations (which make up the collection of information) are used to collect, from vessels arriving in the Panama Canal waters, information required for assuring that the vessels are in compliance with Panama Canal Commission shipping and navigation regulations. The information collected will be used for economic analyses, traffic forecasting, identification, billing, safety and sanitation purposes. It is estimated that the burden (which varies widely, depending upon the nature of each vessel's operations) for cargo vessels ranges from five minutes to four hours per response. The burden will be lessened for those vessels having the capability of producing computer-generated cargo declarations. For passenger vessels, the range would be from approximately two hours to thirteen hours. The utilization of computer-generated crew and passenger lists should reduce by eight to ten hours the time required of a vessel like the QUEEN ELIZABETH 2, (the smallest ``passenger'' vessels carry about 13 passengers and the largest, the QUEEN ELIZABETH 2, is capable of accommodating about 1,879). It would be very difficult to provide a meaningful estimate of the total burden for each vessel since some transit frequently, while others may transit only once or infrequently. Dated: August 30, 1994. James E. Ferrara, Director, Office of Executive Administration and Transition Coordination, Senior Official for Information Resources Management.
