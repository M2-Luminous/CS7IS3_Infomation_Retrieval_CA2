The United States does not believe that this program is for peaceful uses and suspects that Pakistan wants to make atomic bombs. Because of this suspicion, it stopped military and economic aid to Pakistan under the Pressler Amendment. The United States is not satisfied with Pakistan even after the nuclear program was frozen. It is pressing us to roll back the nuclear program, to permit the inspection of nuclear installations, and to unilaterally sign the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty]. However, this is plain blackmail. Actually the United states wants to make Pakistan dependent on it. Since Pakistan is not willing to become dependent, the United States at times accuses it of making nuclear weapons, and at other times threatens to declares it a terrorist nation. What the United States wants is clear from the U.S. Ambassador John Minzo's speech at the American Association of Pakistani Doctors last Saturday. The U.S. ambassador said that relations between the two countries would be very good if Pakistan agreed with the United States. He said in his speech that relations between the two countries have improved compared to the past, and there is the possibility that these relations will become more stable if Pakistan supports U.S. international policies. What the U.S. ambassador has said is very true. If Pakistan was dependent on the United States, and had become its ally, the United States would have no complaints or accusations against Pakistan. U.S. international policies are not hidden from any one. The United States cannot tolerate the idea of Pakistan's friendly relations with China. It does not like Pakistan's brotherly relations with Iran, Iraq, Libya, and other Muslim nations either. It also wants Pakistan to recognize Israel and to establish diplomatic relations with it. However, the U.S. ambassador should fully understand that Pakistan is an independent nation. The Pakistani people are Muslims with a firm faith in their religion. They cannot break up their traditional friendship with these countries for U.S. happiness and aid. Opportunistic and cowardly nations change their ideologies and policies. The Pakistani people are not cowards and will not compromise their principles under pressure or for greed. Pakistan's relations with China can become more stable. Pakistan will continue its efforts toward unity and cooperation among Muslim nations. Israel will not be recognized at all. Similarly, Pakistan will not roll back its nuclear program under any pressure or for any greed. The United States is indeed a superpower, and it can blackmail and harass Pakistan. However, it cannot force us to cooperate with it. No Pakistani government can compromise national prestige and pride. Pakistan also has courageous and patriotic leaders like Imam Khomeini, Saddam Hussein, Colonel Gaddafi, and Farah Adid who are capable of being firm with the time of test.
