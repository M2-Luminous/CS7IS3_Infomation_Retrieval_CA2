Answering questions atthe World Economic Forum's southern African summit in Cape Town, he said in the past opponents of apartheid who had applied for indemnity had had to state what crimes they had committed. "Now we say we want to be even-handed." Those who had committed crimes in defence of apartheid would have to subscribe to the same conditions. This was the only way in which the wounds of the past could be healed. Mr Mandela stressed the intention was not to institute Nuremburg-style trials. He added that the category of apartheid defenders being referred to was those who had thought they were implementing policies in which they believed, and not those who had planned the murder of innocent people. "I hope all of you will accept our bona fides. We want to say we are committed to reconciliation." The ANC had said from its inception that South Africa belonged to all its people, black and white -- and in the 1950's 152 leaders of the people had been charged with treason for this principle. "We are the one organisation whose bona fides should not be questioned," President Mandela said.
