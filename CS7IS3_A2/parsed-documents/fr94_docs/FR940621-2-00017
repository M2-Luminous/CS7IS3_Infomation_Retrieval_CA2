ACTION: Notice of availability of the terms and conditions of proposed commodity futures and option contracts. SUMMARY: The Chicago Board of Trade (CBT or Exchange) has applied for designation as a contract market in rough rice futures and futures option contracts. The Director of the Division of Economic Analysis (Division) of the Commission, acting pursuant to the authority delegated by Commission Regulation 140.96, has determined that publication of the proposals for comment is in the public interest, will assist the Commission in considering the views of interested persons, and is consistent with the purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act. DATES: Comments must be received on or before July 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: Interested persons should submit their views and comments to Jean A. Webb, Secretary, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street NW., Washington, DC 20581. Reference should be made to the CBT rough rice futures and option contracts. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Please contact Fred Linse of the Division of Economic Analysis, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street NW., Washington, DC 20581, telephone 202&hyph;254&hyph;7303. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The terms and conditions of the proposed CBT contracts are identical to those of the MCE rough rice contracts, since the CBT contracts are intended to replace the existing MCE rough rice contracts. Under the proposal, concurrent with the listing of the CBT's proposed rough rice futures and option contracts, the MCE rough rice futures and option contracts would be delisted and all existing open interest will be transferred to the CBT from the MCE. The MCE contract designations for rough rice would remain in force. The Commission is requesting comment on the proposed CBT contracts and on the proposal to transfer open interest to the CBT from the MCE. Copies of the terms and conditions will be available for inspection at the Office of the Secretariat, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20581. Copies of the terms and conditions can be obtained through the Office of the Secretariat by mail at the above address or by phone at (202) 254&hyph;6314. Other materials submitted by the CBT in support of the applications for contract market designation may be available upon request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and the Commission's regulations thereunder (17 CFR Part 145 (1987)), except to the extent they are entitled to confidential treatment as set forth in 17 CFR 145.5 and 145.9. Requests for copies of such materials should be made to the FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Act Compliance Staff of the Office of the Secretariat at the Commission's headquarters in accordance with 17 CFR 145.7 and 145.8.
