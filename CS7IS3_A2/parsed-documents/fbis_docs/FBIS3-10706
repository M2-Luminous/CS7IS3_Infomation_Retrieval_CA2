After a three-hour discussion during which passions ran high, the Constituent Congress upheld the text that bans the head of state from running for the presidency a second time. The reelection of governors and mayors was also rejected. The motion seeking to reduce -- to 90 days before the elections -- the deadline for the president, governors, and mayors to resign from office in order to run for another government post was also voted down. The original constitutional text, which provides for a six-month deadline before the elections for government officials to resign their posts to run for office, was thus passed without amendment. Before adjourning, the Constituent Congress decided that the other item included in the order of the day, namely the amendment extending maternity leave for congresswomen, will be voted on at the end of the week. At 1000 local time today the Constituent Congress will vote on political matters. The order of the day includes, among other subjects, political affiliation, the voluntary vote, the mixed district voting system, and parliamentary immunity.
