[passage omitted] At a news conference held at midday today, Peter Weiss and Jaroslav Volf, the chairmen of the two parties, reported on new elements in the relations between these two parties. Ludmila Bulakova returned from the news briefing only a few minutes ago. Good day to you. [Bulakova] Good day. [Mrazova] I presume that issues relating to parliamentary elections and the solution of internal political crisis topped the agenda, especially because, in the interview broadcast by Bratislava radio yesterday, SDL Chairman Peter Weiss did not rule out the possibility of forming a coalition with the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia. What do the social democrats think of it? [Bulakova] First of all, Jaroslav Volf said that forming a temporary government would be a risky business. Replying to the specific question as to what they would think if the SDL joined Vladimir Meciar's government, Volf said, and I quote, this move would not promote stabilization in Slovakia and would amount to a denial of the idea of the government of broad coalition. [passage omitted] [Mrazova] According to Pavol Kanis [SDL deputy chairman], the SDL is prepared to discuss the date of early elections today. At the same time, it is not against any date because it wants the present situation to calm down. But, as is known, Jaroslav Volf thinks that the elections should be a tool through which political entities could acquire a definite shape. Because of this, he thinks that the June date is very questionable. Was this also discussed? [Bulakova] As far as this disputed point is concerned, Mr. Volf said that it was tabled at the talks with the SDL. The two parties then discussed their positions and felt that a realistic date for elections is the end of September or the beginning of October. [passage omitted] But, to wind it all up, the whole news conference and the pronouncements made there ended with a statement made by SDL Chairman Weiss, who said that the SDSS views would be taken into consideration in the PDL's talks with the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. The SDL described the SDSS as its strategic partner. [Mrazova] Let us assume that the HZDS and the SDL will not reach an agreement today. Will the SDL initiate a dismissal of the government? [Bulakova] Peter Weiss's answer to this was that the word "never" does not exist in politics. One has to consider all of the available options. One of the options is to form a reconstituted coalition government of experts. He did not rule out any of the options, however.
