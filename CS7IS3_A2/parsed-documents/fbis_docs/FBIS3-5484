"As the coalition government was established, the Japanese people expected it to break the rigidity of politics and the economy caused by the long-term rule of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)," Hosokawa said at a plenary session of the House of Councillors. Hosokawa launched the seven-party coalition last August after breaking the LDP's 38-year-long grip on power. At Monday's plenary session of the more powerful House of Representatives, the prime minister vowed continued efforts to make the Japanese economy more open to the rest of the world even though the initial task of the coalition government to reform politics is complete. Hosokawa also expressed hope that the Japanese economy will see a recovery in fiscal 1994, which begins in April. Accelerating inventory adjustment in the private sector offers bright prospects but the economy remains stagnant in general, he said. "The government compiled the 15 trillion yen stimulus package and incorporated measures into the fiscal 1994 budget to bring the economy back on track as early as possible in fiscal 1994 and keep up stable growth from fiscal 1995 on," the premier said. He was responding to questions by Tomio Yamamoto, an LDP upper house legislator. Hosokawa tried to allay concern about a possible shortage of rice, saying the government increased the amount of domestically grown rice to be sold in March and is taking steps to solve the shortage. Japan is expected to import as much as two million tons of rice to make up for the shortage resulting from last year's worst harvest in the postwar period. Representatives of political parties started three days of interpellations Monday on last Friday's policy speeches by Hosokawa and three cabinet ministers.
