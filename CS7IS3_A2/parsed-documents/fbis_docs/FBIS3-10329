Serra and MacLaren on 28 February reviewed some aspects of NAFTA implementation and prepared the trade agenda for the Mexican-Canadian meeting that will take place today. In a brief interview following the meeting, Serra said the Mexican Government's position remains "as it has always been," one of granting other nations access to NAFTA. Minister MacLaren, who agreed with Serra, added that the objective is to ensure that the NAFTA area is open, not a "closed fortress." Serra and MacLaren met behind closed doors and gave only brief answers to reporters' questions. The two also announced that ExpoCanada will be held on 23 and 24 March. Serra said this was a meeting "between friends" and that he hopes he will soon be able to return MacLaren's visits. Today the two officials will discuss trade and investment, promotion of businesses, cooperation, statistics, intellectual property, and multilateral relations. Official figures reveal that trade between Mexico and Canada has been small-scale with slight growth in 1994. Mexico has had a virtually permanent trade deficit with Canada. As of 1993, however, Mexico has became Canada's largest commercial partner and constitutes Canada's sixth largest supplier. In 1993 Mexico sold Canada goods worth 5 million Canadian dollars, almost twice as much as the amount traded three years ago. In addition, Canadian investment in Mexico is some $700 million, almost twice as much as the investment figure for 1989. Leading Canadian imports include assembly material for vehicles, wheat, radio and telegraphic equipment, iron and steel sheets, and iron and steel bars and ingots. The main products Mexico exports to Canada include passenger vehicles, crude, spare parts and engines for vehicles, and data-processing machines, among other things. Trade prospects are expected to increase between the two nations. Since the end of 1993, some 6,500 Mexican companies have visited the Canadian Embassy trade section seeking to do business with that country. Sectors that have expressed the greatest commercial interest include those dealing with transportation equipment, food, and traditional areas such as paper pulp manufacturing and telecommunications. Meanwhile, Canadians have expressed a great interest in such the chemical and mining industries. There are 70 Canadian mining companies in Mexico with the number increasing all the time.
