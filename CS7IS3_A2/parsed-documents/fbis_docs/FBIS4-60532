In his 'Id al-Adha sermon at the al-Ansar Mosque in (?Udinbawi), Omdurman, today al-Mahdi said that the situation in Sudan is the worst it has ever been, noting that he will take serious action to restore democracy in the country. Al-Mahdi pointed out that the government-appointed parliament does not fit into this category because it is appointed by the authority that is supposed to be accountable to it. He criticized the government's economic policies, particularly the profit-sharing system, which he described as the most repulsive crime ever against the Sudanese economy. The former prime minister criticized the government's management of alms and its establishment of the Alms Department, saying that most of the money is being spent on the employees of that department.
