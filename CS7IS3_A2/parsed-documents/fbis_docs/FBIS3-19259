Christopher's wish -- which was not even presented in a particularly sharp form -- that human rights be observed was answered in a way that almost had the effect of an insult. Not only was his visit overshadowed by the prosecution of a well-known Chinese human rights activist, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen even accused the United States of violating laws: Beijing takes offense at U.S. human rights commissioner Shattuk's meeting with prominent dissident Wei Jingsheng a few days before Christopher's appearance. What caused the Chinese rulers to behave in such an unfriendly way? What has driven them to make it almost impossible for U.S. President Clinton to agree to prolonging the preferential treatment of imports from China? It is true that Christopher should have known that Beijing would react particularly stubbornly to direct reproaches and is at best sometimes willing to give in tacitly after Western visitors have departed. However, no other U.S. secretary of state has met with such a cold snub in Beijing -- even though quite a lot is at stake for China's flourishing trade with the United States. Why, therefore, is it so unyielding? Unlike Russia, China is not only potentially, but even now is a profitable market. Economic growth has reached dimensions that meanwhile even frighten the central planners. Therefore, however, the political leadership has become even more self-confident, even if the memory of the democracy movement that was so bloodily stifled a little less than five years ago may have a lasting effect and explain the nervousness with which the rulers react to even the smallest movements of the opposition. However, it is also part of this memory that the West, with an eye on the Chinese market, quickly forgave oppressors of the likes of Premier Li Peng. Beijing is also banking on exactly that this time -- and knows that U.S. businesses that are no less angry with Christopher for advocating the observance of human rights in China are on its side.
