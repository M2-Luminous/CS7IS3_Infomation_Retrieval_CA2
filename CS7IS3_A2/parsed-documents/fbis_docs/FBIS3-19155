In a statement to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation, Mikhailidhis said the new resolution clearly says that an agreement must be reached on the CBM's with no delay and that the measures do not constitute either a substitute or an overall Cyprus solution. They are measures that will open the way for a substantive dialogue on a solution. Mikhailidhis also noted that the resolution clearly mentions that the current situation in Cyprus is unacceptable and that if current efforts fail, the Security Council should study other ways for implementing the several UN resolutions. Referring to the draft document on UN ideas that was submitted to the two sides in the form of informal documents, Mikhailidhis said the Greek Cypriot side has asked for clarifications and has taken neither a positive nor a negative stance on the draft document. He added that from the meetings held so far between President Glavkos Kliridhis and Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate special representative in Cyprus, it seems it will not be possible to hold meetings in New York at the end of March. The foreign minister noted that Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas' recent statements do not give positive messages. The foreign minister announced that Hans van den Broek, the European Union [EU] commissioner in charge of foreign political affairs, will visit Cyprus on 24 March for talks on the Cyprus issue and the Cyprus-EU relations.
