The national union leadership met with them for the first time in (Sitrosimec). In an atmosphere of cordiality, open-mindedness, and defined visions looking at national interest issues, the CPT presented to President-elect Figueres six points that are very important to Costa Rican workers. CPT Coordinator Gerardo Chavez said that among the key points the labor movement presented to Figueres are: a salary policy for the next four years, respect for the right to strike, approval of the unemployment [cesantia] law, and granting of labor rights to private sector workers. Chavez also urged them to honor the country's commitments with other governments. The workers requested the establishment of specific guidelines on the free trade treaty [not further specified], state modernization, and how the social and economic life of Costa Ricans will change in the next four years. President-elect Figueres said that the views of the labor sector will be taken into account. He added, however, that no decision will be made for the time being, because the new government will not be in office until 8 May. Meanwhile, Labor Minister-designate Ayales said that these points deal with issues that are of interest to all Costa Ricans and added that they are willing to hold talks to settle specific problems that might come up in the future.
