Rozhok told BNS the charges brought against him were about fanning inter-ethnic hostility. Rozhok in his speech in Narva on Jan. 25 and in an interview with the Russian-language SILLAMAESKI VESTNIK local newspaper of the northeast Estonian town of Sillamae "fanned inter-ethnic and political hostility," the indictment says. The representative of Zhirinovskiy's party at a meeting of the Narva Union of Russian citizens had said President Lennart Meri was a "president of the Estonians in the best case, not of Russians," because the country's Russian-speaking population had not participated in his election. He said the same of the Estonian parliament. In an interview with the SILLAMAESKI VESTNIK Rozhok said Estonia is a traditional Russian domain. He said the retired Russian military living in Estonia should set up paramilitary units "for defending their honor and dignity" in the case if Estonian authorities decided to send them out from the country. The indictment was read to Rozhok in the presence of a deputy consul of the Russian Embassy in Tallinn, Valeriy Chalovsky. Rozhok said he has to sign a document on not leaving his permanent place of residence. He said he hasn't signed the paper yet. Rozhok had told the police he was no more going to appear before police for interrogation. Security police officials had then said he would be brought before police under compulsion if necessary. The Zhirinovskiy party representative last appeared before Estonian police for interrogation on March 10. Deputy Consul Chalovsky was also present then. Rozhok on March 10 said he was not going to use the services of Estonian lawyers and added he had no intention to pay to any lawyer at all. "You yourselves have made up this soup, now you also eat it," he said in explanation. Holger Siigart, deputy head of the Estonian Defense Police, said investigation into Rozhok's case was going to continue and that Rozhok will in any case have to appear before investigators to give his statements. Siigart also said the issue of the defense lawyer was going to be resolved, but he didn't elaborate.
