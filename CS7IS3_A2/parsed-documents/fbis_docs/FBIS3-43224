In an interview with AFP on 29 December, the French cooperation minister commented on the political situation in Congo. He said, among other things, that there are no national armed forces in Congo and described as unbearable the fact that French nationals living in Brazzavile are being harassed. Michel Roussin asked President Pascal Lissouba to take the necessary measures in order to show his abilities as a leader. The reaction was swift. The Congolese Foreign Ministry described the statement as discourteous. Francis Tamalax has details: [Begin Tamalax recording] At a time when national forces need to harmonize their actions with the mediation activities of our friends, (Machiavel Tadikisa Massanga), spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that Congo was surprised at the unfriendly attitude of a French political authority. This attitude introduces a discordant note in the good relations existing between Congo and France. Brazzaville nonetheless has reiterated its faith by taking care of its friends during the disturbances experienced by the country, notably France, whose political commitment in favor of Congo has never wavered. The Congolese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said that, except for some minor incidents that it regrets and strongly condemns, foreigners living in Congo have been safe from the violence which led to the deaths of about 80 people in the south of Brazzaville, the capital, from 10 to 14 December. [end recording] One of the consequences of the political violence in Congo is the fear that is gripping French nationals. In recent days several French nationals, including two diplomats, have been attacked or mistreated by unknown individuals in Brazzaville. About 30 French technical assistants are planning to leave Congo in the coming days and will follow about 40 others who recently left the Congolese capital with their families and possessions. On the economic level, things are no better. The disruption in rail traffic between Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire following the political violence has resulted in an increase in prices for essential goods and the scarcity of some products in the Congolese capital. Bread is becoming scarce due to a scarcity of flour, and the price has risen from 50 to 75 CFA francs. Similarly, a portion of cassava, usually sold for 500 CFA francs, now costs 1500 CFA francs at the city's largest market. Chinchards, the sea fish that is the most widely consumed by Congolese, can no longer be found. The price of a kilo of rice has doubled from 200 to 400 CFA francs, and bananas have disappeared from most markets. These scarcities are attributed to the proliferation of black market deals organized by Zairians who cross the river in canoes loaded with cassava flour. Apart from foodstuffs, Zairian clandestine fuel traders, nicknamed al-Qadhdhafis, sell fuel at 1000 CFA francs per liter, compared to the 300 CFA francs on the official market. Congo-Ocean railroad traffic, the only permanent link between the capital and the Pointe-Noire port -- the main economic center of the country -- has been interrupted for 10 days. Opposition supporters have erected barricades on the rails to denounce political violence in the Congolese capital.
