This serious case seriously encroached upon state interests and disrupted financial and social order. If we do not punish those involved, we will be unable to calm down people's indignation and exercise state law. The judgment of this case has demonstrated the fairness and seriousness of our country's legal system. We have learned a profound lesson from this case, in which a few foreign swindlers created a bid fraud involving $10 billion. This is indeed a frightening thing. Had our country's judicial organs and concerned departments not taken immediate and effective measures, the economic losses and political impact would have been unbearable. This case reminded us that, in the course of establishing and developing a socialist market economy, we must have a sound legal system to guide and protect us. It is wrong to think people can do as they wish and defy laws human and divine because China is now practicing a market economy. All sovereign countries, including the Western countries where the market economy is highly developed, will not allow criminal activities such as fraud to happen in their own countries. We must have some vigilance against swindling activities carried out by "foreign businessmen" such as Mei Zhifang [Francisco Hung Moy] and Li Zhuoming [Raymond C. Lee]. They came to China not to genuinely help China develop the economy but to pillage for private gains with wicked minds. They came here not to do normal business but to swindle and bluff. Foreigners must observe China's laws, and Chinese should also observe foreign laws in foreign countries. All people should do things in accordance with the law and all people are equal in the face of law. Punishing them in accordance with the law is to protect our country's normal rights and interests and is also to protect foreign businessmen's normal rights and interests. It is certain that the overwhelming majority of foreign businessmen are friendly, come to China to do business, and observe laws and discipline. Swindlers such as Mei Zhifang and Li Zhuoming are extremely few among foreign businessmen. The opening China will not give up eating for fear of choking [yin ye fei shi 0936 0888 1683 7380], and will, as always, welcome friends from the five continents and receive guest from the whole world. What brought on the $10-billion swindle, besides the deceitfulness and craftiness of the swindlers, was the ignorance and greed of those who were deceived. Ignorance and rash actions, failure to abide by the laws, failure to observe rules, and abuse of authority will definitely lead to a law violation and the committing of crimes. Ignorance plus greed could not have been a worse combination. Maybe they wanted fame or status and maybe they wanted money or other personal benefits, but they were blinded by lust for gain and they brought calamity to the country and people. We should draw a profound lesson from what happened. When it comes to constructing the socialist market economy, many of us are just like primary school students who do not even have some of the very basic general knowledge. Only through serious study can we adapt the new situation's demands. Leading cadres at all levels and comrades who are involved in economic work, particularly that which is related to foreign nationals, should, in particular, seriously study the basic law, general knowledge, and laws and regulations governing market economics. What we are afraid of are people who know nothing but pretend that they do and who regard state property as a trifling thing -- that is very dangerous. This year, the overall situation concerning work of the whole party and nation is to seize the opportunity, deepen the reform, open up wider, promote development, and maintain stability. When comrades from all regions, units, and departments want to ask questions or handle affairs, they should have the cardinal principles in mind and take the overall situation into account, and should never harm the interests of the whole for the sake of partial and local interests. Still less should they forget righteousness in the face of profits; they should not forget the fundamental interests of the country and people just because they want a small profit for their localities or units. We should correctly handle relations between reform, development, and stability; seriously complete all tasks in a responsible manner; ensure that we have sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development; and promote all-round social progress.
