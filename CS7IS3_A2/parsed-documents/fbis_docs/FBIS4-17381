FBIS4-17381 "drsov079_b_94067" FBIS-SOV-94-079 Daily Report 23 Apr 1994 RUSSIAN NATIONAL AFFAIRS Military & Nuclear Issues Official Says Chernobyl-Type Accident Impossible Official Says Chernobyl-Type Accident Impossible LD2304174694 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1322 GMT 23 Apr 94 LD2304174694 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] An accident similar to that in Chernobyl is impossible in Russia, a spokesman for Rosenergoatom, Russia's nuclear power engineering concern, running all 9 Russian nuclear power plants, has said. Anatoliy Zemskov told Interfax that after the events in Chernobyl, much work had been done to make nuclear reactors in Russia safer. For instance, at the Leningrad nuclear power station, the first power block has been reconstructed. Technological channels were replaced and so were the reactor's inside graphite covering and the protection system. The speed with which rods fall into the active zone has increased from 18 to 4 seconds. "This work makes it possible to avoid negative processes that are possible at the Chernobyl-type reactors," Zemskov declared. "Of course, this does not rule out separate incidents, however, today's safety systems can localize them," he said. He also reported that the term of some reactors exploitation would soon be up, and power units would have to be stopped in ten years or so. This holds true of the Leningrad, Kola, Kursk, and Novoronezhsk nuclear power stations. So, it is now very important to start designing nuclear reactors of an advanced type, Zemskov said. He disclosed that engineers at the St. Petersburg branch of the Atomenergoproekt institute were completing work on the design of a new NP-500 reactor. In the first quarter of 1995, work will start on an experimental reactor with a maximum capacity of 650 megawatt. "The equipment used in this reactor has been tested in most critical situations and has proved reliable," Zemskov said. In his words, experts are considering the possibility of setting up nuclear power plants in some remote regions. "Sakhalin, Kamchatka, Chukotka, and Yakutia ask for smaller yield atomic power stations on their territories," he reported. In his words, there is a plan to transform some nuclear reactors from icebreakers to movable platforms. Besides, there are blue- prints for building a small remote-controlled nuclear power plant. Placed underground, such a station can operate for 25 years automatically, provided fuel delivery is regular.
