A provisional statute on so-called local deputy conventions has been approved. These conventions, consisting of at least 25 former people's deputies, have been endowed with the same powers as the local soviets that were abolished by Presidential Edict No 1617. Now we can expect the Republic of Mordvinia to become part of the "red belt" around Moscow. The republic Supreme Soviet, which survived the events of last October, used its prerogative to frame the republic constitution to acquire unprecedented power and to strike a blow at President Yeltsin's edict. Incidentally, this is not the first time the Mordvinian members of parliament, headed by Nikolay Biryukov, have thumbed their noses at the federal government. The readers of IZVESTIYA will recall when the Supreme Soviet abolished the office of republic president, rescinding the will of the people, who had elected democrat Vasiliy Guslyannikov to this office. After some minor altercations with the obstinate Mordvinian people's deputies, the Yeltsin administration "gave up" Guslyannikov and thereby encouraged Biryukov to continue his audacious behavior. One of the ideologists of neo-Sovietism, Professor Viktor Veshnyakov, who is now a State Duma deputy representing Zhirinovskiy's party, declared during a recent visit to Mordvinia that the representative branch of government in the republic should be the supreme and sole authority. This idea was echoed in different keys by Sergey Baburin and Vladimir Isakov, who also visited Mordvinia at the height of the Soviet's confrontation with the local and federal presidents. To be fair, we have to admit that many government officials representing the president also came to Saransk. There was the recent landing party, for example, at the time of the turbulent Supreme Soviet session deciding the future structure of the republic government. Saransk was then visited by Sergey Filatov, the president's administration chief, and Yuriy Yarov, deputy chairman of the government. Understandably, they did not approve of the Supreme Soviet's claims to supremacy, justifiably citing the federal constitution. They promised the tormented government of Valeriy Shvetsov, the fourth of this convocation, that Moscow officials would take political action in the event of undesirable developments. Regrettably, the winter session of the Supreme Soviet wiped out the powers of the executive branch, subordinating it completely to the representative branch and burying all hope of restoring the status quo of the Russian Constitution by parliamentary means. There was no reaction from Moscow, although Article 72 of the federal Basic Law stipulates that one of the areas under the joint jurisdiction of the Russian Federation and its members is the "establishment of common principles of the organization of government agencies and local self-rule." Now the Mordvinian members of parliament have gone even further. A day before the deadline for the registration of candidates for the State Assembly that was supposed to replace the Supreme Soviet, they suddenly cancelled the election scheduled for 5 June and rescheduled it for 27 November. They also issued a resolution which effectively restored the Soviet regime throughout the republic. All that was left was the trivial act of raising the red flag over the Palace of Soviets. The Council of Ministers is still resisting, but these forces are clearly unequal. The republic Constitutional Court could have acted as the arbiter, but it was abolished by the Supreme Soviet a couple of months ago for its autonomous behavior. According to Shvetsov and Valentin Konakov, the president's representative in the republic, it is time for the federal government to finally keep its promise. Otherwise, the "red noose" around Moscow will be pulled even tighter.
