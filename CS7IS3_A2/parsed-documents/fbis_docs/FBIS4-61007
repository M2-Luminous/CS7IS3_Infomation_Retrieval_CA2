With the details from Tbilisi is Nikolay Mamuashvili: [Mamuashvili] In his address, Shevardnadze wished all the people of the Republic a happy Easter Sunday. Addressing the people of the Tskhinval Rayon and Abkhazia, the head of state noted that he believed in the day when everyone would be able to return to the conflict zones and that Abkhazia and Tskhinval Rayon would be able to live a peaceful and calm life. I am profoundly convinced, Shevardnadze went on, that Christian morals will give us the right and the opportunity--together with the Abkhazians and the Ossetians--to heal our deep wounds and to live a peaceful life again. Regarding his recent visit to western Georgia, Shevardnadze said that he was happy with the changes he had seen in the region, which provide grounds to be confident about the Georgia of tomorrow. I have seen well-kept gardens, Shevardnadze said, and people working in the fields. Practically all enterprises in industrial Kutaisi have started working again. The highway to the mountains of Svanetia has opened. Everything is being done to ensure order in Adzharia, Kakhetia, and other regions of the country. In Shevardnadze's opinion, we are standing on the threshold of serious positive changes that will be beneficial to the Republic. In his speech, the head of the state also touched upon the question of forming a new Georgian national army, which, as he put it, needs not just bare enthusiasm but professionalism, order, and discipline. It is precisely this, Shevardnadze went on, that guided me when I proposed General Nabaidze to the post of Georgian defense minister, who has passed through a fine school in the Russian Army. The head of state stressed, I quote: The bitter experience of the past has proved that, without close contacts with Russia, we will be unable to create a full-blooded, normal army that, as in all countries of the world, should be the guarantor of democracy, peace, and stability.
