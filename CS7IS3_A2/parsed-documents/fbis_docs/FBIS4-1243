Mr Zwane said the building, which he could not identify, was "blown to bits". There was a fire raging and water pouring from it. Police had cordoned off the area, he said. "It's hell out here." Earlier people had jumped from the building, he said. Mr Zwane said he personally had moved three bodies and saw another two which seemed to be dead. "I think the blast was aimed at us," he said. This seemed to contradict earlier reports that the blast was outside the African National Congress' PWV regional offices at Lancet House. The ANC are in Jeppe Street, but the blast was in Bree Street, he said.
