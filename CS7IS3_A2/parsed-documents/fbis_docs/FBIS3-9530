Dederichs; place and date not given: "Punishing the Instigators"] [Text] [Dederichs] Will the agreement between the Croats and Bosnians finally bring peace for Bosnia? [Silajdzic] It is a very important step to ending the conflict between two peoples that have coexisted in an exemplary manner for centuries. The war has destroyed a great deal of confidence, but in the end we will have to live together. [Dederichs] Why was the agreement signed in Washington? [Silajdzic] The United States has made a decisive contribution. I hope that it will continue its efforts because the Europeans are currying favor with the Serbs and rewarding aggression by recognizing conquests. [Dederichs] Which Europeans? [Silajdzic] The appeasement started in London and was completed in Moscow. The Germans were ready to help but were not always consistent. Germany has provided valuable assistance for our refugees. [Dederichs] The European Union has demanded that the Bosnian Serbs should give up some of their territory. Is that not sufficient? [Silajdzic] The principle of not recognizing occupied territories remains hollow if it is not implemented everywhere. [Dederichs] The United Nations wants to prosecute the war criminals. [Silajdzic] Culprits from all the ethnic groups must be punished, not only the criminals but the instigators, too, those who are responsible for "ethnic cleansing." [Dederichs] Including the Serbian leaders Karadzic or Milosevic? [Silajdzic] They must also be punished! We all must face up to the truth, otherwise 1994 will be like 1939. A total of 16,000 children have been killed in the war in Bosnia. We know who is responsible.
