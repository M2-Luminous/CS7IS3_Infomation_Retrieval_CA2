FBIS4-33226 "drlat107_r_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-107 Daily Report 25 May 1994 Peru Central Bank's Support of Dollar Rate Detailed Central Bank's Support of Dollar Rate Detailed PY0306021194 Lima EL PERUANO in Spanish 25 May 94 p B1 PY0306021194 Lima EL PERUANO Spanish BFN [Text] Yesterday, Central Reserve Bank [BCR] President German Suarez reported that "to prevent the nominal exchange rate from dropping, $700 million has been bought from the black market so far this year, $300 million of which was for the executive branch, while the remaining $400 million was for the BCR." He added that the $400 million purchased by the BCR almost doubles the amount that was purchased last year, and that this means that the bank is always striving to improve the exchange rate parity, in order to avoid causing big losses to the export sector. Suarez noted that international reserves stand at approximately $4.6 billion, and that this amount includes the income of currency from the sale of Peruvian Telephone Company and National Telecommunications Enterprise. "If we exclude this operation, reserves stand at $3.2 billion," he said. During a brief explanation to the Budget Committee, which summoned Suarez and Economy Minister Jorge Camet to explain the targets that the Letter of Intent registered for their sector, the BCR president said the exchange rate lag stood at approximately 15 percent. He said that if the inflow of foreign capital for investment grows, the exchange rate lag could also grow. "Colombia and Argentina are experiencing the same foreign capital growth, and their exchange rate lag stands at 16 and 40 percent, respectively," he said. Legal Bank Reserves Concerning legal bank reserves, Suarez said additional reserves covering foreign currency deposits will not be reduced until confidence in the national currency improves. "Dollar deposits still account for 70 percent of bank deposits," he said. Concerning expectations over an exchange rate increase, Camet said the budget provided for an overestimated exchange rate of 2.7 new soles to the dollar for the end of the year. "The wisest figure was given by the BCR calculation, which indicated 2.43 new soles to the dollar at the end of the year," he emphasized. Economic analysts have said that the purchase of foreign currency by the BCR will have a slight effect this month because enterprises will need dollars in May to meet time-in-service compensation (CTS) requirements. As is known, most employees have chosen this type of dollar deposit.
