ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BAe 125&hyph;1000A series airplanes. This proposal would require modification of the galley feeder cables and toilet services fuse. This proposal is prompted by a report that the gauge size of the existing galley feeder cable is not compatible with the rating of the currently used toilet services fuse. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to ensure that the subject cables are compatible with the toilet services fuse in order prevent overheating of the cables, which could result in smoke and fire in the cabin.
