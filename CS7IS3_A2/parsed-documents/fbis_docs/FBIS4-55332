Zagreb--So far the Ministry of Administration has received most of the zupanija statutes. Of the 12 statutes analyzed to date, in the statute of the Istria Zupanija the ministry has identified many provisions in conflict with the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia and the law. As a result, implementation of that statute has been halted, and at the proposal of the Ministry of Administration, the government has initiated proceedings before the Constitutional Court to assess its constitutionality and legality. According to the words of Minister of Administration Davorin Mlakar, many provisions of the Istria Zupanija's statute regulate issues which, on the basis of the Constitution and the law, are only within the state's purview. Thus, Mlakar stated, that statute violates several laws, such as, for instance, the Law on Local Self-Government and Administration, the Law on the Areas of Zupanijas, Cities, and Municipalities, the Law on Health Care, the Law on Industrial Ownership, and other separate laws. "We believe that provisions of the Constitution have also been violated, and we therefore proposed to the government that proceedings be initiated before the Constitutional Court to assess the constitutionality and legality of the Istria Zupanija's statute. The specific result of our work is only that we have stopped that statute from being implemented, and that it is not possible to act in accordance with it, nor can general acts that would cite it be adopted. It is up to the Constitutional Court to adopt the final decision and say whether we were right or not," Mlakar said. Violated Regulations As an example of inconsistency with the Constitution and the laws, Minister Mlakar cited article 13 of the statute, which provides that the Istria Zupanija independently adopts regulations in specific legal areas. "That means, in other words, that it can adopt regulations in areas for which separate laws provide that they are to be adopted by the Assembly of the Republic of Croatia," Mlakar said. He explained that with the independent adoption of regulations, the Zupanija is establishing its jurisdiction in violation of the provisions of article 128 of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia and articles 13, 14, and 15 of the Law on Local Self-Government, as well as the provisions of the Law on Specifying Matters Within the Self-Governing Jurisdiction of Units of Local Self-Government and Administration. "That means that three fundamental regulations have been violated by that norm in the statute. Thus, for example, article 7 of the Law on Local Self-Government and Administration regulates the content of the zupanija statutes and states definitely what should be regulated by the zupanija statute, and no general act can go beyond that legal norm and remain consistent with the law," Mlakar emphasized. Next, he stated that contrary to the Constitution's provisions, article 13 of the Zupanija statute prescribed that the Zupanija independently adopts regulations governing the status of employed personnel. Specifically, article 54 of the Constitution prescribes the right to work and freedom of work as one of the economic, social, and cultural rights, and article 56 of the Constitution establishes that employees' rights to social security and insurance are regulated by law and a collective contract. That means, according to Mlakar, that employees' status anywhere, including in the Zupanija's bodies, is regulated solely by law and a collective contract. Use of Language Article 15 of the statute, which, as Mlakar stated, says that the Zupanija has decentralization as the principle of its own structure, and that it formulates administrative procedure on the basis of the principles of simple and public operation, is contrary to articles 18, 19, and 88 of the Croatian Constitution, since the Zupanija does not have the constitutional or legal right to formulate administrative procedure. "On the basis of the above-mentioned constitutional provisions, it is exclusively the Assembly's right, because the working methods of state bodies and units of local self-government can only be regulated by law," Minister Mlakar said. He also warned about article 16 of the statute, which establishes the possibility of changing the area and headquarters of the Istria Zupanija. "The areas and headquarters are determined by the Law on the Areas of Zupanijas, Cities, and Municipalities in the Republic of Croatia, and can only be changed in the manner prescribed by the law. That cannot be transferred by any means to a lower unit, or to lower general acts," Mlakar specified. He added that the statute also regulates the introduction of another language, in addition to Croatian, for official use. That right, by law, is only exercised by units of local self-government--municipalities, cities, and districts--which can decide in their general acts that a minority language can also be in official use, along with the Croatian language and the Latin alphabet. The Zupanija, Mlakar emphasized, does not have that right, because according to the Constitution and the laws it is a unit of local administration and self-government. Article 1 of the statute only cites precise provisions of the Constitution, and thus says that "The Istria Zupanija is a unity of local self-government and administration, within the framework of the united and indivisible Republic of Croatia." With the opposite order, which is not unimportant (because it should say "unit of local administration and self-government"), Mlakar pointed out that certain attributes of the state are also left out, because according to article 131 of the Constitution, the Republic of Croatia is a united, indivisible, democratic, and social-welfare state. Citizens' Rights The statute says that the Istria Zupanija is a unit of local self-government and administration of all of its citizens, and that the Zupanija protects the freedoms and rights of its citizens. That is a right that is only exercised by the state, Mlakar warned. "Only the Republic of Croatia has citizens, and units of local self-government, municipalities, and cities have residents. Consequently, zupanijas do not have their own citizens; they are exclusively citizens of the Republic of Croatia and it guarantees them all civil rights and freedoms and human rights. That is a right reserved for the state alone, and in comparison with other countries' constitutions, one can reach the same conclusion--it cannot be left to the units of local administration and self-government to protect citizens' rights and freedoms, because that could ultimately mean that they could be protected differently," Mlakar said. "We are not disputing a single one of those citizens' rights, and we are not questioning that part, but instead we are maintaining--and we have a basis for doing so in the Constitution and the laws--that these are rights that are exclusively within the state's purview. The state has specified by laws which form and part of legal regulations it will leave to the zupanijas, and which part the state, in order to guarantee the equality and rights of citizens before the law and the Constitution, will regulate uniformly for the entire territory of the Republic of Croatia," Minister Mlakar concluded.
