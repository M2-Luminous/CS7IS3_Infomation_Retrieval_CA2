It also demanded that the French Government secure and guarantee conditions for normal and safe work of the Yugoslav cultural centre, duly punish the perpetrators and prevent similar incidents against Yugoslav diplomatic and other offices in France from happening in the future. A group of French citizens and Moslem extremists, headed by notorious activists from Paris' political demimonde, stormed the Yugoslav cultural centre on Monday, threw out the personnel, vandalised the premises and occupied the premises. Police and the authorities reacted to the situation with less than desirable alacrity, allowing the vandals to use the centre for brutal anti-Serb and anti-Yugoslav propaganda. The Yugoslav Foreign Ministry conveyed to the French charge d'affaires its bitter resentment at the escalation of vandal attacks on Yugoslav offices in the city which boasts of being the world's cultural capital. Yugoslavia insisted that everything, including the property of the cultural centre, should be restored to the status quo ante. Special concern was expressed at the fact that the incident had happened despite warnings from the Yugoslav side that something of the kind might be in the offing and demands for adequate measures to be taken to protect the Yugoslav offices. Belgrade explained that assaults of this kind were encouraged by an unprecedented systematic anti-Serb and anti-Yugoslav campaign in the French media. The French diplomat expressed regret at the incident and said he would convey this in his (?note) to his government. The Yugoslav charge d'affaires in Paris too lodged a protest with the French Foreign Ministry on Monday over the deplorable incident.
