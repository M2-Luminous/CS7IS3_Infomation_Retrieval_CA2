Improve the investment environment and guide the direction of foreign investment. The following things are to be done in this area. The first thing is to formulate short-term and medium-term plans for using foreign capital, to strengthen the construction of urban infrastructure, to strengthen legislation of economic laws involving foreigners, to create conditions for treating foreign-invested enterprises like those run by local people, and to improve services for using foreign capital. The second thing is to guide foreign businessmen to focus their investment in infrastructure, basic industries, high-technology and new-technology industries, and the technical transformation of old enterprises, to encourage running export-oriented enterprises, and to run Sino-foreign joint ventures of railways, expressways, and power plants. The third thing is to absorb investment of transnational and well-known corporations. The fourth thing is to explore new forms of using foreign capital. Infrastructure projects are to try to follow the building-operation-transfer process in using foreign capital. The Beijing International Industry Consultancy Holdings Corporation is to be established to invite tenders and to introduce foreign capital. Listed share-holding enterprises are to be encouraged to issue B shares if conditions are available and the financial institutions concerned are to be encouraged to issue bonds abroad. The fifth is to use foreign capital to develop commerce and to strive to increase the number of projects selected for experimentation; to explore how to use foreign capital in monetary affairs, insurance, and financial companies; to attract major foreign corporations with powerful strength to make investment in real estate and to use foreign capital to develop tourism; to make use of foreign capital to set up professional and service organizations for consultancy, information, quality accreditation, and professional appraisal; and to run accounting, auditing, and law office joint ventures on a trial basis. 2. Deepen foreign trade reform, change the mechanism of enterprises, and move toward the modern enterprise system. State-owned enterprises for foreign economic relations and trade are to be reorganized according to the modern enterprise system. A municipal import, export, credit, trust and investment corporation is to be set up to manage and operate the state assets of economic and trade enterprises of the whole municipality and to ensure that the value of state assets is maintained. The work of projects selected for experiments on the system of listing shares of garment import and export companies is to be grasped firmly. In this year, one third of the foreign trade enterprises are to carry out reform and to institute the share-holding system, the limited liability company system, and the share-holding cooperation system. Restrictions on ownership are to be removed and a new pattern of foreign trade which takes state-owned foreign trade enterprises as the main body and incorporates the common development of various forms of ownership is to be formed gradually. Restrictions on the scale of operation are to be removed; the division of work according to specialities in the management of export commodities is to be abolished; and diversified management is to be extensively carried out, while import and export activities remain the major business. Finally, various kinds of large groups for foreign economic relations and trade are to be organized. 3. Develop resources to earn foreign exchange and change the structure for swapping foreign exchange. Barter trade is to be expanded; trade in technology is to be promoted; and trade in the service industry is to be developed with great efforts. 4. Develop overseas enterprises. Large enterprises and large groups are to be encouraged to develop their businesses abroad, and several influential transnational corporations are to be set up. 5. Carry out organizational reform with a view to strengthening macro regulation and control.
