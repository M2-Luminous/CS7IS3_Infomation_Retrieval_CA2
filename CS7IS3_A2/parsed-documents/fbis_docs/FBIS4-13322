FBIS4-13322 "drnes076dd_94006" FBIS-NES-94-076 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs Fatah: Ties With Hamas `Strategic,' `Crucial' Fatah: Ties With Hamas `Strategic,' `Crucial' TA1904152994 Jerusalem AL-QUDS in Arabic 18 Apr 94 pp 1, 19 TA1904152994 Jerusalem AL-QUDS Arabic BFN [Excerpts] Gaza -- Dhiyab al-Lawh, head of Fatah's media and educational department in Gaza, yesterday described the relationship between Fatah and Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] as strategic and crucial and something that cannot be disregarded or underestimated. He added that the current circumstances dictate that this relationship be special as well as more solid and harmonious than ever in order to close any loopholes that might arise in the future. In an exclusive statement to AL-QUDS, al-Lawh stressed that Fatah is looking forward to establishing cooperation with all forces present in the Palestinian arena -- not only with Hamas -- regardless of whether those forces reject or support the accord with Israel. Al-Lawh downplayed Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' warning against a rapprochement between Fatah and Hamas. He said: When we coordinate with Hamas we do not take into account what the Israelis say because this sort of coordination is an inter-Palestinian affair governed by the Palestinian people's supreme interests and not by the Israelis. On elections for an expected legislative council, al-Lawh said: They will be general elections in which everyone can participate, because it is this elected council that will form the Palestinian national government. [passage omitted] On the possibility that a security vacuum might be created between the Israeli withdrawal and the national authority's assumption of power, al-Lawh said: Now I cannot discuss the details of the Palestinian security forces' deployment. I can say, however, that the Palestinian leadership has taken all necessary precautions and made all the necessary preparations to provide security and safety for all Palestinians. It will not allow the creation of a security vacuum even for one minute.
