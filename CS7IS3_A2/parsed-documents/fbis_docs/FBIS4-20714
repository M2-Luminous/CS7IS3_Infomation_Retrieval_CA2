Even children were talking about it, asking questions, and welcoming the first drops of the showers that belatedly restored the hopes of many people. Today, right at mid-season, now that the die is cast and the major crop campaign is well under way, how are things, especially in the Bizerte area, one of the country's granaries? Based on current data, was there enough rain, shall we have a good grain harvest and enough fodder? Rain Deficit According to agriculture experts, the rainfall recorded in the Bizerte area from the beginning of the season until the end of last January reached the 244.4-mm mark; this represents a 36.6-percent deficit of 167.6 mm, because 418.45 mm of rain fell over the area during the season 1992-93. On the other hand, the number of rainy days decreased rather appreciably: 39 days compared with an average of 62 days for the period in question. In addition, on 21-23 January, the Bizerte area was far more affected than the rest of the country by violent winds exceeding 95 km per hour, an unusual rise in the maximum temperature (estimated at 5.3 degrees), and an estimated 98.4-percent increase of the water evaporation rate. Input and Seed: A Small But Real Gap The chemical fertilizer needs of the Bizerte area are estimated at 220,000 quintals of Ammonitre [ammonium nitrate fertilizer on plaster], 111,000 quintals of 45-percent phosphate, and 75,000 quintals of DAP [diammonium phosphate]. However, until 31 January, the quantities available were much below the above requirements, amounting to only 110,000 quintals of Ammonitre, 63,000 quintals of phosphate, and 59,000 quintals of DAP for the area--not including, of course, the stocks of the Tunisian Chemical Fertilizer Company, estimated at 9,200 quintals of Ammonitre and phosphate. As for the quantities of high-grade seed offered by distribution centers, as of 31 January 1994 they amounted to 18,947 quintals, whereas the program prepared by the general directorate of vegetable production mentioned a total of 26,000 quintals; the realization rate, therefore, is 72.9 percent. Note in addition that 17,521 quintals of choice seed had been distributed by 25 January 1994. All these data (bad weather and irregular supplies of agricultural input and choice seed) slightly affected the season's good progress for major crops, truck crops, and tree growers, eventually leaving unaffected only the potato crop--which actually benefitted from the balmy weather of December and January--and the bulk of truck crops. Major Crops: Wait and Hope During the 1993-94 season, an estimated 156,000 hectares [ha] were cultivated, compared with a projected 185,000 ha, hence an overall 84.6-percent realization rate. A little over one-half of this area (i.e., 88,265 ha) was devoted to grain (soft and hard wheat, barley, and triticale), i.e., 1,195 ha less than during the previous season; this, experts agree, is insignificant compared to the effect of late and inadequate rainfall. Concerning fodder, we can also say that the deficit is very small because about 48,500 ha in the area were planted in fodder crops this year (compared with projections of 55,500 ha and last season's figure of 50,470 ha), and since the State was able to make up for it by guaranteeing adequate barley and bran supplies to livestock breeders. On the other hand, legumes and industrial crops seem to have been most severely affected and set back by the inadequate rainfall: only 17,235 ha could be planted with legumes (compared with 29,890 ha in 1992-93), and 476 ha with industrial crops (compared with 2,705 ha last year). Similarly, tree growing programs were also affected by the weather, resulting in a relatively late start of the season; as of 31 January 1994, 120 ha had been planted in the area's common tree varieties (almond, apple, pear, plum, peach, pomegranate, and olive trees), whereas the 1993-94 program provided for 700 ha being planted with fruit trees. Potatoes: Record Results The potato crop, for its part, largely exceeded all previous averages, with 1,020 ha planted in late season, and early potatoes. This appreciable increase is due mostly to the latter variety, which takes up 420 ha this year, compared with a previous average of 280 ha. This is because of the higher temperatures that prevailed last December and January and because of profitable sales of main season's potatoes and the arrival of fall potatoes on the market. As far as the former variety is concerned, we should note that the acreage under cultivation amounts to 600 ha. Projected production amounts to 8,100 tons, or 15 tons per hectare with irrigation and 8 tons without; 85 percent of the crop was harvested and harvesting operations still go on. For the other early greenhouse vegetables, programs continue at a steady rate and 15.5 ha were already planted with peppers, tomatoes, strawberries, and cucumbers. We should also note that 2,800 ha were planted with various vegetables (including 690 ha just for artichokes) despite the relative lack of rainfall. However, agricultural departments estimate that this leaves a deficit of 32 percent for garlic, 46 percent for broad beans, and 33 percent for green onions. This being said, if all these figures seem somewhat pessimistic, we should still not jump to conclusions; just consider the considerable rainfall of the first two weeks of February and the rain that cannot fail to fall over the area and over the country (we fervently wish it will) next March, which will be worth its weight in gold for all agricultural varieties. At this stage in the season, the only possible conclusion is that, although it may not break records, the year will not be as bad as we might be inclined to believe. Isn't greenery already covering our land?
