Did Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl thank you for this nice election aid? [Tietmeyer] It has nothing to do with an election aid. But public reaction, including from the opposition, was mostly favorable. By the way, compared with the past, it was not an unusually large step. [DER SPIEGEL] It is unusual for the recent past. Despite the recession, you lowered the discount rate by a mere quarter percentage point several times. [Tietmeyer] Two factors were decisive for us. On the one hand, the stability prospects have clearly improved, and the German mark is strong. On the other hand, there was too much liquidity by the turn of the year, which increases the money supply. In addition, owing to the turmoil in international financial markets, investors were uncertain about the further course of long-term interest rates and waited with their investment. We believe that in this situation, lowering short-term interest rates could help promote the formation of capital. [DER SPIEGEL] The liquidity increase was a result of tax policy. Capital was deducted from investment funds because of the increase of the capital yields tax. [Tietmeyer] Right, tax policy changes initially inflated the money supply, and the stimulus for swift reinvestment in the capital market was small, given the relatively small difference between short- and long-term interest rates and the uncertainty I mentioned earlier. [DER SPIEGEL] Did the economic cycle play a role in your decision? [Tietmeyer] Of course, we always also consider the economic situation. However, we do not pursue an anticyclical policy, but a longer-term stability policy oriented at the money supply. [DER SPIEGEL] Nonetheless, the Bundesbank is the only institution able to move something regarding the cycle. Fiscal policy is blocked because of budget deficits. In this role, you can certainly make policy. [Tietmeyer] It is the Bundesbank's role to create stable conditions for growth. That is our task, and we think it is the best way to serve the economic cycle. [DER SPIEGEL] How do you assess the current cyclical situation? Officials in Bonn are already talking about recovery. The mood there seems to be much better than the situation. [Tietmeyer] Export orders have been increasing for some time now. Capacity utilization in German industry is increasing again, business expectations are clearly improving. These are important conditions for the second step of the classical German recovery pattern -- an increase in the domestic investment demand -- to follow. [DER SPIEGEL] Has recovery set in, or are these only initial signs? [Tietmeyer] The first step can be seen. Now we hope that the domestic investment demand will increase soon. [DER SPIEGEL] This is influenced by interest rates. Was this the reason you agreed to lower the interest rates substantially? [Tietmeyer] The real interest rates have been relatively low for some time, including long-term interest rates, which are particularly important for investment financing. On the monetary side, we do not see any obstacle to economic recovery. [DER SPIEGEL] Are commercial banks hindering recovery? They have been accused time and again of failing to pass on, or pass on in time, interest rate cuts. [Tietmeyer] In a highly competitive banking system, changes in refinancing conditions will be passed on -- regarding both debit and credit interest. Perhaps this could occasionally have been done faster. [DER SPIEGEL] When, for instance? [Tietmeyer] When we lowered our minimum reserves, it took some time for the markets to react. [DER SPIEGEL] We have the impression that you changed your opinion within two weeks. You said early in May that the danger of inflation was not yet banned, and therefore, the Bundesbank had to "proceed very carefully." [Tietmeyer] This impression is clearly wrong. There is no change in our argument. We also proceeded carefully at this time. [DER SPIEGEL] Your counterpart, Hans-Juergen Koebnick, the president of the Land Central Bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland, early this month called for clear interest rate cuts by at least half a percentage point. Did he and his group of supporters assert themselves in the Central Bank Council? [Tietmeyer] There are no groups in the Central Bank Council, but personages with independent minds. It is in the Central Bank Council that opinions are formed and decisions made. In this case, a Central Bank Council member announced his opinion in advance. I prefer such discussions being held within the Central Bank Council. [DER SPIEGEL] How much will the key interest rates have to be lowered for the cycle to accelerate? [Tietmeyer] Our recent decision has cleared the horizon for the next few months. [DER SPIEGEL] Until after the summer recess? [Tietmeyer] We are examining the situation continuously, but now we must wait and see how the monetary situation in our country is developing. [DER SPIEGEL] In recent months, you revised your interest rate decisions almost every month. In all these cases, the impression was promptly created that something had to be improved in this respect. [Tietmeyer] Revised and improved are not the correct terms. We took cautious steps. I cannot make a decision that applies indefinitely. We do think, however, that the state of affairs is quite acceptable in the foreseeable future. [DER SPIEGEL] The impression has been created that the Bundesbank is lacking orientation and fails to act on a long-term basis. [Tietmeyer] This impression is wrong and is not reflected in the reaction of the markets. The German mark has remained externally strong and has internally stabilized. The rate of inflation is decreasing. It is now important for us to get the money supply expansion under control. We had to abandon the high interest rate level, without creating new inflationary dangers, and without jeopardizing the German mark in proportion to other currencies. We had an interest rate advance over the United States of more than 6 percent. This lead has meanwhile decreased to approximately 1 percent, without the external value of the German mark having been jeopardized. I consider this a mark of confidence. The international markets have realized that the Bundesbank has not changed and will not change its course. [DER SPIEGEL] You personally contributed your share to create such uncertainty by publishing the money supply figure in January. It was thoughtless not to comment on the more than 20 percent expansion. As a result, the financial markets were plunged in turmoil. [Tietmeyer] The turmoil had begun a day earlier in the United States. Nonetheless, the January publication was by no means an excellent performance of the Bundesbank. [DER SPIEGEL] Will you keep to the money supply target in 1994? Your target is between 4 and 6 percent. In each of the first three months, you had two-digit growth rates. [Tietmeyer] We will see by the end of the year. As usual, we will review our annual target in the light of the information available in July. Even if we exceed our own annual target once, this does not automatically spell the danger of inflationary development. In the past, we also occasionally exceeded our target. It very much depends on how -- in the eighties, for instance -- the money supply grows over a medium-term period, and medium-term does not mean 12 months. [DER SPIEGEL] If it had happened just once; 1994 would be the third time in a row. [Tietmeyer] But the extent to which we missed the target differed considerably in each case. In addition, we had quite a number of special factors -- German unity, exchange rate turmoil, interventions, new tax laws, and so on. This substantially complicated a precise control of the money supply. [DER SPIEGEL] Would it then not have been better to at least suspend the money supply concept temporarily or find an entirely new concept? [Tietmeyer] Definitely not. Look at the results of other central banks in comparison with ours. As a general tendency, we have always had better results. However, the money supply is not a robot that could tell us in any given situation what to do. [DER SPIEGEL] Critics have accused the Bundesbank of giving priority to monetary stability for too long, regardless of the cycle at home and in the other EU [European Union] member states on which high interest rates were imposed. [Tietmeyer] We do not see price stability as an isolated factor. However, without restoring monetary stability in Germany, we can neither achieve longer term growth nor a longer term improvement in employment conditions. That is also important for Europe. Of course, we do not live on an island, but in an international community and must therefore consider well the repercussions of our policy on others. That is what we have done, even though one can always argue on the degree. However, I have heard no criticism of our policy from other European countries for some time now, and even less from my counterparts. [DER SPIEGEL] You were lucky to be able to lower the interest rates now. If the dollar were stronger, the Bundesbank could not ignore the increasing U.S. interest rates. [Tietmeyer] We always need a bit of good luck. But I think we have less a weak dollar than a stable German mark. Regarding the dollar, the situation is indisputably a specific one. On the one hand, this has something to do with the controversies between the United States and Japan, and on the other, with the discussion in the United States on whether or not there are longer term dangers of inflation. [DER SPIEGEL] Has the trade war between the United States and Japan shifted to the financial markets? Or can you explain the weakness of the dollar? [Tietmeyer] I do not have a complete explanation. But it also seems to have something to do with the reactions of Japanese investors. The situation in Japan tempts people increasingly to keep some of their old yen holdings, or reinvest them in the yen. In addition, much depends on how the dispute between Japan and the United States will continue. Over the longer term, the development of external balances is important. There is the continuing surplus in Japan and again an increasing deficit in the United States, whereas our deficit is gradually decreasing. This is apparently also reflected in the exchange rates. [DER SPIEGEL] You had to support the dollar again recently. Is new turmoil imminent in the international monetary system? [Tietmeyer] We all have an interest in quiet currency markets. Extreme fluctuations are never good. I do not think there will be monetary turmoil. [DER SPIEGEL] The U.S. Federal Reserve Board has increased interest rates once again. Does this mean that further interest rate cuts in Germany are blocked? [Tietmeyer] Our decisions depend above all on developments in our own country. Uncertainty in international markets has also interfered with the readiness for capital formation in Germany in recent months. The recent U.S. decision has now created welcome clarity. [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Tietmeyer, thank you for this interview.
