FR940922-0-00034 FR940922-0-00015 Comment: The number of properties nonprofits may purchase should be limited and based on the number they have completed successfully. (2) Response: Nonprofit organizations are currently eligible to purchase discounted properties based on differing pre-qualification standards. While the Department believes it would not be in its best interests to require a second approval, nonprofits not previously approved under another HUD program will generally be subject to requirements much like those used in the HOPE 3 program as a condition to purchasing properties at discounted prices. (See the HOPE 3 regulations at 24 CFR part 572.) In addition, the Department may specify a required minimum number of properties to be completed successfully, before the purchase of additional properties. Comment: In pricing HUD properties, appraisers should use distressed properties as comparables. (2) Response: HUD believes its procedure for pricing properties, regardless of their location, is a fair one. Appraisers utilize recent sales of comparable properties in similar condition, and HUD's listing price is reflective of the needed level of repairs. Comment: HUD should continue to provide lists of available properties. (2) Response: HUD's Field Offices are required by ยง291.110(a) to provide lists of properties available for direct purchase upon request. Where Field Offices have provided lists routinely, they have not been instructed to discontinue the practice, and some are continuing that practice. To eliminate unnecessary and duplicative work, however, some offices may elect to have the newspaper advertisement, where such advertising is used, also serve as official notification to the nonprofits and government agencies. In areas where newspapers are not used to advertise properties, other means must be used to notify nonprofits and government agencies of available properties in a timely manner. In those instances where properties being offered without FHA mortgage insurance are first made available to nonprofits and government agencies, Field Offices will continue to provide lists directly to those potential purchasers. The Department does not believe this practice creates a hardship on program participants. Comment: A process should be established for nonprofits to appeal Field Office decisions. (1) Response: The Department does not believe such a process is necessary and, in fact, could serve to undermine the authority vested in HUD's Field Offices. HUD headquarters will continue to oversee the program and to discuss issues with both the buyer community and its Field Offices in order to reach fair and appropriate decisions. The Department does not see the necessity of a formal appeal process to accomplish this. Comment: A means should be developed for low-income buyers to compete better with higher income owner-occupant purchasers. (1) Response: The Department believes that restricting sales only to buyers under a specific income limit could be viewed as discriminatory, unfair to other owner-occupant buyers, and not in the best interests of the Department or the FHA insurance fund, in its efforts to dispose of the inventory in a timely manner and at the maximum return to the insurance funds. Changes made in this final rule to give a priority purchase period to governmental agencies and nonprofits on certain properties will enhance the opportunity of low-income purchasers to acquire properties through programs sponsored by those agencies and organizations. Comment: Investors should not be allowed to purchase properties. (1) Response: The Department has significantly restricted the opportunity for investors to purchase. In the case of properties eligible for FHA mortgage insurance (those generally in better condition), owner-occupants (which includes nonprofits and government agencies) have first opportunity to purchase. For properties not eligible for FHA mortgage insurance, the nonprofits and government agencies have first opportunity to purchase, followed by other owner-occupant buyers, before being offered to all purchasers. It should be kept in mind that there will be certain properties, due to their physical condition, that will not be purchased by any owner-occupant purchaser, so it would not be in the best interests of the Department to eliminate totally the investor buyer from this program.
