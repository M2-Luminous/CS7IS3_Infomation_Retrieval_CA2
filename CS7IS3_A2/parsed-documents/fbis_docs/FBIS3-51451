Many persons played a part in this achievement, starting with the president, who initiated the legislation and without whose vision and decisive support the change would not have had any hope of success. I must reserve space here to comment on the substance of the law, but I would at least like to emphasize the fact that Minister of Labor Luis Fernando Ramirez, who actually authored the reform of the retirement system, won the admiration of the country by virtue of his mastery of the subject, his perseverance, calmness, and recognized effectiveness in promoting a proposal for which many had repeatedly given up hope this past year. Black marks will go on the records of the various obstructionist forces that were bent on throwing a monkey wrench into the works in order to halt the process or derail it. In some cases, the opposition was predictable for simple ideological reasons. For the historical record, however, it would be false to claim that the unions or most of Colombia's economists in the academic world played a positive role in the passage of this far-reaching reform. Unfortunately, the proposal did not come out of the test intact. Obviously, not all of the modifications in the government's original version could honestly be considered as "improvements," and several are inappropriate. Nevertheless, the real "guts" of the reform were saved. Beginning next year, Colombians will have an alternative to the traditional inefficient and excessive government monopoly over the administration of pensions. Fortunately, the idea of opponents of private pension funds of crippling them at birth by virtue of a "mixed" system in which Colombians opting for such funds would remain bound to the ISS for life failed to thrive. Although two pension systems will exist in the future--including the common pot--at least membership in either one will be exclusive. Unfortunately, a populist thrust in Congress altered the essence of the system of distribution by providing that the Treasury will cover any shortfall. The provision is so absurd, fiscally speaking, that workers would do well to foresee that once the inevitable cash deficit occurs in the system, the law may be modified to raise dues or cut benefits. With respect to the relationship between dues and benefits offered by the system of services provided, insufficient progress was made to guarantee that the system will be financially balanced. In addition, an absurd regressive subsidy was maintained, higher for persons in upper-income brackets than for those in the lower brackets. However, dues were at least increased, the minimum number of weeks of payment required for eligibility was raised, retirement ages were modified slightly, and a correction was made in the absurd current rule that a person retires with the wage he was paid for the last two years, an inexhaustible source of abuses. Any demagogue could argue that cutting benefits and increasing dues imply an improvement in the system, but I believe it is to insult the intelligence of Colombians to suggest that one can maintain a dreadful financial imbalance in the system of retirement without forcing workers having to pay the price in the end and, what is worse, doing so in a disorganized, traumatic fashion once the system has reached the crisis stage. Because the financial imbalance is reduced, the Colombian economy is now on a firmer footing and its possibilities of development have therefore improved. Henceforth, the system will begin to generate foreign exchange, resulting in substantial savings. The counterpart of these higher reserves will be more productive capital and an acceleration of economic development. The program contains two negative aspects that reflect the determination of some to block and obstruct in various ways the vigorous development of the pension funds, turning the "grand reform" into a "minireform" at all costs. One way is the exaggeratedly long transitional period provided for maintaining the existing system. The other is discrimination against workers who join the funds. Rules for the transition will practically exclude from these funds all women over the age of 35 and men over 40. With respect to discrimination, it was stubbornly established that workers in the lower-income brackets who transfer to the pension funds will be required to pay into them longer than they would into the ISS in order to be guaranteed a minimum pension. Nevertheless, despite the law's numerous requirements that are aimed at preventing the emergence of a strong pension fund system, I believe the funds will offer workers a far more attractive combination of profitability and service than what we have at present and that in the final analysis, the market will demonstrate its superiority. The future is upon us!
