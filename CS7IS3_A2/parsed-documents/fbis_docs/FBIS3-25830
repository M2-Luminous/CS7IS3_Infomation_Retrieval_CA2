Offical figures show that last year the province approved more than 10,000 overseas-funded firms, involving a total investment of more than nine billion U.S. dollars, doubling the figures for the previous year. Located in the Chang Jiang River Delta, a priority area of development in China, Jiangsu has been ranking first in total industrial and agricultural output value among all provinces in the country. A total of more than 18,000 overseas-funded firms have been established here by businesses from 85 countries and regions in the world. Statistics show that the scale of overseas investment has been on the rise. More than 700 foreign-invested projects have been capitalized with more than 10 million U.S. dollars each. Some 60 leading international companies from the United States, Japan and the Netherlands have made investment in Jiangsu. Meanwhile, in major cities like Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou 60 percent of the big state-owned enterprises have now introduced foreign investment. The areas where foreign investment went to have also been expanded. Officials from the provincial department in charge of investment affairs said that most of the overseas investment has been concentrated in the ten national development zones in the province. But all counties and almost every township have introduced overseas investment. Investment has poured into such fields as basic industries, infrastructures, the service sector and high technology. Since the beginning of the 1990s, foreign investors have shown great interest in the province's construction of highways, ports, bridges, airports and energy projects. The officials also noted that in recent years more and more Taiwanese businesses have invested in the province. Official statistics show that to date, the province has approved more than 3,800 firms with Taiwan investment, involving a total contractual funds of over four billion U.S. dollars. Big projects with at least 10 million U.S. dollars have exceeded 100.
