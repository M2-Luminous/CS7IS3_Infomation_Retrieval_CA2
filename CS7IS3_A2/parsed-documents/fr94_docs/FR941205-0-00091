FR941205-0-00091 FR941205-0-00024 32. We agree with NCTA that the provisions of the 1992 Cable Act may not be amended by the Commission through the rule making process. Further, contrary to CBA's interpretation of Section 614(h), satellite stations meet the definition of a local commercial television station, are full power stations pursuant to Section 614(h)(2)(F), and are generally not simply passive repeaters. We disagree with CBA's contention that Congress intended satellite stations to be treated differently from other full power stations when reviewing the statutory requirements an LPTV station must meet to gain must-carry status. Moran and CBA request that we codify the exception in footnote 217 to the qualification requirements of an LPTV station. While the Report and Order had suggested the possibility of additional circumstances in which LPTV carriage might be warranted, it now appears that this is an area where the specific statutory provisions and the balancing incorporated therein must necessarily guide our enforcement of the mandatory carriage provisions for LPTV stations. C. Manner of Carriage Provisions Applicable to Commercial and Noncommercial Stations 1. Content To Be Carried . 33. Section 614(b)(3)(A) and Section 615(g)(1) require cable operators to carry the primary video, accompanying audio, and line 21 closed caption transmission, in its entirety, of both qualified local commercial and NCE stations when fulfilling their must-carry obligations. With respect to qualified local commercial stations, cable operators also are required, to the extent technically feasible, to retransmit program-related material carried in the vertical blanking interval (VBI) or on subcarriers. Retransmission of other material in the VBI or other non-program-related material (including teletext and other subscription and advertiser-supported information services) is at the discretion of the operator. With respect to local qualified NCE stations, cable operators are required to transmit, to the extent technically feasible, program-related material carried in the VBI, or on subcarriers, that may be necessary for receipt of programming by handicapped persons or for educational or language purposes. Retransmission of other material in the VBI or on subcarriers is at the discretion of the operator. Cable operators may, where technically feasible and appropriate, remove ghost-cancelling information carried in a station's VBI if the cable operator applies an adequate alternative methodology at the headend. 34. In the Report and Order, we decided that the factors enumerated in WGN Continental Broadcasting, Co. vs. United Video Inc. (``WGN''), provide useful guidance for what constitutes program-related material. 16 We declined to further define ``program-related,'' noting that carriage of information in the VBI is rapidly evolving. As a result of our reliance on the approach followed in WGN for guidance, we rejected a proposal by A.C. Nielsen Company (``Nielsen'') to require program identification codes to be carried by a cable system. 16 In the Report and Order, we used a cite of 685 F.2d 218 (7th Cir. 1982), which was the original citation for the case, prior to rehearing. Upon rehearing, the court affirmed the factors on which we are relying. 35. The WGN case addressed the extent to which the copyright on a television program also included program material in the VBI of the signal. The WGN court set out three factors for making a copyright determination. First, the broadcaster must intend for the information in the VBI to be seen by the same viewers who are watching the video signal. Second, the VBI information must be available during the same interval of time as the video signal. Third, the VBI information must be an integral part of the program. The court accepted WGN's future programming schedules as an ``integral part of the program.'' The court in WGN held that if the information in the VBI is intended to be seen by the viewers who are watching the video signal, during the same interval of time as the video signal, and as an integral part of the program on the video signal, then the VBI and the video signal are one copyrighted expression and must both be carried if one is to be carried. While the court did not define an ``integral part of the program,'' the WGN VBI information not only included local news, but also contained future programming schedules for WGN, and the court upheld the VBI as one copyrightable expression with the video signal. 17 17 In an ex parte presentation, StarSight requested that the Commission determine that its product, which is transmitted in the VBI, meets the WGN test. We believe that such a request should not be resolved in the context of a rulemaking proceeding, but rather should be dealt with separately through the special relief process.
