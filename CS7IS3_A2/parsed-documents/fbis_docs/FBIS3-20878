Of 1,664 cooperatives, 229 face the threat of liquidation or bankruptcy. Nor is the situation of private banks any better; only foreign banks may be said to have no problems. A commission has begun work, its aim being the creation of a new banking law and a study of ways to counteract the crisis situation. Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz was born in 1952 in Warsaw. She is a graduate of the Department of Law and Administration of Warsaw University, a Ph.D. in legal theory, and a specialist in the area of banking law. She attended the Sorbonne for one year on a scholarship from the French Government. She was an adjunct professor at Warsaw University and at the Department of Canon Law at the Academy of Catholic Theology. In 1992, she was named director of Warsaw University's Institute of Law and National Economic Management. Earlier, beginning in 1989, she was the Sejm and Senate expert on public law affairs. From January to March 1992, she was the adviser to the director of the Analysis, Budget, and Finances Group of NIK [Supreme Board of Inspection]. The first time Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz stood before the Commission on Economic Policy and Finances was in December 1991. At that time, her candidacy was dismissed by both the commission and the Sejm. In March 1992, supported by President Walesa, she was accepted and took on the position of president of the National Bank of Poland. The first major decision she implemented in that position was beginning the process of liquidation of the Bank of Commerce and Trade in Katowice.
