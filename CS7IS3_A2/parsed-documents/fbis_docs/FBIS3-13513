Even though there is no uniformity between Iran and Iraq, it appears that the Clinton administration has been forced to adopt such a policy to extricate itself from its decisionmaking impasse. Speaking in favor of this policy, Clinton's adviser for Middle Eastern affairs, Martin Indyk, who is considered the formulator of the policy of dual containment and restriction, says: In the past our policy was to give one of the two countries, that is Iran and Iraq, greater preference over the other. We are now in a situation where we should learn a lesson from the past and should study and adopt a suitable strategic stance on the Persian Gulf. Reliance on the strength and capabilities of one of the two countries to restrict the other and to maintain a balance of power has proved to be an erroneous policy. Today, such an equilibrium can be satisfactory and in conformity with U.S. national interests if it restrains both the countries. Martin Indyk believes that the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the reduction of the political and military strength of Iran in the eight-year war with Iraq, and the direct presence of the United States in the Persian Gulf have created conditions that allow the United States to bring about a balance without Iran or Iraq having any direct intervention in the region. In his criticism of the policy of dual containment, U.S. political expert Graham Fowler has said that the aforementioned policy will not be beneficial. The United States tends to greatly exaggerate the dangers from Iran and the current U.S. policy needs to be reviewed and reappraised. Fowler says: At present we are confronted with an Islamic Republic in the Middle East, but in the future there will be more such republics and we cannot make any innovations in our policy that we cannot continue in the future. Our (U.S.) current policy is very shortsighted. According to Fowler, the formulation of a balanced policy in which there is a collection of friends and enemies is not a difficult task, but the balance of power in the aftermath of the Cold War needs assessment, study, and thought within the new framework. The United States should formulate its strategy in a manner in which the Persian Gulf countries can resolve their security issues without much dependence on that country and U.S. interests can be safeguarded. Fowler says that Iran and Iraq have policies that are different from those of the United States, and they are also different from one another in relation to their respective situations. Iraq is a country with unchanging policies, which have not evolved completely, and is being administered by a ruthless individual. However, Iran is a country undergoing change and freedom and abundance is evident. Therefore, it would be fallacious for the United States to adopt a uniform policy for both countries.
