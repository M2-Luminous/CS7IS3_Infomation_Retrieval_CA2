One Billion Operation "Balatum" -- coordinated by the central investigation department of the gendarmerie in association with national Magistrate Andre Van Doren -- succeeded in inspecting two fishing vessels 54 miles off the Belgian coast. "La Berceuse," which came back from Morocco and headed for Zeebrugge and "L'Orka," a small shrimp-fishing vessel, were boarded during a transshipment operation involving a large quantity, 10 tons, of hashish with a street value of 1 billion Belgian francs. Caught in the act, the crew of the two vessels, the head of the operation and 11 accomplices, were arrested and placed at the disposal of the examining judge of Bruges. [passage omitted] We can safely assume that all members of the organization's Belgian gang have been effectively taken out of circulation.
