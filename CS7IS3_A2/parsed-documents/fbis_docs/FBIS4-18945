Mr. Balladur is currently going through the same unpleasant experience. The leaders of the Forbidden City are past masters in the art of the snub, of contempt, provocation or -- even better -- a lack of conscience in international relations. Faced with leaders for whom foreign policy is no "gala dinner" but rests essentially on a relationship based on a power struggle, diplomatic subtleties barely count for anything. Nor is it merely a question of generously smiling, bowing and scraping, and making concessions in the hope of being paid back in return. It is more effective to gain respect by maintaining a coherent attitude that is firm when required, flexible when necessary, and -- above all -- by knowing one's dossiers inside out. It was obvious to anyone with even the slightest knowledge of China that Mr. Balladur was going to run up against the wall of human rights. The U.S. foreign secretary underwent the same bitter experience only recently. And yet this experience does not appear to have been in vain. New dissidents have been put behind bars, forcing the French prime minister, who had hoped -- wrongly as it turns out -- to limit the debate to a few generally worded formulations, to devote a large proportion of his time to that subject, at the expense of laying the groundwork for the "major contracts" so dearly sought following the normalization of relations last January. China has also placed Mr. Balladur in an untenable position in France, where both his "friends" and the opposition were awaiting his return without a kind word to say to him. Anyway, by publishing an interview with Jacques Chirac in THE PEOPLE'S DAILY NEWS one day after his arrival, Beijing clearly showed which candidate it is supporting for the presidential election in 1995. And it is not Mr. Balladur. China, that major new superpower and product of a new economic miracle, might have been expected to behave responsibly -- both in the international arena and at home, where the notion of freedoms that it defends is only distantly related to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The remarks made by one Chinese official regarding the individuals NEWSWEEK had reported as being condemned to death are enough to send a cold shiver down anyone's spine: "If the families do not claim their bodies, we will use them as fertilizer." However, diplomacy is merely the art of doing what is possible. And it might have been hoped that the visit by Mr. Balladur would take greater account of Chinese reality as it actually is, and less account of a China idealized by its sycophants and certain businessmen.
