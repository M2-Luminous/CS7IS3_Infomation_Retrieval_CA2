Latest reports say competition is growing to build up data banks for use by businesses, which have come closer to the recognition that a good corporate image helps their long-term interests in the information market. Latest statistics show that some 800 data banks have been established nationwide, compared with only a few score a decade ago. However, the information contained in most data bases is far from enough. On average, the 800 data banks each have 50,000 pieces of information, compared with 1.04 million pieces in 1989 in the United States. Li Yefu, president of Beijing-based MLS Information, a subsidiary of MLS Advertising and Planning Co, believes things are looking up. In an interview with Business Weekly last week, Li pledged to contribute to China's information sector and expressed confidence that it will build up its profile within a few years. Li said MLS Information completed a large data base early this month and is now making major efforts to promote it. The data base, containing information on more than 600,000 enterprises and institutions, is a rarity in the country. Basic information on all large and medium-size State enterprises and institutions and 3,000 foreign firms and organizations has been gathered. MLS Information spent two years gathering and processing the information with the help of a computerized system. To commercialize information in the data base, the company decided to open a telephone hot line on the 18th of every month to answer questions about enterprises and institutions in China. You Zhihai, a manager for MLS Information, said that on March 18, the first day of service, scores of phone calls were received. Li called the hot line a success, and said his firm plans to open several additional phone lines. ``We, like our customers, also need new information from feedback. And we need a good corporate image for our long-term interest,'' he said. The data base is to be updated every six months, You said. Li said that his firm will soon begin a market investigation called Business Cycle Survey of China. Li said he expects the survey, which is to be finished within a year, will help central government departments and State national industrial corporations to make policies and decisions. The firm will compile and publish pamphlets three times a month to provide information from the survey to enterprises and government departments. Questionnaires will be sent to some 30,000 enterprises. ``We expect 70 per cent of them to fill in the forms and send them back to us,'' Li said.
