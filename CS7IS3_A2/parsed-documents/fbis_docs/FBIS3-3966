The conference clearly and definitely pointed out that the basic tasks of China's agriculture and rural work this year are to work under Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building a socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line; seriously implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the October 1993 central rural work conference; stabilize the party's basic rural policies, deepen rural economic structure, and raise the comprehensive agricultural productivity; promote economic development, increase the incomes of peasants, and social stability in rural areas; and create a good economic environment and stable social environment to facilitate smooth proceeding of major reforms and bring about a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and Chinese president, and Li Peng, member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and premier, delivered important speeches at the meeting. Present at the meeting were other members of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Liu Huaqing and Hu Jintao. Zhu Rongji, also a member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau, presided over and addressed the meeting. Other attending were Ding Guangen, Li Lanqing, Li Tieying, Zou Jiahua, Chen Xitong, Jiang Chunyun, Qian Qichen, Wei Jianxing, Wen Jiabao, Ren Jianxin, Chi Haotian, Song Jian, Li Guixian, Chen Junsheng, Ismail Amat, Peng Peiyun, and Luo Gan; the principal people in charge of the party committees and governments of all provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, and cities with provincial-level economic decision-making authority; and people in charge of departments concerned under the CPC Central Committee and the State Council. The central topic for discussion at the meeting was arranging this year's agricultural production and rural work. The meeting called on party committees and government departments at all levels to further strengthen their leadership over agriculture and rural work, implement the policy measures put forward by last year's central rural work conference, and particularly pay attention to the production of grain, cotton and oil-bearing crops and to the "vegetable basket" project and strive for good agricultural harvests this year. In his speech, Jiang Zemin first discussed the emphasis of the party's work and present realities in rural areas. He explained the purposes of the conference and why it was being held less than six months after the last central rural work conference. He said: Agriculture and work in rural areas are very important to the implementation of the basic principles for this year's work set by the central committee, and to the good management of relations between reform, development and stability. This year is an important year in setting up a socialist market economic structure, because we are also carrying out reforms in finance, taxation, banking, investment, and foreign trade. The smooth implementation of reform needs a good economic environment and a stable social environment; and it especially needs stability and development of agriculture and the rural economy. The key to ensuring supplies and curbing inflation lies in doing a good job in grain and non-staple food production. Stability in rural areas and a strong agricultural base will ensure stability in the country, smooth reforms, and sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. Jiang Zemin said: The general situation in rural areas is good, but there are some relatively urgent problems, including a decline in grain output in south China, two consecutive years of reduction in cotton production, remarkable rises in the prices of non-staple foods, and the slow growth of peasants' incomes. In view of this, the central committee deems it necessary to make further arrangements for agriculture and rural work. In the second part of his speech Jiang Zemin explicitly defined the basic agricultural and rural tasks for 1994. He also stressed the need to concentrate on the following current tasks: First, we must ensure the production and supply of grain, cotton, oil-bearing crops, and vegetables. He said that with a population of nearly 1.2 billion people, China had to achieve self-sufficiency in grain and a basic balance between supply and demand. He called on all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government to conduct a careful investigation and analysis of the production and supply of grain in their respective areas, make a thorough check of current grain stockpiles in their granaries, and make plans to maintain grain growing acreage and to increase per-unit yields this year. Not only must major grain- producing areas do this, but developed coastal areas must also strive to stabilize their grain planting acreage, production, and stockpiles. It is necessary to deepen reform of the grain purchasing and marketing system and strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control to ensure that grain sources are under the control of the state. Cotton-producing areas should concentrate on cotton production. Suburban areas in large and medium cities should carry out the "vegetable basket" project successfully in order to guarantee the production and supply of non-staple food. It is necessary to carefully study and to solve, step by step, the problem of the widening gap between the prices of agricultural and industrial products so as to encourage farmers to grow grain and cotton. Second, it is necessary to develop all sectors of the rural economy to increase the income of farmers. Jiang Zemin said considerably increasing the income of farmers together with the development of production constitutes an important and difficult mission in China's agricultural and rural work this year. We must, therefore, give equal importance to increasing the income of farmers and ensuring an effective supply of farm produce. We must steadily and vigorously readjust the industrial setup in rural areas by developing farming which stresses high yields, high quality, and high efficiency and by developing a diversified economy as well as town and village enterprises on the basis of guaranteeing a steady increase in the output of grain, cotton, and other major farm produce. Third, it is necessary to maintain social stability in rural areas. Jiang Zemin called on leading cadres at all levels to work conscientiously in discharging their duties so as to promptly handle hot issues strongly reflected by the masses: -- Resolutely reduce the burden of farmers. Resolute measures should be taken to ensure that no one is allowed to continue collecting fees or charges which have been abolished by order of the central authorities; no one is allowed to continue increasing quotas, which have been abolished by order of the central authorities; this year no one is allowed to collect money from farmers, and any one who arbitrarily collects money from farmers will be made accountable; resolute measures must be taken to ban indiscriminate fund-raising, indiscriminate collection of fees or charges, and indiscriminate levying of fines. -- Effectively improve the comprehensive management of public security in rural areas. The principal party and government leaders in all areas should conscientiously assume responsibility to ensure security in rural areas by resolutely cracking down on criminal activities, improving the quality of judicial and public security personnel, strengthening discipline, and enforcing the law. -- Resolutely check unhealthy practices in the party and in society which the masses have strongly criticized. Effective measures should be taken to stop unhealthy practices such as feasting and wining, squandering public money, abusing power to carry out extortion, and indulging in boasting by making false reports, all of which have been strongly criticized by the masses. -- Conscientiously do a good job in assisting poor areas. It is necessary to mobilize and organize the masses in impoverished areas, disaster-stricken areas, and reservoir areas where the residents must be evacuated to free themselves from poverty and become better- off by developing production to help themselves. Jiang Zemin stressed the need to resolutely implement the principle of "grasping two links simultaneously and attaching importance to both" in order to maintain stability in rural areas. Fourth, it is necessary to strengthen basic-level organizations in rural areas. Particular attention should be focused on building party branches with the emphasis on selecting their secretaries, on building village committees with the emphasis on setting up a democratic management system, on building village collective economic organizations with the emphasis on serving peasant households in a better way, and on building youth, women's, and militia organizations. In the third part of his speech, Jiang Zemin focused on how to further strengthen the party's leadership over agriculture and rural work. He said whether we truly put agriculture at the top of the list in guiding our entire economic work is an important test of whether we truly regard economic construction as the central task. He urged party committees and governments at all levels to correctly handle the relationship between agricultural and industrial development, and, while ensuring sustained and steady agricultural growth, to decide an appropriate scale and speed for economic development and the proper percentages of funds for primary, secondary, and tertiary industries. He said China should ensure the needs of agricultural development even if it meant fewer projects were launched. Jiang Zemin stressed: We should unwaveringly carry out the policies and measures adopted by the party central committee and State Council on stepping up agricultural and rural work. Some policies and measures adopted last year have not been carried out. Central and local departments at all levels should take immediate action to inspect work at every level and carry out these policies and measures -- under no circumstances should we miss this opportunity. Jiang Zemin emphatically stressed: Party committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities must use a large portion of their energy on rural work, and prefectural and county party committees must put their efforts primarily into rural work. In particular, major leaders of party committees at all levels should personally get involved in and fully ensure that all rural work this year is properly carried out. We should use the performance of major leading cadres at all levels in agricultural and rural work as an important criterion for evaluating their overall performance. Party and government cadres at all levels should further improve their work style and method. After this meeting ends, major comrades in charge of the party committees and governments of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities should conduct in-depth investigations and studies in rural areas, listen with an open mind to the views and wishes of grass-roots cadres and the masses, gain a clear idea of how the policies and measures of the central authorities have been carried out, have a good understanding of the major problems in rural reform and development, and seek effective ways to solve these problems. Based on this, they should lay down a practical plan for this year's agricultural and rural work in their localities. In his speech, Li Peng first analyzed the current rural situation and explained the importance of doing good rural work this year. He said: The better the situation is, the more leading cadres at all levels should stay cool-headed. We should not relax for a moment in doing this year's rural work. Practice over the years has proved that whenever agriculture develops well and the rural situation is stable, the whole of society is comparatively stable and reform and development can be carried out in a comparatively smooth manner. China has a rural population of 900 million; it is the key to maintaining social stability. Agriculture affects the national economy and people's livelihood; the production and supply of agricultural products have direct effects on price stability; price stability, to a high degree, depends on whether the supply of agricultural products is ample. Li Peng stressed that leading cadres at all levels must have a clearer idea of the importance and urgency of this year's rural work, should firm up their confidence, overcome difficulties, and strive to reap a good agricultural harvest this year, especially of grain and cotton. Li Peng said: The major rural work for this year is: First, we should strive to ensure a steady agricultural growth and an effective supply of agricultural and sideline products; second, we should increase the incomes of peasants and strive to meet the average annual increase target set in the Eighth Five-Year Plan; third, we should properly solve acute problems in rural areas to ensure rural social stability. He said: To put it specifically, we should ensure success in our work in the following 10 areas: -- It is necessary to maintain the acreage available for grain, cotton and vegetable production. Stabilization of farmland is a basic condition for achieving the goals of stabilizing grain output, increasing cotton output, and enriching the "vegetable basket." In northern China, the grain growing area should be increased; in southern and coastal economic developed areas, the growing area for grain should be increased by a large proportion. We must maintain the availability of farmland for cotton and vegetable production this year, and the wanton use of vegetable gardens for other purposes should be strictly forbidden. When other use of a vegetable garden is unavoidable, we must create new vegetable gardens before existing vegetable gardens can be used for construction purposes. -- We must raise procurement prices for grain and cotton to whip up the enthusiasm of peasants for production. -- We must ensure the supply of agricultural means of production and control their prices. We should do a seriously good job in agricultural production, transportation, and the marketing of agricultural means of production; strengthen administration of the market for agricultural means of production and crack down on fake and shoddy products; and encourage direct procurement and sales between production enterprises and farm operators to reduce middle links and circulation costs. We must strictly control the prices of agricultural means of production. -- We must promote the use of agricultural science and technology, and strengthen the training of agricultural technicians. Counties and townships should stabilize organizations which promote agricultural science and technology, take effective measures to increase the number of agricultural technicians, and increase funding for the promotion of science and technology. We must also do a good job in developing education in rural areas. -- The state should control adequate grain sources. This is a basic condition for ensuring the supply of food grain to the market and keeping prices relatively stable. In addition to raising the procurement price of food grain and encouraging peasants to sell their products to state grain departments, the state should control wholesale markets and play a guiding role in the retail selling of food grain. We should continue to improve the grain market, establish a market system with emphasis on the wholesale market, advocate and support large-scale trade of food grain among various regions, and maintain the normal operation of urban and rural trade fairs. -- We must reform the procurement and marketing system for food grain and set up grain risk funds. We should establish an independent state adjustment center for grain reserves. The scale of the reserves should be maintained at an appropriate level to allow for prompt adjustment of the grain supply. Both the central authorities and localities should set up grain risk funds which should be included in the central and local budgets. -- We must increase investment in agriculture. We should increase the proportion of agriculture in state capital construction investment, state budgets, and loan funds. Starting this year, the rate of increase agricultural funds must not be lower than the rate of increase for revenue. We should seriously grasp the building of 500 key commercial grain counties and 100 fine cotton producing counties, and establish demonstration centers for efficient agricultural production with high yield and fine quality. -- We must promote continuous and sound development of village and town enterprises. In long-term development, we must rely on the development of village and town enterprises to raise income levels for peasants, shift surplus workers in rural areas, and reasonably settle "migrant workers." At present, we should guide village and town enterprises to improve their production structure, improve quality, and raise management levels and economic efficiency. We should encourage the development of village and town enterprises in concentrated and adjacent areas, leading to the development of towns and small cities. We should provide specific guidance for village and town enterprises in different areas and at different levels of development. We should encourage village and town enterprises in eastern coastal areas to further raise quality, expand the scale of production, and develop high-tech and export-oriented products. In central and western regions and minority areas, we should suit measures to local conditions, give full play to the advantages of local resources and labor force, and explore effective ways to speed up the development of village and town enterprises there. Increased State Council loans for village and town enterprises in central and western regions and minority areas must be guaranteed in both scale and amount. -- We must improve conditions for agricultural production and enhance the overall farming capability. Great efforts should be made to launch irrigation and water conservation projects to increase effective irrigation acreage. While striving to take drought-prevention measures, we should also make every preparation to prevent floods. We must persist in overall agricultural development and strive to improve low and medium yield farmland. We should accelerate afforestation and major ecological projects. -- We must properly solve hot issues in rural areas to maintain social stability there. Li Peng said emphatically: Now that the tasks and action for agricultural and rural economic development have been defined, the crucial point is how they should be carried out. He continued: Governments at all levels should carry out the responsibility system in their rural work. They should have a sense of urgency, enhance work efficiency, and conscientiously, responsibly, and actively implement these policies and measures. Li Peng reaffirmed: In supporting agricultural and rural economic development, the State Council as well as relevant ministries and commissions, should be responsible for the realization of any policies and measures introduced by the central authorities; local governments should resolutely carry out the measures adopted by them at the request of the central authorities; and local governments at all levels should guarantee to carry out the policies and measures formulated by themselves. Li Peng stressed: Governors of provinces (chairmen of autonomous regions and mayors of municipalities) should bear responsibility for the supply of grain and edible oil for areas under their jurisdiction. Mayors of large and medium cities should be responsible for the supply of non-staple foods. They should knuckle down to their duties in carrying out the "vegetable basket" project, which is listed as one of their job responsibilities. Their work performance should be checked annually and reported to the people's congress and to the people of their cities. The meeting pointed out that, under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the basic line of the CPC, party committees and governments at all levels as well as the State Council and all relevant departments, should work together with one will and conscientiously carry out the guiding spirit of this meeting, so as to achieve new success in this year's agricultural and rural economic work.
