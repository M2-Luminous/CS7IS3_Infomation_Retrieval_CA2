In this regard, the government is considering to use the budget allocated for this project in other projects, including the purchase of additional F-16s which is selected as the next-generation fighter. The government's policy is based on the judgment that the project lost its meaning because the actual upgrading work of the F-4E's has not been carried out properly up to now since the KPU project began six years ago in 1988 and the F-16's will soon be purchased and deployed in actual combat as the next-generation fighter. In addition, the technologies to be transferred from the United States were considerably reduced and the project is evaluated to be of little benefit to the development of the domestic aerospace industry. The KPU is an over 3 trillion-won project to upgrade some 40 F-4E's by the year 2010 at the cost of 80 billion won each. Two upgraded test aircraft are expected to be deployed in 1995. According to a high-ranking government official, the KPU was suspended because the F-16's, which have been selected as the next-generation fighter, will be delivered year by year and deployed from October 1994, thus, the reinforcement of Air Force capabilities will actually begin. A total of 120 F-16's will be delivered by 1999 at the cost of 3.9 trillion won. In the meantime, the government is studying ways to fully compensate Samsung Aerospace for the 14 billion-won investment it made for the KPU project.
