The arbitration committee is composed of seven international magistrates in charge of examining 58 appeals for the cancellation of the early 1993 legislative elections. These legislative elections, whose results after the first round were violently contested by the opposition in June and which led to a suspension of the vote, constitute one of the root causes of the political crisis that led to clashes between opposition militiamen and the presidential group in the southern suburbs of Brazzaville. After signing an agreement in Libreville last August which established the arbitration committee among other things, the elections resumed in October. In a communique, the opposition accused the presidential group of organizing "warlike pressure and violence against civilians in the southern suburbs," where "armored cars fired 65 shells on Sunday night," the statement said with no further details. For the opposition, these shellings are aimed at "destroying the bridge over River Djoue," which links the Brazzaville to the south of the country, and at preventing the southern suburbs from obtaining their provisions from the neighboring Pool Region. If this bridge is destroyed, "the opposition reserves the right to retaliate," the statement said, threatening to "attack local radio and television" and to block all "air traffic."
