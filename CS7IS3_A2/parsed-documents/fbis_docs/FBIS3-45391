The "Company Law" was the first to be promulgated: It was adopted at the end of 1993 and took effect on New Year's Day of 1994. Under the present situation where mainland China is bringing its economy into the orbit of a market economy, all this legislation is undoubted urgently needed by the country. It has been reported that in the next five years, the mainland plans to adopt 152 laws concerning such fields as the economy, justice, culture and education, and environmental protection. The most prominent of all is the economic legislations. Last 29 November, at the closing ceremony of the Fifth Session of the NPC [National People's Congress] Standing Committee, NPC Standing Committee Chairman Qiao Shi indicated that the NPC Standing Committee would continue to place the work of speeding up legislation, especially economic legislation, in a primary position; strive to enable legislative work to keep pace with reform; and use laws to guide, push forward, and guarantee reform. He said: The NPC Standing Committee should step up efforts and work out laws badly needed in such fields as finance, money, bonds, and securities. He stressed: After laws are promulgated, we must resolutely put them into practice, for a failure to put laws into effect means there is no law at all. As a result of China's feudal history of several thousand years, during which the emperors' imperial edicts were regarded as more authoritative than laws by local officials, an awareness of rule by law was relatively weak at both the higher and lower levels. It may be for this reason that stories about "Justice Bao [an imperial magistrate famous for his wisdom and fairness]" are so popular these days. Even today, some officials on the mainland often refuse to act according to the law and they are used to handling economic and social disputes with administrative means. Some cadres abuse their power and authority for private gain, or forget about their duties the moment they see an opportunity for making a profit. It is clear that such a situation would undoubtedly create obstacles and hidden dangers for the smooth operation of the market economy. As a matter of fact, during a period when the mainland is trying to change the operational pattern of its economy, a number of deeper contradictions in the economic field still remain unsolved, most state-owned enterprises are still plagued by losses, the rate of wage increases is falling behind inflation, many workers and staff are leading a relatively difficult life, and a number of social contradictions which have been triggered by inflation have added to those factors leading to social instability. Under such circumstances, a failure of government offices at all levels to act according to the law and to stop lawbreakers from fishing in troubled waters will probably lead to turbulence in the society. It is exactly based on this consideration that we need to put into practice the "bankruptcy law" and the "social insurance law" (including unemployment relief funds and pensions). Meanwhile, we need to work out and further perfect laws on building a clean administration and on the campaign against corruption to provide more powerful legal grounds for handing down effective punishments for corrupt officials and bribe takers. Free competition is allowed under a market economic system. However, due to different conditions and economic strengths enjoyed by state-owned enterprises, collective enterprises, privately run enterprises, and foreign-invested enterprises, a question has thus emerged on whether or not there is fair competition. The "Law Against Illegal Means of Competition," which was adopted by the mainland in October last year, filled this gap, thus providing favorable guarantees for all sides. With this law, all departments, enterprises, units, and individuals wishing to enter the market can neither enjoy privileges or monopolize the market, nor beat down their rivals by dumping products. The "law on foreign trade," which is to be promulgated this year, also carries clauses on drastically reducing import tariffs and preventing the dumping of foreign goods. The "Company Law," which took effect on New Year's Day of this year, mainly aims at establishing the status of companies as the main body in the market structure, standardizing the organizational structure and conduct of companies, enabling state-owned enterprises to carry out reform of their property rights and head for a corporate joint-stock system, and at finally setting up a modern enterprise system which regards the laws of the market as the main productive factor. Tian Jiyun, vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, has indicated that China should base its legislation "on its own national conditions and boldly assimilate and use for reference the accomplishments and experience of foreign countries in legislation." He noted that it has become the usual practice of all countries in the world to assimilate and use for reference the legislative experiences of other countries. He stressed that when adopting economic legislation, China should not, and sees no need to, start everything from the very beginning; instead, it can transplant to China from foreign countries laws that suit China's national conditions and which enjoy the common nature of a market economy. This is also a shortcut for China to accelerate its adoption of market economic legislation. The mainland probably plans to take such "shortcuts" when it adopts 152 new laws in the next five years.
