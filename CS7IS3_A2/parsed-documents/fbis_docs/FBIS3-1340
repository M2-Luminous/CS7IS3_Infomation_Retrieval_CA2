Among the key points being guarded were government buildings and fuel depots, as well as the police armoury. Striking public servants, including nurses and members of the Lebowa police, gathered and toyi-toyied [protest dancing] outside the main entrance to the government offices at Lebowakgomo. Lebowa Chief Minister Nelson Ramodike called on the South African Government to report personally to striking workers on why promotions and salary increases had been withheld, apparently a key factor behind the strike. The South African Government took over the financial administration of Lebowa in September 1993, following charges of maladministration and irregular promotions which led to serious cash-flow problems in the homeland. About 30,000 public servants are reported to be participating in the strike. Mr Ramodike said that since the SA Government had taken over the running of Lebowa's financial affairs, labour unrest had increased. He called the take-over a political ploy with a view to the election and earlier this week suggested the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] assume responsibility for Lebowa's finances. Late on Thursday, thousands of striking public servants waited at the homeland government buildings for members of the Transitional Executive Council to address them. A spokesperson for the public servants said the TEC was expected to arrive at Lebowakgomo on Thursday afternoon to discuss their problems. He said a full report regarding the issue of their promotions would be given to given to the TEC. The South African minister of regional and land affairs, Mr Andre Fourie, on Thursday denied allegations by Mr Ramodike that matters had worsened in Lebowa under his department's control. Mr Fourie said in a statement "maladministration and mismanagement were the trademarks of Mr Ramodike's administration and as chief executive, he is responsible for the lack of proper and responsible government in Lebowa". Regarding Mr Ramodike's statement that "the takeover and the subsequent reversal of promotions of the civil servants by Minister Andre Fourie had led to a series of strike and sit-ins that had the effect of disrupting services in the region", Mr Fourie said the civil servants themselves were to blame for salaries not yet being ready. "Due to the fact that civil servants have been striking most of the time and wasting the South African taxpayer's money, only to return to work at the time when salaries are being processed, I have given instructions that their salaries may only be processed after the claims of suppliers and contractors had been attended to," Mr Fourie said. He also claimed the civil service strike was directly responsible for pensions not being paid in Lebowa. He said the pension money was available at the banks, "but the officials responsible for the payment of pensions are on strike".
