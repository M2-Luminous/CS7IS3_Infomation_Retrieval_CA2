Boris Nikolayevich, you have said repeatedly that you are prepared to take account of the results of the election campaign - the elections which took place on 12 December - and the voters' mood in your domestic policy measures. Do you intend to make any adjustments in your foreign policy, particularly in relations with the United States? [Yeltsin] I believe that our relations with the United States are developing in a very stable, precisely coordinated fashion, and in a manner that truly befits partners. However, there will of course be a certain adjustment, especially with regard to the social sphere. We consider that, in contrast to Vancouver, we will not bank on the humanitarian sphere and direct social aid. That is our business. What we are asking the American side to do is to open up the American market, to lift restrictions, to help us with our debts, to assist in supporting reforms by helping with the conversion of military enterprises, and so on. We are not asking for direct social aid, because the people of the United States themselves need such social support. It would be simply frivolous to help with unemployment in Russia without guaranteeing employment in their own country. We think therefore that this is our affair, and from these forms of support, the restructuring of the debt, the structure of changes in the economy, we will begin to look for some kind of social guarantees for our working people in order to reduce poverty, the level of poverty that exists in our country today. [Gautness] Helen Gautnuss. Do you mean that you are going to retreat from shock therapy a little, to act slightly more moderately in order to help people? [Yeltsin] No, we shall continue to act in a resolute manner when it comes to reform, and in this respect the President of the United States is agreeable to support such a course. [Clinton] Could I respond just briefly to the last two questions from my perspective? I commend President Yeltsin for his adherence to continuing the path of economic reforms. If you look at 1993 as compared to 1992, if you consider to what extent the deficit was reduced as a percentage of gross income, if you consider how inflation fell and money stabilized, I think that very good progress has been made in work on including the Russian economy into the global economic system. We had very long talks about what can be done, what kind of assistance the United States could provide to recognize that there are certain difficulties connected with these changes, and to let the Russian people know that efforts are being made to solve these questions. But I also have to tell you that I believe that people (?will see the benefits) they could not see last year. This year, as investments and trade grow and people in the world see that the president is tackling this issue seriously, I think that advantages will be created. This is linked to developing a system of social support and job training, and all this should be created. I think that this will be a great help in many respects. In addition, I would like to say in response to your question that, in my view, President Yeltsin has been, it appears, criticized in some quarters for relations with America, the implication being that we are somehow trying to direct the course of Russian policy. This is not true. The people of Russia themselves should determine their future. The only thing I would like to do is to say that if we share common values, a vision of the future, dreams of political and economic freedom, and respect for neighboring countries, I would like to be an equal partner because I believe that this is a great country, and that the whole world -- and Europe in particular -- are interested in Russian reforms succeeding. So I must say that our relationships with Russia have been absolutely correct all this time, although some people are trying to characterize them wrongly. I have come here as a friend and partner. We have our own problems in the country, [passage indistinct]. We should be partners and Russia should determine its own future. [ITAR-TASS correspondent Sizov] I have a question to both presidents. During the Brussels visit the Russian president and the Russian side addressed NATO and the United States with a request to exert more influence on Ukraine over the issue of nuclear weapons. How far have Russia's hopes been justified with the signing of agreements just now at the talks which have taken place in Moscow with the president of Ukraine? Thank you. [Yeltsin] Well, I think our hopes have been justified extremely quickly. Today an agreement was signed with Ukraine on the destruction of all nuclear weapons in Ukraine and on their transportation to Russia to be destroyed there. Of course, as concerns the uranium, we should offer compensation and give fuel uranium for weapon-grade uranium. We agree with this, since we will also be processing weapon-grade uranium into fuel uranium with American help. Given that an agreement was signed today on uranium, I believe that today the agreement with Ukraine, the trilateral agreement signed by the three presidents, is a historic decision in which not only Russia but the United States, and U.S. President Bill Clinton personally, have played a major role. [Clinton] I am fully satisfied with this agreement. I want to compliment President Kravchuk again because I believe he has really shown great interest in obtaining security for his country, which has become stronger and which after this agreement will become stronger economically over the next years, due to the fact that investors will support this decision to be a non-nuclear state. Just like [passage indistinct] this was, after all, President Yeltsin's proposal that we establish this trilateral process. I have enjoyed working on this, we worked on it intensly, Vice President Gore worked on it, and of course our whole team worked on it. I assure you that I will personally continue to work on this intensly. I think that a strong and independent Ukraine is very important for the creation of an integrated Europe, which we are working on in our partnership. [Unidentified correspondent in English] A question for both presidents. President Yeltsin, you have undertaken today, and President Clinton has agreed, to encourage and continue economic reforms on a large scale, but time demands that institutions be created which can soften the effects of these reforms. The last elections showed that 15 percent of those elected support this policy. How can this policy be continued, bearing in mind the opposition there will be in parliament? President Clinton, without direct aid, what can international institutions do to help President Yeltsin? [Yeltsin] First of all I do not agree with your figures that 15 percent of Russians support the reforms; that is not true, absolutely not true. It is necesary to see how people voted for the Constitution. The Constitution is the support for the reforms, not individual personalities, not voting for individual parties and blocs, but voting for the Constitution which determines the future of Russia and its reform. This is where the citizens of Russia determined their choice, and that was around 60 percent. As regards support by world institutions: We talked about this. Incidentally we discussed about 30 or more issues -- internal issues, Russian ones, U.S. ones, bilateral relations, international relations, and so on, security issues -- a large spectrum of issues. And I believe that, of course, the fact that a package was adopted in Tokyo, and that unfortunately the G-7 has a very inert attitude toward implementing this decision -- this is the main thing. [sentence as heard] Bill Clinton has personally fulfilled his obligations, what he promised in Vancouver. He has practically handed over the first package -- 1.6 billion. The second package of approximately the same amount, which is passing through Congress, will also be provided in 1994 and 1995. As regards the pledges of the G-7, the seven countries, here unfortunately the situation is significantly more complicated. They made a decision, but there has only been minimum implementation. This pains me, and it also pains my friend, Bill Clinton. [Clinton] Let me respond to your question. I think it is important to tell you what we are doing. First of all, the agreement on uranium is extremely important. It guarantees a steady stream of commercial...[pauses] It is a business deal. It guarantees that money will be received each year for a long time to come. Now in addition to that, I have asked for $900 million in aid from the 1995 budget, and if you take that together with the 2.5 billion in the second package for all the republics of the former Soviet Union -- most of it will go to Russia -- there will be more than a billion dollars in aid in each of the next two years. In addition, we have reached agreement with the G-7 countries on a number of other things which I think will help as well. We are opening an office here headed by an American, a G-7 office to make sure that all the commitments involved are complied with. We are going to work toward trying to get the funds -- I am confident we will -- to Russia's energy customers, so that they can pay their bills for the energy that Russia is providing. It is a business deal that will give them a considerable amount of money. We offer technical assistance, all that the president has requested, and we are trying to help to provide for social services, [word indistinct] scenario, and the program for staff training in order to soften the negative consequences of reforms. This week we are again starting to allocate money [words indistinct] to the fund for the development of small enterprises. I would also like to stress that the willingness of President Yeltsin to continue along the path of economic reforms, it seems to me, is viewed positively by the international financial institutions. This will make it possible to free billions of dollars of assistance within the next couple of months for investments. Following Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown's visit in March, there will be a significant increase in trade and investments on the part of the United States. So we intend to work very hard on this. It seems to me that this will affect [word indistinct] the citizen of Russia. The point is that there is always a gap between the time when a decision is made and the time when people can actually feel the effect of this decision on their lives. This is exactly what I was trying to explain during my walkabout yesterday while shaking hands with Muscovites. All of us who care very much about the potential of this country and the greatness of this country must be interested in this. I think that all this will be felt in the life of the average Russian citizen. I think that this will have a significant effect in the next few years. [Unidentified correspondent] Vesti, Russian television. Millions of Russian viewers are watching us and smiling. Boris Nikolayevich, I have a question for you. Taking into account the composition of the new Russian Parliament, can one envisage certain problems with the ratification of agreements and accords signed with Western partners? It might be that the Parliament will toughen its foreign policy. Do you, as president of the Russian Federation, feel that the situation restricts and complicates your relations with the United States and its allies in the face of this fact? [Yeltsin] I do not think we have that sort of Parliament. This Parliament is wiser, more intellectual, and more experienced. I believe that the upper chamber will, generally speaking, pursue the line taken by the president and the Government, while the State Duma will gradually reach that position and realize that to drag out and fail to ratify major international treaties and agreements -- such as that concerning the destruction of chemical weapons and so on -- is simply to show disrespect for their own people. I also hope that the members of Parliament will remember, as I said in my message, that they are envoys of the people and that the people have told them how they ought to behave. They ought to conduct themselves with a high standard of political culture. Of course, our parliamentary system is young, but I believe nevertheless that it will operate constructively. [Bennett] Nancy Bennett from AP. President Clinton, what are your impressions after experiencing Moscow firsthand? What is your assessment of the threat the ultra-nationalist movement poses to the movement for democracy? [Clinton] Well, those who are in the Parliament are, after all, there as a result of democracy. I think these are two separate things, because you have to respect the democratic process and in every democratic process no one is satisfied with the outcome of all elections, I can tell you that. In that sense, I do not think they present a threat to the democratic process. Now I think what is happening here is that Russia, which is and has been a very great country for a very long time, is doing what countries are required to do at some point or other -- I mean redefining what greatness means and creating a vision for the future. When times are difficult, and the Russian people have been through some difficult times, there are always, in every age and time, people who can generate some support by defining greatness in terms of the past. But in the end, the only people who achieve real success are those who define greatness in terms of the future. That is why I believe that the reformist movement will prevail. If you look at the nature of the global economy, and if you look at the processes that move and change people's lives, I think history has always sided with the reformers. I also believe what would happen is that you can have some interesting discussions in that Duma, and I keenly follow the news at the moment. It is nice to be in a place where some other president is having problems with his parliament. [laughter] President Yeltsin has made an important point here: When these issues are discussed, and when you move from the rhetoric of the campaign, which is always abstract, to the real problems of real people, there is a possibility of a new consensus emerging. The only thing that I would say to all the people in this new Duma is that you have enormous opportunities and responsibility. You are the first ones in your country to be elected constitutionally and democratically. You must be ready to listen to Russia and to tackle issues. I would not think that America and other countries should dramatize it. I think it is a start of a great and exiting path, and we should wish you all the best and see what happens. [Moderator Kostikov] The protocol circumstances force us to reduce the time of the news conference. So, one last question each from the Russian and American sides. Go ahead, Markov, RIA-Novosti. [Markov] Vladimir Markov, Russian Information Agency-Novosti. I would like you to make your point of view, Boris Nikolayevich, and yours, President Clinton, more specific as regards the latest decisions of the NATO Council on the possible eventual entry of other states into the organization, particularly those that are contiguous with Russia. Do you see the possibility of Russia itself ever joining NATO, and on what terms? [Yeltsin] I think that the initiative of President Bill Clinton and some Europeans not to accept anyone into NATO country by country, but to declare everyone partners in order to preserve peace and security, is a good formula, since drawing one more line, dividing once again into black and white as the saying goes, is no good. It is another matter that the moment will come, at some time, when possibly both Russia and all the others will unite, but precisely together, in one packet as people say, and that will then ensure security for everyone. I am also against dismemberment one by one, and for that reason I very actively support the initiative of the U.S. President as regards Partnership for Peace. [Clinton] The whole idea behind the Partnership for Peace was to develop a post-Cold War mechanism for countries that share the same commitments -- in this case a commitment to respect the territorial borders of their neighbors, a commitment to civilian control over the military, a commitment to joint planning and training and military exercise -- that these countries could work together aiming towards eventual NATO membership, if they so wish, and if that is the direction that appears to be the best for security of the post-Cold War world. That is, NATO members clearly foresaw this possibility of such an expansion, but this Partnership for Peace is a real thing now, and even now we are inviting everyone, we have invited all the former Soviet republics, all the Warsaw Pact nations and the other non-NATO members in Europe, to be part of the Partnership for Peace. All were told that this would also lead to eventual membership in NATO, but our objective is to create for the first time in the history of nation states, an undivided, united Europe, united around political freedom, economic freedom, military cooperation and respect for one another's borders -- something that has never happened before. I think we share that vision, and I think that we have a particular responsibility to work towards that vision. [Moderator Kostikov] This will be the last question. Rita Braver, CBS. [Braver] President Clinton, did you discuss the subject of Bosnia and what was the nature of this discussion? Does President Yeltsin agree with NATO's stated intention of carrying out air strikes if the situation does not improve in Sarajevo and Bosnia? [Clinton] First I asked the NATO representatives, my NATO colleagues, to discuss this question with great precision. I want to describe with great precision what they voted for. They voted to reaffirm that air strikes could be considered if Sarajevo is in very great danger, in the sense that the United Nations is unable to work in Bosnia, if the United Nations is unable to work in Sarajevo, if there are no hospitals, if there is no humanitarian aid, medicines, and so on. They voted to ask the armed forces to consider what can be done on the basis of the air force in order to help the transfer of troops from Srebrenica and the opening of Tuzla for humanitarian aims. I would like to stress this because there is great understanding and a resolution directly aimed at creating a peace treaty for Bosnia. All of this is aimed at helping the UN mission and also to preserve people's lives until the sides conclude measures. I think that I should probably allow President Yeltsin to speak for himself about what NATO has done with regard to Bosnia. We have different points of view on Bosnia. Yesterday evening we discussed whether there is anything else our sides can do independently or together to put an end to this conflict; that is, we want people to stop killing each other and conclude a sensible peace under which they can live normally, even if just for their children's sake. We did not reach any final results. Quite a frank conversation took place and several things were said and I think that we can work together. A more detailed account may give rise to a central hope. I think that we had a very honest and frank conversation. [passage indistinct] It is very important because these air strikes have become a sort of psychological test. NATO enumerated three possible spheres of military actions. All of this aimed at helping the UN mission. This cannot, in the final analysis, resolve the conflict. The NATO leaders said that in the final analysis the sides must, themselves, reach agreement on this. President Yeltsin and I discussed whether we can do anything to help a possible decision. We reached no final results but a basis was created for further discussions. [Moderator Kostikov] Thank you, gentlemen, the news conference is over. Thank you. Goodbye. [Clinton] Boris said he agreed with my characterization of our conversation. [Yeltsin] If you are dissatisfied because I did not reply, well, in the first place, you put your question to President Clinton and not to me. But to touch on my opinion, then we really did have a discussion. There are some differences between us but, as I said in my speech, we are not in agreement on everything and everywhere. We really do have differences, but the most important thing is that there was goodwill, there was partnership to find common decisions, and I believe that we shall find common decisions. Thank you.
