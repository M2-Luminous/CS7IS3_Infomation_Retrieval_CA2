Commenting on Monday in an INTERFAX interview on the Russian leaders' statement on the need to prepare a memorandum, the Nizhniy Novgorod governor said in particular: "Maybe I am not on the right wavelength, but it seems to me it is a pointless exercise." "We have had similar memorandums before," B. Nemtsov went on. "Many roundtables were held in the President Hotel (in Moscow) in Khasbulatov's time and a memorandum of accord between the Supreme Soviet and the government was adopted, but, unfortunately, the political fate of these documents is well known." According to the governor, the historical value of these documents is "nugatory, because they possess neither legal, nor any other status making them binding."
