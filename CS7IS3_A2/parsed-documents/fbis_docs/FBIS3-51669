Spokesmen for the Colombian Association of Civilian Pilots (Acdac) have said, concerning the Barranquilla incident, two reconnaissance airplanes overflew the city's central zone for five hours, causing problems in commercial air operations entering and leaving the Atlantico Department capital. Meanwhile, the Colombian Defense Ministry and Air Force have confirmed joint operations with the United States DEA on the Caribbean coast. It was learned the military airplanes from Howard Air Force Base in Panama that overflew Barranquilla on 15 January were involved in control operations with other FAC [Colombian Air Force] aircraft. Air Force spokesmen have said the operations were executed at 22,000 feet for more than one week. Following these explanations, civilian pilots have agreed that these types of operations may take place, provided the control towers are notified of the aircraft's presence and positions. "We reject the fact the authorities, specially the FAC, do not require U.S. pilots to report their position and avoid creating chaos as it occurred 15 January in Barranquilla, when two reconnaissance airplanes overflew the city the entire day and only at dusk established contact with the control tower," said an Acdac pilot. Moreover, presidential candidate Ernesto Samper Pizano, currently on tour in Barranquilla, was visibly displeased and upset by the presence of U.S. airplanes on the northern coast. Samper has said he shares the people's views, because he considers as untimely this type of maneuvers in our territory. He has said President Cesar Gaviria's government should explain the military maneuvers executed 15 January near Barranquilla. Furthermore, Congressman Samuel Moreno Diaz, a member of the 6th Senate Commission, which is in charge of aeronautical affairs, has said this new incident proves once again there is no control or coordination between the Civil Aeronautics Board and the FAC in Colombia. He has said, generally speaking, the flight plans recorded for U.S. planes are false and a result of the flight crew's whim rather than the type of operation they are executing, thus endangering the lives of hundreds of passengers and--what is even sadder--violating our airspace, because Colombia lacks the organization to protect and exercise our sovereignty. "We have reported often that the FAC has no control whatsoever over our airspace, and what happens many times is that the flight controllers in most of the country's airports unsuccessfully try to contact the foreign planes, yet they have no flight plans, and no one really knows what they are doing in Colombian airspace," Senator Samuel Moreno has said.
