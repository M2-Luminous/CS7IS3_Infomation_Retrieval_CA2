The United Nations, the West, and NATO, which Croatia so wholeheartedly relied upon as allies to help it solve its greatest problem -- the reintegration of the occupied areas -- have shown their true face. Morally corrupt, cold-hearted, cynical, and incapable of preventing the tragedy of Gorazde, these Croatian allies have crossed the Rubicon of dignity and morals. Instead of responding to the latest Serb tricks, lies, and crimes with strong military pressure, these rich, powerful, and influential societies are openly discussing lifting the sanctions imposed on Belgrade. Those who believed that the West could not fall any lower after Vukovar, Sarajevo, or Bijeljina have seen that there is no end to the abyss. Croatia should find it indicative that lifting the sanctions is discussed by UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali as well as the Belgrade supporters in Moscow, and that even the U.S. Administration has been making completely confusing announcements regarding the issue. The fact that the Americans are prepared to consider lifting the sanctions if the Serbs withdraw from Gorazde and at least reduce the attacks in other parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina clearly shows that the West and the international community consider Croatia the least of their concerns. Not taking even the UN resolutions into consideration, Butrus-Ghali has shown that the peaceful reintegration of the occupied Croatian territories is not on the list of his political priorities. This is why Croatia can do nothing else but respond to this (un)expected development of events by taking the diplomatic steps that will prevent the jaded world power-wielders from leaving it alone with the problem, the solution for which they impose, but do nothing to implement. The lesson is bitter, but it is a good one, and we should hope that it has arrived on time.
