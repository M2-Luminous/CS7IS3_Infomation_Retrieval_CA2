At the meeting, they stressed that they share the view that the economic stability program is the guarantee of the future of Turkey's economy. They also determined that there is no liquidity problem in terms of either the Turkish lira or foreign exchange in the Turkish banking system. They decided to make the system liquidity permanent by means of measures to be determined by the Turkish Union of Banks and the Central Bank and to be carried out by all the banks that are members of the union. The participants at the meeting agreed that publishing the recent speculative and unfounded reports in connection with certain banks is, to say the least, immoral. They stressed that both the Treasury and Foreign Trade Undersecretariat and the banks concerned will take legal action in connection with these reports.
