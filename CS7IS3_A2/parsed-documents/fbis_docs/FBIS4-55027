"All diplomats and soldiers who have been objective and unbiased in their quest for peace in these parts have been branded as undesirables by the Muslims, who demanded their dismissal," Krajisnik said. He stressed: "It is certain that the Muslim government is backed and instigated by the United States in its demand for Akashi's removal." "To claim that Akashi has sided with the Serbs is an abhorrent lie," Krajisnik said. Although he is undoubtedly one of those responsible for the bombing of Serb positions around Gorazde, in our books he is not among those most responsible. That is why we are certainly not in favor of his dismissal, and I hope that this will not happen," Krajisnik said.
