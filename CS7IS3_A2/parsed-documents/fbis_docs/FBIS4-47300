Its three basic tasks are to detect objects (obstacles), to identify them, and to decode their encoded position. A telephoto camera with an optoelectronic receiver of semaphore lights feeds images to a detector (image converter). The latter sends signals to: 1. an object identifier followed by a semaphore lights color analyzer, 2. a stereorangefinder, 3. a path analyzer. A generator of brake activation signals, upon receiving signals from these three sources, transmits an output signal to the brake servomechanism. The stereorangefinder and the tracking device are interfaced, the latter sending signals to a light source for the road. In the stereorangefinder a right prism with mirror faces is placed symmetrically between two terminal reflectors of incident light. This prism combines the light coming from both reflectors into a single beam and sends that beam through an intensity regulator into an objective followed successively by a focus magnifier and a beam splitter. Two hoods, one around each reflector, prevent entry of sunlight or the headlight beam of a train into the system. The spectral sensitivity band of the system is 0.45-0.90 �m, which covers both visible and near infrared light so that the system can respond to semaphore lights of all three colors: green (0.51-0.55 �m) - yellow (0.57-0.59 �m) - red (0.62-0.78 �m) semaphore lights. Object-obstacle identification is based on geometrical characteristics. The color of a semaphore light is identified by spectral discrimination. The path analyzer has an autointerrogator with an exclusive-NOR gate, and a decoder followed successively by a comparator, a memory, and an autoresponder. Figures 4; references 3.
