Faced with the negative effects of deregulation and resistance by the bureaucracy, no bold policy is forthcoming. Bureaucratic opinions aside, the global market presses for deregulation. No budget progress is possible and there is no room for a choice. Why is deregulation necessary now? Why do the corporate managers seek deregulation in unison? Some cases are perceived of those who seek expansion of their vested interests and make self-centered contentions. However, there is an undercurrent of reverberating cries that seek a breakthrough in the serious blockage of Japan's economy. The present business recession is not as simple as portrayed by the optimistic view in the Economic White Paper as "relatively large in the postwar years." Unlike the Economic White Paper which incorrigibly forecasts a "recovery from the last half of FY93," the managers closely sense a potential for the worst recession in postwar years. Above all, they are troubled by an unprecedented lack of clarity. Conditions now are worse than the recession following the oil shocks. After the oil shocks, such measures as downsized management, massive and intensive exports, and strong budget actions were permitted. Today, however, due to the high yen resulting from the trade frictions of the past 20 years, exports are providing no relief. In addition to a holding balance of 190 trillion yen in national bonds, the fiscal situation with a drop of several trillion yen in tax revenues is at a standstill. If downsizing is pushed, a company's loss in volume means a personnel cut, and reduced investment will cause a contractile spiral that lowers macrobusiness. Moreover, financing which should support the struggling real economy has been hurt and has lost its leeway. The greatest change of all is the loss of confidence by the managers. The fighting spirit that faced the oil shocks and high-yen recession is now rarely seen. One reason is that the endurance of the high yen has reached its limit. The experience of mistakes during the bubble has dulled the edge of judgment. Amid these circumstances, it seems impossible to escape from the contractile spiral unless a modest market is created. Conditions to utilize the positive aspects of the high yen must be formed. The network of protective regulations formed to protect vested interests will then become merely "overheavy armor." Regardless of how highly efficient and splendid the armor, it is just a white elephant if the warriors who wear it cannot move in it. Japan's economy will choke to death without progress in deregulation. Although It Is a Small Step... The Hosokawa administration was forced to set forth deregulation as the centerpiece of an ad hoc economy policy, which inherently cannot serve as a business stimulus measure. It conversely exposed its do-nothing posture regarding the present fiscal impasse and the record low business level. Moreover, it has ended in half measures in its policy which should be based on a long-term vision of deregulation. The Hosokawa administration positions deregulation, its centerpice measure, as the "first step in reforming the economic structure." However, as far as the recently announced measure indicates, it continues to be a shortcut reappraisal under bureaucratic leadership, and not even a sense of its direction surfaces. Led by cabinet members who received repeated instructions from the Prime Minister's Residence, the targets of deregulation have increased from the original 60 items to 94 items. The prime minister himself reportedly stated that "we will not let deregulation end up according to the proposal by the bureaucrats." However, there was ultimately not a single item of bold deregulation. Chairman Shinji Shimizu of Life Corporation says: "Regulation means bureaucrats and, as long as the number of bureaucrats does not decrease, it is essentially impossible to expect the bureaucrats to deregulate. With the majority of the regulations essentially unnecessary, what is needed is not easing but abolition." Naturally, in this regard also, there was reportedly a fierce exchange between the bureaucrats, who basically do not wish to deregulate, and the prime minister's staff. Displeasure regarding the "cold attitude, considering our long acquaintance," was indicated by the bureaucracy also to Keidanren [Federation of Economic Organizations], which requested 30 supplemental items and threw the ball into the lap of the Prime Minister's Residence. There was also protest from the industrial organizations (which are under Keidanren's wing) that "we do not recall requesting deregulation to that extent." Ukehisa Iwakami, managing director of the Japan Department Stores Association, remarked about the recent measure as follows: "The trunk of the tree called regulation remains. Only a few branches and leaves were trimmed." That is because, after the conclusions and review directions on most of the 94 items were decided, they ended up as merely an array of deferred items. [passage omitted] Of course, there are some items that can be partially evaluated. For example, items excluded from the application of the antimonopoly act could be reevaluated by the end of FY95. Customs information could be displayed which has been kept secret in the past from the shippers, as if in spite, to protect the customs brokers. Also, the submission of value declarations on prices of duty-free commodities which accompany the payment of consumption taxes could be abolished. [pasage omitted] "Sanctuary" Remains Conversely, what did not surface in the recent deregulation measure may be considered important from the standpoint of understanding the lack of meaning and substance in Japan's regulations. For example, the Finance Ministry has stated that it will ease regulations concerning permits to listed large stores of more than 10,000 square meters in floor space that are engaged in sales of sake. Actually, notification regarding this already went out in July 1993 and, in this case, even if they receive permits, they will be unable to sell beer or sake for three years. Also, the majority of the medium-sized stores of less than 10,000 square meters in space are still unlicensed despite petitions by industry circles. For a supermarket to open for business, permits and licenses are said to be required on the basis of the Large-Scale Retail Store Law and 42 other laws, including the Liquor Tax Act. Daiei Inc. has made a prior trial accounting which indicates that, if permits and licenses are abolished, commodity prices will drop by 0.3 percent due to cost reductions. However, because it had already been decided to reappraise the Large-Scale Retail Store Law in late January 1994, it was included in the recent list, but its reappraisal is limited to reporting criteria for store-opening times and days of closure, with abolition not even considered. Furthermore, all of these regulations on distribution obstruct free entry and competition to excessively protect the established dealers. Regarding the problem of farm products, deregulation decided by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF] amounts merely to "flexibility regarding the bidding system for semirationed rice" and "promotion of new entry by rice retailers." Both are established directions and do not probe into the formation of a fair price market for semirationed rice or the problem of the Nokyo [Agricultural Cooperative Association], which has a monopoly on collection of cargo, distribution, and sales. For example, the "flexibility of semirationed rice" included in the recent deregulation is merely a study of the past regional distribution of listed rice on a prefectural basis, and the prevention of self-bidding on Nokyo-related wholesales, which has already been pointed out as a violation. Moreover, improvement is being deferred with the listed rice itself remaining at 25 percent of this year's semirationed rice, of which 75 percent is being transacted to the Zenno [National Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives] on a relative basis, and the price range is limited. Also, deregulation that coerces tied-in domestic-foreign sales to protect the domestic producers, such as exempting customs duties only for dealers who purchase domestic barley germ, indicates a deferment of all deregulation despite the wishes of industry circles, and protection of the "sanctuary." Regarding these circumstances, a person affiliated with the ruling coalition parties remarks: "It was said that, individually, farm products are not excepted, but the majority of the ruling parties themselves belong to the protectionist faction, and they are not acting in unison. The result was that a judgment was avoided." Another fact seen in the recent deregulation is that, in the same context as the 1985 Nakasone plan on the people's livelihood, the easing of the capacity ratio and the easing of municipal regulations indicate the surfacing of a deregulation policy based on emphasis on supply, with the wishes of industry circles and the politicians as the backdrop. Regarding the easing of the capacity ratio, there is still a discrepancy between the wishes of the industry circles and the government's view, which is oriented toward deregulation centered on housing. However, aside from the abolition of the surveillance areas where the role has already ended with the slump in land prices, the introduction of the incentive called the expansion of capacity ratio simply means that the outlook for deregulation itself is an anachronism. Amid the present office recession without an exit and the slump in land prices, the easing of the capacity ratio is nothing more than relief for established land brokers who bought up land and are suffering, and expectation of another bubble. The 1985 Nakasone plan for the people's livelihood, which began under the same economic conditions as the present conditions with an expansion of domestic demand and deregulation, pushed for the sale of government property and large-scale development with a supply theory as its slogan, opening the way for the rise of the bubble economy. It is now unrealistic to expect the return of such a dream. It is more important to conversely control the cities through downzoning and to expand the livelihood base. Expansion of rights is now totally unrelated to deregulation. Turning to a Debate on the Abolition of Principle We are not exactly unaware of why the recent deregulation remained extremely insufficient. When regulations are eased, the domestic-foreign price differential is reduced and new entries begin in the established domestic fields, and an extremely large deflationary effect appears. Instead, the erasure of domestic-foreign price differentials means the appearance of new suppliers despite the continuing supply surplus and plant-and-equipment surplus. For example, the U.S. machine tool industry is being dealt a devastating blow by imported products, and the same thing could happen in Japan if it takes the wrong approach. Despite arguments that it could be a plus for the consumers, such views would undoubtedly die down under conditions where unemployment continues to rise. According to computations by the Japan Research Institute, the total demand expansion effect of deregulation is 11.9 trillion yen, while the employment-creating effect will be an increase of 1.02 million workers. However, this is based on the calculation of 5.12 million newly employed workers versus 4.1 millison workers layed off due to the price fall. The new employment of 5 million workers is premised on the creation of consumer purchasing power with domestic/foreign price corrections (lower domestic prices). However, the new purchasing power could not immediately provide goods and services of corresponding quality and quantity. In contrast, there is a possiblity of quicker layoffs due to a domestic-foreign price correction. If there is a fear of such a mismatch, it will be extremely difficult to move toward deregulation. Moreover, as is clear from the requests by Keidanren, in terms of smoothly facilitating deregulation, the logic of the supply side is in the forefront. The Large-Scale Retail Store Law and the reappraisal of the capacity ratio are typical. Although deregulation equaling liberalization in the established fields is profitable for the consumers due to lower prices, in one aspect the world of the survival of the fittest expands. Only the share of the strong rises, but total employment does not. On the contrary, when the efficient and strong grow, the possibility is great for total employment to drop. The same result could be seen regarding elimination of the domestic-foreign price differential, which would equate to promotion of imports. Consequently, in order to really implement deregulation, it is necessary to combine it with the creation of a new market that absorbs the micro minuses. It is not possible to find a new market immediately. When it is found, everyone will have already moved into it. In more acccurate terms, it is futile to expect the bureaucrats to form a new market. A free market can only be born through trial and error. It means detachment from the conventional administrative approach of pushing development toward a designated model. Deregulation is therefore a kind of cultural revolution. On 18th of this month, Eiji Suzuki, adviser to Asahi Chemical Industry, and Iwao Nakatani, professor of Hitotsubashi University, presented an ad hoc proposal as follows. "Reexamine deregulation on a zero base. It is quicker to abolish the principles and conversely adopt a cumulative approach." This is indeed a revolutionary declaration against the bureaucracy-led economy. Certainly, regulations are not all bad. There are necessary regulations concerning such irreparable matters as life and health. By merely taking the cumulative and restructuring approach, it should be possible to eradicate the burdens of the economy considerably. However, it is not clear whether the awareness of the administration is being changed through what is perceived to be bit-by-bit deregulation. The number of permits and licenses issued by the government agencies by the end of March 1992 totaled 10,942. Although the necessity for deregulation was pointed out repeatedly on the basis of the 1985 Administrative Reform Council report, progress was slow and the number of items per se rose bynearly 1,000 items. Real Test To Come An executive of the Management and Coordination Agency said: "Although there is criticism that the majority of the deregulation items have appeared previously, it is significant that they have been taken up as a government measure. It means that it will absolutely be done." In other words, in order to move still further, it is necessary for politics to make decisions based on a long-term vision. Meanwhile, the private sector has also continued to depend on regulation, which equates to protection. A certain top manager does not hold great expectations when he says: "With coordination of the industry circles and rejection of entries from the outside left up to the government, they do not wish to be tainted themselves. Therefore, deregulations notwithstanding, there could not possibly be anything that will discomfort others or result in their own loss." In the first place, is it the aim of the current deregulation to correct the domestic-foreign price differential = expansion of imports = reduction of the trade surplus, or to dismantle the government-bureaucracy-industry alliance, or to improve the so-called low-productivity service industries, or to smooth business implementation for the established enterprises? A look at the 94 items gives an impression of a hodge-podge of those aims. Even the Hosokawa cabinet, which proclaims that "structural reform is a historical mission of the cabinet," does not display any long-term vision. It gathered a large number of bureaucratic old boys and formed the Hiraiwa council to draft a second Maekawa report, but debate has barely begun. Although it cannot avoid the agricultural problems from the standpoint of structural reform, there is still no consensus regarding the rice problem within the ruling coalition parties. After announcing an ad hoc measure, Minister Hiroshi Kumagai of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] said: "We were not able to delve into the heart of the problem." This was probably not a statement in reference to rice, but even an incumbent cabinet member is aware of the inadequacy. Jiro Ushio, chairmman of Ushio Inc., voices encouragement to the Hosokawa administration, saying: "It is not the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], which grew with regulation, but the non-LDP that can implement structural reform. The non-LDP is attempting to formulate a policy that is detached from the `zoku' Diet members." However, the details depend on future policy. It must be remembered that the structure--which nurtured industries with export competitiveness, provided profits as tax revenues, enabled the granting of subsidies, and maintained an extremely low unemployment rate compared to Europe and the United States--is no longer permitted within the global economy. If the external balance deteriorates, the form of support through fiscal action cannot be expected to expand beyond the present state. The argument to increase national bond issues is deep-rooted, but who will buy them? Assuming that we depend on fiscal investment funds, there is no guarantee that long-term interest rates will not jump up. In addition, fiscal freedom will inevitably and increasingly be lost due to interest payments. If we should look far for the causes, we will eventually arrive at the collapse of the Berlin wall. With the cold war over, we were no longer able to presume upon U.S. kindness. From that point on, our domestic "socialist domain," wherein the means of regulation = protection was maintained, probably ended. Amid this trend, a transition to a self-responsible economy that does not depend on the bureaucracy means deregulation. A rose-colored dream is by no means promised, but there is no path except this for the Hosokawa administration.
