FBIS4-14256 "drnes083_v_94001" FBIS-NES-94-083 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 Pakistan Foreign Minister on Nuclear, Economic Issues Foreign Minister on Nuclear, Economic Issues JN2704195694 Al-Shariqah AL-SHURUQ in Arabic 21-27 Apr 94 p 32-33 JN2704195694 Al-Shariqah AL-SHURUQ Arabic BFN [Interview with Foreign Minister Sardar Asif by Buthaynah Abu-'Ubayd; place and date not given] [Text] [Abu-'Ubayd] Recently, there has been an increase in the wave of criticism of the Benazir Bhutto government claiming that she has reembraced the old approach. This raises questions about the fate of the current government and its stability? [Asif] The internal situation in Pakistan is completely stable. Reports about tension have no truth whatsoever. The internal disturbances that take place are provoked by a neighboring state that always seeks to cause these disturbances to divert the attention of the Pakistani Government from its inhuman practices on its border. [Abu-'Ubayd] How true is the current talk in Islamabad about the possibility of the Pakistan Muslim League [PML] withdrawing from its alliance with the ruling Pakistan People's Party, against the background of widespread mismanagement? [Asif] I do not want to offend the Pakistani opposition. However, there is no real problem with the PML. These are only press headlines. The fact is my presence here is the best evidence of the continued alliance of the two parties. I am a member of the PML and I say the party coalition is permanent and stable. In addition, some religious parties, who posed as our enemies in the recent elections, have started to cooperate with the government. Take, for example, the Assembly of Islamic Clergy led by Maulana Fazlur Rahman. [Abu-'Ubayd] On the economic level, has the government fulfilled the promises it made in its election program? [Asif] We have succeeded in some aspects, particularly the economic aspects. When we arrived, the Pakistani treasury had only about three million [currency not specified] in hard currency. Now, we have two billion. We also got rid of the floating currency problem, which happened three times during the government of Nawaz Sharif. Also, the Karachi stock market is one of the world's five strongest markets. There is also a major plan for economic reform. However, before carrying out this plan, we must remove difficulties and obstacles and pave the way for such reforms. We are currently trying to avoid the mistakes of the previous government and stop the negative developments it has caused, such as the financial crisis suffered by the country. The IMF has agreed to give Pakistan $3 billion in aid. This shows the success of our new economic approach, which is also a subject of interest to world quarters. [Abu-'Ubayd] As soon as she assumed office, Benazir Bhutto called a halt to the policy of privatization adopted by her predecessor. Is there any plan to reintroduce this policy? [Asif] During the term of Nawaz Sharif, the system of privatization was used to serve the personal interests of a few people. The selling and ownership of government sectors was confined to an elite of his group. Consequently, the money and shares primarily went to people who are loyal to him, despite the fact that these sectors are owned by all the people. Therefore, we terminated and reviewed privatization in light of the new reform plan. We are now about to start it once again, but with caution and avoiding any corruption that might affect it. Within this context, we seek to attract investments and capital to invest in Pakistan, especially in the energy sector that yields guaranteed profit amounting to 33 percent. [Abu-'Ubayd] The rise of the recent government was surrounded by speculation regarding a retreat to Islamic fundamentalism. How true is this on the ground? [Asif] In the recent elections, the religious parties won only a few votes. There has been a large retreat in religious fundamentalism in the wake of the elections. It was clear to everybody that our people resent fundamentalism and extremism and support moderation and modern approaches. Our people think political parties can build a new Pakistan better than religious parties. [Abu-'Ubayd] What is the aim of the active Pakistani diplomatic moves toward Iran, including high-level visits recently? [Asif] You must be aware of the close relations between Iran and Pakistan. Iran is a friendly state. We have excellent relations with it but not at the expense of any other state. We attach great importance to the north and south of the Gulf. We are interested in stability in the Gulf as well as in the Indian sea [as published] region. The Gulf states host more than 1 million Pakistani nationals. We have important economic cooperation. We have special ties with the United Arab Emirates [UAE], in particular. The UAE participates in huge projects and has huge investments in Pakistan. It is also an important source of oil for Pakistan. Moreover, during my current visit to the UAE, I proposed to the brother UAE officials to hold joint naval maneuvers, as we have already done with Iran and Oman. This is an indication of our special relations with the UAE. Stemming from its good relations with both Iran and the UAE, Pakistan is prepared to play the role of mediator to resolve differences and the problem of the occupied islands, and end tension between the two, if we are asked to do so. [Abu-'Ubayd] Now that the bilateral talks between Pakistan and India on the Kashmir issue have stopped, how do you see relations between the two countries in light of the continuous border tension? [Asif] India does not want to resolve the Kashmir issue through negotiations. The Pakistani side has ascertained that India did not follow peaceful methods in this issue. Pakistan wants a peaceful solution based on UN resolutions. The situation is really serious. Any deviation from the peaceful path will definitely lead to war in which the possibility of nuclear escalation will increase. This prompted the United States to bring India and Pakistan to the negotiating table. Meanwhile, we will not remain silent on the mass violations of human rights in Kashmir. More than 500,000 Indian troops are deployed in Kashmir, spreading destruction and corruption on a daily basis. The situation there is more difficult than it is in Bosnia. We will be right if we call Kashmir the "Bosnia of Asia." [Abu-'Ubayd] Following U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Strobe Talbott's visit, you announced your conditional readiness to stop your nuclear program. Will this be in exchange for a U.S. aircraft deal? [Asif] Pakistan has never refused to sign an agreement to end the nuclear race in South Asia. We offered to agree to the U.S. proposals provided India agreed in the second round of negotiations and a solution was reached. [sentence as published] When an agreement is reached on a solution, we will be prepared to halt our nuclear programs in three stages, which will inevitably lead to some results. The first is immediate halt to the atomic project, the second is to return the program to its first stages, and then stop it altogether. I would like to assert that Pakistan does not possess a nuclear bomb. But Pakistan is a nuclear power and has the capability [al-salahiyah] to produce it at any time. When we reach agreement with India, we will stop the program completely. As for the F-16 plane deal, we made it clear to the Americans that it should not be linked to the nuclear question. The United States agreed to the deal in the past and we paid $650 [million] for 38 out of a total of 71 planes. The U.S. Congress's refusal to approve the deal following the Pressler Amendment is a U.S. problem. I am confident that the Clinton Administration is understanding, and that it is endeavoring to remove obstacles to approving the deal because of the differences it engendered in the U.S.-Pakistani relations. [Abu-'Ubayd] What about your agreement to allow inspection of your nuclear facilities? [Asif] The Americans presented technical proposals on inspection to ascertain that we do not possess the bomb. After we study these proposals, we will consider whether or not we will allow them to monitor.
