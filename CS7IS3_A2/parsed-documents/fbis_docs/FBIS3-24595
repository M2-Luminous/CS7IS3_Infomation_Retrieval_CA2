The new enzymes were found to be free of interfering impurities. The endonuclease R Bli7361 recognizes the DNA sequence 5'-GGTCTCN1-3'[downward arrow-pointing] and 3'-CCAGAG5N-5'[upward-pointing arrow] and cleaves it, as indicated by the arrows, at a distance of 1 and 5 nucleotides from the recognized sequence to form single-strand 4-nucleotide 5'-protruding termini. This new endonuclease is thus an isoschizomer of Eco31I, PpaI, and BsaI. The isolation of MBli736I was hailed as opening the possibility of studying the nature of the methylation of the enzyme site recognized by it. Several possible applications of the new enzymes were discussed: (1) using R Bli7361 with the DNA of the plasmid pBR322, which has only one site for this restrictase that is located in the gene of resistance to ampicillin, in order to cleave the molecule and thus permit radioactive labeling that would in turn facilitate more precise restriction mapping (by Smith and Bernstiel's method) of DNA fragments integrated at the PstI site; (2) using Bli7361 with the DNA of the phage _l_ for selective labeling of terminals by using a Klenow fragment as an alternative to using labeled oligonucleotides complementary to the natural ``adhesive'' terminals of the DNA of the phage _l_ in ``cos''-mapping of recombinant phages; (3) using Bli7361 to create selective ``holders'' for site-specific mutagenesis or to create vectors for directed unilateral shortening of integrated fragments and to create ``restoring'' and ``multiplication'' vectors. The promise of using the new restrictase to create ``restoring'' vectors was given special attention. Specifically, it was stated that because the phage M13mp18 does not contain sites for Bli7361, taking two oppositely directed sites for Bli7361 that have a GC-dinucleotide between them and introducing them into a polylinker sequence will result in the creation of a site for the ``blunt-ended'' restrictase NruI, for which there is no site in the vector either. This NruI site may then be used to clone chemically synthesized oligonucleotides for the purpose of subsequently assembling a whole gene in a single ligation reaction from oligonucleotides cut from recombinant DNA by using Bli7361.
