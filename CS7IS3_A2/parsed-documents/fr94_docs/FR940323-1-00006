SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On April 16, 1993, EPA published the proposed Water Quality Guidance for the Great Lakes System in the Federal Register (58 FR 20802). The period for receiving public comments on the proposal closed on September 13, 1993. Subsequently, EPA announced the availability of three additional reports that EPA is considering as it develops the final Guidance (August 9, 1993, 58 FR 42266; September 13, 1993, 58 FR 47845). The period for receiving comments on issues raised in the three reports closed on October 13, 1993. The preamble to the April 16, 1993, proposal described EPA's intent to hold an open public meeting to provide an opportunity to members of the public who wish to express views on the written comments of other parties submitted during the public comment period (58 FR 20823). This meeting will be held on April 26, 1994, at the time and address shown above. Interested parties are welcome to attend the meeting to present their views. All comments received in the public hearing held August 4 and 5, 1993, and all written comments received during the public comment periods that closed September 13, 1993, and October 13, 1993, will be considered by the Agency in the final rulemaking. The April 26, 1994, meeting is intended to provide an opportunity for those parties who wish to comment on issues raised by other commenters contained in the public docket for the rulemaking. Therefore, interested parties who provided comments on the proposal should not, and do not need to, restate their views at the April 26, 1994, meeting. The public meeting may also include separate concurrent sessions on the elements of the proposed Guidance in order to facilitate the anticipated number of commenters and issues. For further information on the meeting, you may contact the persons identified above. EPA also invites elected officials and other representatives of State, local, and Tribal governments to attend the meeting. EPA encourages such participation, in accordance with Executive Order 12875, Enhancing the Intergovernmental Partnership, issued October 26, 1993 (58 FR 58093).
