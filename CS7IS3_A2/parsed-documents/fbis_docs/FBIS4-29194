The politically sensitive surplus with the United States, however, continued to rise. The overall customs-cleared trade surplus fell an unadjusted 15.9 percent to 6.54 billion dollars, scoring a double-digit fall for the first time since December 1991, the ministry said in a preliminary report. Imports rose 12.3 percent to 21.54 billion dollars, and exports gained 4.2 percent to 28.07 billion dollars. A ministry official, briefing reporters, said import volume rose sharply on the yen's rise, citing the 16.1 point rise in the trade index for import volume. Regarding the effect of the yen's rise on exports, he said the index for export volume fell 2.5 points to post the fourth straight decline, but the price index was at 7.0 points to inflate the export value. In yen terms, the trade surplus fell 21.6 percent to mark the fourth consecutive decline, with exports falling 3.0 percent and imports rising 4.5 percent. The dollar averaged 103.17 yen in the latest reporting month, down 7.4 percent from 110.85 yen the preceding year. The official noted a special factor involving the "Golden Week" holidays in early May that were longer than in the previous year. Companies increased their exports in late April ahead of the holidays to prevent any gaps in covering foreign orders. But he said this alone would not lead to such sharp declines in the overall surplus. Masaru Takagi, chief economist at Fuji Research Institute, cited a lot of information indicated in May. The May figures are insufficient to judge that the overall trade gap turned firmly lower due to holiday factors, he said. "But we must take note of the increases in import volume," Takagi said, adding that imports are increasing despite ongoing sluggish domestic demand, and that Japanese manufacturers are indeed facing tough price competition from cheaper imports in the unchanged market pie. Meanwhile, the surplus with the U.S. remained higher in reflecting lingering trade disputes, he said, adding that the dollar is unlikely to fall against the yen against this backdrop. Japan's trade surplus with the U.S. rose 7.5 percent from a year earlier to 3.04 billion dollars, the third consecutive monthly gain, the ministry said. As for other major nations, the surplus with the European union fell 31.5 percent to 1.34 billion dollars for the fifth straight decline, and the surplus with other Asian nations edged 0.5 percent lower to 4.03 billion dollars after rising for 24 straight months. Takagi traced the lower surplus with Asia to increased imports of cheaper products, led by clothing from China, that more than offset a relatively healthy increase in exports. In fact, imports of clothing posted a strong rise in May, gaining 26.9 percent from the previous year. Among other major import gainers were office equipment, up 46.9 percent, and semiconductor and other electronics parts, up 39.2 percent. Imports for crude oil fell 14.8 percent although the import volume rose 4.6 percent, stemming from lower prices that averaged 15.39 dollars, down 18.5 percent from 18.88 dollars. As for major export gainers, semiconductor and other electronics parts rose 30.2 percent, and engines and motors increased 21.9 percent. Exports for audiovisual equipment fell 22.3 percent, and those for automobiles dropped 11.7 percent.
