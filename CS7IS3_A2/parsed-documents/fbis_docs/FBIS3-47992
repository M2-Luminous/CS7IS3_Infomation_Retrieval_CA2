The ministry has also decided to push a future-oriented defense policy in anticipation of a unified Korea in the 21st century while designating "five large military reform tasks" to respond to President Kim Yong-sam's call for reform and the creation of a new Korea. The decisions are outlined in the ministry's report on its programs for 1994, submitted Thursday by Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae to President Kim Yong-sam at a conference room of the Ministry. Yi said that North Korea completed preparations for war in 1993 and designated 1995 as the year for unification of the country. Therefore, if the nuclear issue runs into a dead-end in 1994-95 or the Kim Il-song regime is threatened, North Korea could attempt a military provocation in order to find a way out. Against tension being built up by North Korea in connection with the nuclear issue, Yi said, South Korea is maintaining standby measures in close coordination with the United States. South Korea and the United States have a solid joint defense posture against any kind of North Korean armed provocation since the United States has worked out a new military strategy, Yi told the president. Moreover, the ministry, taking possible security situations in the 21st century into consideration, is promoting equidistant and cooperative relations with China, Japan, and Russia, Yi said. In addition, the ministry will try to reorganize and transform South Korea's military from a manpower-based force into a technology-intensive and quality force by strengthening military technological education, Yi said. He said the ministry will continue to carry out reform while internationalizing and globalizing national defense policy. After receiving the report, President Kim instructed ministry officials to effectively manage the nation's defense resources and train all military personnel so that they can ensure a scientific management of the military force in the future. "In order to do this, the ministry should develop new personnel management and undertake a systematic training program," Kim said. Kim also urged the ministry to continue self-cleansing efforts to be reborn as a new military and undertake mesures to keep "the transparency" of defense projects and their effectiveness. Following the report, Kim had lunch with senior military officers. The president noted some concern that public opinion is sharply critical of the military because of a number of irregularities exposed in recent months. The military has impressed the public deeply with the selfless dedication and sacrifice it demonstrated in a couple of disasters -- the Asiana jetliner crash near Mokpo, South Cholla Province, and the sinking of the Sohae-ho ferry in the West Sea, off Kunsan. The entire military should not be judged on the basis of a few irregularities committed by a very limited number of people, Kim said.
