It occurred near Ilicha Avenue, one of the city's central thoroughfares. The Donetsk Internal Affairs Administration later disarmed an installation made of five antitank grenade launchers assembled on a truck and prepared for launching. The previous evening in an alley near the Donetsk wine plant, some boys came across an old abandoned GAZ-51 with a cover over its bed. The network of wires on it looked suspicious, so they called the militia. The militia arrived immediately and established that the grenade launchers were aimed at a residential building located 300 meters away. The installation was rigged with imported automatic instruments and remote-controlled devices permitting it to be operated from a distance of 150 meters.
