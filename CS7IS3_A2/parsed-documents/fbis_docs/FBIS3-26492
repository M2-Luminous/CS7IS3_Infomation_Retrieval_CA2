He recently officiated at several important economic meetings and visited several places to learn about the situations there. He bluntly expressed his dissatisfaction with the overheated property development, the slow pace in bringing order out of chaos in the financial market, and the excessive scale of investment. He demanded that cadres in all localities continue to follow the red-letterhead document on strengthening macroeconomic control and act according to their capacity by resolutely suspending or delaying the construction of a number of projects. He was angry with officials in various sectors having their own way and "refusing to safeguard the authority of the central government." He was furious with Guangdong and other provinces for resisting the central decision to impose the value-added land tax. In the first half of this year, he will take strong measures to tighten up on investment and loans, cool down the overheated property market, and bring down inflation. According to Beijing economic circles, while Zhu, who was promoted by Deng Xiaoping, favored the call to "seize the favorable opportunity to speed up economic development," he kept a wary eye on the possibility that local economic growth would endanger the macroeconomic control exercised by the central government. He believed the central government must have abundant funds at its command before it can exercise effective macroeconomic control. The supply of funds, energy, raw and semifinished materials, and transport services must be taken into account in planning to increase the GNP, and we must not "rush headlong into mass action" and "hanker after something sensational, but impractical," all over again, he said. In recent speeches, he has reiterated the need to straighten out the "bubble economy" at a greater pace, to effectively recover loans made in breach of the regulations, to cool down the real estate craze and the rush to set up development zones, and to earnestly tighten up on bank loans and fixed-asset investment. Fixed-asset investment in 1993 was as high as 1,150 billion yuan, up 44 percent over the planned 800 billion yuan, and up 47 percent over total 1992 investment. The economic growth rate and fixed-asset investment planned for 1994 are 9 percent and 1,300 billion yuan, respectively. Zhu was quoted by an economist in Beijing as saying: The investment scale is large enough already. Provinces are not allowed to vie with one another in launching construction projects, and leading cadres of local governments must be held responsible for undesirable consequences arising from improper investment. Zhu was highly critical of some provinces that had refused to do away with unacceptable economic development zones and had engaged in property development irrespective of actual conditions. The circular issued by the State Council in late January on strengthening macrocontrol over fixed-asset investment was prompted mainly by Zhu's idea of guarding against economic overheating. Zhu reiterated the need to enforce the following "three regulations": No borrowing in breach of the regulations is allowed, no unauthorized interest increase or interest increase in a disguised form is allowed, and financial organs must sever ties with the economic entities they have established. In particular, he demanded that central departments and local governments try their best to prevent the recurrence of unauthorized fund-raising. He believed that only when bank loans and unauthorized fund-raising are controlled can the real estate craze be cooled down and the scale of fixed-asset investment curbed. He required banks in all localities immediately to break the debt chains of the financial offices, put an end to the situation in which "the bank's account-settling channel is stopped up and funds cannot be transferred readily [hui lu bu chang 0565 6424 0008 2545]," and forestall the possibility of banks not being able to provide cash for their customers. A Guangzhou official was quoted by Beijing economic circles as saying in Hong Kong some days ago that Guangzhou would not impose the value-added land tax. "Iron-headed Zhu" said this is nonsense, claiming: The provisional regulations on levying the value-added land tax will be carried out. All localities must submit themselves to the central government, rather than "countering central policies with local ones." All tax laws enacted by local governments which run against central policies are invalid. There was a hot dispute in the CPC hierarchy over the relationship between development speed and economic stability. Chen Yun has been insisting that "the scale of economic construction correspond to national strength" and that the principle of doing what is within our capacity must be followed in arranging fixed- asset investment so as to strike a balance in finance, credit, materials supply and demand, and foreign exchange. He once said: "How many capital construction projects can be launched is not determined by how much money we have, but by how many raw and semifinished materials are available." He also maintained that in arranging the scale of economic construction, the restraining effect of agricultural development on economic growth rate must be taken into account. Zhu and other third-generation leaders in central leadership now are seeking a compromise program that will accommodate Deng Xiaoping's call to "speed up economic development" and Chen Yun's call to "do what the country is capable of" because, on the one hand, they support Deng's plan "to bring about a period of particularly rapid development every few years," and on the other, they must take into account Chen's principle of "seeking development under a stable situation." Evidently, economic reform will deepen in 1994, but the State Council will curb blind investment by local governments, including "excessive development" in real estate and development zones.
