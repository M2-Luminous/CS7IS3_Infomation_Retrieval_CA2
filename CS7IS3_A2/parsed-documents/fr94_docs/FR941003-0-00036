ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing regulations on certain requirements governing the submission, review, and approval of abbreviated new drug applications (ANDA's). Specifically, these new regulations pertain to patent issues, certification and notice of certification of invalidity or noninfringement of a patent by ANDA applicants, effective date of approval of an application under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), and new drug product exclusivity. These regulations are intended to complete FDA's implementation of Title I of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 2, 1994.

Sheehan, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (HFD&hyph;600), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;0340. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On September 24, 1984, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98&hyph;417) (the 1984 amendments) was enacted. The law consisted of two different titles. Title I authorized the approval of duplicate versions of approved drug products (other than those reviewed and approved under section 507 of the act (21 U.S.C. 357)) under an ANDA procedure. Title II authorized the extension of patent terms for approved new drug products (including antibiotics and biological drug products), some medical devices, food additives, and color additives. Congress intended these provisions to provide a careful balance between promoting competition among brand-name and duplicate or ``generic'' drugs and encouraging research and innovation. Title I also amended section 505 of the act (21 U.S.C. 355) by requiring all New Drug Application (NDA) applicants and holders to provide certain patent information, requiring ANDA applicants to certify as to the status of patents claiming the drug product they intend to copy, providing for the submission and approval of applications for which the investigations relied on by the applicant to satisfy the ``full reports'' of safety and effectiveness requirements were not conducted by the applicant or for which the applicant had not obtained a right of reference or use from the person who conducted the investigations, establishing rules for disclosure of safety and effectiveness data submitted as part of an NDA, and providing specific time periods during which an NDA or an ANDA cannot be submitted or approved. The 1984 amendments also required FDA to promulgate new regulations implementing the statute. In the Federal Register of July 10, 1989 (54 FR 28872), FDA published a proposed rule on Title I. In the Federal Register of April 28, 1992 (57 FR 17950), FDA published a final rule on some aspects of Title I, such as ANDA content and format, approval and nonapproval of an application, and suitability petitions. In that final rule, FDA stated that it was still examining issues concerning patents and market exclusivity, and would issue a final rule once it had completed its deliberations. This document now finalizes those provisions. In the Federal Register of March 7, 1988 (53 FR 7298), FDA published a final rule implementing Title II. That rule is codified at 21 CFR part 60.
