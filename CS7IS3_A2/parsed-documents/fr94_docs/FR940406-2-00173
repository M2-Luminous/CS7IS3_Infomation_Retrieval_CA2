FR940406-2-00173 FR940406-2-00095 Proposed Priority 3: ADA Training for School Districts Background There are 15,173 regular school districts in the United States according to the U.S. Department of Education National Center for Education Statistics (1993 Digest of Education Statistics in the United States). These school districts are covered under Title II of the ADA. Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in all services, programs, and activities of State and local governments. The Office for Civil Rights within the U.S. Department of Education (OCR/ED) has been designated to enforce Title II in public elementary and secondary educational systems and institutions, public institutions of higher education and vocational education (other than schools of medicine, dentistry, nursing, and other health-related schools) and public libraries. Title II covers three major categories of programs or activities: Employment; activities involving general public contact as part of an entity's ongoing operation (e.g., telephone contacts, office walk-ins, interviews, and public use of the facilities); and activities or programs directly administered by the entity for program beneficiaries and participants (e.g., programs that provide State or local government services or benefits). School districts that have received Federal funds have been covered by section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act since 1973. Title II is patterned after section 504, and many school districts need information and training to understand not only their responsibilities under the ADA, but also the relationship of section 504 to the ADA. OCR/ED and NIDRR have cooperated to produce a self-evaluation guide for school districts that includes information addressing the relationship between section 504 and the ADA. One of the primary purposes of this training project will be to assist school districts to conduct their self-evaluations with this new self-evaluation guide and implement their plans to comply with the ADA. As part of this process, the project will enable trainees to understand not only their responsibilities under the ADA, but also the relationship of section 504 to the ADA. The project will place special emphasis on school districts where a majority of the students are from minority background because of their limited access to outside training opportunities. The project will train selected educational organizations whose membership have responsibility for complying with the ADA in school districts (e.g., superintendents, principals, special education directors, school boards, etc.), as well as selected individual school district's staffs. Proposed Priority An ADA training project for school districts shall_ •Placing special emphasis on school districts where a majority of the students are from minority background, identify and select for direct training a range of school districts, equitably distributed throughout the country, including those from urban, rural, and suburban areas; •Identify and select for training the membership and staff of educational organizations whose members have responsibility for complying with the ADA in school districts; •Develop a strategy and a schedule for directly training school districts as well as the membership and staff of selected organizations using a variety of approaches including, but not limited to, on-site training, regional, State, and local meetings, teleconferences, and audioconferences; •Utilizing the OCR/ED self-evaluation guide and other existing federally-approved materials to the maximum extent appropriate, develop an array of training materials and activities that vary in length and content in order to accommodate the information and scheduling needs of selected school districts and organizations; •Provide training to selected school districts and organizations on updating or conducting self-evaluations using the new guide, understanding the responsibilities of school districts under the ADA, on implementing changes to comply with the ADA, and on the resources available to them to facilitate the implementation of the ADA; •To the maximum extent possible, utilize as trainers those individuals with disabilities who have been trained as trainers on the ADA by NIDRR, EEOC, or DOJ technical assistance or training project;
