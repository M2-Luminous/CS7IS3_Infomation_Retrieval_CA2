This is the average foreign capital brought into the country by investors for speculative operations, namely in stock markets. On 17 May in remarks to Radio CBN, Lula said that if elected, he would allow only foreign capital that is intended for creating jobs. After lunching with foreign executives in Sao Paulo, Lula said: "It will be up to the Central Bank [BC] to define which investment is speculative." According to BC figures, $19.7 billion was brought into the country from 1990 to 1993 for purchasing stocks and for investments in the financial market. The monthly average of foreign capital brought into the country for this purpose in 1993 stood at $1.2 billion. A total of $3.9 billion was brought in during the first two months of 1994. In August, then-Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who is now a presidential candidate, took measures to stem the inflow of foreign capital, which already was exerting pressure on the issuance of Brazilian currency. Institutional investors (pension funds, insurance companies, and others) were channeling large resources not only into stock markets but also into fixed income investments. The latter were then excluded from stock market operations and subjected to an Financial Operations Tax surcharge. Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) sources conveyed their surprise over Lula's remarks. Stock markets would be strongly affected by restrictive measures. They believe it will be difficult to define which operations by institutional foreign investors are speculative. Normally, the amount of capital that leaves the country monthly after obtaining profits accounts for 40 percent of the incoming capital. CVM sources fear that Lula would allow only direct investments. These investments totaled $3.4 billion from 1990 to 1993 and $481 million during the first two months of 1994.
