What is perhaps most interesting, is the difference in interpretations of these developments by various journalists. For example, Belarusian mass media reported that the document was signed by all members of the Belarusian delegation. According to Moscow reports, the document was not signed by Belarusian National Bank Chairman Stanislaw Bahdankevich. To clarify the situation and the stand of the Belarusian National Bank, a BELINFORM reporter tried to urgently contact Stanislaw Bahdankevich. This was not easy due to the schedule of the chief Belarusian banker, and the BELINFORM reporter failed to reach him. However, BELINFORM has learned that Stanislaw Bahdankevich held an urgent meeting of the Belarusian Bank Board during which members of the board declared their support for the agreement, though the decision came with difficulty. The situation of the phantom signature was also clarified. Stanislaw Bahdankevich signed the agreement on the unification of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems, but with reservations. The point is that clause No. 5 of the agreement, saying that all assets and liabilities of the Belarusian National Bank should be transferred to the Russian Central Bank, contradicts the Belarusian Constitution. At 1330 today at the Belarusian National Press Center, Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich will hold a news conference on the results of the visit by the Belarusian delegation to Moscow and the signing of the monetary unification agreement.
