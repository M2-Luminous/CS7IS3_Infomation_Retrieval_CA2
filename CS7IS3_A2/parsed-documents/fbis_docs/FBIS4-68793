Some people were immediately reminded of the incomparable somersaults of Ruslan Imranovich. Those who reacted with the most irritation to the speaker's unusual move were the old associates of both Rybkin and Khasbulatov. Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the communist faction, for example, believes that the chairman of the house had absolutely no right to sign anything on behalf of the Duma without having put this question to the vote and without having obtained a minimum of 50 percent of the vote. Even more annoyed by the speaker's action was Sergey Baburin, leader of the Russia's Way group of deputies. Rybkin's actions, according to him, "are an unprecedented step destroying the idea of the separation of powers and the idea of parliament as such." Baburin made a firm promise to seek the speaker's resignation after the May holidays. Subsequently, in conversation with your OBSHCHAYA GAZETA observer, he specified: "We will raise the question of the style of work of the chairman of the State Duma. To what extent is Rybkin coping with his duties? He is in breach of the standing orders of the Duma almost daily and he disregarded the opinion of the majority of deputies in the appointment of the leader of the administrative system. If Rybkin's political predilections are gaining the ascendancy, he should give way to someone else." Baburin will hardly succeed in moving Ivan Petrovich from the presidium to the stalls. Even his fellow thinker Viktor Ilyukhin, who has repeatedly publicly rebuked the speaker for his "born-again" character, acknowledges that the question of the speaker's resignation could only be raised at this time as a warning. It could be attempted, but success is unlikely. This does not mean, of course, that the chairman of the house may feel totally secure. As many people believe, the opposition will leave him in peace only until the end of the summer vacation and that subsequently his Agrarian Party and Communist Party comrades, who moved him into the speaker's chair, will try to talk with him in party fashion. It is said that the agrarians, who have not as yet in public treated the speaker of the house badly, have already "worked" on him several times in a small group. Rybkin's withdrawal from the directive bodies of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation is a purposeful sign also. But while losing friends in his native camp, Ivan Petrovich is, naturally, acquiring them in the other. The Russia's Choicer Gleb Yakunin told your OBSHCHAYA GAZETA observer that he welcomes the Baburinites' intention to initiate Rybkin's resignation: "This gambit will fail, for all that, and Rybkin will move even closer to us. And his name is such that he will swim from one side to the other." That Rybkin is "swimming" is, indeed, noticeable. But to suppose after Gleb Yakunin that the speaker's route will lie from one political bank to the other and will soon bring him to Russia's Choice would be to suspect Ivan Petrovich of an uncritical assimilation of the experience of Khasbulatov. He will, most likely, not go to the bank: The smart fish searches where the water is deeper. In his inauguration speech even the newly elected speaker promised to create in the Duma a "strong center" by "weakening the fringes." It is in this sense, most likely, that we should perceive also Rybkin's "social democratism"--as something central between the communists and the democrats. And the movement from left to right could, generally, be aimed in actual fact at upward ascent. In this sense Ivan Petrovich is the direct opposite of Ruslan Imranovich. Having come to head a "freely elected parliament," the first in Russia's history, whose legitimacy is not disputed even by Yeltsin, a parliament for whose breakup Yeltsin would have no justification, Rybkin has not made the slightest attempt to take advantage of this "historic opportunity." On the contrary, he is effecting an evolution the opposite of Khasbulatov's. The latter went from unquestioning support of the president to uncompromising struggle against him, Rybkin, from being of an opposition frame of mind to manifest and unmanifest actions of support. The most important of these actions as of the present has been the conclusion of that Social Accord Treaty itself. Ivan Petrovich did not, after all, simply append his signature, running the risk of a violation of the Duma's standing orders, and did not simply afford the president an opportunity to "seize the initiative" of peacemaking. Throughout this campaign he had right from the outset prepared for both the Duma and himself the modest role of "No. 2" and ally of the opposite side. Back in the morning of 23 February, when no one knew how the intrepid venture of the amnesty and the Duma accord memorandum would end, Rybkin let slip the words, not noticed at that time, that "we need... a unique Russian social treaty or agreement with the consolidating role of President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin." It was in this direction that he steered, despite the resistance of the parliamentary opposition--in the direction of the "consolidating" or, simply put, principal role of the president in what had primordially been a Duma undertaking. And how dexterously the chairman stepped on the brakes on the painful question of the location of the lower house! And how decisive he was in the appointment to the position of chairman of the Duma administrative system of the "president's man" Andrey Voykov, although they had quite recently, in September-October, been on different sides of the barricades! No, Rybkin is definitely not an avenger, an insurgent. He is, rather, a skillful integrator who has expertly written the Duma into the system of power created since October and who is doing everything to ensure that it "not protrude" from this system. One of my Duma interlocutors observed philosophically: "Rybkin is Kant's 'thing in itself.' He does not lean toward either one or the other, working only for himself. He has no desire to perish beneath the rubble of the Duma and wants only to consolidate his place in the system. In today's hierarchy he is somewhere around the Ryabov level and would like to rise higher." If a place in the hierarchy is determined by the volume of services rendered, it is still too soon to put Ivan Petrovich above Ryabov but he has, after all, only just begun, and everything lies ahead for him. And it is by no means a fact that he will "swim" directly to the president's fish pond. He could at the right moment turn off to the side also. Journalists are noting that the speaker of the Duma has become a frequent guest of the prime minister also. The prime minister is seen with Rybkin far more often than with Vladimir Shumeyko, speaker of the Federation Council and a man of the "president's group." They are, evidently, in some way of interest and use to one another....
