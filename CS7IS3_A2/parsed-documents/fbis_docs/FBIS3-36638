However, there were no happy faces or celebratory salvos fired. It became clear prior to the Tbilisi summit that no one wanted the upcoming signing except the heads of state. The State Duma came out against it -- deputies feared that the treaty would exacerbate the situation in the North Caucasus and provoke another demarche by the Confederation of Caucasus Peoples, which takes all the rebellious regions of Georgia under its wing. The Russian Government sighed deeply and got ready to grant further unsecured credits. Russian servicemen, who were about to quit finally this restless region where they had suffered so much strife and humiliation, are unpacking their bags. The signing of the treaty is seen in Georgia as solely a forced measure. The country's impoverishment has gone beyond all conceivable bounds. People fainting from hunger in the center of Tbilisi are an everyday occurrence. There have been three full-blown wars, leaving aside strikes, blockades, and political and economic crisis. The hopes of integration within the world community were dashed almost simultaneously with the fall of Sukhumi. In these conditions you have to grasp any hand that is extended. So the signing of the treaty by Georgia is not so much a gesture of goodwill as a "recognition of necessity." There is no doubt that the Georgian radical dissidents Chanturiya and Tsereteli will soon start fighting again for the independence of the republic, as in the seventies. The local mafia, which has been furiously printing coupons, by no means all of which have been sold, has also had its nose put out of joint. The Georgian parliament is well aware of the political failure: The country's economy will be revived through Russian money, Russia will set up the Georgian Armed Forces, and Moscow specialists will settle the sovereign state's internal problems. Not for nothing does the old proverb run: "Whoever controls Tbilisi controls the Caucasus." Roughly the same situation is emerging as in the 19th century, and Georgia is acquiring roughly the same status. The Russian president's visit to Georgia is perhaps comparable only to the arrival of Czar Nicholas II at the beginning of the century. A state of emergency was declared in Tbilisi: The streets, particularly the airport road, were repaired as much as possible, while bread and even other food appeared in stores. As already reported, Georgian Deputy Defense Minister Nikolay Kekelidze, who was in charge of armaments and tehnical supply in the military department, was killed by an explosion in his own apartment on the actual day of the visit. He kept a small stock of weapons and munitions in his own apartment in the center of Tbilisi. Arriving at the scene of the incident at 1300 hours, Defense Minister Gorgiy Karkarashvili was almost killed himself, sustaining contusions of medium severity -- also from a bomb blast. To protect themselves against such "coincidences" the Russian side took complete control of the airport and all the places visited by the Russian president. The high ground overlooking the airport was occupied by Russian assault troops while the sky was patrolled by fighters. Changes were made to the Russian president's security system: Soldiers on compulsory service were enlisted for the first time for such an important matter. They were mustered from all sorts of special subunits of the Army and Internal Troops. Their function was to provide external protection for the delegation. This was previously done by "Alfa." This time there were only a few men from "Alfa" present.
