[13 May] Lien, answering a question put to him by Legislator Parris Chang of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party during an interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan, said ties with North Korea would still be considered although the ROC and South Korea have been trying to rebuild their relationship since they broke off formal ties in 1992, when Seoul switched recognition to Beijing. Meanwhile, in a bid to respond to the market diversification policy set by the goverment, the China external trade development council has decided to send a trade delegation to North Korea to enhance bilateral economic ties, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said. Bilateral trade between Taiwan and North Korea totaled just U.S.$7 million last year, with Pyongyang enjoying a surplus with Taiwan. Taiwan exports to North Korea are mainly shoe parts and metal molds, while North Korean imports here are largely agricultural and textile products, Lin Yi-fu, deputy director of the Board of Foreign Trade, said. Currently, Mainland China and Cuba are the only two markets with which local traders are not allowed to do business since the government lifted the trade ban with North Korea in 1992, Lin added.
