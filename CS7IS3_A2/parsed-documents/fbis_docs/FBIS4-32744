Papathemelis delivered Berov the most cordial greetings of Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and an invitation to visit Athens. The two sides discussed possibilities for cooperation between the Bulgarian Ministry of the Interior and the Greek Ministry of Public Order in combatting drug trafficking and illegal crossing of the border between the two countries. They expressed satisfaction over the presence of representatives of Greek business in Bulgaria. We also talked about peace and stability in the Balkans, said the Greek minister at the press conference after the meeting. He said that the opinion of the two sides on these issue coincided to a great extent. We believe the interference of non-Balkan factors in the crisis in the former Yugoslavia to be greatly disturbing and of a negative impact on the solution of the problems, Papathemelis said in response to a question. However, we hope that the worst will be avoided, he said. The launching of the idea about a Macedonian nation and a Macedonian language is an instrument for destabilizing the region, the Greek minister said. According to him, Skopje cannot use this instrument on its own but it could be used by third, non-Balkan states which may disturb peace in the Balkans. We would like to believe, Papathemelis said, that the government of this state will realize where its true interests lie. I believe that Mr. Kiro Gligorov holds the key to the successful solution of this problem. At the talks in the Ministry of the Interior, the Greek side invited Bulgarian Interior Minister Mikhaylov and a group of experts to visit Greece and discuss measures in combatting drug trafficking and strengthening border control, Chief Interior Ministry Secretary Kosta Bogatsevski told the press conference.
