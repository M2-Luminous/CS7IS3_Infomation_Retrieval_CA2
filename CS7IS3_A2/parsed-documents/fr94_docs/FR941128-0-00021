FR941128-0-00021 FR941128-0-00007 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [TX&hyph;45&hyph;1&hyph;6654; FRL&hyph;5114&hyph;2] Conditional Approval and Promulgation of Section 182(f) Exemption to the Nitrogen Oxides (NO X ) Control Requirements for the Dallas-Fort Worth and El Paso Ozone Nonattainment Areas; Texas AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: In this action, the EPA is conditionally approving two petitions from the State of Texas requesting that the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) and El Paso ozone nonattainment areas be exempted from NO X control requirements of section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) as amended in 1990. The State of Texas bases its request for DFW upon a demonstration that the DFW nonattainment area would attain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone by the CAA mandated deadline without the implementation of the additional NO X controls required under section 182(f). Similarly, the State bases its exemption request for El Paso on a demonstration that the El Paso nonattainment area would attain the ozone NAAQS by the CAA mandated deadline without implementing the additional NO X controls required under section 182(f), but for emissions emanating from Mexico. These exemptions are being requested under authority similarly granted under section 182(f) of the CAA. EFFECTIVE DATE: This action is effective as of November 21, 1994.
