[passage omitted] However, unlike Lithuanian President Brazauskas and Romanian Foreign Minister Melescanu, Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak openly stated that Poland is not really happy with the partnership. "We can accept it if we are certain that Poland will ultimately be able to become a full member," said Pawlak. On this issue, the prime minister sees eye to eye with Polish President Lech Walesa, who only went along with the NATO proposal after being subjected to heavy U.S. pressure but subsequently let it be known that, in his view, it can in no way be said to meet Polish demands. Poland, probably to a greater extent than its neighbors, fears a resurgence of Russian imperialism that would threaten its borders. Poland had counted on receiving adequate protection against any threat from the East in the form of security guarantees from NATO. However, a badly disillusioned Warsaw is now having to face up to the fact that NATO is not prepared to give these guarantees. [passage omitted] Consequently, Warsaw has no option but to take the long road to accession, and the only one leading in that direction is the Partnership for Peace. NATO has already let it be known that Poland and the other Visegrad countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia) could find themselves placed on a faster track, enabling them to gain full membership before the Romanians or the Bulgarians. However, no one is daring to say so openly so as not to create new dividing lines in Europe. [passage omitted]
