Chinese officials have indicated that companies which fail to produce the required licence will not be allowed to export toys from China. The majority of the 3,000-odd toy factories in Guangdong, where most of the country's toys are made, are owned by Hong Kong businessmen. Dennis Woo of Hong Kong's Merchandise Testing Laboratories (China) said when he met with a Chinese official in charge of enforcing the regulation last week, that he was told only 200 companies had obtained licences. Wen Hongsheng, the deputy chief of the Guangdong Import-Export Commodity Inspection Bureau in Guangzhou, told Woo the government was serious about enforcing the regulation, which required toy factories to have their products and management system screened before an Export Toy Quality Licence was issued. The regulation was issued by the State Import and Export Commodity Inspection Bureau in mid-1992 to take effect this July. Wen reportedly said the government would initially be "flexible" in enforcing the regulation. This was taken to mean that customs officers were likely to allow companies which had made credible efforts to obtain a licence to export their goods even if they had not met the deadline to get a permit. Those which have not made an application will almost certainly have their goods held back. Warren Kwok, the secretary-general of the Hong Kong Toys Council, said yesterday he was aware many companies had not applied although the council issued circulars briefing its 200 members. Kwok said the requirement was cumbersome, unnecessary, and could hurt the toy export business. "The toys for export to Europe and the United States are subject to very stringent requirements in those countries. There have been very few complaints from the importers so we don't see why the exporting country should start imposing restrictions on their own products." To obtain a licence, a company needs to have its toys tested for safety and quality. It will also have to pass a management system audit conducted by Chinese officials
