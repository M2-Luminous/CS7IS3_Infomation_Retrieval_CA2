FR940512-2-00092 FR940512-2-00054 [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;51&hyph;C] Consolidation Coal Company, 1800 Washington Road, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15241&hyph;1421 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.364(b) (weekly examination) to its Loveridge No. 22 Mine (I.D. No. 46&hyph;01433) located in Marion County, West Virginia. Due to deteriorating roof and rib conditions in the air course along the West Side of the Main North entries that flow south from 1 North (adjacent to 3 North Crossover Seals) to the junction with the 1 West entries, the entire area cannot be traveled safely. The petitioner proposes to establish check points to monitor the quantity of air; and to have a certified person test for methane and the quantity of air on a weekly basis and record the results in a record book kept on the surface and made available to all interested persons. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 10.
