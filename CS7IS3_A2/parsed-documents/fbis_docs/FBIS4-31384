Manaj in Tirana; date not given: "`Shock Therapy' -- Albania's Economic Revival!"] [Text] [Manaj] Mr. Minister, recently Mr. Berlusconi announced, in the name of the Italian Government, the creation of 1 million new jobs. What would you say about our government's plans in terms of employment? [Sheqi] For the year 1994, the government has planned to employ around 60,000 people who are at present jobless or receiving social assistance. Speaking about planning, we do not have in mind the outdated plans of the centralized economy. For example, this year 13 billion leks have been earmarked for public investments, 4.6 million of which come directly from the state budget and the rest is funded by foreign investors and international bodies. The aforementioned figure originates from the 10-percent economic growth envisaged for this year. It is equal to last year's growth, when 60,000 vacancies were filled in the private sector alone and public investments accounted for only 4 billion leks. Also, the employment structure, which is the most important thing, will change this year. Last year, the largest number of vacancies was in the private sector and the rest in the production sphere. By contrast, quite the opposite is happening this year. It highlights the fact that this is the first year when, after a long-running break in production, we will witness an increase in industrial production, as a result of small- and medium-size privatization of state-owned enterprises. Meanwhile, as planned, unprofitable enterprises will continue to be closed down. [Manaj] What does the new employment structure involve? [Shehi] Highway construction is one of our labor fronts, but despite its considerable value, during this construction period it will not be the most important. The main stage in creating new jobs will begin after completion of the highways with the setting up of petrol supply points, motels, hotels, restaurants and factories like the brewery and Coca-Cola factory recently opened in Tirana, and so on. By and large, there is a new climate favoring employment. Our government's plans offer a relatively large number of alternatives. [Manaj] What would you say about the 100-percent inflation indexation approved at the recent government-BSPSH [Union of Independent Syndicates of Albania] meeting? [Shehi] We reached agreement on this problem, and within this framework work is under way for setting up a working group that will go into the indexation details that will take the form of a law or an agreement. As far as our government is concerned, it is, in this respect, in favor of an agreement. [Manaj] How do you see prospects for our county's northeastern area, regarding economic growth and employment? [Shehi] We see this as being closely linked with the plans that various international economic organizations have to alleviate the hardship of this poor rural area, whose problems are actually aggravated as a result of the secluded political aura in which it is shrouded. In this respect, we see the improvement of its road network, and the development of its timber industry and geology -- as for the latter we can mention here our government's recent agreements on the creation of the "Albakri" [Albanian copper] joint venture -- as possibilities offered to this area for the solution of a number of its economic problems. Likewise, on this front, we are continuing negotiations on the establishment of the "Albkrom" joint venture. As for the BSPSH leader's request to the government to pass a law alleviating the impact of electricity price hikes, in this region it is not a matter of general measures but of a specific one related to the coal branch. By this measure, the government returns some kind of support to this branch. [Manaj] What stage has the work of drafting the labor legislation reached? [Shehi] We have entered the final stage of working out the Labor Code, and we are looking forward to passing it on to Parliament for approval before the summer vacations. The labor legislation, however, cannot be considered complete, unless several groups of legislation, for various reasons, are consolidated, and it will take a considerable time to do all this, including the contracts in the state budget sector and those dealing with the status of state employees. We think that Albania will have the basic part of its Labor Code approved by the end of 1994, which will be enough to enable us to proceed further with this activity.
