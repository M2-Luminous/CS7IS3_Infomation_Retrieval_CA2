The demonstration of daredevil combat skills by the crack Red One Brigade before a select Hong Kong audience was a show of force by the sovereign power just a little shy of three years before takeover. Xinhua and the pro-Beijing press claimed the parade would enable Hong Kong citizens to know more about the People's Liberation Army (PLA). As the propagandists put it: "It was the first time since nation building that Hong Kong compatriots took a close look at PLA troops in an organised and large-scale fashion." Not highlighted was the fact that the exhibition was open to only 216 of the faithful: Beijing-appointed legislators and advisers as well as members of the "shadow Government". The press were barred, as were Hong Kong's elected legislators. More important, however, is the fact that Hong Kong has prospered precisely because its residents have not needed to be anywhere near the PLA. At the height of the 1967 "disturbances", the Hong Kong Government kept a fleet of airplanes at Kai Tak on a 24-hour standby basis. An emergency airlift would take place the moment the PLA crossed the border. Even for moderate cadres of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), however, the stationing of the PLA in Hong Kong -- not to mention holding periodic war games to scare "domestic and foreign hostile elements" in the territory -- makes little sense. The Special Administrative Region (SAR) is exposed to no danger of foreign invasion. The late premier Zhou Enlai and politburo member Liao Chengzhi who held the Hong Kong portfolio in the 60s and 70s -- did not favour posting troops to Hong Kong. Messrs Zhou and Liao's idea about the change of sovereignty was as minimalist as it was liberal: Just change the governor and the flag. Former defence minister Geng Biao and former foreign minister Huang Hua also opposed billeting soldiers here. After they told the press about it, however, the two were in 1983 given a public scolding by patriarch Deng Xiaoping for "mouthing nonsense". Yet even Mr. Deng envisaged no more than a token PLA presence. With the onset of the moral equivalent of war between Beijing and Governor Chris Patten and the "neo-imperialists", however, the 8,000 to 10,000 soldiers who will call Hong Kong home after July 1997 have much more than symbolic significance. Top brass briefing the Hong Kong dignitaries last weekend reiterated that the troops would not interfere with SAR affairs. Xinhua Vice-Director Zhang Junsheng made much of the fact that since "the PLA are the people's army, the sons and brothers of the people, Hong Kong compatriots have nothing to fear". Almost the same words were used to assure Beijing residents as the CCP's Central Military Commission (CMC) moved troops into the capital in May 1989. During last weekend's exercise, the 216 luminaries were so awestruck by the display of brawn and electronic wizardry they did nothing other than sing praises over "this civilised battalion, this glorious battalion." Cooler heads, however, should ask themselves -- and the PLA -- the following questions. First, on the issue of loyalty. The troops to be quartered here will be under the "absolute leadership" of the CCP and the CMC. There have been no fully-fledged coups d'etat in Communist- Chinese history. But during the Cultural Revolution and the "turmoil" in the spring of 1989, the PLA responded with alacrity to calls by the CMC to "restore order". It is not very likely that the SAR -- or a "destabilising" political force within the Region -- will lock horns with the CCP administration. Hong Kong, however, has been characterised by Chinese cadres as a "base of subversion". Should an ugly confrontation shape up, Beijing would no doubt ensure that, to use PLA lingo, "the guns of the soldiers (here) will be pointed in the right direction". Then there is the degree of effectiveness with which the CMC can control troops in Guangdong and in the SAR in the post-Deng era. It is a reflection of Beijing's concern for "warlordism" that, to quell the 1989 "rebellion", the CMC mobilised divisions to the capital from all the military regions. Likewise, the soldiers destined to "guard" Hong Kong will come from different parts of the nation. Should CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin fail to hold together the army after Mr. Deng's demise, officers in the Guangzhou and the Hong Kong command might not heed the centre's instructions about what not to do to the SAR. Because Hong Kong is such a fat piece of meat, ferocious argument has also broken out within the top brass over which PLA unit and faction should have the choicest parts of the spoils. It is understood that the CMC had to invoke Mr. Deng's authority to shoot down a proposal by the navy that it erect major installations in the SAR. The leadership was worried that the business viability of the SAR would be hurt if a chunk of it became a naval base. The power struggle within the CCP and the CMC, however, is a never-ending game. The PLA faction that comes out on top two years after Mr. Deng's death may have a radically different idea not only on troop deployment here, but on other aspects in which Hong Kong can serve the motherland's Great Wall of Steel. The Basic Law notwithstanding, the SAR will not be able to say "no" to the propositions of the single most powerful institution in China. Then there is the question of the PLA's mushrooming business empire. Hong Kong has resigned itself to the fact that the PLA will reap billions of dollars from developing the huge plots of land which will be turned over to them by the departing British garrison. Much more disturbing is the phenomenon of PLA companies using their unbeatable clout to muscle into -- and corner parts of -- the Hong Kong market. Quite a number of generals tipped for the Hong Kong Command, including the Head of the Political Department of the Guangzhou Military Region, Lei Mingqiu, are accomplished military entrepreneurs. On the mainland, PLA companies wheel and deal outside the law because, in most instances, they are outside the purview of civilian departments in areas such as customs, auditing, taxation and anticorruption. There is no suggestion that army businesses operating in Hong Kong after 1997 will make a point of breaking SAR laws. Yet given the feverish anxiety with which political and business circles in Hong Kong are currying favour with power sects from up north, it would be that much easier for errant PLA executives to get away with shady transactions.
