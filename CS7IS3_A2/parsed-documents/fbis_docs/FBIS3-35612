It is no wonder -- nuclear disarmament is the only way for humanity to survive. Either all nuclear states will dismantle this most terrible weapons of mass destruction, or the threat of wiping out every living being on the face of the earth will loom over civilization like the sword of Damocles. However, for some reason, the first step was not made by Russia, China, or even France, or by any other country possessing nuclear weapons, but by much-suffering Ukraine. Besides, the most vociferous and heated appraisals of the thanks-to-secret-diplomacy agreement are being voiced by officials of those states which belong to the nuclear club. This is understandable: We would embrace with the same clamor and degree of concern the disarmament of the United States or, even more so, Russia. However, I am afraid that we will not live that long. Now we are being assured that Ukraine will gain a lot after it hands over its nuclear warheads to our northern neighbor, which will turn around and sell the enriched uranium to the United States; these assurances are voiced by our president, as well as our ministers and generals, who unanimously assert that Ukraine will reap many profits on the path to unilateral nuclear disarmament. State mass media organs furiously advocate the same claim and voice the same opinion, and such uniformity and unanimity makes one to recall the former times of ideological adherence to the party line. Normal people, however, are lost in doubts. It is true that Ukraine has declared itself to be a nonnuclear state; it is also true that, having suffered from Chernobyl, Ukraine does not need any nuclear warheads. However, the disarmament should be accomplished step by step, along with other nuclear states. Yes, the statements that the liquid-fuel rockets are dangerous to the environment sound convincing; besides, the rocket's guarantee service term is coming to a close. But is there any reason to hand over the solid-fuel rockets? Even pro-Russian Mr. Kuchma has not consented to such a move. Yes, there is no disagreement as to the statement that we do not need strategic nuclear weapons which we are not able to use (it is a logical point of view, because tactical rockets were given to Russia for free). However, let us recall Margaret Thatcher who, notwithstanding her being a woman, had strongly defended the English right to possess nuclear weapons as a means of deterrence, even though nobody threatened the territorial integrity of Great Britain and nobody exerted shameless economic pressure upon that country. Yes, the lack of specialists capable of providing technical service to nuclear warheads is a serious reason to get rid of them. However, how many of our countrymen and compatriots are providing technical service to those weapons on Russian territory?! Now President Clinton states joyously: Strategic missiles on Ukrainian territory will no longer be aimed at the United States. However, not a word in the statement about strategic missiles on U.S. territory not being aimed at Ukraine, Kazakhstan, or Belarus... Well, Ukraine's unilateral nuclear disarmament is a noble and moral step. We are being assured that this step is economically profitable as well. However, doubts are natural among men. To disperse doubts and to become assured of Ukraine's profits, we need to have clear and distinct answers to some questions. First. Why have the three presidents preferred the form of a statement as opposed to a trilateral agreement, as is usually used with important international issues? As a rule, statements are not subject to parliamentary ratification. Maybe, the adoption of the statement was intended to preclude ratification by the Ukrainian Supreme Council, even though the council, according to Leonid Makarovych [Kravchuk], can grow wiser. If the statement is not subject to ratification, are its provisions subject to implementation? Second. What specific compensation is provided for Ukraine for the transfer of the nuclear warheads to Russia? Third. For what price is Russia going to sell enriched uranium from Ukrainian warheads to the United States? Why cannot Ukraine sell that uranium to America or some other nuclear state without an intermediary? Fourth. How many, in what stage of preparedness, and for what price does Ukraine sell uranium rods to Russian nuclear power plants, which are prepared from Ukrainian raw materials mined and enriched by our citizens? At the same time, it would be interesting to know the price of the completely prepared uranium rods which are being resold to Ukrainian nuclear power plants by Russia. Fifth. What specific security guarantees are granted to Ukraine by the United States and the Russian Federation for dismantling strategic nuclear weapons, in addition to the provisions of the statement, which repeat the principles of the CSCE Final Act? The CSCE Final Act was signed by these states some time ago, but it did not exclude Russian territorial claims and economic pressure with regard to Ukraine -- a member and one of the founders of the United Nations. Sixth. The last question repeats the doubt that was already expressed above: Why are we discussing the full nuclear disarmament of Ukraine only, not taking into account a step-by-step simultaneous disarmament by all other nuclear states? As we see, these questions are not difficult to answer. However, without these answers, it is impossible to evaluate the Moscow trilateral agreement and determine what Ukraine will gain for transferring strategic nuclear weapons -- will these gains be the same as with the tactical missiles transfer, or will there be something more? Anticipating my opponents' criticism, I admit that I am not a nuclear specialist, and the above questions may be those of a dilettante. However, it makes it easier for specialists to answer them precisely and clearly. VECHIRNIY KYYIV is ready to publish such answers to dissipate the disbelief of many Ukrainian people in the great victories of our young diplomacy.
