However, some plans for military training plans are striking in their abundance and scope of activities. When are we going to stop dissipating our resources, when are we going to learn to economize?--Lieutenant Colonel V. Belousov. * * * This question from a letter to the editors is basically rhetorical. But we decided not to ignore it and asked Colonel S. Ignatyev, an officer in the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense central staff, to discuss this topic. The current situation with regard to funding the Armed Forces is very strained. And the defense minister has directed administrative agencies to search for ways to cut costs and ensure strict austerity and rational use of the financial resources appropriated for defense needs. The basis for this must be laid as we plan the development of the Russian Federation Armed Forces in 1994-1995. I would like to identify basic areas of staff work that make it possible to conserve resources. Combat- and mobilization-readiness plans and organization and methodological directives must be coordinated with amounts of appropriations and material and technical resources. In planning command-staff, tactical, specialized tactical, demonstrative and other exercises, staff training exercises, and wargames, a careful analysis must be made of their usefulness and effectiveness. The composition of exercise participants, as well as the manpower and resources used to support them, must be the optimum choices. It is essential to thoroughly reexamine the existing practice of holding training and assembly exercises that entail the consumption of valuable materials and financial resources for planning and implementation and the reimbursement of travel expenses and payment of per diems to assembly attendees, as well as keep assembly sites as close as possible to troops and forces and limit them to three to five days. It is also necessary to sharply reduce the number of training assemblies and meetings held with commanders of districts, groups of forces, fleets, armies, and military educational institutions and that involve summoning a large number of officers to Moscow, St. Petersburg, and other major cities, and to arrange to hold clustered training assemblies and meetings and stop sending several commanding officers of military administrative agencies (commanding officers and their deputies, administration, department, and service chiefs, etc.) to them. Operational, training, training and methodological and other training assemblies (classes) for commanding officers of large formations and military units and administrative officers of formations and military units (ships), military educational institutions, the military departments of state educational institutions for higher professional education, and military missions should be planned on a garrison basis, as a rule. The minimum necessary number of personnel and military equipment should be used to prepare and support training assemblies. Training camps, firing range operations, and field excursions must be put in proper order. In planning measures involving physical training and sports, the main emphasis should be on holding large-scale competitions and sports festivals directly in military units and at military educational institutions. We must limit the amount of appropriations and number of championships among the branches of the Russian Federation Armed Forces, districts, groups of forces, fleets, and large formations and units, as well as competitions among military academies and schools. In order to more coordinate operational and combat- and mobilizational-readiness plans with available appropriations and material and technical resources, plans should be subjected to comprehensive economic scrutiny and cleared with financial and economic agencies before being approved. Proposals for inclusions in the Russian Armed Forces training plan that are submitted to the Russian Armed Forces General Staff must be substantiated with necessary calculations of financial expenditures that have been cleared with the Russian Ministry of Defense Chief Military Budget and Financing Administration. Balancing plans for combat training and material, technical, and financial support for planned activities will make it possible to maintain the required level of combat and mobilizational readiness in our Army and Naval Forces.
