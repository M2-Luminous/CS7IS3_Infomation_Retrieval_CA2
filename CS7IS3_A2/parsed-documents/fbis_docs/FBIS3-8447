President Michal Kovac and Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar were also present. Peter Weiss, the parliament's deputy speaker, has informed us about the meeting's results: [Begin Weiss recording] The cross-party standing committee has met on my initiative. I based it on the final part of the president's speech on the need to seek ways toward national and political conciliation, healing political wounds, easing the atmosphere of confrontation, and creating peaceful conditions for early elections. On the basis of this initiative, a meeting was held in the presence of both the president and the prime minister. Representatives of all parliamentary parties and movements were there. Various proposals were presented there for the creation of a broad coalition government--also by the president and myself. It must be said that the prime minister explicitly rejected the idea of a broad coalition government until early elections are held. The atmosphere that arose there was more likely to lead to a new confrontation than to a constructive dialogue. That is, the prime minister showed unwillingness to seek a solution that would be generally acceptable. [end recording]
