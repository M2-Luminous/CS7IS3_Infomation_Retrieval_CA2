Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that the prime minister told the Labor Knesset faction he considers the report as the commission's way of dealing with a complicated situation and criticizing the operation of certain systems. Rabin emphasized that the government will implement all the conclusions and recommendations, adding that the report will make it easier for him to determine prayer and security procedures in the Cave of the Patriarchs and especially to enforce the arrangements on Jewish worshipers. Yitzhaq Rabin rejected the statement of Ari'el Sharon -- without spelling out his name -- that contrary to previous commissions of inquiry, the Shamgar Commission has not placed any ministerial responsibility on anybody. Rabin said that contrary to the Lebanon War, where the government made a concrete decisions to enter Beirut, the Shamgar Commission has dealt with an unpredictable event which was not initiated by the government. Regarding the reports on Ron Arad's fate, the prime minister says Israel has considerable information regarding Ron Arad's fate up to 1989. In the past he was held by Mustafa al-Dirani who was a member of the Amal organization. He was then turned over to Hizballah and Iran. Syria could also have done more than it has on this issue.
