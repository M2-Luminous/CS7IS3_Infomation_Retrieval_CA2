FR940921-0-00020 FR940921-0-00010 B2. Subpart 1 of Part D _Section 176(c) of the CAA requires States to revise their SIPs to establish criteria and procedures to ensure that Federal actions, before they are taken, conform to the air quality planning goals in the applicable SIP. The requirement to determine conformity applies to transportation plans, programs and projects developed, funded or approved under Title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act (``transportation conformity''). Section 176 further provides that the conformity revisions to be submitted by States must be consistent with Federal conformity regulations that the CAA required EPA to promulgate. Congress provided for the State revisions to be submitted one year after the date for promulgation of final EPA conformity regulations. When that date passed without such promulgation, EPA's General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I informed States that its conformity regulations would establish a submittal date (see 57 FR 13498, 13557 (April 16, 1992)). EPA promulgated final conformity regulations on November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62188) and November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63214). These conformity rules require that the States adopt both transportation and general conformity provisions in the SIP for areas designated nonattainment or subject to a maintenance plan approved under CAA section 175A. Pursuant to ยง51.396 of the transportation conformity rule and ยง51.851 of the general conformity rule, the State of North Carolina is required to submit a SIP revision containing transportation conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established in the Federal rule by November 25, 1994. Similarly, North Carolina is required to submit a SIP revision containing general conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established in the Federal rule by December 1, 1994. Because the deadlines for these submittals have not yet come due, they are not applicable requirements under section 107(d)(3)(E)(v) and, thus, do not affect approval of this redesignation request. B3. Subpart 3 of Part D _Under section 187(a) areas designated nonattainment for CO under the amended CAA and classified as moderate were required to meet several requirements by November 15, 1992. North Carolina was required to submit a 1990 Emission Inventory. EPA has reviewed and is approving in this notice North Carolina's 1990 Base Year Emission Inventory. The requirement to make I/M corrections are not applicable to Forsyth County since it was not a pre-enactment nonattainment area, and therefore did not have an existing program before the CAA. Section 211(m) further required North Carolina to submit an oxygenated fuels regulation for the Winston-Salem area. North Carolina submitted a complete Oxygenated Fuel SIP on November 20, 1992. The Oxygenated Fuel Program is fully adopted and has been approved by EPA (See 59 FR 33683 published on June 30, 1994). Therefore, all Subpart 3 requirements that were applicable at the time the State submitted its redesignation request have been met. 3. Fully Approved SIP Under Section 110(k) of the CAA Based on EPA's approval of SIP revisions under the 1990 Amendments, EPA has determined that the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County area has a fully approved SIP under section 110(k), which also meets the applicable requirements of section 110 and Part D as discussed above. 4. Improvement in Air Quality Due to Permanent and Enforceable Measures The control measures to which the emission reductions are attributed mostly to the Federal Motor Vehicle Control Program (FMVCP). The fleet turnover under the FMVCP produced annual CO emission reductions of 6 percent. In association with its emission inventory discussed below, the State of North Carolina has demonstrated that actual enforceable emission reductions are responsible for the air quality improvement and that the CO emissions in the base year are not artificially low due to local economic downturn. EPA finds that the combination of certain existing EPA-approved SIP and federal measures contribute to the permanence and enforceability of reduction in ambient CO levels that have allowed the area to attain the NAAQS. 5. Fully Approved Maintenance Plan Under Section 175A Section 175A of the CAA sets forth the elements of a maintenance plan for areas seeking redesignation from nonattainment to attainment. The plan must demonstrate continued attainment of the applicable NAAQS for at least ten years after the Administrator approves a redesignation to attainment. Eight years after the redesignation, the state must submit a revised maintenance plan which demonstrates attainment for the ten years following the initial ten-year period. To provide for the possibility of future NAAQS violations, the maintenance plan must contain contingency measures, with a schedule for implementation adequate to assure prompt correction of any air quality problems. In this notice, EPA is approving the State of North Carolina's maintenance plan for the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County area because EPA finds that North Carolina's submittal meets the requirements of section 175A. A. Emissions Inventory_Base Year Inventory On November 16, 1992, the State of North Carolina submitted a comprehensive inventory of CO emissions from the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County area. The inventory includes emissions from area, stationary, and mobile sources using 1990 as the base year for calculations. The 1990 inventory is considered representative of attainment conditions because the NAAQS was not violated during 1990. The State submittal contains the detailed inventory data and summaries by county and source category. The comprehensive base year emissions inventory was submitted in the National Emission Data System format. Finally, this inventory was prepared in accordance with EPA guidance. It also contains summary tables of the 1990 base year and was projected to the year 2005.
