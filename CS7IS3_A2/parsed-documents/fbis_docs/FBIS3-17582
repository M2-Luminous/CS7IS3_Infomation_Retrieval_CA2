As informed sources report, he plans to fly to Moscow on Sunday afternoon. He is pleased with his vacation and, but for the rumors about a coup in preparation which are disturbing the capital, his mood would be perfectly fine. Incidentally, this was helped by the weather -- it was really warm in Sochi. The president spent the second week of his vacation more strenuously (I do not think this was done with the aim of "demonstrating" his good health). He met with Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, who flew down to discuss problems relating to the economy and some foreign and domestic policy questions. The meeting, as the prime minister told journalists, was not an emergency meeting. Moreover, the president continued to be briefed on the the state of affairs in the Kuban and flew by helicopter, along with Krasnodar Kray Administration Head N. Yegorov, over the Black Sea coast. Yeltsin did not, course, forget to relax during his vacation. According to the Sochi Town Hall press service he made several trips around the resort and did the local sights, while the heliicopter trip with Yegorov, it emerged, pursued purely sporting ends -- a duck shoot was held at Priazovskiye Plavni. The president's wife, Naina Iosifovna, who visited Sochi's House of Fashion and the Mini-Maxi Theater of Fashions last Thursday, also imparted to journalists some details of Boris Nikolayevich's life in the resort. According to her, the president even took a dip in the sea (the temperature of the sea water is nine degrees). Aware that there are the Matsesta therapeutic waters in Sochi, which all the country's past leaders have taken to improve their health, journalists rushed to report that Boris Yeltsin had also undergone a course of treatment there. But the Matsesta complex' chief medical officer, A. Shvyrova, denied this information was true: "Unfortunately, Boris Nikolayevich did not visit us. If he had, we would certaintly have drawn attention to our plight...." During the president's two-week vacation only a film crew from Ostankino managed to visit the dacha by the Bocharovo brook. Your TRUD correspondent's press pass did not, unfortunately, enable him to gain access to the estate. I was courteously admitted to the guardroom, my details were taken down..., and I was thanked for my concern. I had gone to the checkpoint at the president's dacha to clarify the details of a minor incident -- on Wednesday a group of Sochi inhabitants had organized a picket at the gates.... Some people were demanding an apartment from the president, others an increased pension, someone else wanted the president to deal with the local mafia. After holding their midday rally, the people went their separate ways. There were no other excesses in Sochi.
