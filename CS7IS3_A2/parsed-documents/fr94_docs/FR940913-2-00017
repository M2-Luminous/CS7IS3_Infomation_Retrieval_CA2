FR940913-2-00017 FR940913-2-00011 Applications for Duty-Free Entry of Scientific Instruments Pursuant to Section 6(c) of the Educational, Scientific and Cultural Materials Importation Act of 1966 (Pub. L. 89&hyph;651; 80 Stat. 897; 15 CFR part 301), we invite comments on the question of whether instruments of equivalent scientific value, for the purposes for which the instruments shown below are intended to be used, are being manufactured in the United States. Comments must comply with 15 CFR 301.5(a)(3) and (4) of the regulations and be filed within 20 days with the Statutory Import Programs Staff, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. 20230. Applications may be examined between 8:30 A.M. and 5:00 P.M. in Room 4211, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. Docket Number: 94&hyph;090. Applicant: Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Box 9812, New Haven, CT 06536. Instrument: Phosphoimager X-ray Diffraction Area Detector. Manufacturer: MacScience Co. Ltd., Japan. Intended Use: The instrument will be used in determining the three-dimensional structures of proteins and nucleic acids using x-ray crystallography. The proteins or nucleic acids are crystallized and the single crystals are exposed to a beam of X-rays which diffracted by the crystals give rise to discreet spots of varying intensities. The instrument is used to automatically measure the intensities of each of these diffracted reflections and write them out on disk. In addition, the instrument will be used for Ph.D. thesis research of graduate students in the Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: July 13, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;091. Applicant: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Research Laboratory, Office of Research and Development, 960 College Station Road, Athens, GA 30605-2720. Instrument: Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer, Model OPTIMA. Manufacturer: Fisons Isotopic Analysis, United Kingdom. Intended Use: The instrument will be used for natural abundance-level measurements of (1) the stable carbon isotopic compositions of individual peaks resolved by gas chromatography, and (2) the stable carbon, nitrogen and sulfur isotopic compositions of soil, plant, and animal materials. These samples will be used to study transformations of C, N, S, and H in terrestrial soil-plant-water ecosystems. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: July 18, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;092. Applicant: The University of Georgia, Research Foundation, Boyd Graduate Studies Research Center, Athens, GA 30602. Instrument: Motion Analysis System, Model ELITEPLUS. Manufacturer: Bioengineering Technology and Systems, Italy. Intended Use: The instrument will be used in the biomechanical analysis of human and/or animal gait to assist researchers in evaluating the effects of drugs, disease, etc. The instrument will also be used in the courses Biomechanical Systems Design, BEN 470 and BEN 670, to analyze loading responses of joints during gait, to learn how to design prosthetic devices and to understand the response of the body to implants, drugs, etc. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: July 18, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;093. Applicant: The University of Georgia, Research Foundation, Boyd Graduate Studies Research Center, Athens, GA 30602. Instrument: Muscle Response System, Model TELEMEG. Manufacturer: Bioengineering Technology and Systems, Italy. Intended Use: The instrument will be used in the biomechanical analysis of human and/or animal gait to assist researchers in evaluating the effects of drugs, disease, etc. The instrument will also be used in the courses Biomechanical Systems Design, BEN 470 and BEN 670, to analyze loading responses of joints during gait, to learn how to design prosthetic devices and to understand the response of the body to implants, drugs, etc. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: July 18, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;094. Applicant: United States Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, DC 20585. Instrument: Fuel Cell. Manufacturer: Fuji Electric Company, Japan. Intended Use: The instrument will be used for study in the use of a phosphoric acid fuel cell to propel an urban transit bus. The fuel cell converts hydrogen and oxygen into electrical power. The objectives of this program are to develop and demonstrate a methanol-fueled, PAFC/battery-powered urban transit bus to provide energy savings, petroleum displacement and air quality improvements. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: July 19, 1994.
