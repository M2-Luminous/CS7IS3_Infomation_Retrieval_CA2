"The area of influence under the mark has grown in a short time from sixty to one hundred million people, indirect influence is being tripled, and that's not the end of it because other countries in the area of the mark are knocking at the Union's door," Costa said Thursday [3 March], commenting the agreements reached Monday with the three northern states, which may join the EU in January 1995. The prospects for Italy at the turn of the century will not be very bright, especially if Italy is unable "to gain considerable political and economic room in Europe and in the Mediterranean," Costa added. "Europe itself, which inappropriately criticized us for our state-run overspending, never misses a chance to fatten itself with Franco-Prussian bureaucrats and to approve antifree market measures such as those on milk quotas," Costa claimed, referring to EU demands for reductions in milk production. Italy, Costa asserted, must be able to negotiate and "fight" in a Europe which he described as "sometimes contradictory -- but always serious and careful with detail -- and conditioned, tomorrow more than today, by the Bundesbank."
