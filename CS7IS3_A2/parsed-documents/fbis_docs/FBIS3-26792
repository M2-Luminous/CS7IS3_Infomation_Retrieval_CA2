He explained that NATO, which has enough warplanes to carry out the air strikes, would not need Spain's participation. NATO has threatened to launch air strikes against Bosnian Serb gun positions around Sarajevo unless the Serbs withdraw their weapons or surrender them to UN control by midnight GMT on Sunday. The Bosnian Serbs were accused of launching a mortar attack on a Sarajevo market earlier this month. The attack, which killed 68 civilians and wounded nearly 200 others, led to renewed calls for NATO's air strikes against Bosnian Serb gun positions around Sarajevo. Solana expressed the hope that the United Nations and NATO would seek an end to the Bosnian war without resorting to force. He was speaking to reporters before departure for a visit to Andorra. Solana also urged the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo in a step "to actually lift the siege of the city." He said he had called on the United States, France, Britain and Russia to help end the siege of Sarajevo through promoting negotiations involving the warring parties.
