FR940610-1-00090 FR940610-1-00008 Viscusi (1993) also surveyed risks of death and concluded that ``the most reasonable estimates of the value of life are clustered in the $3 million to $7 million range'' (p. 1942). However, he cautions that these estimates may be low, because the populations of exposed workers in these studies generally have lower incomes than individuals being protected by government risk regulations. 13 (The positive income elasticity for risk reduction means that higher values for lifesaving should be used when evaluating many risk reduction programs, such as airline safety programs). Fisher, Chestnut, and Violette also caution that to the individual's valuation of the risk reduction should be added the value loved ones and altruistic others also would be ``willing to pay for reducing the fatality risk for those exposed to it'' (p. 97). The values for risk reduction may be greater when risks are involuntarily assumed than when the risks are voluntarily chosen. This is relevant to the school lunch situation where a limited array of choices are offered in the lunch program. Thus, the higher estimates may be most appropriate for evaluating the school lunch programs' healthier diet and its contribution to reducing risk per-statistical-life. In comparison to the dietary changes predicted by FDA for food labeling, the improvements in fat and saturated fat estimated for the school meal program proposed regulation are substantial. The School Nutrition Dietary Assessment Study found that dietary intake from NSLP lunches provides 37 percent of calories from fat and 14 percent of calories from saturated fat. Reducing these lunchtime intakes to the Dietary Guidelines levels proposed in the regulation would reduce an NSLP participant's intake by 5.9 grams of fat and 3.4 grams of saturated fat on each day school lunch is eaten. Allowing for 182 school days per year and the percent of total U.S. children age 5 through 18 years who receive a meal on any school day (51%), it is estimated that the average daily reduction across all school-aged youth would be 1.5 grams fat and 0.86 grams saturated fat. These estimates are significantly above those estimated for the FDA food labeling changes for fat and saturated fat. For cholesterol, school meals already provide a moderate intake and no further reduction will be required by the proposed regulation. To further compare the aggregate effect to that estimated for the food labeling regulations, consider the situation where the adult population reduces fat by 1.5 grams, reduces saturated fat by 0.86 grams, and does not reduce dietary cholesterol intake. This is necessary because there are no commonly accepted equations to relate changes in children's intakes of fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol to chronic disease reduction. The Browner model assumes that the relative risk of cancer is a function of total fat. The reduction of 1.5 grams of fat is about 39 percent greater than the reduction of 1.08 grams average for males and females estimated for FDA's food labeling, so a larger reduction in cancer incidence and deaths would be expected. For coronary heart disease, the Browner model assumes that all change is mediated through changes in serum cholesterol, which is affected by total fat, the type of fat, and dietary cholesterol. FDA used the following equation from Hegsted (1986) to estimate the change in serum cholesterol: Change in serum cholesterol in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) = 2.16S ^ 1.65P + 0.097C Where S = change in percentage of total calories represented by saturated fat, P = change in percentage of total calories represented by polyunsaturated fat, and C = change in dietary cholesterol measured in milligrams per 1000 kilocalories. The Hegsted equation shows that the greatest effect on serum cholesterol is due to saturated fat, and that changes in dietary cholesterol only play a small part. 14 The NSLP changes result in an average reduction in saturated fat of 0.86 grams, which is 2.77 times the reduction of 0.31 grams estimated for FDA's food labeling. Since the estimated change in polyunsaturated fat levels is only slightly greater for food labeling than for the proposed regulation, the overall estimated change in serum cholesterol for the adult example based upon changes at the levels which are proposed for school lunch would be considerably greater than that projected for labeling, driven by the large decline in saturated fat.
