In the past few days, statements by Clinton and officials in his Administration about the issue have been strangely and suspiciously contradictory. When the U.S. President met with leaders of the "Zionist lobby" in the United States he emphasized to them his support for making Jerusalem the unified capital of Israel. A day later, the U.S. State Department issued a statement stressing that there is no change in Washington's position regarding Jerusalem! A few days later, Jewish sources once again quoted President Clinton as backing Jerusalem as the unified capital of Israel. Later, news agencies quoted him as affirming that the status of Jerusalem must be determined through Arab-Israeli negotiations. The Arabs understood this to mean Clinton's promise to them not to recognize the legitimacy of the Israeli occupation of Jerusalem. In general, the U.S. comments, which are designed to satisfy the Arabs, were marked by a great deal of deliberate ambiguity. Former U.S. President George Bush was once asked his opinion on declaring Jerusalem the capital of Israel. His specific and firm answer was that Jerusalem is part of the occupied Arab territories and that its final status, like that of the other Arab cities and villages that Israel occupied in 1967, will be determined by the peace talks. However, the current U.S. Administration confines itself to emphasizing that its "position on Jerusalem has not changed." The confusing thing about this phrase is that the position of the Democratic Party and its presidential candidate in the recent elections, Bill Clinton, recognized Jerusalem, both East and West, as the capital of Israel and even sought to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The Zionists viewed this position as a promise no less important or significant than the infamous "Balfour Declaration." Thus, the "no-change in the U.S. position on Jerusalem" means one of two things: First, that Clinton meant that he adheres to his position announced during his election campaign, namely to recognize the legitimacy of the Israeli occupation of Jerusalem; or second, that he meant they continue to adhere to the position of the preceding U.S. administrations, which viewed Jerusalem as an occupied Arab territory. I believe that this duality in meanings is intentional and deliberate, acting upon the foxy Kissinger's theory that "modern politics should be hard to understand." We apologize to Mr. Kissinger, but we are nevertheless trying to understand. Unfortunately, our attempt to do so leads us to believe that the whole thing is nothing but a trial balloon by Washington to see what the Arab and Islamic reactions would be if the U.S. Embassy were to be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Thus, the Arabs must counter this U.S. ambiguity with full clarity and firmness before it is too late.
