Trade problems between Japan and the United States are expected to be high on the agenda for the talks, government sources said. Christopher and Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner will participate the same day in security consultations with Hata and Defense Agency Director General Kazuo Aichi, the ministry source said. The consultations are expected to take up matters pertaining to the bilateral alliance and the issue of North Korea's nuclear program. Christopher, who arrives in Japan on March 9 on a four-nation trip to Asia and Australia, is also expected to attend a meeting in Tokyo of the International Committee on Reconstruction of Cambodia (ICORC). The secretary of state said in an interview Wednesday that he expects political and security ties between the U.S. and Japan will remain intact despite bilateral trade woes. "Our relationship on the first two aspects is excellent and I would not expect it to be negatively affected by the economic matters we are going to be discussing or economic actions to be taken," he said.
