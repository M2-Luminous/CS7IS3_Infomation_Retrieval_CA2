The responsible person said: With the State Council's approval, we have begun collection of the value-added tax at production, wholesale, and retail stages. The tax, with a uniform basic rate of 17 percent, is levied only on the increased portion of the value at each stage. Some people are worried that the collection of the value-added tax will cause commodity price increases. Some enterprises construe it as adding the 17-percent tax to the original selling price of any commodity. Others think that the tax is collected on the total value of a commodity both during its production and during its marketing. None of these interpretations is correct. The responsible person said: The collection of the value-added tax will not cause price increases. It is because the new tax is a conversion from the old product tax, value-added tax and business tax; and it is only a change in the mode of tax collection. During the conversion, we have not increased the total tax burden. So, it should not cause any changes in retail prices. Then, why do we generally collect the value-added tax at the commodity production and wholesale stages? The value-added tax is a common practice in foreign countries, and it is much better than our old tax system of collecting product taxes, value-added taxes, and business taxes separately. First, the new tax rate is simpler, with a basic tax rate of 17 percent and a preferential tax rate of 13 percent. In the old system, the value-added tax had 12 different rates, the business tax had four different rates, and the product tax had several dozen different rates, making the collection a very complex process. Next, the new procedures for paying the value-added tax require a special invoice which indicates all the value-taxes paid for the product earlier so that they will be deducted from current payment and thus avoid the old problem of double taxation. The separation of tax from calculated price makes the tax amount clear at a glance. Besides, the value-added tax is conducive to specialized production. The responsible person said: Some enterprises construe the tax not included in the calculated prices as adding a 17-percent tax to original selling price. This is a misinterpretation. For a long time, China had practiced a tax-inclusive pricing system in marketing commodities. So, the tax was included in the selling prices of most commodities in the past. For instance, if a commodity had a price tag of 100 yuan, its actual price was 85.5 yuan and there was a tax of 14.5 yuan; but the tax of 14.5 yuan was not separately indicated. The new value-added tax system, unlike the old practice, requires separate indication of commodity price and tax. In this way, the price of a commodity at present actually consists two parts before it reaches the retailer. Moreover, in selling a product, the enterprise must make out a special value- added tax invoice showing both the price of product and the tax amount. Take the above-mentioned 100-yuan commodity, for instance. Its actual price is 85.5 yuan, and the tax is 14.5 yuan. The tax amount is 17 percent of 85.5 yuan. So, it is evidently wrong to construe the tax not included in the calculated prices as adding a 17-percent tax to the original selling price. Then, why is it wrong to say that the value-added tax is collected on the total value at both the production and marketing stages? Because according to the regulations, the value-added tax is levied on only the increased portion of the value of a product, and the previously-paid value-added tax for the product may be deducted. This is greatly different from the old practice of collecting product tax according to selling price. For instance, a garment factory pays 100 yuan plus a tax of 17 yuan for material before making a garment. After the garment is completed, the factory sells it for 150 yuan. The value-added tax at this stage should be: 150 x 17 percent - 17 = 8.5 yuan. The formula may also be: (150-100) x 17 percent = 8.5 yuan. It is very clear that the value-added tax does not mean collection of 17 percent of tax on the total value at both the production and the marketing stages. The tax is levied only on the increased portion of the value. The two interpretations are greatly different from each other. Of course, I must make it clear that we adhered to the principle of no change in total tax burden in designing the value-added tax reform. The uniform tax rate may reduce the tax burden of most enterprises, but will perhaps increase the tax burden on a small number of enterprises because their products carried less tax in the past. The increased tax burden of enterprises can be compensated for by the lower income tax rate and the abolition of the "two funds." Besides, enterprises should offset the increased burden by improving management and product quality and by lowering costs. They should not solve the problem by raising prices. The responsible person said: It merits our attention that some enterprises at present deliberately drive up prices while the new tax system has just begun and some people still lack sufficient knowledge of it. Such unreasonable price increases must be resolutely stopped.
