The Ministry is studying ways to eliminate the posts of 17 senior officials, according to the official. A senior official at the Ministry said, "there has been criticism that the Ministry has too many special grade one officials and too few working-level officials. "A recent meeting of the Ministry's senior officials almost agreed to the reduction of the organization's staff. If things go well, we plan to receive approval from the minister and revise the executive ordinance of the Public Servants' Law covering foreign affairs. We want to begin the reduction within the first half of this year." Other ministries do not have the positions of special grade one or two level officials, which are unique to the Foreign Ministry. Under the plan, the number of special grade one level officials will decrease from 47 to 30 over five years, while that of special grade two level officials at the assistant minister level will be maintained at the current 35. In contrast, the number of grade one level officials will rise from the current 53 to 70.
