Six Small Parties in the Shadow of Six Big Ones"] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] We can put the parties in the following five groups on the basis of the party list election results that can be expected at this time: [passage omitted] 1. Those parties that can rightfully count on at least 10 percent of the vote, that is, those that will certainly be parliamentary parties in the next cycle. These are presently FIDESZ [Federation of Young Democrats], the MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum], the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party], and the SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats]. (The MDF, in whose case it is not possible to exclude even a 4- to 10-percent vote result, is a borderline case.) 2. The other two parliamentary parties, the FKgP [Independent Smallholders Party] and the KDNP [Christian Democratic People's Party] can only hope to get less than 10 percent of the vote, but it is very probable that they will get above the 5-percent threshold. (The FKgP is a borderline case because in an unusual situation, it might get squeezed out of parliament.) 3. It is possible that not a single party aside from the six above will meet the requirements for getting in. On the basis of Szonda-Ipsos's 1993 data, however, we can say that the Agrarian Federation, the Republic Party, the Workers Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Entrepreneurs Party, and the Green Alternative can have some hope of success as they try to expand their voter base to the necessary degree. (The Green Alternative is on the borderline between groups three and four, mainly because, as we will see, those who sympathize with it show little intention of taking part [in the election].) 4. There are parties, including the United Smallholders Party, the Hungarian Interest Party, the MIEP [Hungarian Justice and Life Party], the Hungarian Market Party, and the NDSZ [National Democratic Federation], whose existence public opinion is aware of but whose support is so low according to the research data (fewer than 1 percent of the potential voters) that only in the most extraordinary situation would they be able to get 5 percent of the vote. (Of these parties, MIEP is the one whose sympathizers, it can be assumed, are most likely to remain hidden in the course of public opinion research; therefore, perhaps this party can also be considered a member of the previous group.) 5. Finally, there are parties whose existence is in effect not recognized by the voting public, although they are registered parties and even have some members at their disposal. People do not mention them in any form, not even occasionally, in the course of public opinion research. [passage omitted]
