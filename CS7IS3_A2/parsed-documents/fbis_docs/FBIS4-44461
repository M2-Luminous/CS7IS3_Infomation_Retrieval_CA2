This has had a great effect on China in the way she has changed. However, official circles are also aware how this foreign capital, in a covert way, is changing the face of Chinese society. It can be said that the feeling in official circles toward foreign business is a mixed one of love and hate, much like lovers who do not know when they will have another quarrel. Recently, the Ministry of International Trade and Economics of the State Council conducted a large scale survey focusing on some of the solely foreign-funded enterprises in Dalian, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Xiamen to further understand the influence of such businesses after their appearance in China. The results show several problems that warrant attention. Negotiated Foreign Funding in Tens of Billions (U.S. Dollars) Up to the end of September 1933, about 10,000 solely foreign-funded enterprises had been approved, for a total investment close to US$20 billion U.S. They comprised 16 percent of the three kinds of foreign trade enterprises, and 25.3 percent of the total foreign capital investment agreed upon. The rapid rise and development of solely foreign-funded enterprises took place after 1988. From the beginning of 1988 to September 1993, 10,000 of solely foreign-funded enterprises had been approved, with an agreed upon investment totalling more than $20 billion (actual amount invested was $3 billion), comprising 98 percent and 92 percent respectively, of the aforementioned totals. At present, enterprises already established and started on production, and those in process of construction make up more than two-thirds of the solely foreign-funded enterprises approved. These enterprises are located mostly in special economic zones and opened coastal ports. For example, in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, approval had been granted to about 1,500 solely foreign-funded enterprises by the end of September 1993. These enterprises were engaged primarily in electronics manufacture, mechanical processing, industrial chemicals, light industry, construction materials, textiles and clothing, real estate etc. Investors were primarily from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, the United States and Germany. Rapid Growth on a Large Scale In studying the tendencies of these solely foreign-funded enterprises, official circles discovered that since 1988, development of these enterprises exhibit two outstanding characteristics: 1) The speed of growth and the continually increasing scope of capital investment. In 1988, only 410 solely foreign-funded enterprises were approved for all of China, with an agreed upon capital investment totalling $480 million U.S. By 1989, this figure had increased to 931 enterprises, with an agreed upon capital investment totaling $1.654 billion; by 1990, to 1,860 enterprises with investment totaling $2.444 billion; by 1991, to 2,793 enterprises with investment totalling $3.667 billion; by 1992, to 3,607 enterprises with investment totalling $5.210 billion; and by 1993, to 4,100 enterprises with the investment total in excess of $6 billion. 2) Increases in project size and in volume of capital investment from Taiwan. Solely foreign-funded enterprises everywhere usually start on a small scale. In the beginning, they were usually small and of an exploratory nature, but grew as time went on. Take the situation in Dalian as an example. Before 1986, capital investment in a solely foreign-funded enterprise averaged $1,458,800. Since 1988, the average capital investment had been on the rise--up to $1,573,800 for that year. By 1993, the average capital investment had increased to $3.5 million. Increases in Taiwan Investment and in Large Scale Projects In recent years, following continued improvement in the investment environment, the number of solely foreign-funded enterprises has been on the rise. At present, of such enterprises with a capital investment in excess of $10 million, 25 are located in Xiamen, nine in Zhuhai, and six in Shenzhen. In Dalian, there is only the "Jieneng Dalian Office Equipment Co., Ltd.," a solely Japanese-owned enterprise in which more than $100 million has been invested. The growth of solely foreign-funded enterprises owned by Taiwan business is most marked along the coast of Fujian Province. For example, among the 840 solely foreign-funded enterprises located in the city of Xiamen, 625 are owned by Taiwan business. Among 756 already approved enterprises funded by Taiwan investors, 76 percent of them are sole-proprietor enterprises owned by Taiwan business. However, we cannot have it both ways. At the same time that foreign investment benefits China in many ways, it is also accompanied by many problems, of which the following two are quite serious. 1) Serious tax evasion accompanying outstanding economic benefits. Solely foreign-funded enterprises usually adopt up-to-date techniques and equipment. Enterprise management is strict, and their products are strongly competitive on the international market, while reaping good economic benefits and great profit. According to followup analysis by the Xiamen Committee on Foreign Investment of economic benefits received by some important enterprises among 680 solely foreign-funded enterprises that are in production, 94.1 percent are making a profit, while only 79 percent of joint venture enterprises are doing the same. Statistics compiled by the Zhuhai Committee on Economics and Trade for 1991 also showed that among 210 solely foreign-funded enterprises already engaged in production, 173 were making profits that totalled more than 100 million yuan. The 88 enterprises that did not show a profit incurred losses totalling 52 million yuan, 54.7 percentage points of the deficit covered. However, among the 530 solely foreign-funded enterprises (including those already in production) granted approval, close to 200 of them had their investment capital increased in recent years to more than 200 million yuan, which comprised 32 percent of the agreed upon quota. How the solely foreign-funded enterprises frequently use a high-cost import and low-priced export technique to transfer their profits out of China, or use a branch company to do so is reflected wherever these enterprises operate. This is done to achieve their goal of paying as little tax as possible. According to statistics compiled by the port of Xiamen, the value of output from solely foreign-funded enterprises in Xiamen for 1992 was 41.2 percent of that from all foreign ventures in Xiamen, but the enterprise income tax from the solely foreign funded operations was only 11.4 percent of that paid by all foreign ventures. 2) Tense internal labor-management relationships. Because solely foreign-funded enterprises do not have a middleman, and the "Law on Foreign Ventures" does not clearly define such a management slot for these enterprises, labor-management relationships within such enterprises are not easy to handle. Moreover, certain solely foreign-funded enterprises, especially owners of smaller operations at certain ports, will cut costs wherever possible, in pursuit of maximum profit. To do so, they will prolong normal working hours at will, and overlook improvement of working conditions on one hand, and on the other, adopt an arbitrary parental approach that uses physical punishment, bag and body searches, so that the conflicting relationship between workers not used to such treatment and the enterprise owner worsens, leading to work strikes and resistance. This phenomenon has been noted in places such as Dalian, Zhuhai and Xiamen. Take Xiamen for example. More than 30 strikes have taken place during the last few years, the largest strikes being one where more than 700 workers collectively "walked off" for one day, and another where 250 workers stayed off work for 3 days. Because solely foreign-funded enterprises are expanding so fast and coming on so strong, and China has yet to have a corresponding policy, regulations and supervisory mechanism to keep up with them, such enterprises have urgent management problems that need to be resolved. They are: 1) The state's lack of measures to implement effective tax oversight on profits of solely foreign-funded enterprises. At present, some of these enterprises have yet to seriously implement an independent accounting system, as they regard their enterprises only as subsidiaries of foreign companies, through which they can avoid inspection and oversight by taxing agencies. Even as some of them have yet to set up a strict finance accounting system, they have not set up independent financial records either, or they may keep several sets of books instead. The accounts between quite a number of enterprises and their parent companies are often unclear, for they regularly use the "high-cost import" and "low-price export" technique to transfer their profits to avoid taxes. 2) Clarification of rules and regulations dealing with foreign ventures. This problem was noted from evaluation of solely foreign-funded enterprises, one of considerate concern to all local agencies of economics and foreign trade. Even as the "Regulations on Implementing the Law on Foreign Ventures" have been announced, some problems still remain to be clarified, making it difficult for those responsible for granting approval to make a decision. For example, with respect to an item of sole ownership involving plant and facility construction that does not require a petition for land use, does it still require the planning committee to establish an item? Does an enterprise funded solely by an individual need to establish a board of trustees, and if so, how shall it go about it? What about the legal basis for changes, dissolution, exchanges between shareholders, and share classification? What about the legal basis for the way capital is invested in a solely foreign-funded enterprise, time limits on capital payments, termination conditions etc.? 3) Important management problems. This includes inadequate capital payments into a solely foreign-funded enterprise, striking a proper ratio between production and marketing as determined, resolving long-time resistant deadlocks, setting up a legal person as an enterprise item, unwillingness to provide statistical reports etc. People on the Chinese mainland do not know how to deal with such problems. 4) Other problems. Most important is the pressure for medical care, housing, family planning, public safety and other services needed by the large labor force imported from outside the immediate area to work in solely foreign-funded enterprises. Once these enterprise operations have been fulfilled or completed ahead of time, these workers become surplus baggage. As many of these enterprises are labor-intensive operations, their expansion frequently leads to fighting with local enterprises for water, electricity, materials, markets etc. By taking away space that could be used for development of a new hi-tech industry, they hinder development and progress for the local industry as a whole. Furthermore, how to make timely duty refunds on indirect export of products from these enterprises, in accordance with related regulations (such a problem with duty refunds occurred in Xiamen where several solely foreign-funded enterprises owned by Taiwan business made a joint petition), how to resolve the labor management problems that frequently occur, ands how to protect the enterprise workers' welfare and other legal benefits are all very knotty problems.
