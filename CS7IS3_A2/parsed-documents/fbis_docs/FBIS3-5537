[Fuwa] During the deliberations on the political reform bills, the Diet's Yokusan nature after the coalition government's birth became evident. This was demonstrated by the Social Democratic Party of Japan's [SDPJ] endless, repeated compromises. Even the "heiritsu" system proposal, combining single-seat constituencies and proportional representation, was initiated by the LDP, which calls itself a strong opposition party, when it was in power. It is more than clear that the LDP is supporting the coalition through policy coordination. Mr. Hosokawa increasingly resembles his grandfather, former Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe. Like the Taisei Yokusan Kai [national organization for political control created in 1940] during the Konoe administration, most of the former opposition parties were coopted into the political regime, and a "new Yokusan structure," which has even made the LDP fall in line, was formed. This made the passage of the reform bills possible. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] As a result of the House of Councillors' rejection of the bills, the system for proportional representation was changed into a bloc system, which is disadvantageous to the JCP. Was it a strategic error on your part? [Fuwa] Some people said that it would have been better for the upper house not to reject the bills. That is a criticism that came after everything was over. For once, at least we succeeded in pushing for the bills' rejection. That is very different from accepting without putting up a fight. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Will you put up your own candidates for all 300 electoral districts under the new system? How would you campaign in the electoral blocs? [Fuwa] It goes without saying that we will do our best under whatever electoral system there is. We will put up candidates and fight in both the single-seat and proportional-representation constituencies. Even if the proportional representation elections will be fought in several blocs, we will fight in these elections and try to avoid making them impersonal campaigns. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you stand by your decision to refuse any government subsidy for your party? [Fuwa] There will be no change in that policy even after the system of subsidies for political parties goes into effect. It is our goal to work for an end to this system as soon as possible. From the experience of other countries, it is clear that official subsidies will only corrupt the political parties. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What do you think of future political alignment under the new system? [Fuwa] There has been talk of political realignment since the time of the LDP regime. The political regime has become a more nasty one after they experimented. Under the present political framework, no matter how hard the political forces other than the JCP try to create two or three major forces, they will be nothing more than alliances of convenience, and there can be nothing new. What we need now is to create a new trend of working for the people's interests. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] There has been dissension among the ruling parties on account of the national welfare tax and other issues. Do you think this will be the start of a realignment? [Fuwa] The Hosokawa administration's strategy is to take care of hiking the consumption tax rate before the upper house elections in summer 1995. The SDPJ is said to have resisted this. However, its counterproposal is not much different from the national welfare tax. The SDPJ's opposition and resistance consists of nothing more than postponing the issue for one year. I do not think the SDPJ will ever part ways with the administration and be the receptacle of the people's criticisms against the tax hike. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How would you confront the Hosokawa administration at the Budget Committee and on other occasions? [Fuwa] The Hosokawa administration is a successor to LDP politics. There is a tremendous gap between its slogans of reform and its real substance. We will vigorously oppose the budget draft, which has done nothing about subsidies and preferential tax treatment to big business and which is one-sidedly in favor of arms expansion, as evidenced by increased appropriations for U.S. military bases, and the purchase of AWACS (airborne warning and control system). Of course, we will also pursue the issue of the prime minister's alleged acceptance of 100 million yen from the Sagawa Kyubin Trucking Company.
