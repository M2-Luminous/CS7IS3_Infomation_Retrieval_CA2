The recent conference of G-7 finance ministers and central bank governors became an occasion to demand that Japan boost its domestic demand and reduce its surplus. It was a matter of course that the Western countries should make strong demands on Japan because Japan is still unable to extricate itself from the worst recession in the post-war period, and its current accounts surplus continues to grow. The Hosokawa administration has no recourse but to go back to the essentials of international coordination, exert efforts to expand domestic demand and open up the market, and reduce the surplus. That should be Japan's option, and this will contribute to an expanded equilibrium in the world economy. Although the main item on the agenda of this G-7 meeting was supposed to be aid to Russia, the Western nations' interests were focused rather on the expansion of domestic demand and surplus reduction in Japan. The G-7 made it clear that "this is not a problem only for Japan and the United States" (according to German Finance Minister Theo Waigel). With regard to the focal issue of tax cuts, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said that these will not only be limited to one year, but Japan intends to continue with tax cuts even beyond 1994. The recent Japan-U.S. summit broke down not just because of the contention on numerical targets. The United States had also perceived Japan's tax cuts to be limited to one year. Fujii's statement on continuing with the tax cuts was, of course, aimed at dispelling such a "misunderstanding." But the question of why this had not been declared at the Japan-U.S. summit remains. If Fujii's statement was a hasty deviation from the original plan in view of the Clinton administration's attitude toward Japan after the summit, then it was indeed a clumsy act. Some people might think that it is impertinent for foreign countries to meddle even in tax cuts in Japan. However, time and again, Japan has asked the United States to reduce its financial deficits at past G-7 meetings. On the other hand, Germany has consistently been asked to ease its monetary policy. If policy coordination among the advanced countries is indispensable for the world economy's development, then it is important to listen to what foreign countries have to say. However, the prerequisite for such coordination is to know each other's economic management well. The Hosokawa administration was incredibly inadequate in explaining Japan's economic stimulation measures, while the Clinton administration's lack of understanding was also appalling. The attitude of the Clinton administration, which condemned Japan's pump-priming measures as being ineffective from the very beginning, was not any better, if not worse, than the Japanese bureaucrats, whom the United States calls stubborn. Unfortunately, the two countries cannot be said to have narrowed such a perception gap at the recent G-7 meeting. The Japanese monetary authorities wanted to work for stable foreign exchange rates at the G-7, but it seems that the foreign exchange issue "was not a focus of the discussion" (according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen). Under the floating exchange rates system, monetary strategies do not work unless accompanied by financial policy coordination and large scale intervention [in the foreign exchange market]. The vague G-7 declaration, and rhetorical intervention by the monetary authorities can only influence the information-oriented market temporarily. After all, the foreign exchange rate reflects economic fundamentals. Looking at the fundamentals, for instance, the difference in the economic climate and the gap between interest rates in Japan and the United States, there will probably not be any rapid appreciation of the yen despite the tension in bilateral relations. Even the Clinton administration would like to avoid any excessive appreciation of the yen because this may lead to the depreciation of the dollar, and consequently, a rise in interest rates. Stability of the exchange rate all depends on whether Japan will be able to correct the trade imbalance through the expansion of domestic demands and market liberalization.
