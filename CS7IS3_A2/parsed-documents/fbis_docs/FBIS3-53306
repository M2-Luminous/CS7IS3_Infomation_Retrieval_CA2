First, every government in Islamabad has sought Chinese help in procuring military hardware and nuclear know-how and materials with varying degrees of success. Secondly, the Pakistanis have naturally attached the greatest importance to eliciting significant Chinese diplomatic support for its case on Kashmir. Benazir Bhutto's visit to Beijing has made hardly any difference to bilateral ties from either point of view. As far as the first objective is concerned, the Pakistan Prime Minister's talks with Premier Li Peng have not produced any dramatic result. None of the five documents on cooperation signed on this occasion relates to military items although the Pakistan Defence Minister, Aftab Shaban Mirani, along with the Foreign and Commerce Ministers, were present at the talks between the two delegations led by the PMs. It is not clear whether this is because Mirani, who was in Beijing three weeks ago also, had already transacted military business. The possibility of significant military purchases from China cannot, of course, be ruled out. If the two sides have decided to carry on covert business in this field, that is the established pattern all over the world. In terms of the requirements of Pakistan's current diplomacy, a new helpful gesture by China, on Kashmir was actually far more important to Benazir Bhutto. She has not achieved this purpose. Li Peng merely reiterated the known Chinese stand that India and Pakistan should resolve this question "through patient dialogue" and "welcomed efforts conducive to a settlement". This advice cannot have been sweet music to the visiting lady's ears. It is hardly distinguishable from what the Simla Agreement enjoins India and Pakistan to do. As is well know, Islamabad pays only lip-service to this agreement while moving heaven and earth to sabotage it in practice. The lesson to be drawn, therefore, is that the Chinese connection is unlikely to give Pakistan more diplomatic manoeuverability than hitherto. In a notable amplification of China's present policy on Kashmir, the Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Li Ruihuan, during his recent visit to New Delhi, had also condemned terrorism in any form. The sooner the Pakistani policy-makers realise the futility of concentrating on enlisting the support of other countries for its claim to Kashmir instead of reaching an amicable settlement with India, the better it will be for regional peace and stability. To reject such a shift in the face of the demands of the new international situation will be to cling to a world of make-believe. The challenge before Benazir Bhutto is to lead her people not back into the dreary past, but towards a reassuring future.
