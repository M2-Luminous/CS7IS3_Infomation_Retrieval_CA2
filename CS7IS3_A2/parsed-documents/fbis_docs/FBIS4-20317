First, central-local relations are being tested across the board. Second, the war against corruption is facing a serious test. Third, the gaps in regional development are widening, as are income disparities between the different strata, which has a substantial impact on the public psychology. Fourth, there is the possibility of serious sudden incidents breaking out in some localities. Fifth, law and order is in serious trouble. These five major contradictions, which cause the CPC authorities much anxiety, are the very factors that may touch off unrest in China today. They also epitomize what is wrong with Chinese society at the moment. As far as central-local relations are concerned, the most likely trouble spot, if the current situation is any guide, is Muslim areas in the northwest. Shaken by riots by the Hui nationality in Qinghai in the fall of 1993, Zhongnanhai is now very nervous about the situation in the northeast. Its instruction to the local governments is that they absolutely must do a good job in nationalities work and prevent anybody from stirring up trouble in the name of religion. The government is scrutinizing what is being said in the press in the Hui areas most closely, fearful that the slightest linguistic indiscretion would again anger the Muslims and ignite a disaster similar to the Qinghai riots. Dominated by the Han nationality, many people believe, China does not face the prospect of dissolution in the manner of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. Yet Chinese history is replete with examples of instant disintegration after the demise of a centralized imperial authority. Besides, the CPC regime today is very similar to the centralized monarchies in Chinese history. Will the Chinese mainland remain unified as central power wanes and CPC authoritarianism further declines after Deng Xiaoping's death? Hard to say right now. The takeoff of the Chinese economy has brought prosperity, but prosperity is not exactly the same thing as stability. Prosperity itself has spawned new social problems such as corruption and the unequal distribution of wealth, all breeding grounds of social unrest. The more prosperous the economy, the bigger the problems. The Shenzhen Special Economic Zone is the nation's corruption and degeneration capital. The officialdom in Shenzhen, the ordinary people say, is a hotbed of corruption; there is not a single cadre in the city who is not on the take. Measured by the charges against the several economic criminals whom the CPC has openly executed by shooting, two-thirds of the members of the CPC municipal committee should also be killed by the firing squad. Then there are the relatives of the cadres and officials who speculate in land and stock, making a killing thanks to their power and influence. The common people see everything and feel bitter at heart. There is a groundswell of resentment. In the booming coastal areas, individual-household upstarts and bureaucratic capitalists wallow in dissipation and luxury, their way of life consisting of the so-called "one big and three smalls," that is, "big brother" and "minor wife, small car, and small villa." Side by side with the nouveau riches, however, are tens of thousands of low-paid workers from the provinces in the interior, toiling in factories and experiencing the brutality of what Marx called capitalist primitive accumulation. After seeing how they lived, a Beijing reporter said it was as tragic as the lot of the "indentured laborers" in Shanghai in the 1930's as portrayed by veteran writer Xia Yan [1115 5888]. After witnessing the shocking polarization between the rich and the poor in the coastal areas, he could not help but sigh with feeling, saying he would not be surprised if there occurred another round of unrest similar to the Shenzhen stock market riots. Owing th the erosion of social values and the gradual decline of the authoritativeness of the CPC dictatorship, the mainland society is showing signs of getting out of control. Law and order on the mainland is in worse shape today than in 1949 when the KMT was in power. Serious crimes such as car theft, highway and river robbery, armed robbery, drug-trafficking, prostitution, abduction, and kidnapping have been on the rise relentlessly. There were over 70 bank robberies in broad daylight on the mainland in the first 11 months of 1993 and 11 bank employees were killed. Most of the bank robbers carried firearms. A Taiwan businessman who traveled back and forth between two cities regularly reported witnessing three major hold-ups by gangs within 5 days. He said he had travelled on business to countries like the Philippines and India, nations notorious for their lawlessness, but had never before seen anything this frightening. He said, "In terms of law and order, the mainland is about even with the black neighborhoods of New York City." According to the internal documents of the Ministry of Public Security, law and order has broken down in many border areas and villages and at numerous locations along the highways and railways, where serious crimes like smuggling, prostitution, drug-trafficking, and gang robberies are commonplace. Mainland sociologists predict that social law and order will continue to deteriorate as the urban unemployment rate keeps climbing because of economic reform and as haphazard rural migration worsens by the day. Inadvertently or otherwise, the Sociology Institute of CASS has omitted the most serious problem in China today, namely agriculture. The most dangerous thing today, both the mainlanders and people overseas say, is peasants making trouble. [passage omitted] In early 1993 peasants in Renshou County, Sichuan Province, staged anti-tax riots lasting five months. This time around the CPC regime did not despatch tanks and AK-47 rifles to put down the uprising, which was how it dealt with the students on Tiananmen Square. Not only did it stress appeasement, but it even released Zhang Dean [1728 1795 1344] and Xiang Wenqing [0686 2429 5237], two peasant leaders who headed the tax protest, but was also forced to take practical measures to ease the heavy burden on peasants in the county. It has been said that this was the first time in 40 years that the CPC buckled under popular resistance. It had no other choice, people in the know say. Already the flames of the peasant movement in Renshou County and neighboring areas were spreading. During the disturbances, 17 peasants' associations sprang up spontaneously in Renshou County overnight. Trouble was also brewing in the surrounding counties. Any forcible suppression would have ignited a mass uprising throughout the province. [passage omitted] The peasant riots in Renshou County should not have taken the CPC by surprise. By the time Deng Xiaoping toured southern China in 1992, fueling a second bout of "economic reform fever," the seriousness of China's agricultural crisis was quite pronounced. In the beginning, reform--fixing farm output quotas for each household--generated a measure of short-term prosperity in Chinese agriculture. But this was followed by stagnation and decline. Reformers were wholly preoccupied with industry and investment in agriculture began a steady decline. Investments in capital construction in agriculture in 1992 accounted for a mere 3 percent of all fixed assets investments in the whole country, a historic low. Because of inflation, agricultural production costs also rose continuously, increasing the burden on peasants and causing bankruptcies in agriculture, a bad omen. Reports say that villagers in Sichuan Province, long known as the land of milk and honey, were so overwhelmed by the burden that they went on strike. Peasants in Jianyang County, Sichuan Province, pulled up rice seedlings that they had planted painstakingly, declaring that never again would they grow crops. Or turn over grain to the state. But the peasants' woes are not limited to these. Caught in a cash squeeze, the Chinese Government in recent years has been shifting its fiscal difficulty to the most impoverished members of Chinese society: the peasantry. Consequently, peasants turn over grain to the state only to be given IOU's. When the children of peasants who have found jobs elsewhere remit money home, the post office refuses to cash them, issuing "green slips" instead. Furthermore, peasants are slapped with all sorts of the most outrageous and exorbitant taxes and levies. Mainland newspapers frequently carry reports of peasants being driven to commit suicide by drowning or hanging, an entire family ruined in the process. Chinese peasants have gotten to the point where they could no longer continue living. In many localities peasants gang up with one another and turn to banditry, robbing trains and cars and stealing public installations mostly just to survive; one can no longer feed and clothe one's family doing legal work alone. There is a village in Sichuan inhabited by poor peasants. Driven by poverty, the peasants dug some big holes on the highway, making it impassable by car. Only when the drivers paid a toll did they fill up the holes and let the cars go through. Leaders of the CPC, including Jiang Zemin [3068 3419 3046], inspected the countryside in 1992. What they saw made them tremble with fear and gave them many a sleepless night. Reportedly they asked the peasants, "What do you need?" Answer: "Chen Sheng [7115 0524] and Wu Guang [0702 1639]." Asked what they would like to do, the peasants said, "Sweep Li Zicheng's [2621 5261 2052] grave." Peasant riots in Renshou County may very well be the harbinger of a more extensive peasant uprising in the future. Experts on the Chinese peasantry note that sporadic peasant disturbances are now springing up all over China. [passage omitted]
