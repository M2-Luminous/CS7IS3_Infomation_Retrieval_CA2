If NATO is used as a model, Moscow could closely study, for instance, the appointment of a supreme commander of naval forces in the Black Sea who would be an operational commander of both fleets, the officer said. He added that in this case the supreme commander would be appointed by Russia. In his opinion another option is also possible: the operational subordination of the Ukrainian navy to the Black Sea Fleet. Earlier Ukraine had insisted on the approval of a supreme commander by the presidents of the two countries. The commander was supposed to have one deputy from Ukraine and another from Russia.
