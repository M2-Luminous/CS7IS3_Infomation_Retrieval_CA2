The conflict flared up over Pyongyang's reluctance to renounce its nuclear ambitions and to satisfy the requirements of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] concerning inspection of a reactor producing plutonium suitable for the production of nuclear weapons. The U.S. Administration is holding intensive consultations with other states on this problem. "We are taking a firm line," Bill Clinton stated yesterday. "We are going to the UN Security Council with a draft resolution on sanctions." In response to these statements the DPRK leadership has warned that any sanctions will be viewed as a "declaration of war." This is what has forced its southern neighbor to take "all measures necessary to give an immediate and decisive rebuff in the event of any agression from the North." Incidentally, U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry has stated that, if necessary, the United States would be prepared to strengthen the contingent of 38,000 troops already in South Korea. The situation on the Korean peninsula has reached fever pitch. The United States, it would appear, is attempting to put together a coalition against the DPRK similar to the one that George Bush organized during the Gulf War. However, it is extremely doubtful that Clinton will manage to form a similar "alliance," and he would risk triggering a second Korean war, whose consequences would be catastrophic. Moscow's stance in the current situation was spelled out in the proposal put forward by Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin's suggestion that an international conference be called to search for mutually acceptable solutions to this conflict.
