The IAEA, in a statement available here, said it had suspended the investigation because some "important measures which had been agreed were refused at the radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon." "As a result of this rejection, the IAEA Secretariat had to brief the board that the agency was not in a position to verify that there had been no diversion of nuclear material at the facility where the relevant measures were rejected," the statement said. The IAEA team of inspectors made an inspection visit to the DPRK from March 1 to 15, based upon an understanding as to the aim and scope of the inspection reached in Vienna on February 15. In an informal briefing in Vienna earlier today the team informed the board of governors the detailed results must await performance of follow-up analytical and evaluation work in Vienna. However, the board members were informed that although many of the agreed inspection measures were carried out as envisaged, "other important measures" which had been agreed were refused. According to the statement, a meeting of the board of governors on this subject will be held on Monday [21 March].
