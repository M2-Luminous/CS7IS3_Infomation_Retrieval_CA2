FBIS4-2919 "drchi073_f_94006" FBIS-CHI-94-073 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 Near East & South Asia Iraq Denies Involvement Iraq Denies Involvement OW1404202994 Beijing XINHUA in English 1922 GMT 14 Apr 94 OW1404202994 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Baghdad, April 14 (XINHUA) -- The Iraqi authorities have no knowledge of the incident today in Northern Iraq involving the crash of two military helicopters of foreign forces there, an official spokesman said. A statement by the spokesman to this effect was carried by the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY. The spokesman said the Iraqi Air Force was not engaged in any activity in the region at the time of the incident. Two U.S. Army helicopters were shot down over the "no-fly zone" in Northern Iraq today. Earlier Western news reports said the helicopters were shot down by Iraqi warplanes. Later the United States confirmed that they were shot down by two American F-15 fighter jets. The U.S. helicopters had been mistakenly identified as Iraqi aircraft operating in the "no-fly zone." It was reported that more than 20 "high-level" people on board were killed. The "no-fly zone" was created by the United States and its allies in Northern Iraq shortly after the end of the 1991 Gulf war and allied planes have since been patrolling the zone over Northern Iraq allegedly to protect Kurds from government attacks.
