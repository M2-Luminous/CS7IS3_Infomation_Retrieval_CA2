Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz is in the studio with the details: Several words separate Israel and the PLO and are holding up the official announcement on the resumption of the Taba talks. Most of the work has, in fact, already been done and has enabled official political sources in Jerusalem to say today that the deliberations will be renewed next week, and only the day still has to be decided. The telephone dialogue between Shim'on Peres and Nabil Sha'th has so far led to the following outcome: The Taba talks will discuss the Cairo understandings and the Declaration of Principles. The PLO is pleased because it refers to understandings and no longer talks about the Cairo agreement or document. Israel is satisfied because it is based on the Cairo Liaison Committee and not on the Oslo or Versailles talks, as demanded by the PLO. Israel is also pleased about something else; Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said several times recently that Yasir 'Arafat's recent demands are deviations from the Oslo documents. The contacts are due to continue this evening. Foreign Minister Peres is due to talk on the telephone again with Nabil Sha'th. Peres also spoke with 'Arafat's special adviser Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi several times today. Correspondent Ya'aqov Balsenboim reports on Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's visit to the Meqorot company today: [Begin recording] [Balsenboim] Rabin was the guest of the Meqorot company which inaugurated Jerusalem's fourth water pipeline, but he could not avoid journalists' questions about the crisis in the peace talks. The first question put to him was when would the Taba talks resume: [Rabin] I hope that they will be resumed when a suitable basis is found, if there is agreement on what was achieved in Cairo. If there is no agreement then everything is open. [Balsenboim] The prime minister added that if the Cairo agreement is not approved by Tunis then we are also not bound by what was agreed upon. [Rabin] It is true that it was known beforehand that any agreement reached in Cairo depends on the approval of the leaderships in Tunis and Jerusalem. No approval was apparently received in Tunis for some of the things achieved in Cairo. If this is the case, then from our standpoint, things said in Cairo do not have to be approved by us. [Balsenboim] Asked about a possible meeting with 'Arafat, Rabin said it is more important to reach agreement on the Gaza-Jericho First agreement. [Rabin] I do not think that at this stage such a meeting is the issue. The aim is to find real answers to permit us to implement the commitment to the Declaration of Principles, to translate it into a detailed Gaza-Jericho First agreement. Implementation will not start before we reach such an agreement. [Balsenboim] To conclude, Rabin added that independent contributions by ministers and Knesset members to the negotiations are superfluous. [Rabin] I think that at this stage, it is preferable to leave the negotiations to those who have to handle them and independent contributions are superfluous. [end recording]
