FBIS4-9288 "dreeu079_y_94004" FBIS-EEU-94-079 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 YUGOSLAVIA Federal Russian Duma Delegation Meets With Officials Russian Duma Delegation Meets With Officials LD2204175694 Belgrade TANJUG in English 1629 GMT 22 Apr 94 LD2204175694 Belgrade TANJUG English BFN ["Pool" item] [Text] Belgrade, April 22 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Prime Minister Radoje Kontic said on Friday [22 April] that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia resolutely urges a political and peaceful solution to the crisis in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and supports Russia's principled and objective stand on the crisis in ex-Yugoslav territory. In talks with a delegation of the Russian parliament's lower house [State Duma], Kontic said that Russia's efforts have prevented the escalation of the fighting in Bosnia and underscored that the further continuation of the international sanctions against Yugoslavia practically prolongs the crisis in the former Yugoslav territory. The head of the Russian parliamentary delegation, Nikolay Bezbirodov, said that the aim of the visit is to see for themselves the situation in Yugoslavia and the developments in Bosnia, and thus enable the lower house of the Russian parliament to make objective and principled decisions. Bezbirodov, who is deputy chairman of the parliamentary Defence Committee, said that he lower house is aware that the sanctions should be lifted and that they do not contribute to the resolution of the crisis in ex-Yugoslav territory. He said that the lower house is opposed to the use of military power in the settlement of the Bosnian crisis and that all conflicts should be resolved through negotiations, in a peaceful way. The Russian delegation also met with the Speaker of the Yugoslav Parliament's lower house, Radoman Bozovic, who said that peace in Bosnia should be established immediately along the separation lines and then that all international institutions should be engaged to take part in political talks on all open issues. He said that the peace process requires the objective and equal treatment of the Serb people, on the same footing as all the other warring sides. Pointing out that it is senseless to further maintain the sanctions against Yugoslavia, the Russian delegation said that a legal project on their lifting had been drafted in the lower house, but that the procedure had been halted for the present due to the deterioration of the situation in Gorazde.
