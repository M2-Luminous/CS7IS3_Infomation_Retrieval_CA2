This means that one who is a bad man by nature can only say bad things. This was the case with the puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam when he made a so-called New Year's address. In making silly gibberish, he raved that the new year should be made a year for eliminating still-remaining irregularities and corruption and making a new, clean society. In other words, he intends to continue with the reform game. This is really dumbfounding. Since traitor Kim Yong-sam came to power wearing a mask of a civilian regime, the wind of reform has blown frantically in South Korea for nearly a year. However, the result has been horrible. To conduct a real reform in the colonial fascist South Korean society, they should realize that the people aspire for independence and democratization in the first place. To eliminate corruption and irregularities, they should take practical measures to preclude illegal amassment of wealth in the first place. They should distinguish themselves clearly from their preceding military fascist regimes, and rectify the wrongs of the past. However, the puppet clique, instead of implementing a reform aimed at freeing itself from the domination of a foreign force, left South Korea totally under the domination of a foreign force. Furthermore, the puppet clique raved that the foreign force should dominate the Korean peninsula after the reunification, as well. Since it came to power, the puppet clique has kept intact the fascist evil laws, such as the National Security Law, and the suppressive organizations, such as the Agency for National Security Planning, the police, and the prosecutor's office. Further strengthening their function and authority, the puppet clique is stepping up the degree of suppression on the people. The Kim Yong-sam clique, which had raved about departing from his preceding dictatorial regimes, pardoned the murderers of Kwangju, babbling that it could not jeopardize the future simply because it had a bad sentiment of the past event. While raving that it would root out irregularities, it purged its rival forces and was bent on strengthening its basis for power. The aftermath of the implementation of the real-name financial transaction system, which the Kim Yong-sam clique claimed to be the reform of reforms, brought about further bankruptcy and a decline in the economy. Agriculture ended up with a bad crop, the worst in 80 years, shrinking the rice harvest by over 10 million sacks compared with the volume originally anticipated. The stern reality of South Korea for nearly a one-year period, last year, clearly showed that the reform, which the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique publicized so loudly, was not reform for the better but reform for the worse. The falsity of the so-called reform has been exposed thoroughly. There is nothing the workers, the peasants, and the popular masses gained from it. Nevertheless, traitor Kim Yong-sam made a gibberish about reform again. This is a deception and mockery of the South Korean people once again. More intolerable is the fact that he, in a so-called New Year's address, criticized us, saying that the suspicion of the North's nuclear weapons development should be resolved. As has been reported, in the recent contact, the DPRK and the United States removed a series of (?obstacles), which had brought the DPRK-U.S. talks into a stalemate, displaying the spirit of understanding and cooperation toward each other, thus bringing forth a breakthrough for the progress of the talks. At a time like this, traitor Kim Yong-sam made a presumptuous blunder of criticizing us. This reveals his vicious scheme to step up the slanderous maneuvers to harm the fellow countrymen in the new year under the pretext of the suspicion of our fictitious nuclear program. He raved about the suspicion of our nuclear program as soon as the new year began, out of fear that the U.S. promise to maintain the international cooperation system it gave him during his junket to the United States last November in return for the total opening of the South Korean rice market may come to naught. It is presumptuous and indiscreet of him, the puppet clique without any real power or voice, to babble about the issue that is to be resolved between the DPRK and the United States. Delivering a so-called New Year's address, he was not able to say anything new but repeated the old tune. This is far from surprising. Traitor Kim Yong-sam is a completely ignorant man without any independent opinion or political philosophy, a politico in whose belly there is only the greed for power, and a dirty man. The South Korean people are well aware that no matter what traitor Kim Yong-sam raves about doing something in the new year, they have nothing to expect from it. They, therefore, are determined to fight against the clique to the end. The Kim Yong-sam clique, the flunkeyist traitor who turned against the country and the nation, will not be able to escape from the stern judgment of history and the people.
