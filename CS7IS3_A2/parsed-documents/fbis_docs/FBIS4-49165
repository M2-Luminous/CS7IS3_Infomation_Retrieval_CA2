"If we were to withdraw the most favored nation status from China, it would undermine what I hope to see in terms of our relationship," Clinton told CNN from Atlanta, Georgia. "And it would be detrimental to the economic progress of China and to the standard of living which has come to so many millions, indeed hundreds of millions of Chinese people," he added. The President claimed that what he had sought to do is "to find a balanced way for our two countries not simply to be partners, but to restore our genuine friendship" by trying to establish conditions that would permit that partnership and that friendship to go forward. "Those are the criteria I set forward in order to continue the Most Favored Nation status next month," he said. "I will say we have made real progress in our relations with China" in many areas, Clinton said, but "we still have a way to go." He stressed that "I would work personally very hard to work out our differences so that we could go forward together." Clinton also claimed that human rights is very important to the United States and there are some issues that the United States has an extra responsibility to stand up for: human rights, non-proliferation and other things. "I am doing it in the spirit of genuine reconciliation and hope that in the next month our two great nations can work this out," the President said.
