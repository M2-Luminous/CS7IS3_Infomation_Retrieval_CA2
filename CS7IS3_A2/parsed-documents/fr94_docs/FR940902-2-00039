ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Department of Health and Human Services notifies Federal agencies of the laboratories currently certified to meet standards of Subpart C of Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs (59 FR 29916, 29925). A similar notice listing all currently certified laboratories will be published during the first week of each month, and updated to include laboratories which subsequently apply for and complete the certification process. If any listed laboratory's certification is totally suspended or revoked, the laboratory will be omitted from updated lists until such time as it is restored to full certification under the Guidelines. If any laboratory has withdrawn from the National Laboratory Certification Program during the past month, it will be identified as such at the end of the current list of certified laboratories, and will be omitted from the monthly listing thereafter. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mrs. Giselle Hersh, Division of Workplace Programs, Room 13A&hyph;54, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857; Tel.: (301) 443&hyph;6014. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing were developed in accordance with Executive Order 12564 and section 503 of Public Law 100&hyph;71. Subpart C of the Guidelines, ``Certification of Laboratories Engaged in Urine Drug Testing for Federal Agencies,'' sets strict standards which laboratories must meet in order to conduct urine drug testing for Federal agencies. To become certified, an applicant laboratory must undergo three rounds of performance testing plus an on-site inspection. To maintain that certification a laboratory must participate in a quarterly performance testing program plus periodic, on-site inspections. Laboratories which claim to be in the applicant stage of certification are not to be considered as meeting the minimum requirements expressed in the HHS Guidelines. A laboratory must have its letter of certification from SAMHSA, HHS (formerly: HHS/NIDA) which attests that it has met minimum standards. In accordance with Subpart C of the Guidelines, the following laboratories meet the minimum standards set forth in the Guidelines: Aegis Analytical Laboratories, Inc., 624 Grassmere Park Rd., Suite 21, Nashville, TN 37211, 615&hyph;331&hyph;5300 Alabama Reference Laboratories, Inc., 543 South Hull St., Montgomery, AL 36103, 800&hyph;541&hyph;4931/205&hyph;263&hyph;5745 Allied Clinical Laboratories, 201 Plaza Boulevard, Hurst, TX 76053, 817&hyph;282&hyph;2257 American Medical Laboratories, Inc., 14225 Newbrook Dr., Chantilly, VA 22021, 703&hyph;802&hyph;6900 Associated Pathologists Laboratories, Inc., 4230 South Burnham Ave., Suite 250, Las Vegas, NV 89119&hyph;5412, 702&hyph;733&hyph;7866 Associated Regional and University Pathologists, Inc.
