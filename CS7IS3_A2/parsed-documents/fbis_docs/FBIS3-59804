During that meeting, the Iranian president attempted to circumvent the new Majles and its bloc leaders who had competed with him for power after they had deceived him by posing as his allies in his struggle with the extremists who were led by Mahdi Karubi, former speaker of the previous Majles. In the presence of all the members of Majles, with the exception of Nateq-Nuri, the speaker of Majles, Rafsanjani proposed that Velayati visit all member states of the Gulf Council in order to improve relations between them and Iran before pilgrimage time in view of the rumors and instigations, which that period brings with it. As soon as Rafsanjani convinced the Council members of the validity of his viewpoint, it was agreed that the Council would present a detailed study to the mentor of the revolution, Ali Khamene'i, in order to win his support and to send Velayati on a mission, the purpose of which stretches beyond the diplomatic reasons given at the time, namely the improvement of relations between the Gulf states and Iran and concern for regional security. The study, which was surrounded by great secrecy, referred quite plainly and clearly to the enormous difficulties facing the Islamic regime in Iran. The study warned that those difficulties might lead to an explosive situation in the capital itself similar to the one that took place in the cities of Meshed, Shiraz, and Arak last year when the disturbances and demonstrations were a warning of an imminent danger, which made the officials aware of the possibility of a confrontation between the people and the regime. The study highlighted the economic aspect, which it viewed as the strongest factor in influencing the regime and altering its tendencies and policies, and probably leading to its demise "unless bold and courageous decisions are taken to restore to the people its faith in the Government and its Administration as well as in those in charge of the situation in Iran." The study allocated a large section to the relations with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in light of the important changes and developments in the region following the second Gulf war. The study quoted Rafsanjani as saying that there was no way for Iran to survive and enhance the trust between the people and the government, and to improve the economic conditions, except through the improvement of relations with Riyad and said "which is the key to the solution of all our economic, political, and even social problems." But the wishes of Rafsanjani and even Khamene'i soon clashed with the fundamentalist factions and the Khomeyni issue. In his will, Khomeyni had indeed left strong words that could create problems for Rafsanjani, as well as to the mentor of the revolution, and lead to a fierce outbreak of the internal situation should they attempt to draw close to Saudi Arabia. This issue was raised by Ahmad Khomeyni during the meeting of the Supreme Council for National Security. The study answered the issue by stressing the need for a Rafsanjani initiative and for a statement expressing his desire to visit Riyad. As to the timing of the visit, the study indicated that it should take place during the Hajj in view of its effects and impact on the Iranian people and on the Hezbollah party, as well as on other revolutionary followers of Ayatollah al-Khomeyni. In fact, Rafsanjani did launch his initiative by sending his Foreign Minister Velayati in the name of the policy of overture adopted by the president. To counter that attempt, the speaker of Majles, Nateq-Nuri, launched an opposing initiative by holding a meeting he called with the leaders of the "New Revolutionary Students." During that meeting he answered the participants' questions regarding the forthcoming visit of Rafsanjani to Saudi Arabia, and he revealed that Rafsanjani's Gulf visit, as well as that of Velayati, were planned during the session of the Supreme Council for National Security and was supported by the mentor of the revolution. It was obvious that Nateq-Nuri wanted to distance himself from the responsibility and the implications of Rafsanjani's visit and its effects on the Iranian people. At the same time, he wanted to embarrass Rafsanjani, especially at a time when the latter was overwhelmed by the presidential elections and the frenetic search for as large a number of voters as he could get to face the Parliamentary blocs who wished to curtail his authority and test his ability. The Alliance of the Fundamentalists Nuri felt that what he had done so far was not enough. Nor was he content with instigating the "revolutionary" students and inciting them to organize demonstrations against Rafsanjani, accusing him of deviating from the path of the Imam and his revolutionary approach. In fact, huge demonstrations were organized and a number of rallies proceeded to march but were not allowed by Rafsanjani to leave the university campus. But the organizers of the protest filled the streets and highways with posters carrying slogans hostile to Rafsanjani's policies. Both the Majles and Nateq-Nuri went even further. The speaker of Majles paid a spectacular visit to Qom, the stronghold of the clerics and the leaders of the Shi'ite governing institution. There, he held long meetings with Ayatollah Fazel Lankarani whose influence is taken into consideration, with apprehension, by both Khamene'i and Rafsanjani, in the configuration of the balance of power. What Nuri did also, was to open up to Ayatollah Lanakrani and the other religious leaders, telling them everything he wanted to say hoping to win their support in his confrontation with Rafsanjani. Not to be outdone, Rafsanjani, who was backed by Khamene'i, went to Qumm. However, his visit was a failure because he failed to win the support of the Ayatollah there. Moreover, Rafsanjani was harshly criticised because of the bad economy and its harmful and dangerous effects on the social conditions. Rafsanjani, as well as other observers, realized that the hands that were fomenting the internal instability in Iran, were not necessarily foreign. In fact, both Nateq-Nuri and Muhammadi Reyshahri, together with their supporters, could, by opposing the president, upset the internal configuration of power and harm the foreign relations of Iran, especially with the Arab Gulf states. It is relevant to note that all those who view Rafsanjani as their competitor and as a deviationist dictator, have formed an alliance against him, an alliance that spans from the far right to the far left on the Iranian map of political forces. This was obvious by the number of votes the president received during the presidential elections, and the parliamentary sessions for the vote of confidence on the Government, when Rafsanjani received a nonconfidence vote for his minister of economy and finance, Dr. Mohsen Nurbakhsh. So Rafsanjani found himself in a "bottleneck," and as he did not wish to be burned twice from the same spot, he threw all his cards in Khamene'i's basket and allied himself with him, having convinced him of a bitter reality, namely that all fundamentalists, both the former and the new, did not believe in Khamene'i's authority. The new fundamentalists, whose leader in Majles is the speaker of Majles, Nateq-Nuri, even though they recognize the competence of Khamene'i as a Faqih [Muslim scholar], they follow the religious teaching of Ayatollah Azari-Qomi, and the political decisions of Ayatollah Mahdavi-Kani. As to the former fundamentalists who are today shunned and harassed, they are led by the former speaker of Majles, Mehdi Karrubi. They formed an alliance with the person they had once defeated and made him lose the position of al-Faqih and the succession of Khomeyni, namely Ayatollah 'Ali Montazeri, to whom they secretly paid allegiance. Rafsanjani and Khamene'i have decided to improve relations with Saudi Arabia because they are convinced that it constituted the key to the solution of the problems of Iran, as mentioned in the study referred to above. As result, Khamene'i forced the speaker of Majles, Nateq-Nuri, to attend the meeting of the Supreme Council for National Security held at the time when the OPEC foreign ministers were meeting in Geneva to study the dangerous effects of the low prices of oil on the economy and hence the social situation and the internal stability of Iran. The meeting of the Supreme Council for National Security, which met at Rafsanjani's request, concluded its meeting by reaffirming the recommendations of the previous study of the Council presented to Khamene'i, namely the need to improve relations with Riyad and the approval of Rafsanjani's trip to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and his meeting with the custodian of the two holy mosques, King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz. And because the first Rafsanjani study won the approval of Khameni'i, the second study gave Rafsanjani the green light to contact King Fahd and fulfill his desire to meet with him while his innermost feeling saying: "Deliver us from the falling oil prices, God will have mercy upon you." Some informed Iranian sources said that Rafsanjani, during his telephone conversation with the Saudi King, discussed the question of mutual cooperation on the question of oil and promised to find a solution to the problems between the two countries, foremost among those problems, were the problems of Hajj and 'Umra. This pilgrimage problem arose when Rafsanjani's enemies sent groups of non-Iranians to Saudi Arabia first for pilgrimage, and later to the other Arab Gulf States. While in Saudi Arabia, Velayati told King Fahd of Rafsanjani's desire to meet with him wherever he wishes, either in Tehran or Riyad. This request was interpreted by the observers as an expression of Rafsanjani's desire to visit the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The custodian of the two holy mosques responded by opening his house to the visitor and by expressing his hope that Rafsanjani would visit Riyad so as the two could meet in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. During Velayati's visit to Saudi Arabia, Rafsanjani made a declaration intended to enhance his initiative. He said that he would soon meet the Saudi king and he expressed his wish to improve Iranian-Arab relations. He went even further and said that he looked forward to the west and hoped to build strong relations with all states without exception. However, Rafsanjani's initiative failed at that time because Nateq-Nuri and the new fundamentalists took over the Majles by winning more seats, all of which belonged to the leaders of the Muslim fundamentalist movements. Rafsanjani's Victory The telephone conversation between Rafsanjani and the Saudi king, which took place under the aegis and support of the mentor of the revolution, Khamene'i, opened the way to Rafsanjani to tighten his control and enhance his position vis-a-vis Nateq-Nuri and the fundamentalists, so Nuri found himself bound to accept Khamene'i's decision because the speaker of Majles and all the followers of Mahdavi-Kani and Azari-Qomi wished to appear as paying allegiance to the authority of the Faqih as represented by Khamene'i. On Thursday (30 September) Nateq-Nuri gave a well-prepared interview to TEHRAN TIMES, the mouthpiece of the new fundamentalists. In that interview, he said that the telephone conversation between Rafsanjani and King Fahd took place with the consent of Khamene'i and at the request of the Supreme Council for National Security. This reveals the extent of the importance that Rafsanjani's administration attach to Saudi Arabia for the solution of the economic problems of Iran. In an ostentatious show of allegiance to Khamene'i, Nateq-Nuri felt compelled to assert that both Iran and Saudi Arabia play a major and important role in stabilizing and raising the prices of oil within the framework of OPEC. Nuri went as far as to quote from Rafsanjani's previous study, which Nuri had then opposed, namely "that if Iran wishes to solve its problems within OPEC, it has to cooperate with Saudi Arabia." However, Nateq-Nuri did not wish to accept his fate and that of his group, so he deliberately mentioned the forthcoming visit of Rafsanjani to Saudi Arabia even though Rafsanjani did not mention it following his conversation with King Fahd. Nateq-Nuri added that the telephone conversation between Rafsanjani and Fahd, as well as "the visits among officials" would help Iran reach its goal within OPEC. Rafsanjani had not revealed his forthcoming visit to Saudi Arabia, which he hoped to undertake without prior announcement. But the fact that Nateq-Nuri mentioned it, proved that Nuri and his group were still intent on putting sticks into Rafsanjani's wheels so as to arouse the fundamentalists against him. It is apparent that there are wise men and moderates who work to transfer Iran from the revolutionary positions and the proliferation of the centers of power to an area of the state where a unified decisionmaking system could be established. That is why Rafsanjani decided, before announcing his latest initiative, to restrict the freedom of certain extremist newspapers, which can stir public opinion in Iran against him. Subsequently, he arrested Abbas 'Abdi, the editor of the paper SALAM, mouthpiece of the former fundamentalists who had lost their positions in Majles and had boycotted the government but who, nevertheless had kept some power and influence in Majles. Rafsanjani hinted to his supporters in the Judiciary to exert pressure in various ways on the press. This led all the newspapers, especially SALAM, to appear "rational" and to tone down their outspokenness, and, for the first time since the inception of the Islamic Revolution, to curb down their criticism of the Iranian-Saudi rapprochement. Moreover, several newspapers welcomed Rafsanjani's initiative and published the views of various economic analysts and experts saying that the agreement reached in Geneva was a historic victory to Tehran, which could not have been reached without that telephone conversation and without the coordination displayed during OPEC's meeting between the two major parties, namely, Iran and Saudi Arabia. Those analysts who were frightened by Rafsanjani's stick, expressed optimism that the latest OPEC agreement could lead to an increase in the prices of oil, which have been steadily falling. Few of them went even further and called for a summit conference for OPEC in order to enhance the standing of the organization "despite the existing political differences," among the member states. It is obvious that the Iranian economy, especially in the current phase that requires construction and economic reforms, relies on the income from oil; so the drop in oil prices constitutes an unfortunate beginning for the launching of the programs of the Second Five-Year Plan. This in turn is a serious indicator that would increase inflation, aggravate an already bad economic situations, and cause the disruption of the internal social fabric, and eventually, lead to disturbances, especially in Tehran, where it could threaten the regime and its projects. All the above-mentioned issues were discussed by the Supreme Council for National Security before it asked Rafsanjani to contact King Fahd.
