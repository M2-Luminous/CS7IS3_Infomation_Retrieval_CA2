FR940620-0-00087 FR940620-0-00029 Many commenters stated that, rather than requiring automatic or power assisted doors, the Board should establish technical provisions for acceptable door opening pressure and allow State and local government entities flexibility in meeting the provision. Commenters suggested that allowing entities the flexibility to choose the means by which they achieve this door pressure may lead to the development and application of new technology and prevent reliance on electronic devices. Commenters' views on the location and type of operating mechanisms to be used varied greatly. Other commenters indicated that there may be security problems with requiring automatic or power assisted doors for detention and correctional facilities. Response. Recently, the Board sponsored a research project to provide recommended scoping and technical provisions for automatic or power assisted doors applicable to both State and local government facilities and private entities. The Board has decided not to consider issuing guidelines in this area until the results of the study have been analyzed. The final report is available from the Board. Currently, State and local government facilities and private entities are encouraged to exercise the option, consistent with ADAAG 4.13.12 (Automatic Doors and Power Assisted Doors), to use automatic or power assisted doors to increase accessibility. Alterations Based on comments received in response to the initial rulemaking for ADAAG, the NPRM proposed that ADAAG 4.1.6(2) apply to facilities subject to title II of the ADA. (See 56 FR 2319, January 22, 1991). ADAAG 4.1.6(2) requires that where alterations affect or could affect the usability of or access to an area containing a primary function, the entity shall make the alteration in such a manner that, to the maximum extent feasible, the path of travel to the altered area and the restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the altered area are accessible to the extent that the costs of these accessibility features are not disproportionate to the overall alterations in terms of cost and scope as determined under criteria established by the Attorney General. Comment. The Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund and a few other commenters requested a change to the path of travel requirement that would combine the requirements of ADAAG and UFAS. The commenters noted that UFAS 4.1.6(3) contains minimum accessibility requirements for a building or facility that is substantially altered, regardless of disproportionate costs. These commenters also noted that the Department of Justice title III regulations provide a list of priorities that should be followed when choosing which accessible elements to provide in the event of disproportionality. Since the Department of Justice title II regulations do not contain such a priority list for providing accessible elements, the commenters requested that the title III priority list be incorporated into ADAAG so that the priorities would apply to State and local government entities. Response. ADAAG 4.1.6(2), by itself, yields a substantial level of accessibility. The addition of the UFAS provision to the requirements of ADAAG 4.1.6(2), will not, in most cases, result in greater accessibility than that currently required by the Department of Justice's title III regulations. Further, incorporating the UFAS provision into ADAAG 4.1.6(2) would result in a requirement for State and local government entities which is different from the ADAAG requirements for private entities. The requirements for public and private entities should be uniform unless there is a compelling reason for them to be different. With regard to setting priorities for accessible elements in the event of disproportionality, the Department of Justice has proposed to amend its title II regulations to address this and other issues. See 28 CFR Part 35. Based on these reasons, no changes to the requirements of ADAAG 4.1.6(2) have been made. Polling Places, Voting Booths, and Equipment The NPRM asked whether polling places operated by State or local governments utilize fixed voting booths and equipment and how these fixed voting booths and devices currently meet the accessibility needs of persons with visual impairments, reach range limitations, and limitations in manipulating or operating controls. In addition, the NPRM requested information regarding existing and new technologies which would enable people with disabilities to use voting equipment and booths without assistance. The NPRM also requested comment on the cost information of such technologies. Comment. A large number of commenters recommended various means which may be used to make voting booths and equipment accessible. These include such auxiliary aids as computers, touch tone phone systems, touch screen technology with voice output through earphones, tactile markings, voting equipment with audio capabilities, and the use of push-button controls instead of levers. Other suggestions for providing access to the voting process include the use of taped, brailled, or large print ballots. None of the comments indicated that technology is currently in use to provide independent access for individuals who are blind. No information was provided regarding the costs associated with the recommended technology. Some commenters noted that access to the voting process could be achieved through absentee balloting procedures. A large number of commenters pointed out that existing Federal and many State laws allow people who are blind or visually impaired who need assistance to choose their own personal assistants to help them in the voting process. Several commenters stressed the importance of an accessible area which surrounds the voting equipment and an accessible route to the polling place. Only one commenter knew of a jurisdiction which had fixed voting booths. Response. To the degree fixed voting booths are constructed and altered, they are subject to ADAAG requirements. In addition, as buildings and facilities covered by ADAAG are newly constructed or altered, accessibility will be required in these buildings and facilities, thereby improving access to polling places which may occupy these buildings or facilities. Although portable booths and equipment would not be covered by the construction and alteration requirements contained in ADAAG, such portable items and the voting process is subject to the Department of Justice regulations implementing title II of the ADA. These regulations require program accessibility and auxiliary aids and services (see 28 CFR 35.149 and 35.160). Assembly Areas The NPRM sought comment on the design issues associated with providing integrated and dispersed accessible seating locations in arenas, stadiums or other sports facilities. In September 1992 the Board initiated a research project on assembly area accessibility. Through post-occupancy evaluations of sports and performing arts facilities, the Board is examining numerous issues related to current ADAAG provisions. The Board intends to address issues associated with assembly areas in a separate rulemaking once this research is completed. Comment. One commenter requested that the Board clarify whether the required number of wheelchair locations in the chart at ADAAG 4.1.3(19)(a) refers to one or two wheelchair spaces.
