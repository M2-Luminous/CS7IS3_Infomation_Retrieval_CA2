By 2020, China will have basically achieved it mid-range goal of industrialization, and its socio-economic development will basically have caught up to the level of advanced nations. In the quarter century before this goal is reached, it will be difficult to reverse the trend of a steadily worsening environment, but the country and the society must first lay down a specific policy before it can reduce the threat and pressures of environmental degradation; After the first 20 years of the 21st century, China's ecological environment can be genuinely improved, and economic development and the ecological environment can begin to move forward on a coordinated course. China Will Be Faced with Serious Environmental Pollution Problems in the Next 25 Years China must wage a protracted struggle to maintain suitably rapid economic growth. Between the 1950's and 1973, most of the world's developed nations saw a sustained economic development, but they created rather serious industrial pollution. In 1972 the U.N. Human Environment Conference was held in Stockholm, and the "U.N. Human Environment Report" was issued. It was recognized that population growth and economic development were the basic causes of the various pollution and ecological environment problems. Western scholars, represented by the "Roman Club" felt that the economic growth of various countries should be limited, and they advocated the "low growth" and "no growth" ideas. The per-capita GNP of the countries where those experts lived was between $U.S. 15,000 and 25,000, and even at that rate the proponents of those ideas could not get any concurrence. China cannot accept "low growth", much less "no growth". China's GNP averaged to the population is only several hundred U.S. dollars, and China is facing enormous pressures of rapid development, expanding industries, rapidly rising incomes and standard of living. If it were only a question of a rapid development, then the question of the ecological environment could be gradually solved. With the booming economic development and influx of foreign investments following the reforms in China, a six to eight percent economic growth rate probably can be maintained for some time. After 2020, the per capita gross national output value will be about $U.S. 3,000 to 5,000, after which economic growth will gradually level out, and the post-industrial stage will have been reached. In the first and middle stages of industrialization, the economy will grow rapidly, and industries that consume large amounts of raw materials and discharge large amounts of wastes will inevitably play a primary role in that growth. The steel and petroleum industries and the chemical industries, building materials, thermal power, and paper are all big consumers of raw materials and discharge large volumes of pollutants, they belong to the three big ministries and the six big enterprises who are the "big polluters". Because China was a late starter in industrialization, the internal demands and pressures are great, and these industries are in a long historical process and still must quickly increase in scale. By the end of this century steel production will have reached about 90 million tons, but China wants it to continue its growth up to 2015, and a series of large- and middle-sized steel mills will be built and expanded to make that possible. There are nearly 20 large-scale petroleum bases in China today, and the ethylene production capacity, existing and under construction, is nearly three million tons, not one-fifth that of the U.S., and well below China's needs. By 2020, in addition to the large-scale bases mentioned, more than 10 new bases will be needed. Because of the low level of electrification in China, and 70 percent of that is coal-power, and that can't be changed much, but while nuclear and hydropower are increasing, the desired new increase in thermal power will be 130,000MW to 150,000MW, and over 60 2,400MW big thermal power plants will have to be built. Cement, paper, and common non-ferrous metals will likewise need to be increased on a large scale. China's population has maintained strong growth over the last 25 years, and between 2010 and 2020 it will peak out; The massive urbanization of the population will change the consumption structure considerably, adding to the consumption of energy and water, and waste discharge will also be on the increase. The per-capita consumption of energy in cities is three to five times the rural rate, and the consumption of fresh water is also much greater. If the population migration is not controlled, by 2010, about 500 million people will be living in urban areas, of which probably 200 million will be in clustered towns in large- and middle-sized cities. They will be crowded for space, and basic facilities will be lacking, adding to the industrial and urban pollution, which will intensify the ecological and social problems in those areas. After 2020, the total population and rate of urbanization will diminish, and the pressures on the ecological environment will ease. The people's average income is still very low, and large amounts of money will not be available for environmental controls and ecological construction for some time to come. Only through rapid development, namely through raising the economic strength and level of well being, can any good portion of the redistributed people's income be put into the protection of the ecological environment. The U.S. is now putting two to three percent of the people's output value into controlling pollution, and in China, it is about one percent, and that is not being used to full advantage for a variety of reasons. Two Strategic Ecological Environment Policies Must Be Implemented Simultaneously China faces two kinds of ecological environment issues: 1. those primarily due to natural forces and human agricultural practices; 2. those primarily due to industrialization and urbanization processes. Because of drawbacks in China's natural geographical structure, large population, and unwise use of wastelands, there has been serious erosion, encroachment of sand and salt, diminishing grassland, and desiccation, which fall under the first category of environmental issues. The second category includes water, air, and land pollution, acid rain, the greenhouse effect caused by CO[.sub]2[/] emissions, the rising sea level, surface subsidence, sea-water encroachment, insufficient water in concentrated industrial and urban areas, overcrowding, and lack of minimal supplies for capital construction, all caused by the industrialization and social urbanization processes. These two categories of environmental issues differ in respect of their formation and harmful effects, and in their means of control. China must, therefore, implement two different strategic policies for correcting these environmental problems. In the 40 years since reconstruction, there has grown a general recognition of the effects of natural forces and agricultural practices on the ecological environment, and State and local funds, manpower, and materials have been put into the effort to control and prevent ecological damage, including scientific research and experimentation, which have had varying degrees of success in reducing the worsening trend in ecological problems. The problems of pollution and other ecological environmental issues caused by industrialization and urbanization have gotten much attention since the 1970's, but the public consciousness has yet to be sharpened on these issues. It should be regarded with alarm that these pollution problems are growing worse every day in the process of the rapidly developing economy, and although public opinion, local governments, and basic enterprises keep saying they want to control pollution, that fact is that for financial, organizational, technical, facilities, and management reasons, corrective actions to deal with these environmental phenomena have still not reached widespread governmental and social application. Therefore, during the course of 20 years of economic growth, environmental pollution has spread, and the threat has worsened. The rate of ecological degradation from the second category of causes grows much faster than that of the first category. To infuse a lasting health into the diversified areas of the society and the economy, the measures for implementing the strategic policy of operating simultaneously on the two categories of environmental issues, namely; continuing to improve comprehensive controls on erosion, desert encroachment, floods and droughts, while striving at the same to control environmental pollution, surface subsidence and sea-water encroachment, eliminate acid rain, and apply measures to improve the living conditions in secondary urbanization areas, should be elevated to status of the consummate strategy for creating a better world for the future generations. The sure course for reaching this strategic goal is: (1) Improve theoretical and applied research on human, natural resource, and environmental interrelationships, learn their interrelational operating mechanisms, and publicize it widely among the populace. (2) Allocate a higher proportion of the people's income for environmental controls. As the economy develops rapidly, the government and enterprises should put more money into improving the environment and controlling industrial pollution. Try to get the amount of the gross value of national production that is put into the ecological environment up to two percent by turn of century. (3) Implement macro-adjustments and controls on the distribution of national industries in long- and mid-term measures fitted to the special natural environmental features of the various large regions and the load-bearing capability of their environments. (4) Clarify the responsibilities for pollution control, and reform the product cost-accounting process. Enterprises should factor into the production costs of their products all of the funds that were needed for pollution control, tailored by the amount of threat posed to society by their discharged wastes, and other losses incurred therein, and the government should pick up a part of that cost for input into special environmental foundations to be used for environmental protection projects. (5) Be frugal in the use of resources, and set up a resource-saving socio-economic system. That should include creating industrial structures that have low-intensities of resource consumption, developing industrial technologies that conserve or re-use resources and reduce the amounts of discharged wastes.
