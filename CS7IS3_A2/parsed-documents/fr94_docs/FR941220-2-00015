Disclosure to consumer reporting agencies: Disclosure pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(12): The Department may disclose to a consumer reporting agency information regarding a claim which is determined to be valid and overdue as follows: (1) The name, taxpayer identification number and other information necessary to establish the identity of the individual responsible for the claim; (2) the amount, status, and history of the claim; and (3) the program under which the claim arose. The Department may disclose the information specified in this paragraph under 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(12) and the procedures contained in 31 U.S.C. 3711 (f). A consumer reporting agency to which these disclosures may be made is defined at 15 U.S.C. 1681a(f), and 31 U.S.C. 3701 (a)(3). Policies and practices for storing, retrieving, accessing, retaining, and disclosing of records in the system: Storage: The records are maintained on magnetic tape and computer disk media. Retrievability: Data are retrieved by matching social security number, name and date of birth. Safeguards: All physical access to the sites of the contractor where this system of records is maintained, is controlled and monitored by security personnel who check each individual entering the building for his or her employee or visitor badge. The computer system employed by the Department of Education offers a high degree of resistance to tampering and circumvention by use of software that requires user access to be defined down to the individual data element. This security system limits data access to Department of Education and contract staff on a ``need to know'' basis, including external users of the system (guaranty agency and school personnel) and controls individual users' ability to access and alter records within the system. All users of this system are given a unique user ID with a personal identifier. The software monitors and tracks changes to any data element. Any change to the database is recorded, together with the identity of the individual user who made the change.
