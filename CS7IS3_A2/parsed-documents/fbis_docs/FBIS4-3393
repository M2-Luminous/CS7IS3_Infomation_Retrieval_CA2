A delegation of leading Chinese businessmen is traveling with the premier. On regional issues, Li said the development of China's relations with Central Asian nations would not affect its ties with other nations of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), including Russia. "We hope the CIS nations would maintain friendly relations and work together for regional stability and development," he added. Li noted that China and Uzbekistan, which have no fundamental conflict of interests, share identical or similar views on many major international issues.

"China is ready to have regular exchange of views or consultations on regional and international issues with Uzbekistan so as to enhance mutual understanding and trust," he said.
