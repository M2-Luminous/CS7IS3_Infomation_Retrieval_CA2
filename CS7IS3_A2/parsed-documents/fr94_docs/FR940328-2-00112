ACTION: Notice of request for a revision to an existing OMB clearance (9000&hyph;0075). SUMMARY: Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501), the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Secretariat has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a request to review and approve an extension of a currently approved information collection requirement concerning Government Property. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Beverly Fayson, Office of Federal Acquisition Policy, GSA (202) 501&hyph;4755. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Purpose This is a request for approval of a revision to a previously approved OMB Clearance Number 9000&hyph;0075. The reason for submitting this revision is to allow for a proposed revision to part 45 that, while increasing hours in some respects, decreases hours in others, accounting for an overall reduction of 585,600 hours. ``Property,'' as used in part 45, means all property, both real and personal. It includes facilities, material, special tooling, special test equipment, and agency-peculiar property. Government property includes both Government-furnished property and contractor-acquired property. Contractors are required to establish and maintain a property system that will control, protect, preserve, and maintain all Government property because the contractor is responsible and accountable for all Government property under the provisions of the contract including property located with subcontractors. The contractor's property control records shall constitute the Government's official property records and shall be used to: (a) Provide financial accounts for Government-owned property in the contractor's possession or control; (b) Identify all Government property (to include a complete, current, auditable record of all transactions); (c) Locate any item of Government property within a reasonable period of time. This clearance covers the following requirements: (a) FAR 45.307&hyph;2(b) requires a contractor to notify the contracting officer if it intends to acquire or fabricate special test equipment. (b) FAR 45.502&hyph;1 requires a contractor to furnish written receipts for Government property. (c) FAR 45.502&hyph;2 requires a contractor to submit a discrepancy report upon receipt of Government property when overages, shortages, or damages are discovered. (d) FAR 45.504 requires a contractor to investigate and report all instances of loss, damage, or destruction of Government property. (e) FAR 45.505&hyph;1 requires that basic information be placed on the contractor's property control records. (f) FAR 45.505&hyph;3 requires a contractor to maintain records for Government material. (g) FAR 45.505&hyph;4 requires a contractor to maintain records of special tooling and special test equipment. (h) FAR 45.505&hyph;5 requires a contractor to maintain records of plant equipment. (i) FAR 45.505&hyph;7 requires a contractor to maintain records of real property. (j) FAR 45.505&hyph;8 requires a contractor to maintain scrap and salvage records. (k) FAR 45.505&hyph;9 requires a contractor to maintain records of related data and information. (l) FAR 45.505&hyph;10 requires a contractor to maintain records for completed products. (m) FAR 45.505&hyph;11 requires a contractor to maintain records of transportation and installation costs of plant equipment.
