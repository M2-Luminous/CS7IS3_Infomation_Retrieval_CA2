Prithvi was already tested a dozen times by the Defense Research and Development Organization over a five-year period between 1988 and 1993. Last Saturday, the Army began the crucial preinduction trial phase with its first user trial. Yesterday's launch was to the missile's maximum range of 250 kms and all the mission requirements were achieved. The entire exercise of the user trials is likely to be completed by the end of next month. Prithvi will then be cleared for induction into the defense forces. There may be at least six more user trials in battlefield conditions. The Army has opted for Prithvi with a shorter ranger of 150 kms. These missiles have the capability of carrying the more lethal one ton warhead payload. However, the Indian Air Force is opting for the 250 km range version to safeguard its forward air bases as well as to bring enemy forward bases within Prithvi's range. This will carry half a ton warhead. When Prithvi's first experimental launch was successful in 1988, Western security analysts could hardly believe that India could develop the missile system entirely on its own. When Prithvi's induction and deployment seemed imminent in 1992, the United States imposed trade sanctions on India. They are still in force, but have not prevented our scientists from developing this liquid propelled new generation ballistic missile. Prithvi's liquid engine enables its flight to be controlled through real time commands on board computer. [sentence as heard] Its altitude and range thus become greatly flexible and it has six alternate preprogrammed trajectories. All these make it far superior to the Patriot and Scud missiles which performed dismally during the Gulf war. Prithvi's designers and main users see it as an accurate weapons system that can deliver very specific military objectives ranging from a tactical battlefield, heavy artillery support system to long range knocking off of enemy supplies by striking at bridges, roads, air fields, railroads, marshalling yards, and so on. Prithvi's induction and deployment into the defense forces will certainly enhance India's overall security by acting as a deterrent. Once its sister missiles like the Trishul, the Akash, the Nag, and the Agni make their way into the defense forces, any enemy will have to think more than twice before launching a conventional military adventure against India.
