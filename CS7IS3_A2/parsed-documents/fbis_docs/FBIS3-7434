[Khachatphai] There is no question that everyone wants the country to enjoy peace and progress and people to enjoy decent livelihood. The bombings, bomb threats, and creating of rumors have misled people into feeling that security is lacking. I wish to given the assurance that the country enjoys complete security. All the officials concerned have worked together closely to find the culprits and gather information to prevent the future occurrence of these problems. Security at various installations has been strengthened to prevent acts of terrorism. Everyone can be confident in the government mechanism dealing with this matter and in the officials concerned. In any event, to better tackle the matter, people must cooperate by acting as informants. This will lead to the arrest of the culprits. This is one way of helping prevent untoward incidents. [Correspondent] Does this mean that the performance of the officials concerned has not been effective? [Khachatphai] One must realize that there are people who look for opportunities to create trouble. They will carry out their work whenever an opportunity arises. Therefore, it is difficult to absolutely prevent every problem. Intelligence operations and security vigilance have been responsible for preventing many incidents. These types of operations, however, cannot be publicized. So, people do not know about the performance of such operations. Therefore, it is unfair to say that officials have been ineffective. [Correspondent] What are the causes of the bombings perpetrated by local or foreign elements? [Khachatphai] There are many causes for the bomb attacks carried out by Thais. Among them are personal conflicts and deliberate attempts to create a situation. The officials concerned are investigating the causes. Operations by foreigners concern acts of international terrorism. They carry out their operations in Thailand to achieve their objectives. The country's public safety is affected regardless of which group carries out its operation as innocent people suffer. Everyone should condemn such an evil operation. [Correspondent] Do international terrorist groups pick Thailand for their operations because they find it easy? [Khachatphai] Thai society, like in other liberal countries, is open. Tourists can travel where they please. Several million foreign tourists visit every year, in addition to more than 100,000 illegal arrivals. This is a weak point, but it does not mean that international terrorists pick Thailand because it is so easy to stage an incident. [Correspondent] Compared with Singapore and Malaysia whose societies are also open, why do terrorists pick on Thailand to carry out their sabotage activities? [Khachatphai] There are several factors international terrorists consider in choosing a country for their sabotage. One factor is their intended target. It is probably not true that security in those two countries is so good that it is impossible to carry out terrorist activities. The elaborate counterterrorist measures in the United States and the UK have not been able to completely prevent terrorist activities there. [Correspondent] In addition to foreign terrorist groups, are there local groups which complicate the sabotage picture? [Khachatphai] Possibly both. That is, there could be foreign terrorist groups which have targets in Thailand. Meanwhile, there are some local groups which aim to create public disorder. So, incidents affecting national peace and order could be created by any of these elements. Therefore, officials concerned must not relax and must be ready to prevent an incident and timely solve it if it happens. [Correspondent] What about groups which seek to topple the current government? [Khachatphai] The results of initial investigations have not linked groups seeking a political change to the disturbances. Normal incidents of disturbance are probably linked to personal disputes or to intimidation with some purpose in mind. Officials concerned are trying to verifying the causes. [Correspondent] Is the intelligence work sufficient to cope with the current situation? [Khachatphai] To date, I have found through working with military and civilian intelligence oficials that they have worked hard. Several pieces of intelligence have been exploited to timely solve the situation. However, current and future problems are diversified and complicated and, therefore, intelligence efficiency should be further developed to timely cope with the situation and keep up with the game. [Correspondent] Do the currently numerous protests affect national security? [Khachatphai] The administration system in Thailand is democratic and the government comes from the election. Therefore, if a group of people feels that it is not given fair treatment it has a right to express its views and inform the government so that the unfairness can be remedied. If a protest arise from the people's genuine hardship then it is not difficult to solve. But if there are instigators in the background it is more difficult. Therefore, I ask that people cooperate with the officials and act as their eyes and ears. The mass media has a role as well to help create a peaceful atmosphere by constructive reporting and avoiding emphasizing things that will excessively worry the public. Although there are issues which affect peace and order, overall national security is good. Please have confidence in the state mechanism to protect and maintain national security.
