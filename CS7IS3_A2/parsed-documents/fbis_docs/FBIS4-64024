Asked by IF's correspondent about the possibility of excluding this provision from a draft decree on extension of the state of emergency in the conflict zone, Lozovoy said: "I do not know why this question arises. We agreed on it with the Ingush president and he had no objections to it." "These parts of the Sunzhenskiy and Malgobekskiy regions will perform the role of a buffer zone to prevent penetration of militants in the zone of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict," Lozovoy said. In the meantime, in neighboring Chechnya armed forces were put on alert in connection with the possible expansion of the state of emergency in the zone of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict. Groznyy assessed the intention to include the Sunzhenskiy and Malgobekskiy regions of Ingushetia in the state of emergency zone as "an act of open armed aggression." With the lack of an administrative border between Chechnya and Ingushetia these regions are a subject of dispute between the two republics.
