France thus joins the 37 states, including the United States and Japan, which decided to sign [the Convention] last month during a meeting in London. Although France has not dumped any radioactive waste in the sea since 1969, it abstained from signing, together with Belgium, China, the United Kingdom, and Russia. France only sought a simple renewal of the 1983 moratorium, so that it would retain the right to reassess the problem "in 15 years in light of the scientific knowledge at that time." However, the majority vote on 12 November was accompanied by a clause: The countries abstaining from voting and the 29 nations not present in London would have 100 days to vote for or against [the convention], otherwise they would be excluded from the convention. "In compliance with Prime Minister Balladur's willingness to conduct an energy policy respecting the environment," says Michel Barnier's message, but also due to the lobbying of the ecological movements, the French Government, which could have saved itself the trouble of a controversy by signing the convention last month, has thus come into line with the resolution adopted in London.
