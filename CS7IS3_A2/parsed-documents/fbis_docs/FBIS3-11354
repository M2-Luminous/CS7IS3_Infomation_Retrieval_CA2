The commission plenum approved the motion with 26 votes in favor of and two against. The sessions will be held to discuss electoral reforms to the constitutional and penal codes. The Popular Socialist Party [PPS] and the Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party [PFCRN] voted against the move. PPS Deputy Cuauhtemoc Amezcua criticized the fact only specific government officials and the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], National Action Party [PAN], and the Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD] participated in the negotiations regarding the extraordinary debates. PFCRN Deputy Alberto Carrillo said the people's participation in the Federal Electoral Institute will only create a council of notables; it will not guarantee or solve the electoral problems. The summons states the special debates will begin on 22 March but does not set an ending date. The document also establishes only two issues will be discussed and approved: 1) reforms to Article 41 of the Constitution, to allow greater citizen participation in the electoral organizations; and 2) reforms to the Penal Code to review the description of electoral crimes and to increase punishment. The proposal to reform the penal code, both for general rights within the Federal District and federal rights for the rest of the country, suggests adding 17 acts to the current list of electoral crimes. This seeks to clearly and definitively protect the right to vote freely and privately, the right to participate in the political process, the authenticity of electoral documents, and to prevent the illegal use of public resources in favor of a specific political party or candidate. Some of the more noteworthy acts to be listed as electoral crimes are: 1. Requesting votes in exchange for payment, gratification, or a promise of payment or gratification. 2. Those ministers of religious organizations who, during acts of their ministry, influence their followers to vote for or against a specific candidate or political party or to abstain altogether, will be sentenced to 500 days in jail or an equivalent fine. 3. Altering election results and removing or destroying ballots or electoral documents. 4. Disseminating false information regarding the election process or its results. 5. Forcing subordinate government employees to vote in favor of a specific political party or candidate; 6. Conditioning the rendering of public services or the completion of plans or projects in order to force voters to vote for a specific political party or candidate. 7. For public officials to use government funds, assets, or services assigned to them due to the nature of their position to support a political party or candidate or to do so using subordinate personnel during working hours, notwithstanding any other penalties that could derive from charges of embezzlement; those assets may include vehicles, buildings, and equipment, and there will be no bail for those detained on such charges. 8. Altering voter registration lists and tally sheets or issuing illegal voting credentials; such crimes shall be punished with three to seven years in prison. Legislators from all parties expressed their opinion during the Permanent Congressional Commission's debate.
