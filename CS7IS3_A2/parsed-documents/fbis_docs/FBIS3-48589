Speaking with reporters, the diplomat, who requested anonymity, said members of the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) had "come to the conclusion that they need to change their image." But he dismissed hints of political reform -- such as the proposition of a new constitution put forward by the National Convention, whose delegates are handpicked by the junta -- as pure "flummery." "There is no disposition to yield power to anyone else in any way," he said, stressing that "the changes are only cosmetic." The diplomat predicted Nobel Peace prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, whose National Democratic League (NLD) overwhelmingly won elections in 1990, would remain under house arrest though her sentence technically ends next July. She has been under house arrest since July 1989. Soldiers and wooden guard boxes at the entrance of her home were removed last Saturday. The junta's current concern about image might result in "a public relations coup of some sort," such as allowing a single foreign diplomat to visit her. So far, only her husband, British academic Michael Aris and their two sons have been authorized to visit her. If she were released, he said, it could touch off spontaneous demonstrations. "They're a volatile population," he said. "We know that from 1988," the year pro-democracy demonstrations were crushed nationwide by the military. He also called current peace negotiations between the council and ten ethnic minority groups an example of "divide and conquer" and added: "There is still a policy of Burmanization." Meanwhile, life for the Burmese has failed to improve, despite surface changes in the capital Rangoon and Burma's top tourist draw in the northern city of Mandalay, he said. SLORC had allowed select members of the military and their families to invest in businesses which had injected funds in those cities, he said. But "the rest of the country has been left untouched," he said. Food has become prohibitively expensive, while the salaries of civil servants and pensioners have been frozen since 1989, he added. People continue to be regularly rounded up for mock demonstrations of support for the SLORC, but "look like zombies," he said. The diplomat's evaluations echoed a just published report from Amnesty International which said that small improvements have been made by SLORC in human rights during the second half of 1993, but that the use of torture and other form of ill-treatment against its opponents remained "endemic." Still, the diplomat remained optimistic that foreign investment and increased exposure of the Burmese people to foreign media could pressure Rangoon for real reform. Turning to China's influence in Burma, he said: "Chinese are everywhere in Rangoon, and Mandalay in particular." But "the driving power of the relationship is Kunming and Yunnan," he said, referring to the province on China's southern border with Burma and its capital, "not Beijing." "There are rumours of resentment" with Chinese investors, he added. Satellite dishes, while not widely available, are "ultimately beyond (SLORC's) control," he said, and promised to improve the flow of information. He said he hoped that member countries of ASEAN -- the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, grouping Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Singapore -- would demand that certain conditions be met before granting membership to Burma, which some diplomats think is on the agenda. In the short run, "the military is here to stay." Rumors of tensions between some top leaders may be true, but for now, "none can move against one another." Furthermore, he said, "there is a sense that every order is followed from the top."
