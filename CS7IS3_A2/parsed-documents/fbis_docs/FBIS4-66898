The denial by the Russian defense ministry sounded like the old stuff from the times of the Cold War: "It is all a never-ending campaign by the West, with the obvious aim of diverting attention from its own biological armament programs." The report says that there is no remedy for the Russian "Super Plague": Spread with bombs and missiles, the newly-bred bacteria causes a terrible death, with blood spitting, poisoning, and decomposition of the lungs. Within a few days, entire areas can be "cleansed" of enemies, while cities, factories, and transport routes fall into the victors' hands intact. Russian laboratories can breed 200 kilograms of the deadly bacteria in a week -- enough to kill half a million people. The Soviet Union was among the countries that signed the convention banning biological weapons in 1972. Today, the Moscow defense ministry does not deny that the bacterial bomb was developed in spite of this agreement. In the 1980's, 25,000 people, including top biologists, in 18 research institutes and six factories worked for the "Bio Remedy" program. Meanwhile, former President Gorbachev was touring the West, denying the existence of any biological weapons programs, and being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his disarmament initiative. His successor Yeltsin admitted possession of the banned weapon and stopped the program by presidential resolution no. 390 in April 1992. Even Yeltsin's environment adviser, Aleksey Yablokov, doubts that the generals are observing the resolution: "The field of biological and chemical weapons is extremely difficult to control. Heaven knows what is going on in the individual laboratories." If anyone from these secret laboratories dares speak about their work, they are not safe from persecution in modern Russia -- as experienced by Vil Mirzayanov, a professor of chemistry. From 1965 to 1992 he conducted research into chemical weapons; and in 1992 he disclosed that the Russian Army, contrary to Yeltsin's assurances, is having a new generation of chemical weapons developed -- the signing of the Paris convention on banning these weapons in early 1993 did not make any difference to that program. Publishing these details in the MOSCOW NEWS put him straight into prison, from where he was released only after massive public protests. He was not charged with spreading false statements, but with betrayal of state secrets. As evidence, chemists from the army stated in a secrete document that Mirzayanov's claims were both true and secret. This document, which has been made available to STERN, proves: Russia is developing a new binary chemical weapon. Its vicious effect only develops on hitting its target, when two chemicals combine to a deathly poison. Since each of the two substances is harmless on its own, they easily circumvent the Paris Convention. "Our army does not want to disarm. They only want to get rid of their old garbage," Mirzayanov said. With disposing the inherited weapons alone, the generals would be more than busy: According to official statements, 40,000 tonnes of chemical weapons are stored in Russian arsenals -- the Americans have some 30,000 tonnes. Meanwhile, the Russian Army is keeping its "chemical troops" in shape. Sixty kilometers east of Moscow, soldiers are exercising a chemical weapons attack on an old model: They are attacking half-timbered houses, a country guest house and a church -- of a small German town.
