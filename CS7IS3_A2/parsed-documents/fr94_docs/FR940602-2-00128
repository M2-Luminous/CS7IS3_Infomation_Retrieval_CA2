FR940602-2-00128 FR940602-2-00080 7. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends/distributions of the various classes and the proper allocation of income and expenses among the classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Independent Examiner''). The Independent Examiner has rendered a report, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, stating that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Independent Examiner, or an appropriate substitute Independent Examiner, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Funds that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Independent Examiner shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Independent Examiner with respect to such reports, following request by the Funds which the Funds agree to make, will be available for inspection by the SEC staff upon the written request for such work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management or of a Regional Office of the SEC, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Independent Examiner is a ``report on policies and procedures placed in operation'' and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time. 8. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends/distributions among the various classes of shares and the proper allocation of income and expenses among such classes of shares and this representation has been concurred with by the Independent Examiner in its initial report referred to in condition (7) above and will be concurred with by the Independent Examiner, or appropriate substitute Independent Examiner, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition (7) above. The applicants agree to take immediate corrective action if the Independent Examiner, or an appropriate substitute Independent Examiner, does not so concur in the ongoing reports. 9. The prospectuses of the Funds will include a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different levels of compensation for selling one particular class of shares over another in a Fund. 10. The Underwriter will adopt compliance standards as to when shares of a particular class may appropriately be sold to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to agree to conform to these standards. 11. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the directors of the Funds with respect to the variable pricing system will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished to the directors. 12. Each Fund prospectus (regardless of whether all classes of shares of such Fund are offered through such prospectus) will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees, FESC, CDSC, exchange privileges, and conversion features applicable to each class of shares. The shareholder reports of each Fund will disclose the respective expenses and performance data applicable to each class of shares in every shareholder report. The shareholder reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to the Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data and ratios, however, will be prepared on a per class basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent any advertisement or sales literature describes the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it will disclose the expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes. The information provided by applicants for publication in any newspaper or similar listing of the Funds' net asset values and public offering prices will separately present each class of shares. 13. The applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by this application will not imply SEC approval, authorization or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Funds may make pursuant to rule 12b&hyph;1 plans in reliance on the exemptive order. 14. Any class of shares with a conversion feature (``Purchase Class'') will convert into another class (``Target Class'') of shares on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in Article III, Section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to the conversion. 15. If a Fund implements any amendment to its rule 12b&hyph;1 plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements any amendment of a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plan) that would increase materially the amount that may be borne by the Target Class shares under the plan, existing Purchase Class shares will stop converting into Target Class shares unless the Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The directors shall take such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into a new class of shares (``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to Target Class as it existed prior to implementation of the proposal, no later than such shares previously were scheduled to convert into Target Class shares. If deemed advisable by the directors to implement the foregoing, such actions may include the exchange of all existing Purchase Class shares for a new class (``New Purchase Class''), identical to existing Purchase Class shares in all material respects except that New Purchase Class will convert into New Target Class. New Target Class or New Purchase Class may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall be effected in any manner that the directors reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance with condition 4, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of New Target Class or New Purchase Class shall be borne solely by the Adviser and the Underwriter. Purchase Class shares sold after the implementation of the proposal may convert into Target Class shares subject to the higher maximum payments, provided that the material features of the Target Class plan and the relationship of such plan to the Purchase Class shares are disclosed in an effective registration statement. 16. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed Rule 6c&hyph;10 under the Act, Investment Company Act Release No. 16169 (Nov. 2, 1988), as currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted, or amended. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
