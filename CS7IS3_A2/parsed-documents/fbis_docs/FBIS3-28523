Ramos with domestic and foreign correspondents at Malacanang Palace in Manila -- live; italicized passages in Tagalog] [Excerpts] [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, how will the government's development projects be affected by the suspension of the oil price increase, considering that the reason for the imposition of the one-peso oil levy is for the government's infrastructure projects? [Ramos] Well, the estimate of the finance people, the revenue people is that, under the present parameters, a one-month suspension would amount to the loss of about P1.2 billion [Philippine pesos] in revenues. But precisely government agreed to this three-week suspension. It's really a three-week suspension -- from today 7 February to 28 February -- 21 days, because we feel there could be some alternatives, new ones, alternatives that have not yet been factored into their original computations. Example, is the P1.9 million saving that is going to arise out of the 5 percent additional reserve that I imposed on the MOOE [expansion unknown] of all government departments, agencies, and offices. Another possible alternative could be a recomputation of the oil price hikes, because we are seeing, and this is based on some very intensive study that we made over the weekend up to early this morning, including myself, we are seeing a plus-21 centavos in all of the computations arising out of the lower price of crude oil in the world market and the stable foreign exchange rate -- the pesos versus the hard currencies including the dollar. There are other alternatives of course that were suggested, such as the so-called P150 billion supposedly in the vaults of the Central Bank. But the secretary of finance, Secretary Bobby de Ocampo mentioned that this is tantamount to just printing paper bills without any backing; and so, they are going to look into that also, just to be sure. And I'm talking about the entire committee of 14. Other possible resources could come from still unfactored privatization benefits. I say unfactored because most of the government assets already scheduled to be privatized, and the processes are ongoing, were already considered in the computations of the fiscal gap. We also, I suppose, can derive some resources, although this is probably already going to be marginal, from further belt tightening. But we do not want to touch what we have already programmed for capital expenditures and infradevelopment programs because that would be of a negative effect toward investors who want to come to the Philippines. We must enhance our infrastructure. We have enhanced already the power situation, so that there are no more brownouts. That kind of thing, we will pursue. [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, point of clarification, the one suspended was the oil price, the 28 January oil price hike. But how about the one-peso levy which was imposed last September? [Ramos] It is the oil price hike that is suspended, it is not quite a rollback yet, but suspended for a period of three weeks, while the joint committee is working on the longer-term solutions. And, we are inputting all the suggestions from all sectors, especially the KRB [Kilusang Rollback or Rollback Movement] and government, and for others, because there were others here who were neither connected with government nor with KRB who spoke their opinions. [Unidentified correspondent] How about the one-peso oil levy which was contained in the executive order? [Ramos] Well, that will now be considered by the committee. The disposition or future of that one peso levy will also be thrown into the deliberations of the committee because their mission is to come up with a long term and enduring and just solution to our perennial problem of deficit. It is really the consolidated public sector deficit that we must solve. Now, the secretary of finance showed a trend of the behavior of the consolidated public sector deficit. Will you kindly provide them a copy of this [addressing a government official], and it does show a downtrend, very, very significant downtrend from the time this administration took over. That is the permanent or enduring way of preventing inflation, interest rates, and foreign exchange rates from running away, to the detriment of the economy and our people. [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, one thing more; with the suspension of the 28 January oil price hike, does it mean that the planned second round of increases will not push through anymore? [Ramos] The committee will look into that because neither the committee nor the president can tell the ERB [Energy Regulatory Board] what to do. We are all suggesting to the ERB these proposed actions and solutions. Of course, the collective influence and clout now of this committee supported by the president would be so much that perhaps the ERB would immediately respond positively to the two resolutions. In fact, Secretary Lazaro on the part of the government was assigned by me to follow up with the ERB their response to these two resolutions. Why Lazaro, not because he is the boss of ERB or the supervisor of ERB, but it is his department that is most closely related to the ERB because of their functions. [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, thank you. [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, may I inquire why did it take the threat of a transport strike and a massive [labor] strike and a massing of protest to prompt government to implement that suspension of the oil price hike? [Ramos] Well, of course the threat cannot be minimized. And this is coming from a broad coalition of forces -- from the extreme left to the extreme right -- as the KRB themselves described it. But it is also a part that government has been conducting dialogues with the leaders of congress on both sides, the multisectoral basic sectors as they are called, meaning the urban poor, the rural poor, the disabled, the women, the farmers, the fishermen, since we had the social pact of 8 September 1993. And our principal action officers here are Secretary Oscar Santos of the Peace Process Office, and Secretary Ernie Garilao of the Department of Agrarian Reform. In fact, tomorrow we are scheduled to have another meeting with that group here in Malacanang. What I'm trying to say is that because of these dialogues, we feel comfortable with the so-called marginalized sectors of our society. But since they have joined this broad coalition, we also want them to get the message from the government that certain hard decisions are being made. At the same time, we want to hear directly from them again what are their most urgent concerns. And so, we are acting on the basis of our own well-studied decisions and conclusions. I'm not doing this under the guns, so to speak. There were some comments even by some of you, that this was done because the IMF was here. No, again I say, and this was clarified by the chairman of our Philippine negotiating team as well as Secretary of Finance Bobby de Ocampo who was part of that team, that what was presented to the IMF was the Philippine Government's plan of action up to year 1998 and into the 21st century which would do many good things. Number one, put us on the growth path. Secondly, effect what would be an exit program for the Philippines in relation to the IMF, and bridge the fiscal deficit that has been perennially bugging our economy. [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, follow-up question: Isn't the preferred solution something like the perennial creation of another committee to meet the problem, and there has been some criticisms aired that this suspension is just delaying what is really inevitable? [Ramos] I think that is a mindset that we should correct now because if there is a new committee to tackle a problem, your usual response is, there he goes again. There is a need at this time to facilitate coordination and to open lines of communication. And in this particular case, the joint committee was agreed to, not because the president ordered it. The suggestion in fact came from somebody in the private sector seconded by another one, I think it was Ronnie Concepcion, and so we picked it up as a means to gain time for the study of a comprehensive and enduring solution to this problem because that's really our task. Our task is not to avoid a strike, although if we can avoid it, so much the better for everyone. But we want to get out of this perennial problem of fiscal deficit. And the committee now precisely, has been empowered by their respective constituents to get into both the short-term and the long-term solutions. That is why a period of three weeks was agreed upon. Government wanted about two weeks because government felt that would be sufficient time for consultations and coordination. The ERB wanted one month. Well, the two sides just split the difference and we came up with three weeks which coincidentally falls at the end of the month -- 28th of February. [Phone-in question read by Press Secretary Jesus Sison] We have a telephone question, Mr. President, from Ditas Gualberto. She wants to find out if the prices will be automatically lowered with the suspension. [Ramos] About the transportation fare, if the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board will respond to the request of the joint committee, I think it will also be reduced because that came out with the oil price increase which involved P1.55 for gasoline and some other prices for other types of petroleum products. The other components that go into pricing, well, market forces will play, but I would like to assure the consuming public that we do have a very effective price monitoring system now. This is under the Department of Trade and Industry basically, but this is now being assisted by the local government executives who have been ordered by me to monitor prices and prevent and punish, even profiteering. What is profiteering -- a 10 percent or more increase of the price of a commodity over the average increase of the month before. [Phone-in question read by Press Secretary Jesus Sison] Another question from Iloilo, Mr. President, Radyo ng Bayan [People's Radio], Rene Monteclaro: What is the president planning to do to restore the citizen's trust on those that will be implementing the projects wherein the source of funds comes from the oil levy? [Ramos] Our projects will continue. I think you will believe this because the president has proof. You just look at the result of our investments in power plants; the rehabilitation of roads, bridges; restoration of public utilities destroyed or damaged during the calamities; improvement in our telecommunication system, transportation system. They are very visible on the ground. We will not lessen the capital outlay because it already has an allocation in the 1994 General Appropriations Act. Nevertheless, we will add the BOT [Build-Operate-Transfer] component, and that will come from the private sector. If the society is in order, if the so-called economic policy environment is steady, predictable, continuous, and would give a fair return on investment to the investors, the BOT area for projects may widen. We have already issued data portfolio on what are the doable [as heard] BOT projects all over the country divided into transport, power, communications, and geographically -- region one to region 15. [Press Secretary Jesus Sison] Second question sir, [from Monteclaro] What are the chances that Congress will pass the tax measures so that the oil levy will be scrapped? [Ramos] Since September, the Executive and Legislative have already agreed on what should be given priority among the various legislative proposals proposed by the senators and the congressmen themselves proposed by the executive branch and also recommended by the multisectoral people's organizations. In fact, 93 such bills came out of that Social Pact, so-called summit last 8 September. Overtime, that has been refined to a really, top, top priority of 15 bills which both houses of Congress has committed over and over again, since even before they resumed their session on 24 January. And I want to read these priority bills so that our people will know that we are not only talking about tax measures but enhancement of the economic environment, enhancement of the revenue effort, and these are the following: -- Amendment to the BOT law. So that we can have other arrangements for firming up and completing BOT agreements and contracts because it is not only BOT that is feasible nowadays. We are trying to get other arrangements which are existing in other countries, like ROL, Rehabilitate, Operate and Lease. There is also ROT, Rehabilitate, Operate and Transfer, there is also BOO [expansion unknown], etcetera, etcetera, which create new opportunities for investors in the Philippines. -- Liberalizing the entry of foreign banks. Finally, a composite bill has been forged in committee in the Senate so that this proposal is as perfect as human talent can make it, according to the committee. And I have certified that composite bill. -- Alien legalization act. We must finally resolve the status of overstaying aliens in the Philippines. Many of them are Chinese, mainly Filipino-Chinese who are still considered stateless. Because some of them came out of that original group in 1949 when the Chiang Kai Shek forces, the Kuomintang fled the mainland, and of course they have children and grandchildren already. -- Commission on Higher Education. This is to improve the administration of education especially at the higher levels. -- Science and Technology Scholarship Program. Again, this is to improve our human development. All of these lend impact to our competitiveness for our economic growth. -- Amending Foreign Investments Code, again, to improve our attractiveness to investors. -- Resolution on citizenship. This is a different action from the Alien Legalization Act because this pertains to authorizing the executive branch to set up the procedures, the fees, and the other arrangements to facilitate citizenship of foreign residents in the Philippines. -- National Health Insurance, dual training system. These two are important in the improvement of our skills, our health, etc. -- Geothermal energy sources, antipilferage of electricity and transmission lines; again, this to improve our energy mix at the same time deter criminals from pilfering electricity, transmission lines, etc. -- Shelter and Urban Development Financing Act, this is to finally package the financial programs for housing, especially socialized housing, because right now there are so many agencies that are involved. There is no single focus on the priority for developing a more aggressive housing program. -- The one called TESDA, Technical Education and Skills Development Authority. Again, this is related to human development. VAT [value added tax] refinements. This is a proposed tax measure, and there are two more bills pertaining to population stabilization and next, the set or the family of resolutions, ratifications and bills for the implementation of GATT agreement resulting from the settlement of the Uruguay round, because we are going into a world trade organization set up, starting about April 1994. [Phone-in read by Press Secretary Jesus Sison] We have a statement from Bacolod, from Raul Gacagculo of Bombo Radyo [Big Drum Radio] that says there is a big rally going on in public plaza of Bacolod, and this is relayed to you for your information and guidance. [Ramos] With our brand of democracy, the people are free to demonstrate, to rally. But it is the responsibility of our officials on duty to explain to our countrymen, especially on the profound and complicated issues such as the oil price increase. And maybe, their being together in a rally is a good opportunity for our authorities to meet the crowd and dialogue with them so that there will be a clearer understanding of what is going on. All we ask is let's not make these meetings bloody and violent because it will not only hurt our brothers and countrymen, especially the children, the women, and the aged, but it might also send the wrong signals to our neighboring countries, especially at this time when we are receiving a favorable impression from these countries especially the investors towards the Philippines, especially after our breakthrough in 1993. The visit of Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia here in the past four days is a very good indication for us and other nations on what is really the prevailing condition in our dear motherland, the Republic of the Philippines. And so I hope that that message to our friends in Bacolod will get through. Yes, go ahead and rally as much as you want. But be sure it does not become violent or unruly or riotous. And we must also observe the rights of the others who are not involved in the rally because they must not suffer from this mass action. But better yet, give everybody a chance as we have done here in Malacanang to dialogue with each other, consult with each other, and determine what are really the genuine issues involved. So that we can come to a comprehensive and permanent solution of the problem. [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, the passage and implementation of revenue-generating measures normally take time. Since the suspension of the oil price increase will only be for three weeks, what will happen if the options proposed by the joint committee are not implemented before the end of the month. Will the oil price increase be implemented? [Ramos] We do not know yet. I don't think we should be second-guessing that committee because they're composed of bright people. Let's give them a chance to work out something for the good of the country. But there are inputs that are already available, for instance, the 5 percent reserve on MOOE could be diverted immediately to some other needs especially in regard to infrastructure development that might be prejudiced due to the three-week suspension of the ERB decisions. We are also seeing some hitherto unlisted privatization measures. Unlisted because they are not yet been factored in. Such as the proposed privatization of government shares of the Meralco [Manila Electric Company]. Only this morning, I issued the directive to [Finance] Secretary De Ocampo, who is the chairman of our committee on privatization, to go ahead with that Meralco privatization, but certain parameters and standards must be observed because we do not want the government to be prejudiced. Those are some of the things that we can use to offset. [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, are you confident that the P10 billion revenues that can be lost from the oil price increase can be generated within three weeks? [Ramos] The reported loss is P1.2 billion per month from the OPSF, [Oil Price Stabilization Fund] which, according to one of the private sectors, that's peanuts. But they said at the same time, they will be happy to absorb some of the financial impact so that it will not be the poorer sectors that will suffer. And so, we welcome that. What will this commitment from the private sector translate to in terms of a practical formula? Well, maybe we can price gasoline in a socialized way especially for private car owners. Probably, we can still increase beyond P1.55 because if someone owns a car, the conclusion is, he can afford it. Socialized pricing, what shall we reduce? Maybe the price of LPG [liquefied petroleum gas]. And so, these are some of the solutions being suggested. But, obviously we couldn't find all the solutions in the two and a half hours that we've met. And so, we threw all the proposals, the bright ideas to this committee, and we are giving them three weeks to come up with comprehensive, enduring, and just solutions to the basic problem which is the deficit, specifically the consolidated public sector deficit. [passage omitted] [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, it was pointed out that the 18.40 centavo per kilowatt hour of Meralco has nothing to do with this recent P1.00 or to P1.55 per liter oil price hike. And you mentioned that this Meralco rate hike was intended to enable Meralco to expand its facilities. Will this 18.40... [Ramos] I did not say that, somebody here said that. But anyway, let's answer this question. [Unidentified correspondent] Will this also be rolled back, this Meralco rate? [Ramos] Those hearings are not yet finished; there is no decision yet as far as I know. But maybe we should just tackle that when the problem comes. According to the ERB, and this is according to them, there are really three issues that they have tried to address because they are all interrelated. The first one is the levy. The second is the build-up of the oil price stabilization fund which went into deficit by the end of December 1993, sooner than their predictions. And the third, is the so-called return on rate base or RORB of oil companies. This one about Meralco is to enable them to expand so that they can provide better service here in their franchise area, and also to pay their bills some of which have become due already because if it is not paid and the interest will balloon, again this probably is going to be passed on to the consumers. But in any case, this is something that is not yet finished. We hope that Meralco, just like government, is trying to do, can find some alternatives. [passage omitted] [Phone-in question read by Press Secretary Jesus Sison] From Michelle Lopez Antonino of Las Pinas, she wants to find out if she goes to the gasoline station today, will the price of the gasoline before.... [Ramos] The process is like this. Our joint committee and this is supported by the president, is now communicating with the ERB, presenting these two resolutions to the ERB, the Chairman Mr. Tantiongco I suppose will receive this. I asked Energy Secretary Lazaro to help in its delivery. And it is up to ERB to decide on the resolutions. Probably, if they will approve it and they will issue a new order to amend the orders that were mentioned in the resolution, maybe it will return to the status quo ante. But as of now, they still have to act on it. Maybe you are looking at another day. [passage omitted]
