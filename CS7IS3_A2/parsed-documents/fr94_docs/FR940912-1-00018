FR940912-1-00018 FR940912-1-00010 40 CFR Part 60 [AD&hyph;FRL&hyph;5068&hyph;3] RIN 2060&hyph;AE94 Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources: Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Emissions From the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry (SOCMI) Wastewater AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule and notice of public hearing. SUMMARY: This action proposes standards of performance for wastewater sources in the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry (SOCMI). These standards implement section 111 of the Clean Air Act (the ACT) and are based on the Administrator's determination that VOC emissions from SOCMI cause, or contribute significantly to, air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. The intended effect of these standards is to require all new, modified, and reconstructed SOCMI process units to control wastewater emissions to the level achievable by the best demonstrated system of continuous emission reduction, considering costs, nonair quality health, environmental, and energy impacts, not just with end-of-pipe and add-on controls, but also by eliminating or reducing the formation of these pollutants. The proposed regulation would achieve an estimated reduction of 16,200 megagrams (Mg) of VOC in the fifth year following promulgation. DATES: Comments. The EPA will accept comments on the proposed rule until November 14, 1994. Public Hearing. If requested, the EPA will hold a public hearing concerning the proposed rule beginning at 10 a.m. on October 12, 1994.
