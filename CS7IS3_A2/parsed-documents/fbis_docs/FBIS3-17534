"It was a very interesting and intensive discussion. It focused mostly on our bilateral relations, but also relations within the Commonwealth of Independent States," Shumeyko said. "It is time to raise the question of closer integration within the CIS, perhaps, even the establishment of some supra-national bodies which could transform the Commonwealth into something like a union. Not the kind of union we had before, but a commonwealth preserving the sovereignty and freedom of all member states," Shumeyko said. The two leaders also discussed problems of citizenship, non- payment crisis and other issues. "Our points of view on bilateral relations coincided almost 100 per cent," Shumeyko concluded.
