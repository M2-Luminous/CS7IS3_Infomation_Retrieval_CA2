FR940927-2-00093 FR940927-2-00067 Federal Railroad Administration Petition for Exemption or Waiver of Compliance In accordance with 49 CFR 211.9 and 211.41, notice is hereby given that the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has received requests for exemptions from or waivers of compliance with a requirement of its safety standards. The individual petitions are described below, including the party seeking relief, the regulatory provisions involved, and the nature of the relief being requested. Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written views, data, or comments. FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts do not appear to warrant a hearing. If any interested party desires an opportunity for oral comment, they should notify FRA, in writing, before the end of the comment period and specify the basis for their request. All communications concerning these proceedings should identify the appropriate docket number (e.g., Waiver Petition Docket Number LI&hyph;93&hyph;13) and must be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel, FRA, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590. Communications received before, October 31, 1994, will be considered by FRA before final action is taken. Comments received after that date will be considered as far as practicable. All written communications concerning these proceedings are available for examination during regular business hours (9:00 a.m._5:00 p.m.) in Room 8201, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590. The individual petitions seeking an exemption or waiver of compliance are as follows: Northeast Illinois Railroad Corporation (Metra) Waiver Petition Docket Number LI&hyph;93&hyph;13 Metra seeks a temporary waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Locomotive Safety Standards (49 CFR Part 229) for Electric MU Locomotives and Non-MU Control Cab Locomotives. Metra is seeking relief from the requirements of Section 229.135 that all trains operating over 30 mph shall be equipped with an event recorder by May 5, 1995. Metra requests that the compliance date be extended to July 1, 1996. The Locomotive Safety Standards were revised on July 8, 1993, to require each lead locomotive of trains operating over 30 mph to be equipped with an event recorder by May 5, 1995. The railroad states that event recorders will be installed on existing equipment by retrofit and by an outside rebuilding program. In addition, new cars to be delivered will be equipped when built. The schedule for these activities extend to July 1, 1996, making the May 5, 1995, compliance date unattainable. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) Waiver Petition Docket Number LI&hyph;94&hyph;7 SEPTA seeks a permanent waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Locomotive Safety Standards (49 CFR Part 229). SEPTA is seeking relief from the requirement of ยง229.5(g) that: Event recorders monitor and record data: over the most recent 48 hours of operation of the electrical system of the locomotive on which it is installed. SEPTA states that a railroad supervisor can get to the scene of any accident on their system within one hour. They feel that 8 hours of recorded information is sufficient for any accident investigation on their railroad. SEPTA's event recorders are solid state devices which record each change in state. With their present recorder system a printed copy of the stored information fills about 73 pages. To accommodate 48 hours of recorded information would result in a very extensive printed copy with no additional useful information. FRA has previously ``grandfathered'' event recorders which were in service on July 8, 1993, and which recorded only 8 hours of data. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) Waiver Petition Docket Number LI&hyph;94&hyph;8 SEPTA seeks a temporary waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Locomotive Safety Standards (49 CFR Part 229) for Electric MU Locomotives. SEPTA is seeking relief from the requirements of Section 229.135 that all trains operating over 30 mph shall be equipped with an event recorder by May 5, 1995. SEPTA requests the compliance date be extended to December 7, 1995. The Locomotive Safety Standards were revised on July 8, 1993, to require each lead locomotive of trains operating over 30 mph to be equipped with an event recorder by May 5, 1995. The railroad states that off-the-shelf event recorders will be installed on conventional (non-MU locomotives) locomotives within the specified time, however, new design event recorders will be required for the Electric MU Locomotives. SEPTA is requesting seven additional months for the design, manufacture and installation of event recorders on their MU locomotive fleet.
