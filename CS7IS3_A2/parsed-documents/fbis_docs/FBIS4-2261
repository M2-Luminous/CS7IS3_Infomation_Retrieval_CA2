The employee-share system has already been widely adopted in thousands of rural enterprises, but a central law could help avoid disorder and chaos, and prevent the whole process from being too haphazard process, said the State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System (SCRES). Rural governments used to support collective enteprises by raising funds from local people and workers. The new co-operative system allows workers to buy shares in their local collectives and get paid according to their work and the number of shares they own. The shares will not be sold on the open market, only to workers and locals. Agriculture Ministry statistics show more than 2 million, or 10 percnt, of rural enterprises were turned into co-operatives by December. And another 60 million rural firms, mostly in the coastal provinces, are in the process of introducing the reform. The system has even caught on in the less-developed provinces. Twenty percent of the State firms have adopted it, a SCRES official said. He described this new system, which differs from the traditional and the standard shareholding systems, as a "new type of relations of production." Some economists argue that the new national system should bar shareholders from withdrawing or transferring their shares when they leave the enterprises. And they believe all shareholders should have equal decision- making power, regardless of how many shares they hold. However, the worker-shareholders should be paid according both to their work performance and the numbers of their shares. But the SCRES official admitted that many rural enterprises switching to shareholding co-ops did not follow this principle. Most have adapted the system to their local conditions. Beijing, Shanghai, Liaoning, Jiangsu and Sichuan have produced their own laws guiding the switch to shareholding co-ops, he said. And five other provinces and cities are now mapping out their own rules. The official said that the SCRES is one of several ministries responsible for drafting this law. The commission this year will investigate these provincial laws and listen to the opinions of experts, provincial leaders and entrepreneurs.
