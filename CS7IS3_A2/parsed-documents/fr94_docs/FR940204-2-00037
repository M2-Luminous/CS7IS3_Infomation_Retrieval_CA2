Only applications which are timely in accordance with 10 CFR 600.13 will be evaluated. Late applications will not be considered and will be handled in accordance with 10 CFR 600.13. Prospective applicants intending to submit an application in response to this solicitation should request a pre-application package, which includes standard forms, assurances and certifications, by notifying the DOE Contract Specialist in writing or by telephone. It is advised that prospective applicants submit their requests in writing no later than February 21, 1994. Questions regarding this solicitation should also be submitted in writing to the DOE Contract Specialist no later than March 8, 1994. Questions and answers will be issued in writing as an amendment to this solicitation. b. Selection of Proposals: Applications not responsive to the objective of this solicitation will not be considered. All timely applications that include a minimum 20% non-DOE cost-share for research and development phases and a minimum 50% non-DOE cost-share for the demonstration phase and meet the other requirements of this solicitation will be considered. c. All applications will be evaluated and point-scored in accordance with the following criteria. The applications should be fully responsive to each of the criteria. Weighting of Criteria: The Evaluation Criteria are weighted in the following manner: The criteria will be based on a maximum of 100 points. Criterion 1 has a maximum point value of 45. Criterion 2 has a maximum point value of 45. Criterion 3 has a maximum point value of 10. Criterion 1: Research Concept and Plan_Factors to be considered are the clarity, completeness, responsiveness, and adequacy of the statement of work; the merit and depth of discussion of the proposed project (review of supporting data obtained in laboratory and/or pilot scale work completed to date) to determine if the proposed work is new and advanced, is based on sound scientific/engineering principles, improves efficiency and reduces natural gas combustion equipment emissions significantly without post-combustion controls, and the general applicability, timeliness and potential economic viability of the proposed technology; the planned levels of data acquisition, sampling and analyses; the schedule (sequence of project tasks, principal milestones, decision points, and adequacy of time for each task); and the planned assignment of responsibilities and level of manpower to complete the research. Criterion 2: Applicant/Team Capabilities_Factors to be considered for the applicant and industrial partner team personnel are experience in research, development and demonstration of the project proposed; knowledge of past advanced developments in the work proposed; resources to perform the research, development and demonstration of the work proposed; ability to assemble a team of multi-disciplined individuals; qualifications of key individuals and the percentage of time devoted to the project; individual responsibilities, task assignments, and resource and manpower availability; draft business plan outline; project management methods; and, the applicant's or an industrial partner's capability to market the equipment developed and demonstrated as a result of this solicitation. Criterion 3: Facilities_Factors to be considered are the availability of laboratory and potential host facilities for performing research, development and demonstration work proposed; apparatus for performance of the tests, instrumentation, and data acquisition and control systems; and the availability of analytical support. d. The proposed cost of the project will not be point scored. Applicants are advised, however, that notwithstanding the lower relative importance of the cost considerations, the evaluated cost may be the basis for selection. In making the selection decision, the apparent advantages of individual technical and business applications will be weighed against the probable cost to the government to determine whether the application approaches (excluding cost considerations) are worth the probable cost differences. e. Selection: Applications will be evaluated under the Office of Energy Conservation and Renewable Energy Merit Review of Discretionary Financial Assistance Applications Review Procedures for Solicited Proposals. The Source Selection Official (SO) will make the selection for negotiation and award in accordance with the above evaluation criteria and in a manner that furthers the DOE programmatic goals. Conditions, Instructions and Notices to Applicants 1. General Conditions In conducting the application evaluations, the government may obtain assistance and advice from non-governmental personnel. Applicants are therefore requested to state on the application cover sheet if they do not consent to an evaluation by such non-government personnel. The applicants are further advised that DOE may be unable to give full consideration to an application submitted without such consent. Information contained in the applications shall be treated in accordance with the policies and procedures set forth in 10 CFR 600.18. DOE reserves the right to fund, in whole or in part, any, all, or none of the applications submitted in response to this solicitation. DOE may require applications to be clarified or supplemented to the extent considered necessary, either through additional written submissions or oral presentations; however, the award may be made solely on the information contained in the application. DOE is under no obligation to pay for any costs associated with preparation or submission of applications if an award is not made.
