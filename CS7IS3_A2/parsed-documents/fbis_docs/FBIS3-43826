The ANC has accused the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] of abusing the position of the Zulu king and the name of the Zulu people to further the political objectives of the IFP and its leader, Mangosuthu Buthelezi. A statement from ANC Midlands spokesman Blade Nzimande says yesterday's march on the Union Buildings in Pretoria was part of the continued abuse of Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. Nzimande said the fact of the matter is that people who marched to Pretoria yesterday were IFP members and not the entire Zulu nation. He's also expressed the ANC's condemnation of violence and thuggery that occurred. He says the ANC regards yesterday's behavior of the IFP as a dress rehearsal of national destabilization in the future.
