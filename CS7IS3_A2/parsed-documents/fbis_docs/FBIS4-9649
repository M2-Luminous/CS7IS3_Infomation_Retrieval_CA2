[Walesa] "I will try to support the young prime minister. I have experience with strikes--the polystyrene strikes, for example. The prime minister has less experience, so we will have to think about support where it is possible, while trying to ensure that there are no mistakes in the decisions. This matter has been going on too long. It really should have been resolved much earlier." [Announcer] The president denied that he was pleased that there were strikes. [Walesa] "I hear that it's a good thing for me that the strikes are continuing. I hear it...[Walesa pauses] Well, Lepper, you can say he's not to be taken seriously, but serious people--I think it was Bronislaw Geremek who said that it was good for me that the strikes were continuing. [sentence as heard] That's getting hold of the wrong end of the stick completely. I oppose strikes, although I went on strike many times myself, but that was when there was no other way to settle matters." [passage omitted]
