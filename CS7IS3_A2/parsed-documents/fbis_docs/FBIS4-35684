First, it has revealed the enemies' real intentions behind the creation of the so-called "security zone." The pages of their scenario are being blown away one after the other. Having plundered the gains made for the autonomy, which was engineered by the symbol of national unity President Saddam Husayn; turned the region into a den for Zionist espionage, and spread chaos and ruination in that Iraqi paradise, the enemies have now moved to the final page in that illusory scenario; namely, the liquidation of Kurds by manipulating agents and turning them against one another in fierce fighting in which thousands of our innocent people are falling victims in accordance with a set plan which is being implemented by these agents with the recklessness of traitors, the lack of conscience of agents, and the treason of criminals. Second, the agents who are befriending each other today are past enemies, and they will continue to be enemies despite their common interests and evil designs against our dear Iraqi Kurdistan. The Kurdistan Democratic Party cannot strike an alliance with the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. Their age-old conflict cannot possibly be removed by a theatrical signing of a treasonous agreement against the homeland and the people. The conflict between the two sides has continued for decades. So, it cannot simply be resolved on the table of negotiations even if it is a table of treason and charlatanry on which these agents have been brought up. Here are the facts being revealed and here are the cities, streets, districts, and subdistricts of Kurdistan streaming with blood caused by the fighting between these agents over the illusory booty of treason and mercenariness. Here is Jalal Talabani acquiring an additional characteristic of "fear." He says he cannot enter the region unless he is received by Mas'ud Barzani in Faysh Khabur and is personally accompanied into the region as an expression of this shaky reconciliation deal. Being birds of a feather, the intentions have become known and have therefore been rejected.
