The source added that the staff at the complex, run by the American company Chevron, were evacuated to the sea, from where they contacted their relatives in Luanda by phone. Without giving any more details, the source said this was the first military incident in Cabinda involving a foreign company. The Malongo complex is the most important in the country, accounting for 60 percent of the oil exploration in Angola. According to the source the attack took place in mid-morning. The staff were evacuated to the high sea and no one was killed. Despite various attempts, it has been impossible to get confirmation of this attack from the Chevron offices in Luanda or in Cabinda, as they are closed. In the meantime, the same source also said that UNITA and the Angolan Armed Forces have been fighting in Malanje.
