Around 100 armed Serb soldiers and police took control of the bridge on the River Sava Friday, overpowering a United Nations control post manned by Nepalese troops. Two battalions of Jordanian UN troops and part of a contingent of Argentinian peacekeepers in north-central Croatia were placed on alert, said UNPROFOR spokesman Matthew Nerzig. UNPROFOR commander in Yugoslavia, General Jean Cot, threatened Saturday to order the use of force to regain control of the bridge linking Stara Gradiska, Croatia, and the Bosnian town of Bosanska Gradiska. UNPROFOR deputy commander, John MacInnis, travelled to the region Tuesday to prepare a report on the situation for Yasushi Akashi, UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's special representative in ex-Yugoslavia, said Nerzig. A high-ranking UNPROFOR officer told AFP Saturday that, if the Serbs from the self-declared Serbian republic of Croatia (Krajina) refused to withdraw, the UN was in a position to "exert armed pressure on them, encircle them and block their movements." Western military sources here said the Krajina Serbs could have been supported by Serbian forces from northern Bosnia in seizing the bridge. The Croatian Serb agency ISKRA reported the takeover by a unit of Krajina's "special police" Friday.
