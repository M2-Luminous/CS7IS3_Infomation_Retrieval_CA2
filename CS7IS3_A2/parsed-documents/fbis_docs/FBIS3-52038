In assessing his trip to Leticia, a Colombian town near the Brazilian border, President Franco told JORNAL DO BRASIL that "Colombia is an important partner." Moreover, Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, who accompanied Franco in his trip to Leticia, said: "Through a free-trade zone we would be able to negotiate under better terms with other trade groups, such as NAFTA." Franco and Gaviria installed the Brazilian-Colombian Neighborhood Commission, which will be entrusted with finding solutions to problems concerning the fight against narcotics, environmental protection, and the adoption of measures to improve health and education conditions and assist Amazonian indigenous groups. The ideas is to expedite negotiations with Colombia before Gaviria leaves the presidency. Colombia is holding presidential elections at the end of the first half of this year, and Gaviria will be running for the OAS General Secretariat. The proposal to establish a South American Free Trade Zone (comprised of the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] countries Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay; Chile; and the five Andean Group member countries Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia) was also discussed at the Mercosur presidential summit held in Colonia, Uruguay last week.
