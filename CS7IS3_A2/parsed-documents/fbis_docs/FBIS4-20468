As tested by an expert panel and by customers, this material's main technical performance exceeds the international general-purpose SEMI [Semiconductor Equipment and Materials Institute] materials standards. This world-class product, costing one-third less than the equivalent imported item, can be used for manufacturing 2-3-ï¿½m-linewidth VLSI circuits. The Huajing scientists reported their achievement at the recently held National Semiconductor and Integrated Circuit Silicon Materials Conference.
