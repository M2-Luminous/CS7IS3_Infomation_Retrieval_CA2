Somchai Nilaphaichit, a representative of the Muslim Lawyer Group, quoted the suspects as saying that they had no involvement with the plot to attack the Israeli Embassy and that they came to Thailand to do business. Mr Somchai and Charan Malulin, a researcher at Chulalongkon University, yesterday visited the three Iranians during which he briefed them on Thai laws and the punishment they face if convicted. Mr Somchai said [suspect] Babak [Taheri] had allegedly told him he was innocent and that the police had no evidence against him. He quoted Babak as saying that he would not have come back to Thailand if he really was involved in the foiled car-bomb plot. [Suspect] Hossein [Shahriarifar], meanwhile, also denied involvement, reportedly telling Mr Somchai that he entered Thailand to extend his visa since he had a business concerning the trade of radio and television sets here. Hossein also denied reports that he had relations with a Thai woman, Mr Somchai said. [passage omitted]
