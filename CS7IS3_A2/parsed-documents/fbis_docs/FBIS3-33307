When he inaugurated the Mexican-German Business Meeting in Mexico City, Serra Puche asserted that the new Foreign Investment Law is applicable for all international investors, including the Germans, without any type of discrimination. Serra Puche explained to the German businessmen that in the years to come there will be another Mexico "with the capacity to access other markets held by no other country in America. From Mexico, there will be free access to American, Canadian, and Central American markets," as well as the possibility of entering North, Central, and South American markets without paying duties, he said. The official said foreign investments have broken all the records in Mexico. He noted that the country received $15.6 billion in investments in 1993, while just in January 1994, investments had reached $2.370 billion. He emphasized that "Mexico has been gaining ground in the race to attract foreign capital and to use its own savings." German Economy Minister Gunter Rexrodt and Tyll Necker, president of the German Industrial Confederation, support Mexico's membership to the OECD as a full-fledged member. He trusts that Mexico, in the short run, will become the "bridgehead" in uniting Latin American countries to enable them to join international development. The German minister also asked the Mexican Government to implement the Foreign Investment Law changes to expedite his country's participation and to give preference to German investors. He highlighted that no country has managed to take such an important leap in such a short time as Mexico has, which after several years of fiscal deficit has managed to obtain a surplus and to decrease inflation. German Minister Rexrodt recognized the importance of the Mexican-German double taxation agreement, which will increase Germany's commercial participation. German investment ranks second in Mexico, a country that is Germany's second commercial partner in Latin America with nearly 19 percent of the trade volume after Brazil.
