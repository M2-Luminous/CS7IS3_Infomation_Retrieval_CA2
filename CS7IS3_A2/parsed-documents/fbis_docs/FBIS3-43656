The government would spend the next few days working on the plan following "important inputs from the ANC's side", said Mr de Klerk. The two sides will meet next week to discuss the composite plan. The joint press conference was the first in South Africa since the signing of the Pretoria Minute in August, 1990. Tuesday's four-hour talks at Pretoria's Union Buildings were attended by chief negotiators Roelf Meyer and Cyril Ramaphosa, as well as Justice and Defence Minister Kobie Coetsee. Mr Mandela noted the talks were conducted in a "spirit of reconciliation". "You will see that none of us has a blue [color as received] eye," the ANC president quipped. The leaders discussed more talks with the Freedom Alliance to try to persuade it to join negotiations. Mr de Klerk said such an approach would be decided on "in the next few days". He reiterated the government and the ANC wanted the Freedom Alliance to be part of the country's constitutional settlement, adding that no effort would be spared "even at this stage". Mr Mandela said he had briefed the state president on his Monday meeting with Conservative Party and Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front] leader Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg, whereafter Dr Hartzenberg said there was no point in continuing talks with the anc on the Afrikaner demand for a "volkstaat" [Afrikaner homeland]. Mr de Klerk and Mr Mandela repeated their condemnation of unacceptably high levels of violence, particularly on the East Rand and in parts of Natal. "(It) must come to an end," Mr de Klerk said. He conceded the problem had been exacerbated by Sunday's shooting during a tour of Katlehong by Mr Ramaphosa and South African Communist Party leader Joe Slovo. Mr Mandela said if violence was to be ended specific proposals should not be publicised at present. Mr de Klerk said he remained confident, however, that a free and fair election was possible on April 27, but areas such as the East Rand and Natal "must be stabilised".
