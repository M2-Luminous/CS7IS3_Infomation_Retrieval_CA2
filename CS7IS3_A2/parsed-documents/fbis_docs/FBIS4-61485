"We will not engage in hooliganism, nor do we intend to capture anyone," said [Defense Minister] Pavel Grachev, replying to an ITAR-TASS correspondent's question on a Ukrainian Defense Ministry statement about alleged Russian plans to seize 20 Tu-22 military aircraft during the forthcoming Black Sea Fleet exercises. Regarding the state of affairs on the division of the Black Sea Fleet, the minister noted that Russian and Ukrainian groups of experts are currently at work. Their findings on this question will be examined at the second round of talks on the future of the Black Sea Fleet. At the same time Grachev stated that the Russian version will scarcely differ substantially from the one it proposed at the talks in Sevastopol between the Russian and Ukrainian defense ministers. "It has been endorsed by the Russian president and reflected in five previous agreements signed by the presidents of the Ukraine and Russia," Pavel Grachev said.
