Zh.," with commentary by Mikhail Shchipanov] [Text] Speaking at a State Duma plenary session yesterday, Viktor Kobelev, who was number two on the Liberal Democratic Party [LDPR] slate, announced his disagreement with the ways of V.V. Zh. [Zhirinovskiy], as well as his decision to leave the faction. He was joined by another LDPR member, Aleksandr Pronin. V.V. Zh. would not put up with such an escapade from his associates, saying that the "scoundrels and scumbags Kobelev and Pronin have already been expelled from the party and the election slate for conduct impermissible for a deputy, and also for criminal offenses." Kobelev, however, dismissed these accusations as false, noting that if V.V. Zh. does not calm down, he (Kobelev) would match each of these strikes with ten. "I remain in the LDPR Supreme Council because the question of my expulsion may be decided only by a party congress." Nonetheless, Kobelev has not so far decided whether he will create his own faction with his supporters in the LDPR, stressing, however, that many of them are ready to follow his suit and leave V.V. Zh.'s faction. According to Kobelev, V.V. Zh.'s extremist tricks, unauthorized by the LDPR congress, do not fit into the party program or rules. Therefore in the very near future one can expect not only the disintegration of the Zhirinovskiy faction, but also a split within the LDP. Afterword The departure of two dissident liberals can be the thin end of a wedge that bodes no good for Zhirinovskiy. Indeed, there is nothing sensational in the mere fact of factional desertion: there have been plenty of precedents while small factions and groups, anxious to expand their base, are dead set against the principle: either you are loyal to your party commitment in the State Duma, or put your membership card down on the table. Moreover, to V.V. Zh.'s shame and humiliation, there is no mechanism for recalling a deputy. And therefore all of his threats to throw the fugitive out into the street are just as menacing as this promise to send five Russian divisions to the Balkans. It is another matter that the great leader envisioned his "flock of falcons" lining up solidly behind him, and now this nuisance. Why? Have they finally seen the light? But this is simply ridiculous: Don't V.V. Zh.'s closest associates already know his true colors? This "recovery of sight," however, can be other than ideological. The people who have come into parliament on the LDP slate have been rumored to express their discontent with V.V. Zh.'s insufficient clout in distributing parliamentary posts and portfolios: apparently he has secured too few comfortable chairs in committees and subcommittees for his associates. Obviously, trust in Zhirinovskiy's omnipotence has been shaken. Moreover, some of his followers began to realize that in the leader's shadows one can easily catch a cold. At the same time, it was clear that the first person to challenge Zhirinovskiy on his own turf could immediately emerge from obscurity into the limelight, launching his own parliamentary career with a noisy scandal which has attracted the attention of the press and colleagues. The design is fairly accurate. It is only that it speaks about the true motives of Zhirinovskiy's "falcons" a little too plainly.
