A few days before his appointment by the expanded Higher Council of the Republic (HCR, the transitional parliament), this remark is important, coming from Monsignor Monsengwo, the president of the institution. What is he doing in Brussels while in Kinshasa the HCR is putting the finishing touches to the transitional constitution and is preparing to choose the prime minister - - a bone of contention? But does Monsignor really want to be on the spot at the time of the choice, which is due to be made "in around 10 days?" This appointment "does not concern me...I do not want to wear the hat" of a politician or have the responsibility for the actions of a politician. Right To Examine "The agreement relates to the appointment of the prime minister by the opposition. If the opposition is to elect the prime minister, the other camp must not have the right of veto, at most a right to examine, since we are acting by consensus. This right to examine may be purely negative in the sense that we could say -- as in the 20 December agreement -- that the Political Forces of the Conclave (Mobutuists -- LA LIBRE BELGIQUE editor's note) acknowledge their choice provided the person elected, whoever he might be, can respect the agreements in the formation of his government and in the administration of the state. That being so, it is not obvious that there should be a vote. These are the agreements and I am anxious that they should be respected." So, what is the point of the candidates put forward in the past few days? "Many people want to be prime minister. There is even reason to be surprised at that in a situation as complex as that of Zaire today." Reviewing the Timetable According to Monsignor Monsengwo, the election timetable "will have to be reviewed." Indeed, four months have passed since the adoption of the protocol which set the beginning of the Third Republic for 1 January 1985. According to the prelate, the stages of this will be "the constitutional referendum, then the presidential and parliamentary elections at the same time, then the regional and local elections. This can only happen when the institutions are in place, in other words, not just the transitional government, but the government, and the National Elections Commission," which will monitor the elections. Will they be reliable? "All the necessary measures must be taken to ensure that they are: Access for all to the media, installation of a minimum of telecommunications to enable the people in the interior of the country to be able to follow the election campaign. That could be done in six months with help. Finally, we need national and foreign observers to monitor the process."
