But according to the leaders of the two organizations, today's meeting was in line with ongoing talks between the two groups. [Begin recording] [Reporter Nan Roux] The ongoing violence and the rejection of a one-ballot system for the coming elections. These were the issues discussed at a meeting between IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and PAC President Clarence Makwetu. The two leaders said such a system was undemocratic and would rob voters of their freedom to choose parties at both the provincial and national level. [Makwetu] If we talk of democracy, if I vote on a provincial level, and I want to vote differently on a national level I should have liberty to do so. It should not be decided by the bureaucrat where my vote should lie. [Roux] Mr. Makwetu said the PAC and the IFP had already contacted the Democratic Party, the Dikwankwetla Party, and others who favor the two-ballot system, in order to work out a joint strategy. On the issues of violence, both leaders committed themselves to addressing the situation as soon as possible for fear that it might jeopardize the entire election process. [Makwetu] I support a move by the people directly involved in the violence sitting together, trying to resolve their differences. [Roux] Mr. Makwetu said joint activity between the PAC, the IFP, and the ANC, was the only solution. [end recording]
