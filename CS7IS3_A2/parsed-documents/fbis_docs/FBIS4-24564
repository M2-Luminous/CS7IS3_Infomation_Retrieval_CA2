"It is an act which does not win the hearts of the people to terrorize a politician who took a wise attitude on the issue of Japan's past invasion," according to a comment released by the ministry's information department. The assailant told police that he was angered by Hosokawa's apology, when he was premier, for Japan's wartime actions.
