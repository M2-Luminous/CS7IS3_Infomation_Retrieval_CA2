The source, who is close to Lebanese minister of hydraulic and electrical resources Ilyas Hubayqah, told IRNA here Monday that the Iranians were delivered to Zionist regime by elements affiliated with head of Lebanese Maronite Party Samir Ja'ja'. He said the hostages who were three Iranian diplomats along with Islamic republic news agency's photographer were taken as hostage when they came across a Lebanese paramilitary troops' checkpoint in 1982. They were taken to occupied Palestine via sea last year once Geagea was forced to quit his command headquarters. Since then, Iranian officials repeatedly have called for their release, but Lebanese paramilitary troops have refused to acknowledge that they are holding the four Iranian hostages. Families of the hostages have also offered documents to the international bodies, appealing for their release. Foreign Minister Velayati also in a letter last month called on his Lebanese counterpart Faris Bouez to probe into the issue.
