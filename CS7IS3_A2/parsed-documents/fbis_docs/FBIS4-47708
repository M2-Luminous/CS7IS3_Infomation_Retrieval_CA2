At the Parade here in Cape Town, a large group of people has gathered. It is clear they are from the National Party and from the ANC. But before we return to them, we earlier spoke to Mr. Kriel and during the run-up to the election there had been a lot of criticism against the National Party's campaign, particularly from the ANC. It was said that the campaign was a racist one, and that there were fears in the Colored community that this aspect was being exploited. We asked Mr. Kriel about this. [Kriel] We did not take advantage of people's fears. We fought a hard election campaign against the ANC. We did not spare them, they did not spare us. As far as my vision for the Western Cape region is concerned -- the Cape of Good Hope as I always call it -- I think that the first thing that we have to do is to initiate a process of reconciliation. We have to leave the petty politics behind, we have to take hands, we have to plan jointly how to improve the quality of life, especially that of the poor people in the region. [passage omitted]
