Chairman Hirotaro Higuchi), a private advisory body to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, held a meeting at the prime minister's official residence on the morning of 25 May, and exchanged views on the international situation after the end of the Cold War. It was confirmed that "it is necessary to prevent regional disputes and proliferation of mass destruction arms because there are isolated and unpredictable dangers in various places." Taking such a situation into consideration, the council agreed that "Japan should take positive actions to resolve international problems," and decided to make this view the framework of a report to be submitted to the prime minister. With regard to the Asian and Pacific situation, the participants cited the following as important issues: 1) while the economy in this region is steadily developing, its security system is immature; 2) interests of the major military powers, such as the United States, Russia, and China, are entangled. The council decided to state in the report its view that Japan's defense capability "will become an increasingly important component for the security environment of the Asian and Pacific region."
