Talks are being held on the borders, the number of cantons, the distribution of the ministries in the government, and the posts in the federation. The course of the talks has so far been marked by rapprochement in all spheres, but, considering that these are very sensitive issues, they will require longer and more patient talks. A more specific agreement on the distribution of ministries in the government and the posts in the federation is expected after the conclusion of the talks on the cantons.
