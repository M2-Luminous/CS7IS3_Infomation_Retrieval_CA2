Mihajlovski: "Additional Contingent of Americans"] [Excerpts] An additional contingent of 200 to 250 U.S. troops will arrive in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] in the next few weeks. This information was given by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili at yesterday's news conference in Skopje. Shalikashvili, who had meetings with President of the Republic Kiro Gligorov and Defense Minister Vlado Popovski, also visited U.S. troops serving as part of the UNPROFOR forces for Macedonia, located in the Petrovec military camp, and said at a news conference that President Clinton had announced his readiness to send more U.S. troops to Macedonia. [passage omitted] The Defense Minister of the Republic of Macedonia Vlado Popovski also spoke at the news conference, and said that the Macedonian side thought that the U.S. contingent should be expanded, because that was a way of strengthening the preventive peacekeeping. "We agreed that Macedonia represented the key factor for peace and stability in the region, and that preventive peacekeeping in Macedonia was equally important as the solution to the conflict in Bosnia- Herzegovina." Minister Popovski said that they had had discussions about military cooperation with the United States, in the sense of giving assistance to the transformation of our defense concept to NATO standards. On the possible arrival of a U.S. military attache in Macedonia, Popovski said that "there obviously is a need for a military liaison officer but he will be given the status of a military attache after the establishment of full diplomatic relations," explaining that the United States had also agreed that there was a need to send such a person to Macedonia. Asked about possible discussions on ceding the Krivolak military camp to U.S. soldiers, Popovski replied: "Such ideas are neither current nor initiated by either of the two sides. We only discussed possible U.S. assistance in the transformation of our army, first of all for the defense of the Republic of Macedonia, and for its inclusion in the `Partnership for Peace' project." According to the information released from the cabinet of the president of the Republic of Macedonia, the Macedonian-Greek dispute was also a subject of discussions between President Gligorov and Shalikashvili (also attended by Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski and Popovski), in the sense that it could have negative implications for the wider stability in the south of the Balkans. President Gligorov personally has renewed the request by our state to join the "Partnership for Peace" NATO project.
