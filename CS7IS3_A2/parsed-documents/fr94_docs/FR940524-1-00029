FR940524-1-00029 FR940524-1-00010 Tuesday May 24, 1994 Part II Department of Health and Human Services Public Health Service 42 CFR Part 84 Respiratory Protective Devices; Proposed Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 99␣/␣Tuesday, May 24, 1994␣/␣Proposed Rules DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Public Health Service 42 CFR Part 84 RIN 0905&hyph;AB58 Respiratory Protective Devices AGENCY: National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Public Health Service, HHS. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: This proposed rule addresses NIOSH's and the Department of Labor/Mine Safety and Health Administration's (MSHA) certification requirements for respiratory protective devices. Specifically, the proposal would replace existing MSHA regulations with new public health regulations, while also upgrading current testing requirements for particulate filters. This action is the first of a series of modules which will, over the next several years, upgrade current respirator requirements. This modular approach will allow improvements to be implemented on a priority basis as well as facilitate adaptation to new requirements by the manufacturers and users of respirators. Except for the particulate-filter requirements, most requirements of existing regulations would be incorporated into the new regulations without change. The proposed testing requirements for particulate filters would significantly improve the current approach to evaluating the effectiveness of an air-purifying respirator's filter to remove toxic particulates from the ambient air, updating existing provisions to be consistent with two decades of advances in respiratory protection technology. The certification of air-purifying respirators under these proposed requirements would also enable respirator users to select from a broader range of certified respirators that meet the current performance criteria recommended by CDC for respiratory devices used in health-care settings for protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the infectious agent that causes tuberculosis (TB). This Notice also announces an informal public meeting on the proposed rule, as indicated below. Elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register , MSHA is publishing a proposal to remove existing regulations at 30 CFR part 11, which would be made obsolete by a final rule resulting from this proposed rule. DATES: Written comments must be received at the NIOSH Docket Office before the close of business on July 8, 1994. Interested persons wishing to provide oral comments at an informal public meeting should file a request for appearance with the NIOSH Docket Office no later than the close of business May 31, 1994. The informal public meeting will be held on June 7th and 8th, 1994, beginning both days at 9 a.m. ADDRESSES: Comments on the proposed rule should be mailed in triplicate to the NIOSH Docket Office, Robert A. Taft Laboratories, Mail Stop C34, 4676 Columbia Parkway, Cincinnati, Ohio 45226. Requests to participate in the public meeting should be mailed in duplicate to the NIOSH Docket Officer, at the same address. The informal public meeting will be held at the Holiday Inn/Capitol, 550 C St., SW., Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Richard W.
