Police sources reported that terrorists planned to detonate a car bomb containing 600 kg of explosives in Lima on 17 May on the 14th anniversary of the launching of the SL "people's war." The attack was aborted when extremist Ayma Rosa Cabanillas Contreras, 22 years old, was arrested. She confessed that she was chosen to conduct the subversive operation and to provide the necessary materials to those entrusted with perpetrating the attack. Cabanillas Contreras has four police records for involvement in terrorist attacks. The police source said she was arrested on 10 May "after an exhaustive intelligence operation that started about four months ago." Cabanillas has been placed at the disposal of the military courts on charges of "treason against the fatherland," the legal term in Peru for aggravated terrorist crimes. If found guilty, she could be sentenced to life imprisonment. Cabanillas is the second SL leader to be arrested by the Peruvian Police in the past two months. The police already arrested Felipe Tenorio, believed to be the SL "Number Two." The SL organization split in 1993 after its top-ranking leader, Abimael Guzman -- who was arrested in 1992 -- recognized the political and military defeat of the SL and submitted a peace proposal to the government.
