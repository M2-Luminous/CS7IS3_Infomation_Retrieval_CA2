As KGB Chief Henadz Lavitski stated, the aim of the reforms is to bring the KGB in line with its goals, its time demands, and to break decisively with its atypical functions. Currently, KGB activities include conducting intelligence and counterintelligence, and providing power and management bodies with information necessary for making state decisions. The KGB will directly participate in the implementation of a state anticrime program by coordinating its activities with other Belarusian law enforcement agencies, strictly keeping within the framework of their competence and the acting legislation.
