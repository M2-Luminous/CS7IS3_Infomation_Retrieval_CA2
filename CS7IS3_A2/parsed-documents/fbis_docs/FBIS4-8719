The meeting took place on the basis of a decision of the Coalition Council, which asked that certain facts be clarified regarding property matters of the daily REPUBLIKA and the transfer of its registration to a different entity. Dusan Kleiman stated that the TA SR did not violate any legal norms and did not use any funds from the state budget to publish the daily. He considers it intolerable for a news agency to publish an opinion-forming [mienkotvorny] daily, but the entire process of the daily REPUBLIKA's becoming independent has been slowed down by the fact that Republika Ltd., which is ready to assume all liabilities of the daily and to take the burden off the TA SR, has not yet been registered. "It is an absurd situation when a state agency publishes a daily that is full of invectives against the crucial state bodies -- the National Council, the president, and the government," Roman Kovac told reporters after his meeting with Dusan Kleiman. According to his words, the TA SR operates with a deficit, caused by the daily REPUBLIKA. Last year, the loss amounted to more than 18 million Slovak korunas [Sk]. He said that Sk30-35 million had been appropriated from the 1993 state budget for the TA SR and this year the subsidy even went up to Sk42 million. Apart from this, the news agency has some income from its entrepreneurial activity (last year it supposedly amounted to Sk95 million). Roman Kovac noted that the TA SR operates with a single fund, into which all its financial resources flow. It is therefore difficult to say whether the loss caused by REPUBLIKA has been offset by korunas from the state budget or by profit from the agency's commercial activities. The argument that the publication of the daily REPUBLIKA should be the TA SR's commercial venture does not hold water, according to Roman Kovac, because, under a Slovak Ministry of Finance decree, organizations of this type can only engage in commercial activities that do not cause losses. This provision has not been observed, "which amounts to a violation of a legislative norm," Roman Kovac stressed. Asked by reporters whether a change in the post of TA SR director general was to be expected, Roman Kovac replied that this matter will still have to be considered. He noted that, probably today, Dusan Kleiman would submit to him proposals on how to deal with the situation that has arisen. According to Roman Kovac, the TA SR director general realizes his share of responsibility, be it responsibility of economic nature or responsibility for the violation of legal regulations. "Although it is true that he did not violate them himself, the head of an organization must bear the consequences for his deeds and is also accountable for his subordinates," Roman Kovac said. Roman Kovac is convinced that the TA SR should operate as an independent agency and said that it was unthinkable for it to publish an opposition daily. He considers the privatization of the daily REPUBLIKA to the full extent, that is, including the debts it has run up, to be the most suitable solution to the problems surrounding the newspaper. As he went on to say, the orders placed by the government with the daily REPUBLIKA in the form of various supplements, which needlessly siphoned off resources from the budgets of individual ministries, are being abolished and the ministry will have to find a new form of maintaining contact with the public, for example by means of bulletins and the like.
