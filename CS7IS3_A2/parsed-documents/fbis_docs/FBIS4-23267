In a statement in Lagos today, the inspector general of police, Ibrahim Commassie, warned that any attempt to install another government other than the present federal military government by any person or group of persons, will be repelled with force. The inspector general of police said that the federal military government, in its genuine effort to return the country to a democratic rule, has set in motion a program to achieve the goal. He said the fact that the present military administration has continued to guarantee freedom of expression, should not be used to cause public disorder. The police therefore advised members of the public to go about their lawful businesses as their safety is guaranteed. The statement added that the Nigerian police and other security agents, are fully prepared to deal decisively with any person or group of persons who decide to break the public peace or stand as an obstacle to the march toward a lasting democracy.
