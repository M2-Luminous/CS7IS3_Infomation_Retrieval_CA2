FR940926-0-00052 FR940926-0-00011 Asplenium fragile var. insulare, a member of the spleenwort family (Aspleniaceae), is a fern with a short suberect stem. The leaf stalks are 5 to 15 centimeters (cm) (2 to 6 inches (in)) long. The main axis of the frond is dull gray or brown, with two greenish ridges. The fronds are thin-textured, bright green, long and narrow, 23 to 41 cm (9 to 16 in) long, 2 cm (0.8 in) wide above the middle, and pinnate with 20 to 30 pinnae (leaflets) on each side. The pinnae are rhomboidal, 0.8 cm (0.3 in) wide, and notched into two to five blunt lobes on the side towards the tip of the frond. The sori (spore-producing bodies) are close to the main vein of the pinna, with one to two on the lower side and two to four on the upper side (Hillebrand 1888, Wagner and Wagner 1992). The Hawaiian fern species most similar to Asplenium fragile var. insulare is Asplenium macraei. The two can be distinguished by a number of characters, including the size and shape of the pinnae and the number of sori per pinna (Wagner and Wagner 1992). Asplenium fragile var. insulare was known historically from East Maui, where it was recorded from the north slope of Haleakala and Kanahau Hill (Hawaii Heritage Program 1992a6, Hillebrand 1888). On the island of Hawaii, the taxon was found historically below Kalaieha, Laumaia, and Puu Moana on Mauna Kea (HHP 1992a12, 1992a14, 1992a15), Puuwaawaa on Hualalai (HHP 1992a4), west of Keawewai, above Kipuka Ahiu on Mauna Loa (HHP 1992a3, 1992a5), and near Hilo (HHP 1992a2). This fern is now known from eight populations on Hawaii between 1,600 and 2,377 m (5,250 and 7,800 ft) elevation (HHP 1992a7, Shaw 1992). These populations are on Federal, State, and private land. The populations are located at Keanakolu, Puu Huluhulu, Pohakuloa Training Area (nine subpopulations), Kulani Correctional Facility, Keauhou, the Mauna Loa Strip in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Kapapala Forest Reserve, and the summit area of Hualalai (HHP 1992a1, 1992a7 to 1992a11, 1992a13; Shaw 1992; Paul Higashino, The Nature Conservancy of Hawaii, Daniel Palmer, naturalist, and Warren H. Wagner, Jr., University of Michigan, pers. comms., 1992). The eight known populations total about 295 plants (Shaw 1992; Robert Shaw, in litt ., 1993; P. Higashino, D. Palmer, and W. Wagner, pers. comms., 1992). This fern is found in Metrosideros (Òhià) Dry Montane Forest, Dodonaea (Ààliì) Dry Montane Shrubland, Myoporum/Sophora (Naio/Mamane) Dry Montane Forest (Shaw 1992), and òhià/ Acacia (koa) forest (HHP 1992a9). Asplenium fragile var. insulare grows almost exclusively in lava tubes, pits, and deep cracks, with at least a moderate soil or ash accumulation, associated with mosses and liverworts. Infrequently, this fern has been found growing on the interface between younger àà lava flows and much older pahoehoe lava or ash deposits (Shaw 1992). The primary threats to Asplenium fragile var. insulare are browsing by feral sheep ( Ovis aries ) and goats ( Capra hircus ) and competition with the alien plant Pennisetum setaceum (fountain grass). At least one population is threatened by military operations and/or fires resulting from these operations (Loyal Mehrhoff, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), pers. comm., 1993). Stochastic extinction due to the relatively small number of existing individuals is also of concern. Ctenitis squamigera was first published as Nephrodium squamigerum by Hooker and Arnott in 1832. The species was subsequently placed in the genera Lastraea, Aspidium, and Dryopteris. In 1957 it was transferred to the genus Ctenitis, resulting in the currently accepted combination Ctenitis squamigera (Degener and Degener 1957). Ctenitis squamigera, a member of the spleenwort family (Aspleniaceae), has a rhizome (horizontal stem) 5 to 10 millimeters (mm) (0.2 to 0.4 in) thick, creeping above the ground and densely covered with scales similar to those on the lower part of the leaf stalk. The leaf stalks are 20 to 60 cm (8 to 24 in) long and densely clothed with tan-colored scales up to 1.8 cm (0.7 in) long and 1 mm (0.04 in) wide. The leafy part of the frond is deltoid to ovate-oblong, dark green, thin, and twice pinnate to thrice pinnatifid (leaflet sections). The sori are tan-colored when mature and in a single row one-third of the distance from the margin to the midrib of the ultimate segments (Degener and Degener 1957). Ctenitis squamigera can be readily distinguished from other Hawaiian species of Ctenitis by the dense covering of tan-colored scales on its fronds (Wagner and Wagner 1992).
