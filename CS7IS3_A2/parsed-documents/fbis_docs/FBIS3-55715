Why was he specifically chosen? After all, the opinion about him in Georgia was far from unanimous. [Sigua] I can tell you how I viewed it. This is a person with enormous international prestige and it would not have been serious on our part had we dismissed this aspect. Shevardnadze's return to Georgia could have given us two big advantages. He could have ensured Georgia received international recognition and its entry into such influential international organizations as the United Nations, CSCE, and so forth. It is wholly natural that these processes would have been connected with the name of Shevardnadze. Indeed, this is what subsequently happened. The second advantage lay in the fact that he could have developed international action on a broad scale and attracted foreign credits into the country with the help of which we would have been able to get the economy back on its feet. According to my calculations, just some four to five months after his return, we would have received $300-400 million in the form of preferential credits. Unfortunately, this did not happen. However, there were also two big disadvantages. The first was western Georgia; with his return, the situation there would have become even more acute. The second was the attitude of the Russian generals to the Gorbachev-Yakovlev-Shevardnadze [alliance]. However, when I weighed the pros and cons, the former outweighed the latter. [Kakabadze] Did you have any opponents in this matter? [Sigua] Yes. However, I managed to persuade them that Shevardnadze was no longer the same person whom Georgia used to know. Moreover, I sincerely believed this myself. [Kakabadze] Why have you said this with such regret? Do you think you made a mistake? [Sigua] Of course, I made a mistake. Life has shown that he has not changed a bit since he was first secretary of the [Georgian] Central Committee. I can see that no genuinely democratic -- not pseudo-democratic -- transformations have occurred in the country since his arrival. There is just the appearance of democracy. Tell me, how can one simply justify the fact that the law on elections was changed by him five times as a result of which people entered parliament who now make up the majority. This was just the start. One voluntaristic decision followed another.... The appointment of God knows who as ministers. Who can explain to me what guidelines one needs to follow in order to appoint a person with two criminal convictions as minister of internal affairs? One can go on and on. I admit that I made a mistake regarding this person. [Kakabadze]However, can one suppose that what is at play here is not so much the subjective factor but objective conditions? Do you think that anyone else in his place could have done more? [Sigua] I know that Shevardnadze's double game with the West was our ruin. It was already clear at the Malta summit that something had occurred in the division of spheres of influence and that Georgia and perhaps the whole Transcaucasus would be the first to leave Moscow's sphere of influence. At least, I felt that Shevardnadze knew what we simple mortals did not know and, therefore, he set his sights exclusively on the West. However, I realized as early as April that this was not the case. In such a situation, it would have been necessary to change one's policy and speak with Russia in a different way and not use the language of intrigue while playing up to the West. When those 88 UN observers did not come to Georgia, I already knew that the West, if not completely, had started to give us up as a bad job. On whose support had we been counting on all that time? Shevardnadze refused when [Russian Defense Minister] Grachev suggested bringing a contingent of Russian troops into Ochamchire [Abkhazia], Poti, Zugdidi, and Senaki [Mingrelia]. As a result, we experienced the Sukhumi tragedy. Who will answer for this? And one more thing -- why, if we are opposed in principle to the introduction of Russian troops, should we destroy our principles and bring them in no matter but with less effective results? Where is the logic in this? [Kakabadze]Where does the solution lie today? The people are already saying that independence is costing us too much. [Sigua] There is a solution. First, we have to retrieve the credits issued by the National Bank and this should be done as a matter of urgency. I have already stated that, according to my calculations, some $70-100 million from these credits have ended up in foreign banks. They must be returned and, in order to do this, our police should join Interpol whatever it may cost us and, thereby, establish ties with European banks. We should retrieve at least half of this money. This is the first thing. Second, for some five months now, no one has said a word about the fact that the IMF has elaborated a special mechanism aimed at giving support to system changes in Georgia. It is stated in the letter, which I handed to Shevardnadze and to which he has not reacted in any way, that the fund is ready to grant 50 percent of our quota in this organization right away. This amounts to $200 million. These $200 million plus the returned credits plus the work done in order to obtain more preferential credits from developed capitalist countries.... I believe that approximately $400-500 million, which can be collected in this way, is wholly sufficient for the initial stage of establishing Georgia's economy. Of this amount, approximately $70 million has to be allocated to the Georgian National Bank in order to strengthen the new national currency -- the lari -- that will be introduced in the near future. Otherwise, the same thing will happen to it as happened to the coupon. I view this way as a realistic one. We will then be able to purchase the necessary quantity of energy sources and the necessary raw materials and get our industry off the ground. According to my calculations, on this basis, we could achieve 65 or possibly 70 percent of the level of production that was attained in 1987. This is the figure that will bring our economic depression to an end. I am often being asked why am I opposed to our joining the CIS. I am not against our membership, provided it is officially established that we were forced to take this step. In that case, I will know that there was no other way out. However, when we are being told that joining the CIS is our only chance of survival, I do not agree with this. Russia will not feed us for free and trade with us at dumping prices. It is another matter that we should maintain very close financial and economic relations with all the former republics of the USSR as, at present, we basically do not have the means to conduct trade on new alternative markets. However, it is not necessary to join any new alliances in order to do this.
