Peptides obtained from the Organic Synthesis Institute of the Latvian Academy of Sciences in Riga were administered to the rats in doses of 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 20 mg/kg. Talcin and its analogue rigin had the biggest immune-stimulating effect at all doses tested. As the dose of the said peptides was increased, the number of IgM antibody-forming and rossette-forming cells [RFC] also increased. When the tripeptide SKE was used, the maximum RFC formed at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg, and when vasopressin was injected, immune system stimulation only occurred at the lowest dose (0.001 mg/kg). A vasopressin analogue that did not contain the amino acid glycine in its structure increased the number of RFC in the mice only when administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg. An increase in number of RFC (by a factor of 1.5) was also discovered in mice receiving substance P and its analogue. Among those peptides with an immune-suppressing function, the vasopressin analogue tripeptide IOS [expansion not given] manifested the greatest immunosuppressive effect. The specific effect of arginyl-asparagine appeared in a narrower dose range. As the dose in which it was administered was increased, the oligopeptide SKD manifested a strong immunosuppressive effect and proved capable of affecting the nervous and immune systems simultaneously. The immunomodulating capabilities of the aforesaid peptides were associated with the presence of amino acids such as arginine, lysine, tyrosine, and glutamic acid in their chemical structure.
