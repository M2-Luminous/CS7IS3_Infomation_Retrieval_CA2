Spanish Finance Minister Pedro Solbes told journalists after a meeting of EC finance ministers that Sweden, Finland, Norway and Austria should not be allowed to vote for a possible currency union between 1997 and 1999. The four countries are negotiating to enter the EC by January 1, 1995, two years ahead of the earliest possible date for currency union. But Solbes said he wanted the single currency decision limited to the EC's 12 current members. [passage omitted] Spain is worried that the EC newcomers, being relatively wealthy, would fulfill the currency union membership criteria and produce a majority to go ahead with the single currency, leaving other members like Spain behind. It has also complained that the newcomers would raise the EC economic averages of inflation and interest rates, making it more difficult for the poorer countries such as Spain to qualify for economic union. But the chairman of Monday's meeting, Yannos Papantoniou of Greece, said the Spanish position had no general support. German Finance Secretary Johan Eekhoff said there was nothing in the Maastricht Treaty to support it. The meeting expressed general support for an EC plan to fight unemployment by launching a massive ECU120 billion (132 billion dollar) infrastructure investment scheme, and by deregulating the labour market. Several ministers, particularly Philippe Maystadt of Belgium and Marianne Jelved of Denmark, stressed the need for greater monetary cooperation to prepare the ground for a single currency.
