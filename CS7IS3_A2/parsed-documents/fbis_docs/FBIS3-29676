The IIPA has recommended that the USTR label China, Brazil and India as priority foreign countries for negotiations on unfair trade relations and retain South Korea, Japan and nine other countries on the priority watch list. By Friday, the USTR had received industrial opinions on whether to invoke the Super 301 section of a 1988 trade law empowering him to take retaliatory steps against countries that fail to lower trade barriers against U.S. goods and will make public the opinions around next Wednesday, the association said.
