With obvious instigation from Vladislav Ardzinba's fascist regime, the criminal and socioeconomic situation in Abkhazia has sharply exacerbated. It can be said with confidence that complex anarchy is reigning there. The law enforcement bodies fail completely to monitor the situation, let alone the repressions carried out against the remaining Georgian population. Abkhazians and the Russian speaking population -- Russians, Armenians, Greeks, and others who are forced to leave the autonomous republic of Abkhazia and seek refuge somewhere else, are also alarmed. In only the Ochamchire and Gali rayons over the last three months -- October-December -- about 40 Abkhaz combatants were killed in clashes between separate individuals and armed units over pillaged goods. On 10-11 January this year, almost a real war was waged between the Abkhaz population of the villages of Chlou and (Arasartikhi) in Ochamchire rayon. Famous people living in Abkhazia are falling victim to the lawlessness of Abkhaz combatants and mercenaries. The public was alarmed over the news of the beastly killing of Shitnik, the chief doctor of Sukhumi's ambulance service. Especially worrying are instances of the mass killing of people of various nationalities. The mercenary executioners Balov, Smetanin, and Krasnov set up an horrific slaughterhouse in the village of Odishi in Sukhumi rayon as a result of which about 30 people were killed, mostly of Greek nationality. It is obvious that we are dealing with the genocide of the Greek population. Against this background, the populist statement by the Gudauta leader [Ardzinba] about the need for those Greeks who were evicted from Abkhazia in the 1940s to return to their homes can only be described as cynical. Drawing your attention to the above-mentioned atrocities, we call on the world community to strictly condemn the criminal acts committed by the Abkhaz combatants and mercenaries as well as their Gudauta patrons.
