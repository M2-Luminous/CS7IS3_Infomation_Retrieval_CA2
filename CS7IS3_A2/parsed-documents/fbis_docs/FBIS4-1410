FBIS4-1410 "drafr082_c_94024" FBIS-AFR-94-082 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 27 Apr South African Press Review for 27 Apr MB2704101594 MB2704101594 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR Mandela's Call To End Mass Action -- "Nelson Mandela correctly anticipates difficulty in bringing home to his supporters that the time for mass action is over," states the Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 27 April in a page-11 editorial. This is because workers throughout the country "have become accustomed to walking out or downing tools when they cannot get their own way. Having encouraged mass action as an effective method of bringing pressure on the Government, the ANC is not now going to switch it off too easily." "Perhaps" the "most daunting" task for the future government is to convince people to stop thinking in "terms of resistance" and start thinking about "addressing problems." SOWETAN Elections in KwaZulu-Natal -- "The eyes of South Africa and perhaps the world are likely to be on the KwaZulu-Natal region after the elections," begins the Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 27 April in a page-6 editorial. The violence in this area of the country is "obviously a symptom of socio-economic problems...and is not about to stop after the elections." Kenyan mediator Washington Okumu, who played a role in encouraging Buthelezi to join the elections, warned that "there is a tendency among victorious political groups in Africa to wipe out the losers. But we believe the elections could also serve to end the deep enmity between the ANC and the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] with King Goodwill Zwelithini playing a vital role. Our wish is that there should be a balance in the distribution of power which will give the king the chance to play a unique role in the history of South Africa." In conclusion the SOWETAN states that "Natal is a vital region and if things go wrong there, they are likely to take similarly unfortunate routes in the rest of the country."
