Russian President Boris Yeltsin told reporters at a joint press conference at the end of the summit that the CIS leaders adopted a statement on the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict and Russia agreed to send its peace-keeping troops there to join the U.N. observers. Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze believed that the statement covered several important points, including an urgent appeal to the U.N. Security Council to start a peace-keeping operation in Abkhazia, a breakaway autonomous republic of Georgia. Asked why Ukraine chose to join the CIS' economic union as an associate member, its President Leonid Kravchuk replied: "the question is whether integration is to be accomplished on equal or unequal terms." The Ukrainian leader pointed out that the unification of the Belarus and Russian monetary systems signifies deeper integration than the Euro-Asian Union proposed by Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev. Kazakh Vice-President Yerik Ansanbayev disclosed that "a comprehensive program for the formation of the Euro-Asian Union will be submitted by Kazakhstan at the next CIS summit." Moldovan President Mircea Snegur believed that ordinary CIS citizens will receive plenty of economic benefits as a result of the Moscow summit. Yeltsin also announced at the press conference that the next CIS summit meeting will be held on December 9.
