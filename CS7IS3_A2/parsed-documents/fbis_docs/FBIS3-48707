Commenting on this, a NODONG SINMUN today says: This is part of the crafty ruses to whitewash the inhuman acts committed systematically by the United States. Recalling the materials of radiation tests on human bodies brought to light in the United States of late, the analyst says: Those tests were aimed at realizing the ambition for nuclear monopoly by largely increasing the production of nuclear weapons. Radiation tests on human bodies were carried out in real earnest each time the U.S. Government was going to manufacture a new type of nuclear weapon. This was a heinous crime of the U.S. warmaniacs to dominate the world with nuclear weapons and a shocking act of murder to which innocent Americans fell victims. The U.S. Government must feel compunction for this anti-human act and punish those responsible. The United States' nuclear ambition has not changed at all. New high-efficiency nuclear weapons are being manufactured, in actuality, behind the screen of nuclear disarmament. This suggests that radiation tests on human bodies more brutal than in the past days might be committed in the United States. The United States must renounce the ambition for nuclear monopoly and not repeat any more such beastly act as radiation tests on human bodies.
