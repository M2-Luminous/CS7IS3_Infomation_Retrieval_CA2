THAI RAT's 450-word editorial, on page 3, titled: "Keep a Close Watch on Japan," says it is necessary for "the Thai Government and the private sector to closely monitor developments following the collapse of the U.S.-Japan trade talks last week because they can have `considerable' impact on the Thai economy in general." The editorial says that the failure of the negotiations has caused the yen's appreciation against the U.S. dollar. "Consequently, Thailand is affected immediately in two ways. First, it will have to pay more for raw materials and semi-finished products imported from Japan. Second, the exchange rate of the baht will rise and thus affect Thailand's competitiveness in the international market." The paper cites reports on Japan's move to open its market for hundreds of countries with which it has been developing trade surpluses in an attempt to prevent them from being exploited by the United States. "We must closely monitor all developments so that we can figure out what goods we can sell in their market. Meanwhile, we must make the necessary preparations to cope with the relocation of Japanese factories to other countries. We have to attract them to our country." "Labor costs in Thailand might be higher than those in China, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Burma, but that is not a problem since labor forms only 22 percent of total production cost. We have an open money market and telecommunications network that is far superior to those of many other countries. If the state and private sectors join hands, we will gain substantially." KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT's 400-word editorial, on page 2, titled: "Beware, We Might Get It," cites reports from foreign news agencies on U.S. President Clinton's pledge to impose sactions against Japan in retaliation for the latter's refusal to cooperate in solving the problem of the U.S. trade deficit. The first retaliatory measure to be used by the United States is the closure of its cellular phone markets. The editorial notes: "Although the cellular phone is only a product, the closure of the U.S. markets has psychological repercussions on U.S. trading partners, including Thailand." The paper notes: "President Bill Clinton said earlier he would probably not take immediate retaliatory action against Japan. Nobody knows why he changed his mind. Therefore, we should try to find out why he changed his mind so fast." The editorial assumes that the closure of the U.S. cellular phone market is a warning to Japan that the United States takes the trade deficit problem very seriously and proof of President Clinton's decisiveness to the American people. "As for Thailand, we must always remember that the United States has been picking on us regarding its trade deficit. Seemingly lenient, the United States is very strict with us on violations of copyrights and other trade and service rights. We are still in a dangerous position, watched closely by the United States, and can also face trade retaliation. "We cannot say that the United States will not do anything against us. What the United States has done to Japan should serve as a warning to all countries to not take advantage of or cheat it. It is believed, however, that the United States will use careful judgement before punishing any country, otherwise it might cause excessive difficulties or a tense situation which can trigger violent responses detrimental to the GATT endeavours to eliminate tax barriers and other obstacles to strengthening the international free trade system."
