On 7 October 1993, the first meeting was held, with attendees representing various research institutes under the jurisdiction of AIST and administrative personnel from MITI and AIST. At this meeting, university researchers gave lectures on liquid crystalline molecular building blocks and the science of super-molecules, which were followed by discussion. With an eye to ferreting out futuristic research ideas and seeking project topics, the Forum plans to hold roughly four meetings by the spring of 1994. AIST says its previous projects concerning material development primarily pursued improvement of performances and functions of existing materials, i.e., they were not meant to develop new materials in a true sense. Therefore, AIST established the New Material Research Forum for the purpose of discovering technical seeds that will eventually lead to the creation of new materials, such as nylon, which began the historical material revolution. The Forum is organized with members from MITI and related institutions, although the policy is to maintain a flexible membership structure, since research targets could be wide-ranging; i.e., the best qualified researcher for a given topic will be asked to join the Forum, regardless of affiliation. The first meeting was attended by 11 researchers from the National Institute of Materials and Chemical Research (NIMC) and the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory, in addition to administrative personnel from MITI and AIST. Assistant Professor Takashi Kato of the Production Technology Research Institute of Tokyo University and Assistant Professor Akihiko Ueno of the Tokyo Institute of Technology lectured on ``liquid crystalline molecular building blocks'' and ``the science of super-molecules,'' respectively, and research activities and trends under these topics were discussed after the lectures.
