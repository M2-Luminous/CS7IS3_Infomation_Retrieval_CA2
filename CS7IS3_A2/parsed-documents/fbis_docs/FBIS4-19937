It is benefiting from increasingly positive expectations for economic development, in particular among voters in western Germany, as the latest poll of the ZDF [Second German Television Channel] Political Barometer shows. In April the CDU/CSU reached its highest popularity in a year (west: 39 percent, east: 24 percent), ZDF reported on Friday [22 April]. However, a majority of 54 percent still believe that the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] will win the Bundestag elections in October; 30 percent believe that the government of the CDU/CSU and Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] will win. In the March poll, however, 61 percent had predicted an SPD election victory, and only 23 percent saw the government in the lead. In contrast to the CDU/CSU coalition partners, the FDP was not able to achieve an increase in popularity. In the so-called Political Barometers projection, which also includes the longer-term behavior of the voters, the FDP was at the critical 5 percent threshold in April. If Bundestag elections were held next Sunday, the CDU/CSU would get 37 percent (plus 1 percentage point,) the FDP 5 percent (minus 1 percentage point). The results for the other parties would remain unchanged: SPD--39 percent; Greens--9 percent; Republikaner--4 percent; and Party of Democratic Socialism--3 percent. The proportion of German citizens who expect an economic upswing has almost doubled over the past half year, according to the Political Barometer. In October there were 23 percent, in April 43 percent (west: 46 percent, east: 34 percent). Parallel to this development, for the first time since last autumn the CDU regained its competence for economic policy in the west Germans' view and was once again ahead of the SPD (CDU/CSU: 27 percent, SPD: 22 percent). In eastern Germany the CDU/CSU and the SPD are attributed an approximately equal share in their ability to solve economic problems (CDU/CSU: 19 percent, SPD: 21 percent). For the Political Barometer in April the Mannheim Election Research group polled about 1,000 representatively chosen voters in western and eastern Germany respectively.
