Statistics show that the gross national product of Jilin last year reached 55 billion yuan-worth, an increase of 14.3 percent over the previous year. The total retail volume of commodities topped 35 billion yuan- worth -- a growth of 18 percent over 1992. The province has taken bold measures to transform the operational mechanisms of its industrial enterprises, and more and more state-owned enterprises are being granted decision-making powers in management and operation, local officials said. Further reform measures have been implemented in the personnel and income-distribution systems in about 2,600 local state-owned enterprises. Hundreds of state-owned enterprises have been auctioned off or sold. The number of share-holding enterprises in Jilin province has reached 371 so far. Meanwhile, the provincial government has also attached much importance to the reform of the price system. The prices of coal, refined oil, cement and timber are now under market regulation. The number of industrial products with controlled prices have been reduced from 23 to 12. As one of the country's largest grain producers, Jilin has increased its agricultural input and made special efforts to lighten the burden on local farmers. In spite of being stricken with serious natural disasters, the province still managed to get a bump harvest last year, with grain output totalling 19 billion kg and a growth of 7.1 percent in the average income of farmers. Taking advantage of the international exploration of the Tuman River delta, Jilin has expanded its economic co-operation and exchanges with foreign countries, especially neighboring countries in northeast Asia. The export turnover of Jilin last year topped 1.6 billion U.S. dollars-worth, and the province actually utilized 650 million U.S. dollars in foreign investment, both substantial growths over the previous year. Meanwhile, the improvement of transportation and communication facilities, and the speeding up of infrastructure construction have created a better economic environment in Jilin, the officials said.
