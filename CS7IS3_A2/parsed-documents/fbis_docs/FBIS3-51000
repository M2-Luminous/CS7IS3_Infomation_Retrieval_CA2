Oviedo stated that the chain of command stipulates that the Armed Forces commander-in-chief conveys appointments to the 1st Army Corps commander who advises the 3d Cavalry Division, headquartered in Curuguaty. On 9 January a report was published based on information gleaned from the Army's weekly, which states that the commander-in-chief of the Paraguayan Armed Forces -- namely, engineer [President Juan Carlos] Wasmosy -- received orders from Army Commander Gen. Oviedo on the appointment of officers to various posts. Asked if there was any mistake in the text, Gen. Oviedo confirmed that the president appointed the officer in question, following a resolution of the office of the Army Command. The Army commander emphasized: "Resolutions are different from instructions. I give instructions, but this was not the case." Oviedo hinted at the fact that the NOTICIAS report was misleading. He said that, following orders, he installed the chosen officer. On a different theme, the Army commander denied that officers and troops are being kept in subhuman conditions in the 3d Army Corps. He pointed out that this could not happen because the barrack facilities are in perfect condition. Incidentally, the Army commander's schedule next month includes a visit to the barracks of the 3d Army Corps, which is headquartered in the town of Mariscal Estigarribia.
