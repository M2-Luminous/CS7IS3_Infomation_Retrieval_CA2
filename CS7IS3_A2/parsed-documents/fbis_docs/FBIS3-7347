Bellicose, abusive remarks that threaten us are being uttered by bosses in U.S. political circles who have started down a road of breach of faith by overturning the DPRK-U.S. New York agreement. In a news conference on 18 March U.S. President Clinton revealed his intention to resume the Team Spirit-94 joint military exercise. On 22 March he ordered the deployment of Patriot missiles to South Korea. On 22 March U.S. Secretary of State Christopher, speaking at the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, clamored that the International community should take strong sanctions against North Korea. On 24 March U.S. Secretary of Defense Perry babbled that the United States will send additional troops and weapons to South Korea in case the United Nations decides to take sanctions against North Korea. On 24 March Sam Nunn, chairman of the U.S. Senate Military Affairs Committee, spreading a rumor that an attack by someone is imminent, openly clamored that the United States should make firm war preparations. In addition, the bellicose forces in the United States these days are uttering random abusive remarks threatening us militarily whenever an opportunity presents itself. At the same time, a Patriot missile battalion is moving from the United States to South Korea, aircraft carrier fleets of the U.S. Navy [mihaegun hanggong moham hamdaedul] are being mobilized in the waters near our country, and large-scale U.S. imperialist aggression armed forces on the U.S. mainland and in areas near the Korean peninsula have assumed a mobilization posture. According to a South Korean newspaper report that quoted a U.S. source, U.S. military authorities are mapping out an operational plan in case of emergency on the Korean peninsula to mobilize 600,000 troops, more than 200 naval ships, and more than 1,600 airplanes from the U.S. mainland within 80 days. Joining the adventurous war maneuvers by the U.S. imperialists the South Korean puppet clique is now frantically running wild to inspire war fever in an attempt to attack us. On 21 March traitor Kim Yong-sam held a meeting of security-related ministers in Chongwadae [presidential headquarters] and clamored that a perfect military security posture should be established to cope with someone's provocation. On 22 March he again urged the puppet military bosses to establish an iron-tight defense posture against North Korea. On 21 March traitor Kim Chong-pil of the Democratic Liberal Party also clamored that a strong countermeasure should be taken against the North. Furthermore, puppet National Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae clamored about a strong chastisement and retaliation on 23 March at a meeting of the National Defense Committee of the puppet National Assembly. On 25 March puppet Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang clamored about the establishment of strong countermeasures in the puppet Joint Chiefs of Staff and, thus, openly agitated for reunification through a northward invasion. On 26 March he went so far as to prowl about the puppet units in the frontline area, inspiring war fever by babbling about the establishment of a perfect defense posture. According to a radio report from Seoul, the puppet Army held an expanded staff meeting on 26 March and decided to further strengthen its military posture in order to immediately perform its combat mission in an emergency. It has also been revealed recently that the U.S. imperialist aggression forces and the South Korean puppet Army has gone so far as to map out an extremely dangerous new operational plan, known as 5027, calling for northward invasion. According to this war scenario the South Korean puppet Armed Forces have been on security alert under traitor Kim Yong-sam's instruction since 23 March. Along with this, the U.S. imperialists these days are dragging various types of combat planes, such as pursuit planes, vertical take-off and landing planes, and fueling planes to the skies over South Korea to stage with the puppets a provocative joint aerial war exercise aimed at a northward invasion. The South Korean puppets are firing weapons in the areas near the Military Demarcation Line and the DMZ. Thus, day after day they are waging military provocation maneuvers in the skies, on the ground, and at sea. The whole land of South Korea is filled with a warlike atmosphere.
