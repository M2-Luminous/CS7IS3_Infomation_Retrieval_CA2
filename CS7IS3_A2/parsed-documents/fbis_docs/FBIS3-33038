The party plans to field its own candidates in the country's leading states at the forthcoming general elections, but needs a decision to consolidate alliances in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, Bahia, Ceara, Rio Grande do Norte, Para, Goias, and the Federal District. The PSDB leadership is confident of the upward trend in its popularity at last elections. Meanwhile, compromise agreements to establish alliances are waiting for the cat to jump. Only Cardoso's decision is missing to complete the PSDB tickets, as the names of the running mates and of the two candidates for the Senate have already been chosen. Senator Jose Richa (PSDB-PR) [Parana] said the minister's decision is personal and will depend on circumstances. Now that the economic program has been approved, the economic situation and the management of the economic policy will decide Cardoso's position. The former Parana Governor contends that if Cardoso chooses to stay in his post, the PSDB must seek an alliance with the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] and field Antonio Britto [PMDB-RS] [Rio Grande do Sul] as its presidential candidate, even though Orestes Quercia has already launched his candidacy to head the PMDB ticket. Richa says the so-called PMDB ethical group may support a PSDB candidate. Exercising more caution, former Sao Paulo Governor Franco Montoro argues that the success of the program to curb inflation is far more important for the country than a discussion about a candidacy. Montoro believes that deciding who will be candidate can come later, and may very well not be Cardoso. He said: We must discuss a program as the basis for our alliances. The party has other candidates: [PSDB Chairman] Tarso Jereisati, [Deputy] Jose Serra [PSDB-Sao Paulo], [Ceara Governor] Ciro Gomes, Jose Richa. [Senator Mario] Covas [Sao Paulo] is not on this list because his candidacy for Sao Paulo governorship is decided. Senator Covas, PSDB leader in the Senate, is of the opinion that pressures exerted by the opposition and even from allies to drop Cardoso's name from the list of possible candidates are unacceptable. He said: It is the party that decides when to field its candidate. Cardoso has the right to be a candidate and I am going to endorse his candidacy at the appropriate time. Covas dismisses charges that the extension of the deadline for resigning from office in order to campaign for election to another public office seeks to favor Cardoso's interests. He said: We are against the proposal of Deputy Nelson Jobim [PMDB-RS], the constitutional revision rapporteur, concerning the re-election of the president and ending the need to resign from one office in order to run for another public office. The proposal to shorten the deadline for resigning from office is just a move of PMDB and PFL [Liberal Front Party] governors, and I am against it. Covas, leader in the race for the Sao Paulo governorship according to public opinion polls, is in favor of alliances. He nonetheless believes the grassroots will expect the party to field its own candidate. He thinks it will be difficult to enter into alliance with the PMDB on account of Quercia's candidacy and the race in Sao Paulo. Covas rules out the possibility of reaching an agreement with the PFL. This agreement with the PFL, which some members of Cardoso's team and some congressmen from both parties wish would come true, is only a dream because of the dispute between PSDB members and "Carlists" -- followers of Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes. Salvador Mayor Lidice da Matta said: I do not believe in this alliance which goes against the PSDB platform and the tradition of its members. The PSDB has registered the greatest expansion since the last elections. It moreover has a charm that enables us to compete in the elections at all levels and throughout the whole country, she stated, adding that instead of an alliance with the PFL, she considers the party is much closer to the PT [Workers Party].
