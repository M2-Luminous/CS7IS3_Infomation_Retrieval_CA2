This is the second time since last December that Cuban deputies have debated the difficult current situation, which is marked by a budget deficit of more than 4.2 billion pesos (equivalent to the dollar) and a liquidity surplus of more than 11 billion pesos. During the prior session, the ANPP decided to suspend analysis so as to summon a consultation with the people, held from January to March with the participation of three million workers in more than 80,000 meetings presided over by labor union representatives, a process dubbed the "workers congress." The deputies are facing the difficult task of establishing general guidelines to improve finances and promote the reactivation of production without resorting to a "shock policy" that would entail additional sacrifices for the neediest segments of society. President Fidel Castro, who is attending the ANPP special session, warned an unquestionable principle of the policy of recovery is that "the revolution will not leave anyone unprotected." Authorities also made it clear that though not all the measures to be adopted will be popular they hope to get the people's understanding on the need to make "a shared sacrifice" so as to achieve industrial recovery. Local experts believe it is indispensable to lower the budget deficit and the money surplus to cope with the economic crisis provoked by the drastic reduction of the country's importing capacity due to the disappearance of the European Socialist Bloc and the tightening of the U.S. blockade. According to sources, the chief guidelines to improve the economy include raising prices, eliminating undue benefits created by the revolution, and reducing subsidies given to state enterprises for losses. These are aspects the ANPP must debate. The authorities and people queried during the assemblies concur on the need to halt and eliminate illicit enrichment through speculation and the black market, which flourished in the last [words indistinct]. This special session was preceded by a state overhaul, which included the elimination and merger of several ministries, institutes, and state committees, in search of a better organization, as part of the general efforts to lift the country out of the difficult economic situation. In this context, the almost 600 deputies of this session, which should conclude tomorrow, are tasked with establishing the guidelines for improving finances, which are considered vital for reactivating the economy, eliminating the crisis, and preserving the gains of the Cuban socialist program.
