In one note the STF answers criticisms that followed the wage increase. The other note states that he is surprised at the government argument that it does not have funds to pay the increase because the funds requested for the increase are already deposited in the Bank of Brazil. STF Chairman Gallotti yesterday released two notes to the media. One note rebuffs criticisms of the Judicial Branch, and the other states that the Judicial Branch payroll is being processed normally. The STF chairman states that he does not understand the government allegation that there are not enough funds for the increase because the funds were deposited on 18 March in the STF account in the Bank of Brazil. Gallotti said the deposit of funds is compatible with the administrative decision by the STF justices on 10 March. According to figures released by the STF, the deposit of 1.75 million URV's was more than was requested. The STF president said the justices have correctly implemented the provisional measure creating the URV, respecting the Constitution. Gallotti did not want to comment on a possible revision of the provisional measure or on the salary cuts as announced by the government. The STF chairman says he does not make decisions on his own and the STF will make a statement only when it receives an official communique from the government. Regarding criticism of the Judicial Branch, the STF president acknowledges the right to disagree but he says the criticisms were made without moderation. He added that if there is disagreement among the government branches, he will not encourage it. Meanwhile, President Itamar Franco met with Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso and confirmed that the government will not pay the wage increase for the Judicial Branch. The president has ordered the Bank of Brazil to discount the wage increase deposited for judicial and legislative branch payrolls. President Itamar Franco again guaranteed yesterday that the wage increase authorized by the STF is illegal and that the government will not pay anything that goes against the law. After meeting in Planalto Palace with the finance minister he authorized the release of an internal Finance Ministry provision ordering the Bank of Brazil to discount the 10.9-percent wage increase from the payroll of the Judicial and Legislative Branches. [Begin Franco recording] I said and reassert: The government will not pay anything outsid the law. We consider the STF is not complying with the law established by the provisional measure. Therefore we will only authorize the funds we think the STF should receive. [end recording]
