FR940830-0-00105 FR940830-0-00014 One comment objected to the short notice given in the proposed rule on May 11, 1994, that assessment work to hold the claim for those claimants qualifying as small miners for the assessment year beginning on September 1, 1994, must be completed in the assessment year ending on that date. However, enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act on August 10, 1993, predated the beginning of the assessment year ending on September 1, 1994, and served as ample notice for those claimants seeking to qualify as small miners under the new legislation. One comment objected to any change in the Mining Law. Since the Congress has amended the Mining Law to require a maintenance fee, no changes in the rule are warranted as a result of this comment. Two comments stated that references to the due date for payment of the initial maintenance fee, which is made at recordation of the notice of location and within 90 days after location, were ambiguous. The comment identified the problem as a possible conflict between the location date on the notice of location and the location date under State law. However, pursuant to 30 U.S.C. 28, the date of the location of the mining claim is fixed under State law, and that is the date used by BLM to determine the 90-day period under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) (43 U.S.C. 1701 et seq .). One comment from a county government stated that the removal of the requirement to file assessment work with BLM for those who pay the maintenance fee will cause the same problems as those that occurred under the rental fee requirements imposed by the Interior Department and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1993. The comment stated that because the Federal requirement to record annual labor with BLM had been lifted, filings were not being made with county recorders, affecting the record title history as well as State tax collections. Filings may still be required under State law. If State law does not require filing with county recorders, then State law could be amended to remedy the problem. Also, miners may risk losing their claims to third parties if they do not record with county recorders, and are urged to comply with State and Federal mining laws. One comment stated that there was some confusion with the term ``record'' as used in the proposed rule. The comment said that the term should be defined to apply only to county recordings and never to BLM ``filings.'' The term ``record'' has been used to refer to certain BLM filings for many years. Any reference to BLM recordation in the regulations clearly refers only to BLM requirements for filings in the proper BLM office. It is inappropriate to provide for exclusive application of the term to county recordings. One comment stated that a notarized signature from each owner on a new notice of location should be required for State and Federal tax purposes. The addition of this requirement would be of no value to BLM, because BLM is not the official repository of mining claim ownership records. The States should ensure that their laws are adequate to trace ownership for tax purposes. One comment stated that the rule should require a notice of intention to hold to be filed in the local State jurisdiction in certain circumstances. No such requirements can be added to this rule, because the 1993 Act does not impose a filing requirement equivalent to the filing requirements in Section 314 of FLPMA. It is therefore up to the States to impose such requirements as long as the 1993 Act remains in effect. One comment stated that the rule should require that relinquishments contain notarized signatures of every owner in order to protect all owners from having their interests voided without their consent. This is not necessary because relinquishments relate only to the claimant making the relinquishment, and only his or her interest would be dropped, not the interests of other claimants. One comment stated that it is unclear who is required to submit changes of address to BLM and pay the service charges. It is the owner's responsibility, not a lessee's. The owner is also referred to as the mining claimant. A transferee could also be an owner or a claimant. However, while BLM does not adjudicate who pays the fee for a mining claim, it holds the mining claimant responsible if the fee is not paid. One comment asked whether the purpose for filing changes of address as requested in the rule is to help ensure that claimants receive proper notice regarding their claims. The answer is yes. One comment asked why the rental fee is now called the maintenance fee. The October 1992 statute used the term rental fee, and the August 1993 statute used the term maintenance fee. The second term more accurately reflects the nature of the fee, since it is not considered rent, a service charge, or a tax. It is a payment required to maintain the mining claim in good standing. 43 CFR 3833.0&hyph;3 One comment stated that it would not be proper to file a notice of intention to hold a mining claim pursuant to ยง3833.0&hyph;3(a) if a waiver is filed. This is true. The waiver for a mining claim can only be allowed if assessment work is done. One comment suggested a rewording of paragraph (g)(1)(i) for clarity. This modification has been made to make it clear that it is the mining claimant who files the notice of intent to locate a claim. 43 CFR 3833.0&hyph;5 One comment stated that paragraph (e), the definition of ``owner or claimant,'' should not require the name and address of all owners on documents referred to in the subpart, but should only require the filer's name and address. This requirement exists largely to protect each claimant's interest in being served in the event of an appeal or other need for communication. Therefore, it will be retained.
