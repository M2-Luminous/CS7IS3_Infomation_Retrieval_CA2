In a statement to CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation], Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis said that, once a decision is made to begin the negotiations, the Turkish side will find itself facing a dilemma. Referring to the visit he will begin in Moscow tomorrow, Mr. Mikhailidhis described it as important, because it will take place immediately after the Butrus-Ghali report, which includes some of the suggestions submitted by the Russians. Responding to a question, Mr. Mikhailidhis said that the time has come for Russian intervention in the process to promote a Cyprus solution. He also noted that Russia plays an important role and added that at his talks in Moscow they will examine the options proposed by the UN Secretary General in his report and will also discuss the Russian proposals toward promoting a Cyprus solution. The foreign minister further said that the consultations, which the Secretary General proposes in his report on alternative ways to promote the Cyprus issue, should be based on the finding of the lack of political will on the Turkish side. Referring to his meetings with the ambassadors of the five permanent members of the Security Council, Mr. Mikhailidhis said that some people continue to believe that there are possibilities in the confidence-building measures. Mr. Mikhailidhis added that he stressed to the ambassadors that it would be a tactical error to ignore the findings in the Butrus-Ghali report, which he described as a landmark.
