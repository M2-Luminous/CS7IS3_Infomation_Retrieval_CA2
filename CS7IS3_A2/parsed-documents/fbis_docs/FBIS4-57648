FBIS4-57648 "drlat099_r_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-099 Daily Report 20 May 1994 Peru Fujimori Refuses To Meet Amnesty International Fujimori Refuses To Meet Amnesty International PY2005215294 Madrid EFE in Spanish 1517 GMT 20 May 94 PY2005215294 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Lima, 20 May (EFE) -- Today, the Peruvian Government said President Alberto Fujimori refused to meet Amnesty International (AI) representatives because he believes it is "inadmissible" for them to request a change in the country's laws. Peruvian Justice Minister Fernando Vega said: "Lawyers from New York or AI cannot be allowed to request the change of the country's laws or judicial procedures." He added: "It now seems that Americas Watch also wants to come to Peru." AI Secretary General Pierre Sane from Senegal has been in Peru since 14 May, heading a delegation that met with Lima Archbishop Augusto Vargas Alzamora and relatives of the missing and people detained in Lima and Ayacucho. Minister Vega said Sane requested the appointment of a commission composed of notables in order to effectively guarantee human rights. Vega said: "The foreigners' visit, who in two days are telling us how we should administer justice, cannot be tolerated. This is an excess that cannot be allowed." Vega again rejected the request for changing Peruvian antiterrorist laws by saying the Repentance Law, which is blamed for the arrest of innocent people accused of terrorist activities that have not been adequately proven, should not be changed. Vega said: The law says the accusations must be clearly proven before any arrests are made. He added, however, that there are judges who do not implement the law correctly but there are certain corrective mechanisms in the judicial branch and the Prosecutor's Office for that purpose. Pierre Sane will meet today with members of the Peruvian Congress Human Rights Committee to request changes in the Repentance Law. He also will insist on the formation of a commission of notables. Sane believes these requests do not interfere with Peruvian sovereignty. Sane said AI has asked the U.S. Government for the formation of this type of commission, which he said already exists in other countries. Sane sent a letter to the Peruvian Government last April to announce his arrival on 15 May and requested a meeting with President Fujimori, the Armed Forces' chiefs, and police. Vega answered that because of the prejudice and negative attitude shown by AI regarding respect for human rights in Peru, Sane will not be received.
