"Mr. Berov's cabinet is about to finally ruin your country's reputation by its inadequate policy and the continual Yugo-embargo busting," representatives of UN Sanctions Assistance Mission told DEMOKRATSIYA in an informal talk. Reportedly, they were categorical that evidence of sanctions busting could be found at all state administration levels. "The silence and inaction of the government implies blending of organized economic crime and government officials," the daily writes. According to the paper, at least four trains crossed the border with Serbia at Kalotina-Dragoman on Saturday and Sunday (February 5-6), one of them carrying 53 tanks of aviation petrol. Answering some accusations in an interview for OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK, the chief of the Central Service for Organized Crime Control, Col. Fedor Vladimirov, points out that "nobody has tried to misuse the information the Organized Crime Control Service has in its possession." Saying that the service he heads has "ample" information about attempted embargo busting and that investigative proceedings have also been initiated, Col. Vladimirov refuses to give further details because the information is top secret.
