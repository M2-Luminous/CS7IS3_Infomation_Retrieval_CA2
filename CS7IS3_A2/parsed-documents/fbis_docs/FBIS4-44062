During the lunch the leaders would have held informal discussions. Kostas, do we have any information on their discussions? [Kekis] The luncheon agenda included an evaluation of the results of the European Parliament elections and a discussion on how to deal with racism and xenophobia in the EU. Regarding the elections for the European Parliament and according to our information, Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said the European leaders should not be satisfied with the result because of the low voter turnout and because some parties with positions against the Maastricht Treaty have increased their power. Papandreou.... [Yiannopoulos interrupts] We have a picture now of the meeting before the luncheon. [Kekis] Papandreou's view was that the low turnout was due to problems faced by the EU, such as unemployment and the loose promotion of the EU's internal security in the fields of social protection and solidarity. According to the various delegations, the same positions were expressed by other leaders who do not appear satisfied with the result of the elections. [passage omitted]
