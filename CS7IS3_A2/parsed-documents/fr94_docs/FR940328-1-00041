FR940328-1-00041 FR940328-1-00019 48 CFR Parts 45 and 52 [FAR Case 91&hyph;57] Federal Acquisition Regulation; Disposal of Hazardous Government Property AGENCIES: Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are considering amending Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart, Reporting, Redistribution, and Disposal of Contractor Inventory, by adding a paragraph which will reference subpart, Hazardous Material Identification and Material Safety Data, and agency regulations, in order to provide assistance to the contracting officer in identifying hazardous Government property; specifying that unless the contract states otherwise, the Government may abandon any nonhazardous contractor inventory in place, and the Government shall not abandon contractor inventory that is hazardous on the contractor's premises without the contractor's written consent; and including in designated standard property clauses the requirement that the contractor promptly identify to the contracting officer any Government property considered hazardous upon notice that the Government intends to abandon the property. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993. DATES: Comments should be submitted on or before May 27, 1994 to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to: General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS), 18th & F Streets, NW., room 4037, Washington, DC 20405. Please cite FAR case 91&hyph;57 in all correspondence related to this case. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Linda Klein at (202) 501&hyph;3775 in reference to this FAR case. For general information, contact the FAR Secretariat, room 4037, GS Building, Washington, DC 20405, (202) 501&hyph;4755. Please cite FAR case 91&hyph;57. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background The changes are a result of industry concern that the language in the standard property clauses does not preclude the contracting officer from simply abandoning hazardous Government property in place. Sections 45.603, 45.611, and the standard property clauses at 52.245&hyph;2, &hyph;4, &hyph;5, &hyph;7, and &hyph;11 are affected by this change. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., because the revision will not have a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR parts will also be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., (FAR case 91&hyph;57) in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping information collection requirements or collection of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.
