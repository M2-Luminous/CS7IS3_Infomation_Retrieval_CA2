Stating the stand of the Cameroonian Government on the Bakassi Peninsula for the first time in public, Mr. Kouomegni asserted that "we are within our rights and our option is still finding a peaceful solution to the problem." "This solution can only be found through the strict respect for each country's territorial integrity -- that of Cameroon and of Nigeria. It is for this reason that Cameroon has informed international institutions and does not rule out any initiative, be it bilateral or multilateral," added Mr. Kouomegni who was speaking at a news conference. "However, if war is imposed on us, we must go to war and we will count on the bravery of our soldiers who have so far given an excellent demonstration of their bravery and we will count on our allies, including France, whose readiness to help us has remained intact," the minister continued, adding: "We recognize, and this is very clear, that this option would be harmful for our two states. We do not wish for it."
