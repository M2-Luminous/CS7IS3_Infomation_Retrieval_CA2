Speaking to journalists in Gdansk on Monday Moczulski added that "the coalition is actually in pieces today." In his opinion "the conflict between the president and the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) is actually a conflict between Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak and SLD Leader Aleksander Kwasniewski which has its roots in the case of former Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Marek Borowski. [no closing quotation marks as received] The KPN leader sees the weakness of the SLD in the alliance's lack of additional candidates for ministerial posts. This was the cause of putting forward Dariusz Rosati, connected to the notorious affair of the Foreign Debt Servicing Funds (FOZZ), to replace Marek Borowski after his resignation as deputy prime minister and finance minister. Moczulski forecasts "a great social commotion to take place within either a few or several months" which would bring about the collapse of the ruling coalition, vain attempts to form new government and early parliamentary elections.
