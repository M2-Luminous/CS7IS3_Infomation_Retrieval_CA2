Cardoso, noting that the creation of the Real Value Unit (URV) will not lead to a price freeze, warned that "if prices begin to abusively stray from their historic path, we might decide we need to control them." Minister Cardoso said the provisional measure that will create the URV will not merely be designed to convert salaries. "We are going to make several decisions by respecting contracts as much as possible; therefore, no private contracts will be broken," he asserted. The minister said the economic team's idea is to create some rules to convert some of the workers' expenditures, such as rent and school fees, because salaries will be converted compulsorily into the new unit. The minister said the longer private prices take to be converted into the URV, the better it will be for salary earners. "Salaries will be modified automatically according to the inflation rate." Action will be taken within 90 days against those enterprises that mark up prices abusively and will be forced to mark down prices to those on a date determined by the government. [passage omitted]
