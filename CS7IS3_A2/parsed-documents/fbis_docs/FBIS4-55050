The main subject of the two-day meeting is a socioeconomic program for Poland for the next three years. Before flying to Lansk, the prime minister said: We have decided to hold this meeting out of town, so that everyday problems do not affect a calm exchange of views. [Begin recording] [Pawlak] The purpose of this meeting, today and tomorrow, is to discuss the fundamental components of strategy for Poland. We want to do this in a peaceful atmosphere, so that everyday pressures do not interfere with our examination of these long-term processes. I think that, as a result of the circumstances and the situation, Poland has tremendous opportunities to become a country that counts and is significant in the east-central region of Europe, and we want to seek action opportunities that will make it possible to realize this objective. [Correspondent Koziol] Mr. Prime Minister, will the current situation in the country, which is so heated, also be a subject of discussion at Lansk? [Pawlak] We intend to focus on long-term issues. As far as immediate issues are concerned, as you very well know, ladies and gentlemen, Minister Miller and Minister Pol have been speaking about this. I think we should leave them room for maneuver here. [end recording] Grzegorz Kolodko, deputy prime minister and finance minister, who accompanied the prime minister on his way to Lansk, emphasized the need to extend the perspective within which the government is going to pursue its economic policy. Often this perspective gets shortened under pressure from severe social problems, Grzegorz Kolodko added. [Begin Kolodko recording] The Polish economy has good opportunities, and Polish society has good prospects, also as far as increased income is concerned. Admittedly we would like most of this income growth to be directed toward investment, with future generations, with the future in mind. The main line of this strategy is stable growth, with a fairer division of the national income than hitherto, but this too requires some tidying up of the system, a continuation of work started earlier, and the establishment of some kind of sequence. That is why we would like to take some time thinking about this. It is clear, of course, that we are not going to return from Lansk with some sort of final conception of government economic policy. In the immediate future its individual elements are going to be presented for public evaluation and for parliamentary debate. But we do have a conception of this kind and I would like to emphasize once again that the Polish economy has good prospects. [end recording] Of the three scenarios for Polish economic development prepared by the Central Planning Office, the so-called fundamental scenario is going to be adopted. Deputy Prime Minister Kolodko: [Begin Kolodko recording] Of course we have chosen the optimistic scenario, and through our program and our activities, together with other social and political forces, we want to implement the optimism which follows from this scenario. This scenario assumes a fairly significant national income growth, and this is going to require appropriate changes in the field of public finance and in the field of restructuring the economy, including property status changes, and its elements will gradually be implemented. This requires a tremendous legislative effort and, I repeat, peaceful and hard work, and sensible government policy. The government is open to criticism and is going to monitor and adjust this conception. [end recording]
