Liu was born in Jiangsu Province and is noted as a painter and arts educator. He has trained a large number of artists since 1912 when as a very young man he founded the Shanghai Institute of Traditional Chinese Painting, China's first arts college. Liu is expert in Chinese and western painting, poetry and calligraphy. His paintings have been widely exhibited at home and abroad. When the painter was already 90 years old, he climbed Huangshan Mountain in Anhui Province time and again to paint. "I have a new beginning at 100 years old," Liu said, "and I will go to the mountain again, and go to the 'three gorges' to create new works." Huang Ju, mayor of Shanghai, and Wu Bangguo, secretary of Shanghai Municipal Communist Party Committee, who are attending a conference of the National People's Congress in Beijing, entrusted Deputy Secretary Chen Zhili to present a wood sculpture of the god of longevity to the painter. The Hong Kong Branch of XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, the Chinese Ministry of Culture, the China Artists' Association, Hong Kong universities and Japanese companies also offered their congratulations to the centenarian.
