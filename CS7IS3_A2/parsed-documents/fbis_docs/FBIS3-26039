Statistics show that the number of self-employed households has now reached 1.12 million, up by 28 percent, and private enterprises are up to 12,000, a 113 percent rise over 1992. The rapid growth in the private economic sector is a result of favorable policies adopted by the Jiangsu provincial government. Jiangsu dropped restrictions on the business scope for the development of private economy and took measures to encourage private enterprises and self-employed households to expand their business in technology-oriented and export-oriented services. The Jiangsu Provincial Administration of Industry and Commerce also arranged for managers of private enterprises to go abroad to broaden their entrepreneurial vision. The economic strength of private enterprises also increased last year. Of the 6,795 newly-established private enterprises, there are 174 households whose registered funds exceed 1 million yuan each. The self-employed households and private enterprises turned over taxes of 2.7 billion yuan to the state in 1993, accounting for 11.6 percent of the total commercial and industrial tax payment in Jiangsu. Last year, 86 private enterprises in Jiangsu set up joint ventures with overseas counterparts, an increase of over 100 percent over 1992. The export value of the private enterprises in the province was 71.46 million yuan.
