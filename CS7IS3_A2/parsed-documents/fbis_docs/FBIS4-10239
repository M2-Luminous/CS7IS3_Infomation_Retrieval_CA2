It is impossible to communicate by phone with Jeremie. Our regional correspondent came to Port-au-Prince, having noticed a slight improvement in maritime transport. Jean-Obed Maturin has a report: [Begin Maturin recording, in Creole] The city hall employees continue to demand 10 months of overdue salaries. The employees have asked the minister of the interior to act on their behalf because they can wait no longer. The city hall employees in Jeremie stopped working several months ago. The population in Jeremie is again begging the telephone company's managers to do something about the telephone lines in Jeremie, which have been out of service for five months. The telephone line failure completely isolates Jeremie from the other departments and from foreign countries. The company's employees spend their days without working. Many of the population hope that the company's managers in Port-au-Prince will take the case of Jeremie into consideration and not dismiss their complaints. Maritime transport resumed two weeks ago, with the ship FRETA and a few others bringing a little life to Jeremie, which was almost dead. However, even though these activities have resumed, the cost of living has increased in Jeremie. [end recording]
