Orlova over video of printing and typesetting operations, on the newspaper printing workers' reaction to the government resolution of 25 November 1993, which forced up costs for printing and publishing services. Many publications will soon have to close altogether. Journalists and editors appealed to Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on 30 December to take urgent measures; and staff of Moscow publications and regional printing organizations have set up a strike committee, which demanded subsidies for publications that have already been subscribed to, and the means to participate in privatization. Unless something is done, the week parliament opens -- 10-17 January -- publication of newspapers will be suspended. Over video of a news conference, Orlova goes on: "One should evidently forget about freedom and independence of the press, too. For the moment, only those publications and television and radio programs that are either financed by the government or belong to commercial organizations are able to survive. In a word, he who pays the piper plays the tune. Valeriy Kucher, ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI editor in chief gave further evidence of this at a news conference today, citing information he said he had learned from authoritative government sources. A decree is being drawn up to close this newspaper and to set up on its basis a government organ named DERZHAVA (THE STATE). The reason for this is that just before the New Year, the editorial staff took its cue from the new Russian Constitution and announced that it was leaving the government's tutelage."
