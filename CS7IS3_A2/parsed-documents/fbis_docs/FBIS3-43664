The radical opposition, which supports Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi, is refusing to sign agreements negotiated since 10 December. Talks were adjourned last month; the parties of the presidential tendency refused to accept Mr Tshisekedi as legal prime minister. Marshal Mobutu then issued an ultimatum to the opposition, which expires today at midnight. Here is the reaction of Joseph Olengakoye, the envoy of Prime Minister Tshisekedi. At the moment he is visiting Paris. [Begin recording] [Olengakoye] We have noted that Mr. Mobutu is aware of the problem and has issued an ultimatum because the impasse in Zaire is related to Mr. Mobutu's own will. He has given himself an ultimatum. I can tell you sincerely that, having arrived at the expiry of Mr. Mobutu's ultimatum, if he does not find a solution that meets the aspirations of our people, there will be incalculable consequences, and we will attack democratically on all fronts. [Reporter Dupont] What else can you do? [Olengakoye] The people will demonstrate, and Mr. Mobutu will rule over corpses. [Dupont] The UN secretary general has put foward a new proposal to the Zairean president. Do you think this proposal could unblock the situation? [Olengakoye] I think that the proposal is to ask Mr. Mobutu to give in to the will of the majority, the will of our people. We have the consequences of 30 years. If we are where we are today, it is because Mr. Mobutu has not managed to govern this people. This means that our people are determined to find a solution according to what they think [as heard], and this is not what Mr. Mobutu thinks. [end recording] Joseph Olengakoye, the envoy of Etienne Tshisekedi. He was interviewed by Ghislaine Dupont.
