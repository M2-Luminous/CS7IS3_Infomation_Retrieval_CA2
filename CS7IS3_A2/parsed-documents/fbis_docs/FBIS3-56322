Russia Intends To Enlist the Support of All Parties to the Karabakh Conflict"] [Text] On 12 January, Ambassador at Large Vladimir Kazimirov, the Russian Federation president's special envoy, ended his two-day talks in Baku; he discussed with the Azerbaijan leadership the situation in the Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict area and the prospects for continuing Moscow's mediation efforts. The republic's presidential press service said that the meeting between the Russian diplomat and President Geydar Aliyev was held behind closed doors. It is noteworthy that in the run-up to the visit to Baku, Kazimirov went to Tehran where he sought to enlist the support of President Hashemi-Rafsanjani over the issue of Russia's peacemaking mission in the region. At the same time, no attempts are forthcoming from Moscow to coordinate its steps in resolving the Karabakh crisis with Ankara. This suggests that the Russian Federation leadership is aware of Iran's growing role in the region. Characteristically, at present Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Russia are seeking close cooperation with Tehran. Yerevan has not abandoned hope that the Armenian-Azerbaijan talks on the construction of a gas pipeline, which have been going on for more than one year now, will be concluded by this spring with the signing of a protocol whereby the Iranian side will begin deliveries of natural gas to Armenia. On the other hand, the administration of President Geydar Aliyev warns Tehran against such a step because after resolving its energy problems, Armenia may intensify its military pressure on Azerbaijan. Baku avoids any rash moves that could complicate its relations with Tehran. This apparently accounts for Aliyev's refusal to approve the proposal by the Russia border troops command on stationing Russian border guards on the border with Iran. Azerbaijan Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov, who visited Tehran, assured the Iranian leadership that Azerbaijan is opposed to the construction of an "iron curtain" on the border with Iran. The absence of a common border between Azerbaijan and the Nakhichevan autonomous area also makes the republic dependent on Iran. In a recent offensive by the Azerbaijan Army in the south the strategic and transportation center of Goradiz was captured, and now it has again become possible to use Iranian territory to ship major cargoes from Azerbaijan to Nakhichevan. Russia's interest in cooperation with Iran on the issue of peacemaking efforts in the Transcaucasus is most likely linked with its aspiration to prevent a possible intervention by Tehran in the Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict and thus to prevent that war's internationalization. It cannot be ruled out that Kazimirov has sought to obtain clarifications from the Iranian side as to whether the Afghan mujahidin have really been recently transferred across Iranian territory to Azerbaijan. Baku, as is known, categorically denies this information. The severe fighting that is going on today between Armenian and Azerbaijan formations occurs mostly in direct proximity to the Iranian border. The Azerbaijan Defense Ministry has announced that approximately 40 km of the Azerbaijan-Iran border has been won back from the Armenian side. The Armenian side therefore now controls some 120 km of territory. The Azerbaijan side so far refrains from continuing offensive operations, but reports from military sources leave no doubt that in the next few days an attempt will be made to liberate the districts of Dzhebrail, Agdam, Fizuli, and Kelbadzhar, occupied by Armenia. Geydar Aliyev has entrusted the preparation of this operation to Lieutenant Colonel Mikhail Bayramov, who has been appointed the defense minister's aide on combat operations. So far, according to the same sources, the Armenian Defense Ministry is hastily moving additional forces to the area to create a second defense echelon.
