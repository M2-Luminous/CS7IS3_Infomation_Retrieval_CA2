The powerful massive struggle of South Korean peasants and students, largest in scale after the appearance of the "civilian government", was an explosion of the indignation and grievances against the group of Kim Yong-sam, the traitor for all ages, which is trying to extend its power by selling off the vital rights of the people and a just patriotic action for defending the dignity and interests of the nation, the statement said, and went on: The Kim Yong-sam group of anti-national hooligans is heading for more grave crimes by resorting to a sanguinary repression against innocent peasants and students who have risen up against the treacherous opening of the rice market. And the traitor Kim Yong-sam, in conspiracy with the United States, is going to raise all over South Korea a row of deployment of "Patriot" missiles. This is an extension of the move to open the rice market and its enlarged version. All the facts show that, with the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique left in power, the lives of the South Korean people, let alone their vital rights, cannot be preserved and no one can vouch that the whole nation may not suffer a horrible disaster. The traitor Kim Yong-sam must settle his crimes against the nation and face a stern judgement by history as demanded by the people.
