FR941117-1-00010 FR941117-1-00004 In 1976 the Social and Rehabilitation Service, one of the agencies that later merged to form HCFA, published final regulations in the 45 CFR part 249 implementing the psychiatric L 21 benefit. These regulations allowed the coverage of this benefit in psychiatric facilities that were accredited by the Joint Commission. The term ``psychiatric facility'' was used rather than the statutory term ``psychiatric hospital'' because the Joint Commission had modified its accrediting practices to encompass a broader range of settings providing psychiatric services. Since the statute at that time required Joint Commission accreditation, HCFA desired to keep its requirements consistent with Joint Commission practices. In 1981 HCFA received comments from the Joint Commission expressing concern about HCFA's regulatory requirement for Joint Commission accreditation. The Joint Commission indicated that this Federal requirement was in conflict with Joint Commission policy that facilities should seek accreditation voluntarily. In response, HCFA noted that the regulatory requirement for Joint Commission accreditation could not be removed because it was required by statute. In 1984, the Congress amended section 1905(h) of the Act, removing the requirement for Joint Commission accreditation and adding the requirement that providers of the psychiatric L 21 benefit meet the definition of a ``psychiatric hospital'' under the Medicare program as specified in section 1861(f) of the Act (section 2340 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (Public Law 98&hyph;369)). Despite this statutory change, based on our understanding of Congressional intent, we did not remove the requirement for Joint Commission accreditation from HCFA regulations, which are in subpart D of 42 CFR part 441. Our reliance on Joint Commission accreditation was the only basis for coverage of the psychiatric L 21 benefit in psychiatric facilities other than psychiatric hospitals. Our decision to retain the regulatory requirement for Joint Commission accreditation was based on the fact that, in enacting the 1984 amendment, the Congress gave no indication that it intended to narrow the psychiatric L 21 benefit or alter HCFA policy that had been in effect since 1976. On November 5, 1990, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA '90), Public Law 101&hyph;508, was enacted. Consistent with HCFA's interpretation reflected in 42 CFR 441 et seq ., section 4755 of OBRA '90 amended section 1905(h) of the Act to specify that the psychiatric L 21 benefit can be provided in psychiatric hospitals that meet the definition of that term in section 1861(f) of the Act ``or in another inpatient setting that the Secretary has specified in regulations.'' This amendment, which was effective as if it had been enacted earlier as part of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, affirmed and effectively ratified preexisting HCFA policy as articulated in subpart D of 42 CFR part 441, which interpreted sections 1905(a)(16) and 1905(h) of the Act as not being limited solely to psychiatric hospital settings. OBRA '90, therefore, provides authority for HCFA to specify inpatient settings in addition to the psychiatric hospital setting for the psychiatric L 21 benefit without continuing to require that providers obtain Joint Commission accreditation. III. Related Provisions Under section 1905(a) of the Act, Medicaid payment is generally not available for any services provided to individuals under age 65 who are patients in ``institutions for mental diseases'' (IMDs). This statutory preclusion of Medicaid payment is commonly known as the ``IMD exclusion.'' The term ``IMD'', as defined in section 1905(i) of the Act, includes hospitals, nursing facilities, or other institutions of more than 16 beds that are primarily engaged in providing diagnosis, treatment, or care of persons with mental diseases, including medical attention, nursing care, and related services.
