SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background In August 1989, Congress enacted section 501 of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, (FIRREA), adding section 21A to the FHLBA (12 U.S.C. 1441a), and establishing the RTC. Pursuant to section 21A(b) of the FHLBA, the RTC has the duty to manage and resolve failed savings associations for which it is appointed conservator or receiver and to conduct its operations in a manner which maximizes the return from the sale of institutions or their assets, makes efficient use of funds, and minimizes losses in the resolution of institutions. In addition, the RTC is required to resolve all failed thrifts by the ``least costly'' method. See section 13(c)(4) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) (12 U.S.C. 1823(c)(4)), applicable to the RTC pursuant to section 21A(b)(4) of the FHLBA (12 U.S.C. 1441a(b)(4)). The Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act The RTC Completion Act was signed by the President and took effect on December 17, 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;204). Section 3(a) of the RTC Completion Act amended section 21A of the FHLBA by adding subsection (w), a list of 21 managment reforms for the RTC. Implementation of two of these reforms is the subject of this interim rule. Subsection (w)(2)_Individual Marketing Period Subsection (w)(2) of section 21A of the FHLBA requires the RTC to market real property on an individual basis for at least 120 days before making the property available on a portfolio basis or in a multi-asset sales initiative. Subsection (w)(2), unlike subsection (w)(3) discussed below, applies only to REO and not to loans or any other types of assets. This provision applies to REO in which a thrift under the RTC's jurisdiction holds, directly or indirectly, an undivided or controlling interest. By including property held indirectly by a thrift, this provision applies to subsidiary property as well. The provision excepts real property transferred in connection with a resolution in which the acquirer purchases a significant portion of a failed institution's assets and assumes either a significant portion of the failed institution's liabilities or acts as agent for the RTC in paying the claims of insured depositors. In other words, this exception is designed to extend not only to the standard purchase and assumption transaction, but also to an insured deposit transfer where the acquiring institution does not actually assume the deposit liabilities. Another exception exempts the transfer of real property by the original pass-through receiver to a de novo institution organized by the RTC pursuant to section 11(d)(2)(F) of the FDIA or section 21A(b)(10)(A)(iv) of the FHLBA. Subsection (w)(2) requires the RTC to promulgate: (1) Regulations which require the RTC to justify in writing the sale of any real property asset on a portfolio basis or in a multi-asset initiative after the 120-day individual marketing period, and (2) regulations to carry out other requirements of the individual marketing provision. Subsection (w)(3)_Marketing Procedures for Certain Assets With respect to non-performing real estate loans with a book value of more than $1 million and real property with a book value of more than $400,000, subsection (w)(3) establishes several marketing procedures for the RTC. Subsection (w)(3)(A) prohibits the RTC from selling such assets unless:
