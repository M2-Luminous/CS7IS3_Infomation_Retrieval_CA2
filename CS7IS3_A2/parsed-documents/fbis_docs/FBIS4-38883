There are six contestants in the election race: the Agrarian Party's leader Aleksandr Dubko, the Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, the former chief of an ad hoc anti-corruption parliamentary commission Aleksandr Lukashenko, the Communist Party's Secretary Vasiliy Novikov, the Popular Front's leader Zenon Poznyak, and the ex-parliament's speaker Stanislav Shushkevich. They received their certificates of candidates at a formal ceremony on Wednesday. In keeping with Belarusian legislation, all of them have equal material, technical, and financial opportunities in the election campaign, during which they can be relieved of their office duties with their pay to be retained, and so can be their canvassers. Each candidate is entitled to up to 20 canvassers. A nominee has the right to a free fare for all means of transportation but taxi. He cannot be persecuted, arrested or detained without the Central Election Committee's consent. Local observers rate Kebich's election chances as best and refer to the outcome of the last poll, in which more than 68 percent of respondents favoured a president that must support monetary integration with Russia by all means. As is known, Kebich is the initiator and consistent advocate of such an alliance. In his last interview with Interfax he plainly declared that if he won presidential elections, he would press for putting the monetary integration agreement with Russia into effect. Analyzing what has helped Kebich's team to prevail at the first stage of the election race, opposition experts point to the active role played in his election campaign by state central and local authorities. Meanwhile, the Popular Front's leader Poznyak has no doubt in his victory, as his canvassers have declared at a news-conference recently. They reminded journalists that Poznyak had collected 230,000 signatures, the second best result after Kebich. As Poznyak himself told newsmen, "although local authorities resisted the collection of signatures for an opposition candidate, he has enlisted more support for himself than all other candidates in Minsk and some other industrial centers." However, as observers believe, his chances to win are slim. According to the election poll, 61 percent of the electorate believe that a president must not represent any political force, and nearly 60 percent of respondents wished that a head of state be a centrist. Although the election campaign was launched on Thursday, contestants had already exposed their views on the key issues in the press and in public statements. For instance, Kebich outlined his election program in an exclusive interview with Interfax (see the Presidential Bulletin of June 1). The Communist Party's nominee Vasiliy Novikov promises, if elected, to do away with vouchers as means to privatize people's homes and businesses since, in his opinion, such privatization "has never justified itself." He has told an Interfax correspondent that he "does not rule out alliance with any candidate but Shushkevich and Poznyak, if he goes through into the second round of elections." He argues that "Belarus had the highest sovereignty only within the Soviet Union." He also reported that "the Belarusian Communist Party currently unites more than 25,000 people and has branches in virtually all parts of the country." "For ethical reasons," he did not name a candidate to the post of prime minister in the event of his election victory, but noted that the composition of the current cabinet and parliament be preserved as much as possible. IF Note: As Shushkevich earlier told Interfax, should he win presidential elections, his cabinet be taken over by the National Bank's Chairman Stanislav Bogdankevich. As is known, Bogdankevich has been repeatedly censured by lawmakers and government officials for his opposition to monetary unity with Russia and for some of his decisions, including the May 18 National Bank's decision to recognize "hares" (national banknotes) as the only legal tender in Belarus pending monetary integration with Russia.
