FBIS4-2970 "drchi073_w_94005" FBIS-CHI-94-073 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 HONG KONG & MACAO Hong Kong Papers Criticize UK Foreign Affairs Committee Report Papers Criticize UK Foreign Affairs Committee Report OW1404125894 Beijing XINHUA in English 1236 GMT 14 Apr 94 OW1404125894 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Hong Kong, April 14 (XINHUA) -- Some Hong Kong newspapers criticized the report released yesterday by the British House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee as a "negative example", "self-contradictive policy" and "challenging report" in editorials published today. "WEN WEI PO" said the report rendered a firm support to Chris Patten, the governor of Hong Kong, and his political constitutional reform scheme. It also declared that the British side would take its own action in the latter half of the transitional period. This showed the intention of the British Government not to adhere to the principles of the Basic Law, and to refuse to work for a smooth transfer of power in Hong Kong and try to put up new obstacles for the formation of the future government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The aim of pursuing a tough policy toward China by the John Major administration is to win support of the British Parliament and alleviate its domestic pressure, the paper said. The "HONG KONG COMMERCIAL DAILY" said, analysing suggestions raised in the report, one can see the British government is self- contradictive in its policy toward China. For instance, it said, the report admits China will turn into an economic power in the next century and there is a need to keep a good relationship with China on the one hand, but advises the British Parliament to develop ties with Taiwan on the other hand. It is known to anyone that China opposes the policy of "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan". If the British Government get in touch with Taiwan, its relationship with China will sure to fall back. In addition, the report showed a wish to solve the Sino-British dispute over Hong Kong, but at the same time supported Governor Patten in his bid to deliver to the legislative council his political reform bill, which China strongly opposed, the paper added. The "TA KUNG PAO" described the report as a "challenging report". It interfered in China's internal affairs without using any packing, it said. It will be fruitless for the British Foreign Affairs Select Committee to cover up the fact that the British side sabotaged the Sino-British negotiations on the 1994-94 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong, the paper said.
