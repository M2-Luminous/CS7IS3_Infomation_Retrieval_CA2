The reports we received from the NKR a short while ago indicate that the situation is far from being stable. The reason is the Azerbaijan military forces' systematic violation of the cease-fire understanding. The Azerbaijan National Army [ANA] units have intensely shelled the NKR defense positions with artillery and then attacked them. It must be noted that the Armenian side has tried to refrain from retaliating against ANA attacks to create an opportunity for the implementation of the measures in the protocol that was signed in Bishkek. However, they have not always been able to do so. Apparently certain forces in Azerbaijan wish to obstruct the peace talks. The war serves the interests of those circles that believe that their political ambitions are more important than the people's interests. The maintenance of the fighting [words indistinct]. However, we hope that Azerbaijan's leaders will honor their signatures on the protocol signed in Bishkek and will work to implement its provisions, otherwise the confrontation may deepen. That state of affairs would not be in Azerbaijan's favor. Undoubtedly, Azerbaijan has realized that the maintenance of the confrontation [words indistinct]. However, the combat operations have not been halted and the situation has continued to be unstable. The NKR Defense Army Headquarters has disclosed that the ANA units launched an attack on [place name indistinct] in Mardakertskiy Rayon at 0500 this morning. A preparatory artillery barrage preceded their onslaught, but their attack failed to achieve its objective. The Armenian defense forces counterattacked and forced them to withdraw to their previous positions. As usual, the ANA units suffered many casualties. A high-level agreement has been reached to end the fighting, so why should the war continue? The combat operations were not limited to Mardakertskiy Rayon. The NKR defense positions in Askeranskiy Rayon in the eastern theater of the war were also shelled by artillery units. There were combat operations in that part of the front line this afternoon, too. The ANA units shelled the Armenian defense positions in Askeranskiy Rayon yesterday. Later they attacked Yarymdzha in Mardakertskiy Rayon. However, their attacks were rebuffed. Dozens of ANA officers and men have been killed over the past three days in Azerbaijan's unjust war for Armenian territory. No incidents occurred in the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan last night and this morning. We hope that this will continue.
