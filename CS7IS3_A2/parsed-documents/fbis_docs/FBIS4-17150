The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA writes that according to a trustworthy source, Ukraine expressed readiness to lease Sevastopol to Russia for a term of five years as the main base of the Black Sea Fleet with the subsequent extension of the lease and remove the headquarters and other facilities of the Ukrainian Navy from Sevastopol. However, Kiev insists that the Black Sea Fleet marines abandon the cities of Ismail, Ochakov, Odessa, Nikolayev and Crimean settlements. Russia agrees to Kiev's proposals in the main, but objects to the removal of its units from the towns of Feodosia and Novoozerny (Donuzlava). Ukraine suggests dividing the fleet in half so that 15-20 per cent of warships and auxiliary vessels remain in the possession of the Ukrainian Navy and the remainder (30-35 per cent) be transferred to Russia on mutually advantageous terms. "It seems that only the Russian side is willing to undo a tight naval knot tied around the Black Sea Fleet and only in part concerning payments of overdue wages to the personnel of the fleet," said Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev. "The first round of talks between delegations of the Russian and Ukrainian Defence Ministries ended to no avail," the newspaper said. KRASNAYA ZVEVZDA writes that passions running high at the talks and their complexity leave no doubt that the final document "will be borne in pain", and there are no guarantees that mutual understanding will be reached in the course of one session only. The delegations are planning to work an extra day on April 22 when a news conference devoted to the results of the talks will be held. "One would like to hope that emotions and mutual reluctance to accept each other's positions will not take the upper hand at the talks. Politicians have had they say on the matter. Now, a fair division of the Black Sea Fleet depends on the common sense of the military, " the newspaper said. The newspaper SEGODNYA writes that "by all appearances, the Russian side was prepared to make serious concessions to Ukraine. At least, Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev hinted at a meeting with the personnel of the Black Sea Fleet on Thursday that former Black Sea naval bases in Odessa, Nikolayev and Ismail are likely to be transferred to Ukraine on condition that 85 per cent of ships of the Black Sea Fleet remains in Russia's possession. (We shall transfer 15 per cent to Ukraine and subsequently, buy them from Ukraine, the minister said). At the same time the Ukrainian delegation arrived at the talks with rather a tough goal: Sevastopol must remain a naval base under double Russo-Ukrainian jurisdiction," the newspaper said. Commenting on the anniversary of Vladimir Lenin's birth, the newspaper RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA writes that the Lenin museum marks its 70th anniversary on April 22. In old days, the date used to be celebrated with proper pomposity, but now, the situation is different. "Is this fair and whether those who have embarked upon the road of downright blemishing their own history have made a mistake? All these questions will have to be answered yet," the newspaper said. The newspaper NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA writes that "there is no "nationwide April" now, no May 1 holiday, and many people say that there is even no Victory Day now. However, these dates survive by themselves and cause genuine concern. New leaders capable of making a crowd go against the authorities and stage pogroms, hiding behind the back of hungry old women, are being born during these days, which is seen from the example of the last May 1 holiday. New authorities are afraid of these holidays and post guards of special task force and riot police, the newspaper said. The newspaper SAN PETERBURGSKIYE VEDOMOSTI writes that no emergency measures are planned to be taken in St. Petersburg by the command of northwest interior troops. All building and facilities of interior troops will be heavily guarded during these days. No special task force units are expected to appear in the streets of the city. The newspaper TRUD carries an interview with deputy chairman of the Russian Government and minister for the affairs of nationalities and regional politics, Sergey Shakhray, devoted to the problem of Cossacks. According to Shakhray, the Russian Government will submit a draft law to the State Duma and adopt its own resolutions on tax privileges, problems of Cossacks' land owning and will render assistance in holding a session of the all-Russia Cossack union scheduled in autumn. The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA writes about a ceremony of bidding farewell to Russian troops withdrawn from Germany. The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA publishes an extract from a book by Sergey Beriya, the son of the former Soviet Interior Minister Lavrentiy Beriya, executed in 1953, containing reminiscences if his father.
