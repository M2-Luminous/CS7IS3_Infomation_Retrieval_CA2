It reminds us of the border between the United States and Mexico. In that area, the difference in living standards has created lots of industry around the Rio Grande. The border between Finland and Russia is quiet but showing signs of waking up. Three industrial villages are under construction along the border and a number of joint ventures are emerging. Trade across the border is taking place, utilizing various methods. In the view of the experts, the eastern border, home of wolves, criminals and bears, should become an impressive facade towards Europe. The border should be utilized systematically, from Petsamo all the way to St. Petersburg and the Gulf of Vyborg. "Currently, projects are arbitrarily started at the eastern border. For example, roads and industrial plants may be built in the wrong areas due to a lack of information," architect Risto Ali-Kovero, from Sunnittelukeskus Oy, noted with some concern. Ali-Kovero has prepared a macronetwork plan for the border area, where the border line has been divided into the following planning areas: The Petsamo Corridor, The Sea to Sea Corridor, The Kainuu-Kostamus Corridor, The Karelian Gateway Area and The Kymi Border Circle. Also included are the Ystavyydenpuisto and the Saimaa-Ladoga Area. "During the negotiations, Finland needs some trumps up its sleeves with which we can show that we are developing the border area in a controlled manner and that we are not creating an uninhabited backyard for the EU [European Union]," said Ali-Kohero. If approval is granted for studies covering the entire borderline, more detailed planning, according to Ali-Kovero, will be initiated as a joint effort involving the Moscow building committee, Gostroi, the Government of the Republic of Karelia, and the Finnish Ministry of Environmental Affairs. Village of Kostamus Largest Of all the ambitious industrial village projects, the largest is the Kospark Technology Park, which is located on the latitude of Kuhmo in Kostamus. Business ventures are solicited to Kostamus not only from Scandinavia, but also from, among other countries, Germany. The plans are completed and the brochure has arrived from the printers. The investment costs in the industrial park, which spans about 15,000 square kilometers, are about 10 million dollars. The joint venture has already completed the frame of the main building of the mining industry collective, which is to be completed first. According to Research Director Hannu Linnainmaa, from Haka Oy, which is in charge of the project, it will include 2,000 square meters of space to be leased to businesses. "The output is supposed to be environmentally safe, as we do not want to emit any pollutants into the environment. The border area is Finland's Rio Grande, but we have to be careful and not let inflation take the bottom out of the project. There are already products in Russia, the prices of which exceed world market prices," said Linnainmaa. The intent is also to utilize high tech jointly with the universities. The company has been founded as a closed private corporation, and its domicile is the City of Kostamus. Work Done Close to Border The Kostamus Technology Park is located 40-50 km from the Finnish border. On the other hand, the Svetogorsk and Vartsila industrial villages are next to the border. The Varn industrial village, to be built on the Russian side of Vartsila, is part of the Karelian Gateway project, which was initiated by the Ministry of Environmental Affairs. "Two areas in the village of Vartsila have been set aside for industrial and business facilities. Completed business spaces are also available in Sortavala. Janisjoki will also be utilized for tourism," said Kesalahti Business Ombudsman Kari Oksanen, who is in charge of the project. The Varn Industrial Village is almost 30 hectares large, and the area is currently being mapped. The Russians own 57 percent of the venture, while the Finns own 43 percent. According to Oksanen, the minority share was a requirement for capital infusion from a fund recently established by the Russians. In Svetogorsk, near Imatra, a Finnish-Russian business park is operating. The Russians own over 90 percent of the park. The size of the area is about 7 hectares. On the Finnish side, the partner in the joint venture is Suomen Imsveto. "There are already two businesses on the Russian side of the business park. We provide them with a complete service, from the acquisition of raw materials to bookkeeping," said Antero Ikalainen, president of Suomen Imsveto Oy. New border crossings lead to increased cooperation at the border. Another contributing factor is the special benefits granted Karelia through Russian development policies. The agreement between Finland and Russia regarding adjacent area cooperation has also helped to some extent. The Finnish state has appropriated a few million markkas for this cooperation. The industrial villages, which are to be built in Russian Karelia, are also pleased by the expansion of the Developing Area Fund (KERA). A law proposal regarding this has been submitted to the Eduskunta. According to the proposal, KERA also should be able to fund start up and development costs for Finnish ventures when they are established abroad. Financing could also be arranged for the purchase of shares in a company operating abroad. According to Pauli Tiainen, financing manager for KERA, next year's appropriation for this would be approximately 50 million markkas. Village Retailer Showed Quadrangular Nail In village storekeeper Oiva Tikka's store there are boxes of nails imported from Russia. The hot galvanized iron nails are resulting in the establishment of an industrial village in the Russian part of Karelia. The village would benefit all of central Karelia. In April of 1990, Tikka started to import nails from an iron plant located directly across the border. He, in turn, exported kitchen stoves with four burners to Russian Karelia. "We met with the Russians for the first time in 1989. We met with Viktor Kamel, the manager of the iron plant, three times, after which we prepared a letter of intent, a business agreement, and also an agreement with a Finnish central firm, " said Tikka. Tikka also acted as a product development consultant. He showed the plant manager a Finnish quadrangular nail and advised him in the production of more advanced hot galvanized nails. Tikka estimates that he has imported from the Russian part of Vartsila about 300 metric tons of iron nails, but the recession has had a dampening effect on demand. Today, Viktor Kamel, the iron plant manager, is chairman of the Board of Directors for the Varn Technology Village. The five districts of Central Karelia participate in the project. They are, in addition to Vartsila, Kesalahti, Kitee, Tohmajarvi, and Raakkyla. Capital stock has been issued and the company has been registered in Petroskoi. Kamel is concerned about the lack of decisions regarding the land areas in the industrial village. The instability of the political situation makes him weigh his words very carefully when he speaks in his office, which still is adorned with a picture of Lenin on the wall. Viktor Kamel seems to have enough problems even within his plant. The plant employs 850 people, and, according to him, many of them are now not needed. "We don't want to let anybody go, and therefore we now need to find them other jobs. And these jobs should be produced by the joint venture, which started in May," said Kamel. Kamel's wife, engineer Olga Kamel, manages a sewing shop, located in the area of the iron plant, which employs over a dozen women. Skila, from Joensuu, has outerwear for children sewn in the Russian part of Vartsila.
