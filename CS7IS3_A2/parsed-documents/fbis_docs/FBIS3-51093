During his meeting with Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, Rawlings stated that his government still has much to do for Cuba because somehow they must express their appreciation for all that Cuba has done for Africa. Robaina, on the other hand, delivered a message to Rawlings from Cuban President Fidel Castro, and described the statements by the Ghanaian leader as a reflection of the historic relations between the two states. Robaina expressed appreciation for Ghana's position on such issues as the U.S. blockade of Cuba and human rights. After stating that 1993 had been the most difficult year in the history of the Cuban Revolution, Robaina predicted that 1994 would be the beginning of an ascending spiral for the Cuban people. Robaina concluded his official two-day visit to Ghana as part of a tour of five African countries. Today, Robaina is in Luanda, Angola.
