The aim of the amendment is to enable property to be returned to Jewish individuals or their heirs. Debate surrounding the proposed return of property to the Jewish communities which was confiscated under the Nazi regime and post-war Czechoslovak communist governments has continued for almost four years now. The restitution law passed by the Federal Assembly in 1991 set 25 February 1948, the date of the communist take-over, as the limit before which claims cannot be made. The act was passed despite the appeals of the Federation of Jewish Communities (FZO), which protested the 1948 limit "would exclude from restitution almost all Jewish property which was confiscated after September 1938 and which in most cases has not been returned". [passage omitted] A bill resolving many property claims of Jewish legal entities and individuals was drafted by ODA deputies around Viktor Dobal. The first part of the bill concerned 202 buildings and sites formerly belonging to the religious Jewish community. The list of property included 45 synagogues, 30 plots of land where synagogues stood before the occupation, 24 cemeteries, 12 sites where cemeteries formerly were, ten religious schools and ritual baths. The second and third sections of the bill deal with the restitution of Jewish individuals, estimated at a few hundred. [passage omitted] A further government bill, produced in April, allows for the redressing of property crimes committed between 1938 and 1945, but only if the properties now are in state ownership. While the government accepts in principle that it should pay compensation for property in private or community ownership that is restituted, it insists on limiting restitution to property that was the subject of an approved restitution claim before 25 February 1948 and that has not already been returned to a claimant. In his opening speech to the parliamentary debate, Dobal said the amendment had been drawn up in such a way as to preserve the restitution concepts already made part of Czech law, and to take into account the process of privatization currently taking place. He emphasized that the amendment did not concern newly-founded restitution claims, did not even extend the amount of property or cases of property having been taken away, nor did it even extend the circle of persons with property claims. Its only aim was to define more precisely those persons, in order to remove the disharmony in court and clerical work in the judgment of the situations of persons to whom property should have been returned in accordance with post- war restitution laws. After the communist coup of 1948, however, the property which had been going to be returned to them was transferred to the state instead. Dobal said that from the above point of view both the law on extra-judicial rehabilitations and the land law (his amendment to which is also being debated today) discriminated, de facto, against Jews, in the form in which they were passed by the former Czechoslovak Federal Assembly. The amendment was part of a wider bill which Parliament failed to pass on February 18 because of the part concerning the problem of Jewish physical persons, Dobal said.
