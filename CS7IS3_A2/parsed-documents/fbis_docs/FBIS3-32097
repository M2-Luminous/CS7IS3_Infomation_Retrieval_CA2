Senator Bernard Sansaricque acts as spokesman for this faction of the Senate, which is composed of legislators from the Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion and those elected during the contested 18 January elections. Bernard Sansaricque also supports the formation of a new office in the Senate to expedite a solution to the crisis, considering that the current office has thus far worked to block the institutions: [Begin recording in Creole] [Sansaricque] Between 10 August and the present, Firmin Jean-Louis held two sessions in the Senate. He cannot blame that on the 18 January senators. They all respected the New York pact until 11 January. So he cannot blame anyone but himself. I think he was a senator with a well-defined mission, the mission of obstructing the country, blocking the Senate of the Republic, because one cannot be a president of the Senate -- in addition to his regular salary, he is earning an additional $1,500 a month. He just obstructs progress. He travels to see Aristide abroad while the country is collapsing. It is therefore a situation that must be solved quickly in the Senate of the Republic. There is an ad hoc office, led by Sen. Ebrane, working right now to find a solution to unite the Senate and solve the problem that the country is facing. [Reporter Renois] Bernard Sansaricque, when you say unite the Senate, do you mean to unite it with the legislators who were elected during the 18 January elections, which are still being contested? [Sansaricque] They are contested. However, even the UN and the OAS recognized them, since they asked them: Will the legislators elected on 18 January please remain outside. Those legislators remained outside the crisis until the New York pact was no longer valid for them, at which time they returned to parliament. They kept their word. [Renois] Does the New York pact officially exist today? Are we still under the New York pact in parliament? [Sansaricque] Certainly some senators will tell you that the New York pact exists. If you ask me, the New York Pact never existed and still does not exist. [Renois] Another aspect in the Senate question: I read in the December issue of JEUNE AFRIQUE, an African magazine, that some senators, namely Thomas Eddy Dupiton, was involved in the assassination of Antoine Izmery. Has the Senate considered this case? [Sansaricque] Of course we are studying this file. I just brought the letter that we wrote to Colin Granderson to Radio Metropole to let it be known that there really is a UN/OAS file on the Izmery case which involves Sen. Dupiton. The Senate will want to have it for necessary purposes. If there is a file, they must present it. A magazine, JEUNE AFRIQUE, or any other magazine cannot just accuse senators... [Renois] Did JEUNE AFRIQUE quote the UN report on that matter? [Sansaricque] They spoke of the UN report which they say was given to the U.S. intelligence service. For such a serious matter, the Senate of the Republic should study this file. The UN and the OAS should therefore give it to us for our own use. [Renois] Last question, Sen. Bernard Sansaricque: There is a crisis. How and when do you, as a senator of the Republic, see this crisis being solved? [Sansaricque] I see that the crisis can be solved as soon as the Senate has a serious office. The senator named Firmin Jean-Louis, who was appointed by Caputo and applauded by some senators, and who had the defined mission of blocking the Senate of the Republic, blocking the country as a whole and making the people suffer as they are now suffering, must be stopped. We must have a decent office, a working office that respects the mandate granted to us. [end recording]
