Luik was briefing reporters on a letter from U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in which Christopher says the United States will give Estonia 1,000 vouchers to buy for some of the retired Russian military living in Estonia flats in Russia. The Estonian Foreign Minister hailed the Washington proposal as a very positive one and expressed hope that also other countries would join U.S. and help Estonia to resolve the issue of Russian military pensioners. U.S. Vice President Al Gore at a meeting with Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar during Laar's visit to Washington last month said the United States was ready in principle to give initially aid for sponsoring the moving out from Estonia of some 300 retired Russian military. Gore had also said his country was going to do everything so that Estonia would be free of Russian military presence by Aug. 31, 1994, adding that this was the logical final aim of the U.S. policy of non-recognition of the incorporation of the Baltics into the Soviet Union in 1940.
