Indeed, many people have already left the capital in a hurry. [passage omitted] Other people who have fled have done so because of fears that they will have to account for the atrocities committed against innocent people. In this regard, those who were involved in organizing the events have cleared off with their families. For instance, reports say that 200 people are stuck at Bujumbura international airport waiting to be evacuated to France. They have asked France to grant them asylum. Burundi gave them 36 hours to allow France to decide their case. [passage omitted]
