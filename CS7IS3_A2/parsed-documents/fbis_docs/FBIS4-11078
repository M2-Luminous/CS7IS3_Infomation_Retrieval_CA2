Nevertheless, I also believe that reckless statements should not be made at Sandinist departmental meetings, not even jokingly, because they are in bad taste," Sergio Ramirez said yesterday. Last week, LA PRENSA reported that supporters of Daniel Ortega recommended during a departmental meeting in Leon that the leaders who did not agree with the current orthodox leadership of the party be killed [eliminar fisicamente]. "I heard these rumors, and Monica Baltodano (of the so-called Pikin Guerrero trend) informed me this was a joke. We discussed this matter in the Sandinist Assembly, and I expressed my opposition to this kind of thing," stressed Ramirez, who has been the target of attacks by sectors close to Ortega. Ramirez said it is dangerous to enter into confrontation within the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] because, according to him, this could create "difficult" situations for those people who are the targets of the attacks. "If they insist on insults and accusations -- such as selling out to imperialism, or selling out to the right -- this indeed creates a tense atmosphere that is somehow dangerous," asserted Ramirez, who is a member of the FSLN National Directorate. He added that he condemns this kind of behavior "in both currents." "I recently heard on a radio program (Radio Ya) that I was a cancerous member in a healthy body (FSLN), and that I should therefore be cut out of the body. I do not know what they were implying by saying that I be cut out," Ramirez complained, reiterating his belief that ideas should be discussed with respect and not with insults. Sergio Ramirez and Daniel Ortega are the individuals who currently lead two currents of opinion struggling to control the FSLN. Political observers have termed Ramirez's supporters "moderates," while the followers of the FSLN secretary general have been labeled "hardliners and orthodox." Also, Ramirez, former vice president of the Republic, reiterated his presidential aspirations for the 1996 elections, in response to a reporter's question. "My categorical answer is yes, because it is a right bequeathed by the Nicaraguan Constitution. I have legitimate aspirations like everyone else," Ramirez stressed. Later, Ramirez, leader of the Sandinist legislative wing, suggested that the FSLN presidential candidate come from the party's rank-and-file and be chosen in primary elections "not by a small group." His statement came in open defiance of the election system that has traditionally existed within his party. Months ago, Ramirez stated his presidential aspirations to the FSLN National Directorate. This resulted in pro-Ortega media, in particular Radio Ya and Radio La Primerisima, launching a severe campaign to discredit and insult him. "I do not aspire to run for vice president, because I have already outgrown such a position," Ramirez asserted categorically. "I want all Sandinists to understand that I will not leave the FSLN, even if the current I support turns out to be the minority. I will continue to be a Sandinist, either within the leadership or the rank-and-file," Ramirez remarked. At this point, with a little more than a month before the party's Congress (20 May), Ramirez indicated he has reserved the right to run for leadership positions within the FSLN. Sergio Ramirez believes the rights of individuals should be respected. "No one is authorized to tell others what they must do," he continued. Ramirez made the aforementioned statements within the context of a struggle for control of the party -- a struggle in which people close to Ortega leaked a list of candidates to join the expanded National Directorate. Sergio Ramirez and Luis Carrion, promoters of the renewal of the FSLN, have been "purged" from this list. Yesterday, Daniel Ortega declared that differences between Sandinist currents stem from the fact that one sector of the FSLN supports government policies, while the other sector opposes them and would be willing to resort to violent means. "I do not agree with Ortega's opinion, because all of the activity Sandinism conducts with the government has the National Directorate's approval," Ramirez stressed. He explained that relations with the government began with the signing of the transition protocol in 1990. "I did not even sign this agreement between the government and the National Directorate, because I was not then a member of that leadership organ," Ramirez said. Ramirez ended by saying: "Every political party that loses an election enters into serious contradictions, and there are Sandinists who have not yet accepted this situation -- a situation of which I am very proud, because the FSLN showed its democratic calling by relinquishing power in the first free elections ever held in this country."
