FR940713-1-00048 FR940713-1-00009 34. In the Notice we announced that, for a period of time, we would not accept applications for new ITFS facilities or for major changes to existing facilities. We expressed our concern that potential applicants would inundate the Commission with applications while the old cut-off rule was still in effect, thereby defeating the purpose of the proposed rulemaking. However, we stated that we would continue to accept (but not process) applications in which the applicant relies on NTIA for construction funds. We have also continued to accept major change proposals where they are filed in the same market to accommodate settlement agreements among applicants that have previously achieved cut-off status and where the settlement resolves mutually exclusive applications. 35. Upon publication of this Order and Further Notice in the Federal Register, we shall instruct the staff to begin accepting applications for major changes to existing facilities, and any mutually exclusive applications thereto. Such applications will be processed under the existing A/B cut-off rules. We believe that this will ease the burden that the freeze has caused to educational institutions that seek to alter their existing facilities. Licensees and those filing competing applications may file such applications until the effective date of any window filing rules. We note that this Order and Further Notice contemplates modifying our definition of a major change. For the purposes of modifying the freeze, we shall use the existing definition of the term. Any pending major modification application not cut off as of the adoption of this Order and Further Notice will be considered in conjunction with the newly submitted applications. Administrative Matters Pursuant to applicable procedures set forth in §§1.415 and 1.419 of the Commission's Rules, 47 C.F.R. 1.415 and 1.419, interested parties may file comments on or before August 29, 1994, and reply comments on or before September 28, 1994.

If you want each Commissioner to receive a personal copy of your comments, you must file an original plus nine copies. You should send comments and reply comments to the Office of the Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 20554. Comments and reply comments will be available for public inspection during regular business hours in the FCC Reference Center, room 239, at the Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20554.
