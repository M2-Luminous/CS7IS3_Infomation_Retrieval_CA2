The highest-level delegation from Ottawa since the 1989 Tiananmen massacre avoided details of the Governor's political plans during talks in China, according to senior Canadian officials. The subject of Hong Kong was brought up three times by the Canadian Governor-General, Ramon Hnatyshyn, but he went no further than expressing to Lu Ping, the top Chinese official in charge of affairs, the hope that the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration on the territory's future "would be respected". In talks with the Governor, Chris Patten, in Hong Kong the Governor-General talked of the need for both the "letter and the spirit" of the Joint Declaration to be adhered to and said he hoped for negotiations between London and Beijing. "We all very much hope for the resumption of dialogue and co-operation between China and Britain to give Hong Kong the future it deserves," one senior Canadian official said. The message contrasts with that given to the Legislative Council last Friday when Hnatyshyn emphasised the need for "fairly contested and free elections" to buttress the rule of law. But Ottawa officials denied that Canada was saying one thing to Hong Kong and giving a different message to Beijing. While the Canadian delegation "did not specifically make the same comments to China" the message was the same, one official said. The visit -- which concludes in Guangzhou today -- aimed to raise the profile of Canada, and discuss and develop economic and agricultural links. Beijing was told of Canada's "concern" about human rights but was assured the issue would be kept separate from trade, the official said.
