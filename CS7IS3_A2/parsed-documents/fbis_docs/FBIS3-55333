It discussed as its central issue the Partnership for Peace plan proposed by U.S. President Bill Clinton. This envisages the establishment of military links between the North Atlantic Alliance and the countries of East Europe and the former Soviet republics, including the Russian Federation. As is known, Russia does not object to these links, but is opposed to NATO's expansion into countries in close proximity to the Russian borders. Incidentally, experts of the Russian Defense Ministry note that NATO itself lacks unity of views regarding the next steps after the possible adoption of the U.S. Partnership for Peace plan. Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian defense minister, speaks about the stand of the Russian military in greater detail: [begin Grachev recording] We are advocates of a path that leads to a truly pan-European system of security. This means collective actions -- but not in accordance with the criteria of membership in the bloc -- aimed at preventing and settling the crises and conflicts now shaking Europe. I believe that security and international stability should be indivisible and should be based on common European structures. Russia is proceeding from the fact that our relations with NATO should be richer and should develop in broad-ranging cooperation. We believe that rapprochement between Russia and NATO should be going at an accelerated pace. [end recording]
