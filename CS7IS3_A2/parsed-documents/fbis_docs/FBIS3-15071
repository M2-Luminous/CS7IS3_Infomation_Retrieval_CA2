Rybkin told a press conference that the actions of the international community could not be undertaken by-passing Russia. In this, he added, I agree with President Boris Yeltsin. NATO has said Monday that its F-16 U.S. planes downed early on Monday four Galeb type aircraft near Banja Luka, a city in northwestern Bosnia-Herzegovina, which were found in violation of the no-fly zone over Bosnia. The identity of the downed planes has not been established, but the world media hurried to claim they belonged to the Bosnian Serbs. The authorities of the Bosnian Serbs denied these claims, while Maj. Obaydul, who heads the UNPROFOR monitor mission at the Banja Luka airport, the only airport the Bosnian Serb army has, said Tuesday his team already sent to the main headquarters three reports that there were no take-offs nor landings at the airport, not only at the time the planes were downed but also over the past few days in general. The NATO action was criticized Tuesday in a statement to the INTERFAX news agency also by a ranking Russian Defense Ministry official. He assessed that this action was not only directed at the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina but even more so against Russia, and all this because it has of late achieved much success in pacifying the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. 'The Americans have no wish to talk and behave as if the cold war has ended with their victory,' an unnamed Russian official told the agency.
