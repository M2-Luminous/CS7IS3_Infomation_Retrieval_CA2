Speaking to journalists after his return from the spring session of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, he was reacting to a statement made by Slovak Deputy Premier Brigita Schmognerova made during their meeting in Washington. Schmognerova indicated that the method of settling the "old-bloc claims" had "still to be considered," Kocarnik said. He added that Schmognerova, however, did not say how the government wanted to solve the situation. On Tuesday [26 April] Kocarnik told CTK in Washington that the Czech and Slovak Governments had agreed on March 25 to convert the liabilities into ECUs using the exchange rate in effect before the currency split. The claims would be transferred to the new bloc and the old would be abolished, he added. Under the old bloc, the 1-1 ratio is applied for payments related to trade deals concluded before the currency split on February 8, 1993. The new bloc uses ECUs. Kocarnik also pointed out that the Czech Government had approved an amendment to the Czech-Slovak payments agreement to this effect two weeks ago. He stressed last night that it was in Slovakia's interest that a settlement reached as soon as possible because Slovakia was the loser. Both parties agreed it was now necessary to verify the volume of old claims and liabilities, he added. Kocarnik pointed out that until September Slovakia's steps would be influenced by the elections slated to take place on September 30- October 1. It will therefore be difficult to distinguish between economic rationality and election-motivated politics.
