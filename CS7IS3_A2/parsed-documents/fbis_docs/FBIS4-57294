Without mentioning names, but clearly alluding to them, Pastrana criticized Liberal candidates Ernesto Samper Pizano and Humberto de la Calle for their alleged sudden changes of opinion and attitude. "One cannot trust someone who in June 1980 signed the ANIF [National Association of Financial Institutions] report supporting the legalization of marijuana and later reiterated this support at a meeting at the presidential palace on 13 May 1993 and today changes his mind and rends his garments when what he so staunchly supported has been legalized," Pastrana said when referring to Samper. "One cannot trust someone who today supports what he denied yesterday; one cannot trust someone who yesterday said `I will never accept' and today accepts it," Pastrana said in reference to De la Calle. Pastrana spoke on Monday night at the Tequendama Hotel during an event to honor him sponsored by the Future Foundation. Several reporters were also invited to attend the event. During his speech Pastrana insisted that his actions have been in accord with his way of thinking and that he is not lying to the country nor is he contradicting himself before the Colombian people.
