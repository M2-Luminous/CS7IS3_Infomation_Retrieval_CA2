While doing a good job in conducting the administration of justice, they have particularly, emphatically, and vigorously grasped the trials of criminal cases and strictly punished a large number of criminal elements who have jeopardized the social peace. Thus, the achievements scored by the province in the "spring offensive" have been further consolidated and broadened. After the launching of "spring offensive", the people's courts at all levels have reinforced the dynamics in dealing blows at criminal elements. Particularly as for serious and appalling cases, they have achieved in having their leading personnel attach importance on them; concentrate their efforts on handling them; join in the handling of them in advance; firmly grasp the trials and examination of them; and give heavy punishment to convicts rapidly. Last week alone, the provincial higher people's court held the meetings of judicial officers in three consecutive days to examine and handle 64 serious and appalling criminal cases. During the meetings the participants made decisions to sentence 76 convicts to the death penalty, eight convicts to the death penalty with a reprieve, nine convicts to life imprisonment, and 36 convicts to more than three months imprisonment. As of 23 April the provincial higher people's court wound up 216 cases of second trials and retrials, which showed an 86-case increase over the same period of 1993, and gave sentences to 466 convicts. [passage omitted] Currently under the unified leadership and arrangement made by the local party committees, the people's courts at all levels across the province are closely coordinated with the organs of public security and people's procuratorate; are concentrating their superior forces on dealing with serious and appalling cases; and are striving to win an overall victory in the "spring offensive".
