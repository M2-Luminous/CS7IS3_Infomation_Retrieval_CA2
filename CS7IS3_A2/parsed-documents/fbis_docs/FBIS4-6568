According to a report on the testimony at a subcommittee of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee on 18 April, (Rowen), assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Defense, revealed that the United States would deploy anew to South Korea one brigade of military equipment, including tanks, howitzers, and multiple rocket launchers. Stating that the United States is pushing ahead with a new strategy of deploying various types of firing instruments and combat equipment on naval ships in South Korean waters and in the waters surrounding it, (Rowen) babbled that, through this strategy, the United States could more quickly deploy stronger ground forces to battles and that it was correcting the problem of a lengthy deployment of tanks and other heavy weaponry to battle sites, as took place during the Persian Gulf war. This is part of the premeditated military buildup maneuvers designed to take a preemptive attack on our republic and openly reveals the U.S. criminal attempt to ignite a nuclear war. A tense situation still prevails on the Korean peninsula. This is totally because of the treacherous acts by the United States. As everyone knows well, the United States made it clear domestically and internationally through a DPRK-U.S. joint statement that it wants to resolve the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula peacefully, that it will not use force of arms, including nuclear weapons, against the other side, and that it will not even threaten the other side with such a force of arms. Completely overturning the agreement made at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York, however, the United States is concentrating its large-scale aggression Armed Forces in South Korea and in the area surrounding it, babbling that it will not rule out a preemptive attack against us and that it will suspend the North's nuclear development even at the risk of a war, and, thus, staging every day a provocative war exercise for a northward invasion. Following the recent deployment of offensive-purpose Apache helicopters to South Korea, Patriot missiles arrived in Pusan on 18 April. It is also said that aggression forces and missile equipment loaded on other transport ships will arrive in South Korea soon to complete the deployment of the Patriot missile unit to the frontline area. In addition, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry flew into South Korea and had a conspiratorial war conference with puppet military bosses. His junket to South Korea was not only a junket for frontline command [ilson chihwi haenggak] designed to convert the puppets' plan for a northward invasion into practice, but is also a junket to conspire to organize combined armed forces against us, which is a phenomenon that we can see usually on the eve of a war. The fact that at this juncture the assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Defense revealed the United States would deploy military equipment, including tanks, howitzers, and multiple rocket launchers, to South Korea vividly shows that the U.S. imperialists are attempting to further reinforce their force of arms on the Korean peninsula in order to provoke a war of Northward invasion at any cost. This also clearly proves that it is none other than the United States who is leading the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war and that they have no intention at all to solve the nuclear issue by means of dialogue. It is evident to everyone that when, following the deployment of Patriot missiles, heavy weaponry such as tanks, howitzers, and multiple rocket launchers are deployed to South Korea, the situation on the Korean peninsula will be further aggravated. The U.S. imperialists are busily moving in order to provoke a war of northward invasion. The U.S. imperialists' inherent nature of aggression has not changed at all. The United States, which became the only superpower after the end of the cold war, now acts more arrogantly, further strengthening its military threat and blackmail against small countries and, particularly, on those countries advancing toward independence. This finds expression in the U.S. imperialists' maneuvers for arms buildup and war on the Korean peninsula. The U.S. imperialists should clearly know that they cannot subdue or frighten our people with military threats or blackmail. We are prepared for both dialogue and war. If someone provokes us, our people and People's Army will retaliate on the rascal a thousand-fold. Our people, who regard independence as life, will sternly punish any aggressor and resolutely defend the nation's sovereignty. The South Korean puppets should not run wild indiscriminately, fools rush in where angels fear to tread.
