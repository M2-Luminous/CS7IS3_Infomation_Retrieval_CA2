VOC Volatile organic compounds. §89.4 Section numbering. (a) Sections are numbered sequentially by subpart. (b) Where two different standards or requirements are concurrently applicable, the model year of applicability is indicated by the number following the main section number. The two digits following the hyphen designate the first model year for which a section is effective. Example: Section 89.304&hyph;96 applies to the 1996 and subsequent model years until superseded. If a §89.304&hyph;98 is promulgated, it would take effect beginning with the 1998 model year; §89.304&hyph;96 would apply to model years 1996 through 1997. Therefore, in calendar year 1997, a manufacturer may be certifying both 1997 and 1998 model year engines, requiring the use of different requirements concurrently. Note: Model year 2000 and later will appear sequentially with 1999 and earlier based on the order of the last two digits of the year, not in calendar year order; that is, §89.304&hyph;03 will appear before §89.304&hyph;99. (c) A section without the model year designation is applicable to all model years as designated in the applicability section for the subpart or part or in the text of the section. §89.5 Table and figure numbering; position. (a) Tables for each subpart appear in an appendix at the end of the subpart. Tables are numbered consecutively by order of appearance in the appendix. The table title will indicate the model year (if applicable) and the topic. (b) Figures for each subpart appear in an appendix at the end of the subpart. Figures are numbered consecutively by order of appearance in the appendix. The figure title will indicate the model year (if applicable) and the topic. §89.6 Reference materials. (a) Incorporation by reference. The documents in paragraph (b) of this section have been incorporated by reference. The incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be inspected at US EPA, OAR, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460, or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 N. Capitol Street NW., Suite 700, Washington, DC. (b) The following paragraphs and tables set forth the material that has been incorporated by reference in this part. (1) ASTM material. The following table sets forth material from the American Society for Testing and Materials which has been incorporated by reference. The first column lists the number and name of the material.
