Will another high tide appear after the ebb? There are various signs that aftershocks have continued after the initial quake. Certain shocks have come from the masses' demands for democracy, and some have come from the people's disenchantment with their current living conditions. Some shocks have come from the popular indignation aroused by the worsening corruption of officialdom. All this has represented a crisis, a serious crisis, for the Jiang-Li regime. The crisis is similar to that of five years ago, and is more complicated and of greater shock potential. We may note the following facts: --Waves of labor unrest have arisen one after another in all parts of the country and have swept across 19 cities. In Inner Mongolia, thousands of party and government cadres in the institutions of the autonomous region were also involved in a "disturbance." --The authorities discovered "organized illegal hostile activities of underground sedition, collaboration, and subversion against the current social system and the People's Government" in 33 cities of 17 provinces. --The CPC authorities intensified merciless crackdowns by arresting and jailing political prisoners and prisoners of conscience. At present, more than 1,700 "counterrevolutionaries" are in jail. This may be an incomplete figure. All this shows that sparks of the prodemocracy movement are still spreading, and the CPC authorities are upset by the hidden dangers everywhere. Recently, the CPC leaders openly called for employing the method used in handling the 4 June incident against the prodemocracy movement, and this more directly shows that the prodemocracy movement is threatening the Jiang-Li regime and that the CPC leaders are on tenterhooks. On 10 May, Jiang Zemin spoke at an enlarged meeting of the CPC Central Political Bureau, and the speech laid bare both his fears and his merciless nature. Jiang said: The resolute action taken by the central leadership against the political turmoil in spring and summer of 1989 was completely correct. If things had not been handled in that way, China would have been thrown into chaos, and external political forces would have taken advantage of the opportunity to make more extensive inroads into China to subvert the government. We would then have had to pay even greater costs. Comrade Xiaoping recently said that, if it had not been for Zhao Ziyang's double-dealing within the party, the incident would have been settled much sooner. In the future, if similar events of turmoil occur, we must take resolute and timely actions without any delay. Jiang added: Facts over the past five years have educated and enlightened our people and cadres and have made them aware that a very small number of hostile elements at home are always trying to stir up trouble and overthrow the socialist system, that the hegemonists in the world are also always trying to interfere in China's internal affairs, and that the hostile political forces outside the mainland and in overseas areas are always trying to join hands with the domestic hostile elements in carrying out subversive activities. We have no other option but to adopt resolute measures against the undermining and subversive activities of the hostile forces. Jiang Zemin did not express even a bit of repentance for the inhumane massacre of five years ago; instead, he even stressed the rationality and necessity of using tanks and troops to kill the innocent people who were peacefully demanding democracy. This utterly exposes the antipeople nature of the Jiang-Li regime and also reflects their fear when facing the prodemocracy undercurrent among the people. An informed analyst has said: The CPC authorities long ago laid down the verdict on the 4 June incident, and Deng Xiaoping has long ordered other people not to mention the incident any longer so that it might be buried in history. However, the first topic discussed at the Political Bureau meeting on 10 May was the 4 June incident. Jiang Zemin brought up this matter from the past. This showed that Deng Xiaoping may not have been in good health recently, and some people within the CPC have tried to take this opportunity to reverse the verdict on the incident. Jiang's speech was aimed at warning them against reserving the verdict. The analyst's conclusions are worth considering. Many people pay close attention to the attitude expressed by the military in China. According to information from internal channels, Zhang Wannian, member of the CPC Central Military Commission and chief of the general staff of the Armed Forces, has been singing the same tune as Jiang Zemin. At a recent national meeting of the party committee leaders of the armed police forces, Zhang Wannian said that, under the current international and domestic circumstances, the People's Liberation Army should fulfill "four sacred duties." One of the "four sacred duties" is related to suppressing the prodemocracy movement. "We should, according to the party's calls and orders, mercilessly crack down on and smash the organized and premeditated activities of the hostile forces against the party central leadership, the People's Government, the Constitution, and the current socialist system. We should crack down on and smash undermining and subversive activities and events of turmoil and rebellions created by the hostile elements attached to the external anti-China and anticommunist forces." According to the CPC authorities' slanderous remarks against the prodemocracy movement in 1989, it was clear that the fourth task of "merciless crackdown and smashing" was aimed at the prodemocracy movement and the demonstrating masses who called for eliminating corruption and effecting democracy. In fact, the terms "turmoil" and "rebellion" have long been used by the CPC authorities to describe peaceful prodemocracy movements like that in Tiananmen Square in 1989. The "merciless crackdown and smashing" obviously referred to the use of force in suppressing such prodemocracy movements. The remarks later uttered by Zhang Wannian explicitly expressed this idea. He said: China's development and the drastic changes in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe have shown that the actions and measures taken by the central authorities against the political turmoil in 1989 were completely correct and necessary, because the turmoil was supported by some foreign political forces and was aimed at overthrowing socialist China led by the Communist Party. The economic sanctions imposed by the hegemonists and their followers failed to daunt the CPC, the Chinese Government, and the Chinese people and failed to stop China's continuing development and growth; on the contrary, this practice only laid bare the fact that the hegemonists had not changed their basic strategy against China and that the hostile political forces had never stopped their sinister anti-China and anticommunist activities of subversion, infiltration, and sabotage. The hostile elements will never change their nature and will never stop their undermining and disruptive activities of creating turmoil and rebellions. Such remarks uttered by Zhang Wannian explicitly indicated that the CPC authorities would continue to use the methods of the 4 June massacre to suppress prodemocracy movements. At the national meeting of party committees in the armed police force, Tao Siju, first political commissar of the armed police force, also spoke. He repeated the main points of Zhang Wannian's speech and made some additions. He said: Firm and timely crackdowns must be carried out on the organized and premeditated activities of the hostile forces aimed at subverting and overthrowing the leadership of the Communist Party and opposing the socialist system, and their plots and undermining activities must be smashed. The undermining activities of the hostile forces supported and abetted by the external anti-China and anticommunist political forces must be firmly and ruthlessly exposed, sternly counterattacked, and thoroughly smashed. This is a basic principle of the party and the state. The turmoil in the summer of 1989 was turned into a rebellion against the Communist Party, the socialist system, and the people's democratic dictatorship, and we took the necessary measures. Only thus could we achieve today's stable political situation. However, we must soberly note that the hostile forces at home and abroad, including a small handful of ultra-rightists in Hong Kong who have attached themselves to foreign powers and oppose everything China adopts, will never be willing to give in. They will inevitably use every opportunity to carry out activities of subversion, infiltration, and sabotage. We must resolutely crack down on their undermining activities against China, against the Communist Party, and against the socialist system without any lenience. The party committees in the armed police force, the public security organs, and the judicial organs rapidly relayed the speeches by Zhang Wannian and Tao Siju and arranged study sessions. The armed police units and public security departments in all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities sent telegrams one after another to the State Council, the Ministry of Public Security, and the Headquarters of the Armed Police Force to express their firm support. It seems that the CPC authorities will not hesitate to repeat the tragedy in order to maintain their one-party dictatorship. This does not show that they are strong; on the contrary, this only shows their weakness and demonstrates that the Jiang-Li regime is being upset by the incessant crises. However, I was also told by other sources that some people among the CPC high-ranking officials are opposed to methods of suppression like those used in the 4 June massacre. They maintain that, if more student unrest like the 4 June incident occurs, and if the students only stage peaceful demonstrations, then peaceful political methods should be used to settle the trouble and violence must be prevented. I asked: "Would this be the mainstream opinion within the party?" "I hope so. However, it seems that Jiang, Li, and other diehards will insist on the option of relying on military force."
