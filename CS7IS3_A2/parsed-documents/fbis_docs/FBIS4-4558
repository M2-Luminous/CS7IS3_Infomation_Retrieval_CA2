In response, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT] made clear on 1 April that it is ready to negotiate with the United States in April, at the earliest. The NTT announced a set of measures to revamp its current procurement procedures, including free contracts, in response to a package of external economic measures that the government announced on 29 March. The MOPT expressed a willingness to negotiate with the United States with the aim of briefing that country on the measures announced by the NTT. Japan and the United States have concluded an intergovernmental agreement on NTT's procurement. An annual review of the NTT's procurement is to be conducted in accordance with the agreement, but the 1993 review has yet to be undertaken.
