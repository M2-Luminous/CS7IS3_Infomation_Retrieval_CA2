FR940719-1-00024 FR940719-1-00009 On November 4, 1992, the EPA published a proposed rule (57 FR 52716) to implement that element of the August 9, 1991, plan. The proposed rule provided that proposed discharges of dredged or fill material into wetlands in the State of Alaska would be excepted from current provisions of the Guidelines that require that all proposed discharges of dredged or fill material represent the least environmentally damaging practicable alternative. In addition, the proposed rule provided that, for proposed discharges of dredged or fill material into wetlands in the State of Alaska, the requirement that all appropriate and practicable measures to compensate for potential unavoidable adverse impacts on the aquatic ecosystem would no longer be applicable. For the State of Alaska, minimization of impacts would have constituted the requisite mitigation necessary to meet the mitigation requirements of the Guidelines. The preamble to the proposed rule solicited comment on whether or not it would be appropriate for the rule to more directly address the protection of high-value wetlands, including the option of maintaining the full sequence of avoidance, minimization, and compensation for high-value wetlands, and if appropriate, how this might be accomplished. The preamble made specific reference to ongoing efforts by the State of Alaska to develop a wetlands categorization approach as part of a State regulatory approach for freshwater wetlands that may prove useful for the identification and protection of high-value wetlands. Comment was specifically invited on how Alaska's wetlands regulatory approach might be integrated into a final rule, and how Federal agencies might most appropriately apply Alaska's system for identifying high-value wetlands. The close of the 45-day public comment period was December 21, 1992. Public Comments EPA received over 6,600 public comments in response to the November 4, 1992, notice of proposed rulemaking. Of those comments, 10% were received from persons in Alaska, while the remaining 90% were received from persons in States other than Alaska. Specific issues areas addressed in the public comments received included the feasibility of practicable alternatives and compensatory mitigation, the existing degree of section 404 regulatory flexibility, protection of high-value wetlands, and Alaska's wetland regulatory approach under development. A summary of the significant relevant comments, and EPA's assessment of them, is provided below. Practicable Alternatives and Compensatory Mitigation The proposed rule would have eliminated for Alaska the requirements to avoid wetlands losses and to compensate for unavoidable wetlands impacts where practicable. Comments regarding practicable alternatives and compensatory mitigation primarily consisted of statements and examples regarding their feasibility. The great majority of comments asserted that, in general, in Alaska there are no practicable alternatives to developing in wetlands and that, in general, compensatory mitigation is not practicable. A number of comments, although agreeing with those who commented that alternatives and compensatory mitigation are not practicable in Alaska, did not believe that these conditions warranted eliminating avoidance and compensatory mitigation from existing requirements, particularly because these requirements are only pursued when ``practicable.'' Most of these comments pointed out that these determinations are made on a site-specific basis, which allows great flexibility in the degree to which avoidance and compensatory mitigation are pursued. A few comments recommended other ways of addressing these mitigation sequence requirements, particularly ways in which compensatory mitigation could be achieved without creation of wetlands from uplands.
