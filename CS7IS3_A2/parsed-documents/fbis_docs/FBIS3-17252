They will be held prior to the start of spring field work. Such auctions were previously held at the "Pravdinskaya" Association and the "60th Anniversary of October" Kolkhoz, about which IZVESTIYA has written. It is envisaged that soft loans will be granted to newly formed agricultural enterprises -- partnerships, cooperatives, and private farms -- under a directive by Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast Governor B. Nemtsov. These loans will be granted on the basis of an average of 200,000 rubles per hectare for the land acquired by the new owners at auction. These resources are to be allocated out of the oblast budget. The loans are granted for a three-year term at a very low rate of interest. According to the oblast administration's Department of Agriculture and Land Reform, such targeted financial support for newly set up agricultural enterprises and private farmers will help them to confidently take their first steps and, in particular, to carry out the upcoming field work. It is interesting that around four dozen applications to hold land auctions have already been received by the department from former kolkhozes and sovkhozes, which will enable the peasants to own land and property in reality rather than just on paper.
