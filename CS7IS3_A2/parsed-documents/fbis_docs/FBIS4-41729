During his meeting with Aluksne inhabitants on Saturday, Ulmanis admitted that the citizenship law could be sent for repeated parliament consideration. "I will ask the parliament to consider the citizenship law one more time so that the interests of the Latvian people as well as international norms were observed in it," said Ulmanis. As reported, the Cabinet called the president not to announce the citizenship law, adopted on June 21, but send it for repeated parliament consideration. The law's article No. 14 provides for the quota principle that allows to naturalize each year a number of citizens equal to 0.1 percent of the body of citizens, starting with the year 2000. The naturalization quota principle endangers Latvia's enrollment in the Council of Europe [CE] and the very negotiations on the granting the CE associate member status to the Baltic country, and that poses a threat to Latvia's further integration into the European Union, according to the government statement. The quota principle also complicates Latvia's entrance into European collective security structures, the statement read. [passage omitted]
