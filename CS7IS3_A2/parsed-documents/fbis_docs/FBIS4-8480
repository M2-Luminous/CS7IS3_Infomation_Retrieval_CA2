FBIS4-8480 "dreeu072_h_94007" FBIS-EEU-94-072 Daily Report 24 Mar 1994 HUNGARY Government Decrees on Radio, Television, MTI Government Decrees on Radio, Television, MTI 94CH0222B Budapest NEPSZABADSAG in Hungarian 24 Mar 94 p 5 94CH0222B Budapest NEPSZABADSAG Hungarian CSO [Article by S.A.: "Radio, TV, MTI: Special Legal Provisions"] [Text] The government has promulgated three decrees regarding the implementation of the public employee law. As published in MAGYAR KOZLONY, the decrees contain special provisions to be applied at the Hungarian Radio, the Hungarian Television, and the Hungarian Telegraphic Agency [MTI]. With respect to public employees of Hungarian Radio, the decree states among other things that fixed-term employment relationships established for the purpose of substitution may exceed the five-year period. At the same time, appointments to higher-level management positions and assignments involving leadership positions may be made for a period up to five years. Insofar as rules of work performance are concerned, the decrees state that additional legal relationships for the performance of work are inconsistent with the legal relationship of public employees if such legal relationship violates or threatens the objectivity and impartiality of information broadcast by Hungarian Radio. (According to experts questioned in this regard, this provision rules out the possibility of, for example, an employee of the Radio acting as the spokesman for one or another political party -- editor.) A public employee of the radio must not establish additional legal relationships for the performance of work with other employers except if such relationship does not violate or endanger the appropriate business interests of the Hungarian Radio. The government decrees take effect on 30 March.
