The entire list of 34 deputies was considered and officially registered. The next issue on the agenda was to schedule the dates for the elections in those 15 districts where they had not been held. Commission members had various proposals. Having weighed all the pros and cons, they decided upon the date of 30 October of this year. More candidates will be nominated, signatures will be collected, and there will be registration. Campaigning will begin on 1 October. The district commissions could possible have the same members; the statute on elections allows this. When solving the problem of district commissions all circumstances will be taken into account. It cannot be ruled out that the composition of several of them will be changed. Complaints from candidates and their authorized agents (not a single voter sent a written complaint to the commission) received after the election were considered at the meeting. A number of complaints were dismissed since they had already been thoroughly discussed. On that day members of the commission began to check out several statements. In the opinion of those who were asked, with respect to one or two districts the oblast electoral commission might possibly have to make an additional decision, that is, the elections could be declared null and void.
