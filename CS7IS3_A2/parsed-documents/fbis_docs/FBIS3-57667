Security Council to "launch a full-scale peace-keeping operation in the whole territory of the Abkhazian region," says a letter of Georgia's permanent representative at the United Nations Pyotr Chkheidze, circulated here on Thursday as a Security Council document. According to the letter, the war in Abkhazia "has brought to a critical condition the economic situation of the Republic of Georgia and turned hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. There are no visible signs that their situation is improving." The letter pointed out that this situation "may create serious preconditions for spontaneous actions on the part of 300,000 refugees and displaced persons," and may bring to naught the agreements reached by the two sides in Geneva. "Taking into account those circustances and facing a real danger of another wave of violence in that region, the Georgian Government is urging the world community to render assistance in launching a full-scale peace-keeping operation on the whole territory of the Abkhazian region, using the U.N. force or, if this problem cannot be resolved quick enough, using any other force sanctioned by the U.N. As is known, this approach has been recorded in a communique on the second round of talks, held in Geneva," the letter said. "Quoting provisions of the communique and taking into consideration the understanding of this request, displayed by the Russian leadership, as well as its direct interest in preventing the spreading of the conflict outside the Georgian territory and, in the long run, in the stabilisation of the situation in the whole area, the Georgian leadership is welcoming Russia's readiness to take part in the peace-keeping operation in Abkhazia with a view to attaining that goal. Contingents from other countries may be attached to Russian peace-keeping units, along with the participation of U.N. military observers, in accordance with a Security Council resolution," the Georgian representatve wrote.
