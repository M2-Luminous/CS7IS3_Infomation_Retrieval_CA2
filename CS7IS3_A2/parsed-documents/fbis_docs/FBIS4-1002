An IEC spokesman confirmed that meetings between banks and the commission had taken place with a view to hiring bank tellers because of their counting skills. The commission plans to recruit over 19,000 counters and although bank tellers will not make up the total number, the commission hopes they will comprise a significant portion. It is understood that tellers have been offered R350 [rand] per day of counting, plus travel expenses. Counting is expected to take two days. Meanwhile, the commission has estimated that 3.5 million temporary voter cards have been printed by the Home Affairs Department, one million of which have already been issued. The commission has changed the registration process for the issuing of the cards to avoid the long queues that have occurred due to the complicated forms. The commission has pointed out that ID documents, reference books and identity cards for temporary identity certificates can be used and that people with these documents need not apply for temporary voter cards. The IEC has released the total number of eligible voters in the different regions. The total number of voters will be 22,709,152. The approximate number in each of the regions are Western Cape (2.4 million), Northern Cape (440,000), Eastern Cape (3.2 million), [Orange] Free State (1.6 million), Natal (4.6 million), the Northern West (1.7 million), the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] (4.9 million), the Eastern Transvaal (1.6 million) and the Northern Transvaal (2.3 million).
