It also agreed to change -- with only two votes against -- the conditions for bidding by Mexican and foreign firms for the right to conduct an independent audit of the lists. After promising that the definitive lists of names will be turned over to the parties before the scheduled date, Government Secretary Jorge Carpizo McGregor said the Mexican Government "is determined to provide all instruments that can yield trustworthy results so that everyone can overcome this air of distrust." IFE members unanimously approved the PRI presidential candidate's replacement. Jorge Carpizo, president of the General Council of the IFE, submitted candidate Ernesto Zedillo's legal registration to Humberto Lira Mora, electoral action secretary of the PRI. Those present at the session, at Carpizo's request, marked a moment of silence in memory of Luis Donaldo Colosio. After voting against an independent audit, Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD] Deputy Roberto Robles Garnica, minority representative in the Senate, said such an audit will prove "useless" because "it is designed to be more of a justification than an improvement in the credibility of the electoral lists." He added that by the time the audit is completed, "we will not have time to use it" to make corrections. PRI adviser Salvador Rocha Diaz denied that the "electoral lists are incorrect," and he accused the PRD of having assumed a "dubious position." He said "it is a serious thing" for the party "to already be preparing to reject the election results." Following a long debate in which an independent audit of the electoral lists was approved, Carpizo thanked the members of the Independent Audit Technical Council for their work and added: "The work done by the 11 scientists contrasts the work conducted by other Mexicans whose cooperation was requested and who have haggled about their time." He did not go into any details about who he was referring to. Carpizo also announced that starting today the electronic media will broadcast messages from the nine presidents of the political parties in which they will invite their supporters to verify the electoral lists in their respective centers. As of yesterday, six party presidents had already recorded their messages. The official later said that, following demands from the parties -- "which, in my opinion, are correct" -- they will be given definite party member lists before the scheduled date to give them enough time to review the lists. He explained that this decision will require a reform of the Cofipe [Federal Code of Institutions and Electoral Procedures], for which there is a consensus. Nevertheless, he said this would require reducing by approximately one month the deadline to deliver credentials with a photograph. He explained it will also be necessary to launch a large-scale effort to enable the people to immediately pick up their voting credentials, and he calculated the first voter lists could be delivered by 1 August. The agreement approved by the parties indicates an external audit will review and evaluate the voter lists, the credentials with a photograph, and the receipt of credentials and party member lists. Carpizo admitted that the external audit may reveal "mistakes in the voter lists involving dead people and changes of address," but, he said, "I thought about this before accepting this post because, if this was going to be one of the daring adventures of my life, I would not work with voter lists that did not allow me personally to be confident." The debate between Carpizo and the PRD representatives became difficult at times, although the tone was more conciliatory in later sessions. This session was not attended by PRD leader Porfirio Munoz Ledo. Senator Robles Garnica, coordinator general of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas' campaign, attended in his place. [passage omitted]
