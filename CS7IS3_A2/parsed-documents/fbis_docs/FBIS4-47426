Their examinations indicated that 89 percent of the school children have essentially healthy eyes and no contraindications for any of various kinds of production work. Such students included those with uncorrected visual acuity of 0.6-0.8 and corrected acuity of 1.0. Only a small percentage of students in the public schools (0.2 percent) had pronounced visual problems, i.e., corrected visual acuity of 0.5 or lower in the better eye. That represents some 1,500 students graduating from the ninth grade each year. In all, 6.3 percent of those who graduate need some correction of their vision. Myopia is the pathology most frequently encountered among the public school students; those with severe myopia, however, account for only 0.2 percent of the graduating students. Virtually all the students found to have severe eye problems were from the special schools. References 10: 9 Russian, 1 Western.
