FR940504-0-00055 FR940504-0-00014 1995 Fisheries The timing of the March and April Council meetings makes it impracticable for the Council to recommend fishing seasons to the Secretary that begin before May 1 of the same year. Therefore, openings earlier than May 1 for 1995 fishing seasons are being provided for at this time. The Council recommended, and the Secretary concurs, that the following recreational seasons will open in 1995: (1) The area from Point Arena to the U.S.-Mexico border will open on the nearest Saturday to March 1 for all salmon with a two-fish daily bag limit, except for closure of the control zone near the mouth of San Francisco Bay from the opening of the season through March 31; and (2) the area from Horse Mountain to Point Arena will open on the nearest Saturday to February 15 for all salmon with a two-fish daily bag limit. The following tables and text are the management measures recommended by the Council for 1994 and, as specified, for 1995. The Secretary concurs with these recommendations and finds them responsive to the goals of the FMP, the requirements of the resource, and the socio-economic factors affecting resource users. The management measures are consistent with requirements of the Magnuson Act and other applicable law, including U.S. obligations to Indian Tribes with treaty-secured fishing rights. The following management measures are adopted for 1994 and, as specified, for 1995 under 50 CFR part 661.
