FBIS3-31494 "dreeu034__a94015" FBIS-EEU-94-034-A Document Type:Daily Report 18 February 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Assembly Rejects Motion To Eliminate Senate AU1702064094 Prague CTK in English 2102 GMT 16 Feb 94 AU1702064094 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Prague, Feb 16 (CTK) -- The Czech Parliament today rejected the proposal to delete a clause providing for establishing a Senate, the upper chamber in the Czech Parliament, from the Czech Constitution. Under the proposal submitted by seven deputies from the Assembly for the Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC) the Czech Parliament should remain one-chamber. The Constitution provides for a two-chamber parliament consisting of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate which has not yet been filled. It is expected that senatorial elections would be held this autumn. SPR-RSC Deputy Miroslav Kasparek, who gave the reasons for the proposal, said his party had proceeded from the conviction that the Senate could not fulfill its function envisaged by the Constitution. Already during the first Czechoslovak Republic of President Tomas Garrigue Masaryk the Senate was criticized as a "layer" for elderly politicians who were already incapable of fulfilling their duties in parliament. He said the establishment of the Senate was not aimed at dividing power but at its ever more concentration "in the hands of one party."
