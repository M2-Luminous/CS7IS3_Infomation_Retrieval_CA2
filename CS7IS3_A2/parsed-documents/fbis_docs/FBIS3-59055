This number is "unbearably large," the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] politician complained in a comparable meeting. Thus, what was reported by FOCUS two weeks ago has been officially established by the government: After the amendment to the Basic Law on asylum, almost the same number of foreigners come to the country illegally. The decrease in immigration only takes place in the statistics. Kanther reported that in 1993, 2,000 refugee smugglers were arrested; 97 percent of them had been foreigners. Otto Hauser, Baden-Wuerttemberg CDU land group chairman, called for a draconian punishment of up to 10 years' imprisonment for refugee smugglers. "There is no other way." Kanther is now planning the employment of foreign officers as undercover investigators against foreign criminal gangs.
