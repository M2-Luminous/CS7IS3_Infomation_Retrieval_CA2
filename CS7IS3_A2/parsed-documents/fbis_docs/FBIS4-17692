No matter what were the reasons for the murder, the ROSSIISKIYE VESTI newspaper notes, "its very fact committed a day before the signing of a memorandum on civic accord and five days before mass May demonstrations, can provoke a political crisis". Referring to the opinion of most Russian legislators, the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper states that "it is chaos in the country and Interior Ministry organs cannot do anything with it. The underworld executes its sentences every day. Nothing can stop it even the legislator's mandate". The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDa newspaper reports the murder under the headline "Russian legislators have not been killed since 1917". Quoting statements by "some militia officers", the newspaper concludes: "Aizderdzis was evidently killed, because the WHO IS WHO newspaper, which he patronised, printed the list of major criminals. It is out of question that he was killed for political reasons". The TRUD newspaper devotes several materials to this event under the general headline "a shot at legislator also hit minister (eds: Interior Minister Viktor Yerin)". The newspaper reminds that the lower chamber demanded that President Boris Yeltsin release the minister of his duties and "use to the full his constitutional powers to establish law and order immediately". TRUD quotes a statement by the Russian leader that assassins will be found. The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper singles out information about this tragedy, noting that the assassination of the lawmaker infuriated the lower house so much that it "almost forbade its speaker (eds: Ivan Rybkin) to sign a treaty on civil accord". At the same time, it expresses doubts that Aizderdzis was killed because of the above-mentioned publication in the WHO IS WHO newspaper. The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA newspaper runs an article devoted to Aizderdzis, noting: "Every of his speeches before audiences resembled vigorous attacks". The newspaper claims that Aizderdzis exposed families of those who gave orders to shoot at innocent people during the tragic October days. "He said everywhere that he was a participant in the parliament building defence, a communist." ROSSIISKIYE VESTI examines another leading theme of the press -- the signing of a treaty on social accord -- from a position of "will the Russian nation obtain a creative perspective?". Under the above headline, the newspaper prints several materials devoted to this event. "Russia is ready to obtain, at long last, a document of nation- wide importance, without a precedent in national history," says one of the articles. It is high time to understand that the Russian nation, all its parties, movements and segments of population, all its generations badly need peaceful continuity. "Sure, recent antagonists cannot agree with each other in everything. But this is exactly the case when there cannot and should not be victors and vanquished." The PRAVDA newspaper believes that the treaty will be signed by representatives of the so-called new bourgeoisie. "Nearly all left-wing parties" will be against. The newspaper claims that "there are grounds to believe that the signing of `the agreement' will eventually turn either into a farce or a tragedy." TRUD publishes with some abbreviations a chapter from the book "The President's Journal" by Boris Yeltsin. It is named "a bleak streak". Describing the tragic events in moscow on October 3-4, 1993, the author notes that "that was struggle against the president, struggle for power... That was struggle for changing the state foundations". The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper features an interview with Viktor Samoilov, managing director of Rosvooruzhenie firm, a state company on export and import of arms and combat materiel. He writes that the company does not intend to surrender its position in competition struggle. At the same time, it will be guided, in future too, by the following motto: "Cooperation in Trust". "We Are Open for Partnership".
