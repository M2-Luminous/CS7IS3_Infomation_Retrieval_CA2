But there still is danger of a further decline in the RMB. Several experts have come out with analyses of this problem and made proposals to the central department. But these proposals have all been tied up in the upper echelon and the experts all are upset. The RMB Devaluation View Is "Killed" What is worse, the mainland departments concerned have recently told dissemination units that they may not report the view that the RMB could be further devalued, making the situation more mysterious. The analysis and opinion that this reporter is expressing in this article is among the opinions "killed." Of course, this reporter has not written off the official efforts to adjust and control the RMB. Actually, the Chinese Government recently has adopted extremely strict measures and ordered local banks to recall conversion funds and loans to assure key projects and agricultural byproduct purchasing funds. So, all the local banks are adopting measures to recall funds one after the other. The RMB money market is extremely tight, and the State Council has now issued a notice that within the year it will abolish the foreign exchange quotas of foreign trade enterprises, causing some enterprises with rather large foreign exchange balances to sell off large quantities of foreign exchange. Strong Measures Only Reap Temporary Effects In another previous period when the banks forced enterprises that were hoarding foreign exchange to pay back, they also sold off large quantities of foreign exchange one after the other and rushed to convert it to RMB to pay back. With this background, the RMB exchange rate went straight up. At the same time, the Bank of China twice raised the savings interest rates, causing savings interest rates to reach double digits and temporarily calming the fear of devaluation of the RMB among Chinese citizens. It certainly was temporarily useful in restoring confidence in the RMB. But it was all the temporary change of strict measures adopted by central authorities. With the passing of time, these central policies gradually lost their effectiveness and the RMB was further devalued. Because in the present situation the RMB is receiving more and more pressure, measures adopted by the central authorities cannot thoroughly eliminate pressure on the RMB. The Balance of Payments Could Change From Surplus to Deficit As regards the overall foreign trade situation, China is changing from a surplus to a deficit. From 1990 through 1992, the mainland had three successive years of surpluses and accumulated US$20 billion in foreign exchange. With the Bank of China's foreign exchange supply added, it totalled US$40 billion. Since 1992 China's export situation has worsened. Imports have increased by 25 percent, but exports have only increased by 18 percent. This year the situation is even more serious. Imports are clearly greater than exports and the surplus is getting smaller and smaller. It is estimated that in the last half of this year, a deficit in the balance of payments will occur. Looking at the first half of this year, it is quite obvious that the lowering of the exchange rate on the RMB to help exports of Chinese enterprises by no means accomplished this result. China's present reduction in the money supply is leading to a rise in the RMB exchange rate and is even more unhelpful to the exports of Chinese enterprises, and China's balance of payments deficit could increase, thereby essentially creating greater pressure on the RMB. Sustained growth of China's imports could lead to greater pressure on the RMB. According to mainland statistics for the past thirteen years, three months after every 100 million yuan increase in domestic investment, imports increase by about US$15 million. In the recent rapid growth of the Chinese economy, the reason that the retrenchment policies adopted by the central authorities have not had the necessary effect is because the central authorities can only control the portion in the central plan and they can by no means control the large portion of provincial, municipal, and local investment and the investment outside the plan. If the central authorities adopt total retrenchment and administrative measures, it also could have a serious impact on the domestic economy. So, future imports could still increase greatly. Certainly, "restoration to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)" also could force China to lower tariffs, leading to a large increase in imports. This obviously could increase pressure on the RMB. It presently appears that the RMB exchange rate could temporarily decline, but it cannot be sustained. And once the RMB exchange rate declines again, the Chinese government obviously cannot use economic force to sell off large quantities of foreign exchange to safeguard the strength of the value of the RMB. Because the Chinese Government understands this, the exchange rate for the RMB will decline. It is necessary to promote exports and it is necessary to cope with the vigorous increase in imports after "restoration to GATT" and its impact on national industry. High Estimate of the RMB Value Leads to Black Market Rates of Exchange It is extremely obvious that China in not establishing a favorable balance of payments base for the stability of adjustments in the exchange rate, but using administrative methods to control and limit foreign exchange prices, ultimately can only create a high appraisal of the RMB. Individuals and companies that have foreign exchange do not want to take their foreign exchange to the adjustment market to sell, causing the foreign exchange adjustment market "to have a price, but no market." This situation can only promote the pouring of a large amount of foreign exchange into the black market for sale and China's black market value has for a time reached the high level of 11 yuan to the U.S. dollar. So, China's reform of the exchange rate will impel further devaluation of the RMB. Eliminating the foreign exchange quota and changing "quota controls" to "spot price controls" requires that the posted exchange rate price of the RMB be devalued to the level of the adjusted exchange rate, that is, from the current official rate of 5.8 yuan to the U.S. dollar to approximately 9 yuan. This will force the RMB exchange rate to be further devalued to between 8.5 and 10 yuan. Foreign exchange black market trends are determined from the supply and demand relationship of RMB and foreign exchange. When foreign exchange supply and demand are unbalanced, the RMB can be devalued. But the domestic economy is presently contracting and issuance of RMB is controlled. The RMB could increase in value for a period of time and the the government could at the same time adopt measures to reduce the economy. So, a policy to tighten the RMB could temporarily support stability. But a rather great number of Chinese economists agree with this reporter that the goal of reducing the economy will not necessarily be effective and it is not easy to be optimistic about the situation. If it is not handled properly, serious inflation could quite possibly occur and control of the issuance of the RMB could be lost, causing further devaluation. Agitation to devalue the RMB also causes Chinese citizens to develop a mentality anticipating devaluation. This mentality is extremely unhelpful to maintaining the stability of the RMB. From the present situation it appears that mainland citizens generally expect that the RMB could be devalued. There is insufficient confidence in the RMB, although the monthly interest on domestic foreign exchange deposits is only 3 percent, two thirds or more lower than the interest on RMB deposits. But the vast majority of citizens still do not want to sell large quantities of foreign currency to buy RMB. Rather they have a tendency to save much foreign exchange to maintain their worth. According to this reporter's statistics, mainland citizens' private savings have reached US$10 billion, half the national foreign exchange reserves. It can be affirmed that in a short while, in addition to stocks, stockpiling foreign exchange will be mainland citizens' future way of maintaining their worth and the principal method of guarding against risks. With the trend of this kind of mentality of Chinese citizens, it will be very difficult to avoid further devaluation of the RMB.
