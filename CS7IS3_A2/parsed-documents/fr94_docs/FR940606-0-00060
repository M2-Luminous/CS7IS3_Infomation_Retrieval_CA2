(1) For purposes of this section, the term displaced person means a person (household, business, nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves personal property from real property, permanently, as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for a project assisted under this part. The term ``displaced person'' includes, but may not be limited to: (i) A person that moves permanently from the real property after receiving notice requiring such move, if the move occurs on or after the date the Owner submits to the PHA the Owner proposal that is later approved; (ii) Any person, including a person who moves from the property before the date the Owner submits the proposal to the PHA, if the PHA or HUD determines that the displacement resulted directly from acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the assisted project; or (iii) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit who moves from the building/complex, permanently, after the ``initiation of negotiations'' (see paragraph (h) of this section), if the move occurs before the tenant is provided a written notice offering him or her the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex, under reasonable terms and conditions, upon its completion. Such reasonable terms and conditions shall include a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the greater of: (A) The tenant's monthly rent before the ``initiation of negotiations'' and estimated average monthly utility costs; or (B) The total tenant payment, as determined under 24 CFR 813.107, if the tenant is low-income, or 30 percent of gross household income, if the tenant is not low-income; or (iv) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling, who is required to relocate temporarily, but does not return to the building/complex, if either: (A) The tenant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, or (B) Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable; or (v) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who moves from the building/complex permanently after he or she has been required to move to another dwelling unit in the building/complex, if either: (A) The tenant is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move; or (B) Other conditions of the move are not reasonable. (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this section, a person does not qualify as a ``displaced person'' (and is not eligible for relocation assistance under the URA or this section), if: (i) The person has been evicted for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease or occupancy agreement, violation of applicable Federal, State or local law, or other good cause, and the PHA determines that the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide relocation assistance; (ii) The person moved into the property after the submission of the preliminary proposal (or application, if there is no preliminary proposal), and, before signing a lease and commencing occupancy, received written notice of the project and its possible impact on the person (e.g., the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated, or suffer a rent increase) and the fact that he or she would not qualify as a ``displaced person'' (or for any assistance provided under this section) as a result of the project; (iii) The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2); or (iv) HUD determines that the person was not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the project. (3) The PHA may request, at any time, HUD to determine whether a displacement is or would be covered by paragraph (d)(7) of this section. (h) Definition of initiation of negotiations. For purposes of determining the formula for computing the replacement housing assistance to be provided to a residential tenant displaced as a direct result of private-owner rehabilitation or demolition of the real property, the term initiation of negotiations means the execution of the Agreement between the Owner and the PHA.
