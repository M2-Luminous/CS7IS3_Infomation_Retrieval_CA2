The Security Affairs Committee and the Legal Affairs Committee met to discuss the remaining disputed issues with a view to reaching an agreement at the end of this week. Khalid al-Qidrah, head of the Palestinian delegation to the Legal Affairs Committee, noted some progress in the committee's work. There is now a great deal of understanding on the main issues, such as jurisdiction over territory and over criminal and judicial affairs, he said. Once we finish with the agreement, we will present it to the Palestinian leadership, he added. Palestinian sources have said that the Israeli proposals on legal jurisdiction meet some Palestinian demands, especially concerning the rights of foreigners in Gaza and Jericho and legal pursuits in security and criminal cases. The sources say that some differences, especially those over the control of crossing points and the release of detainees, have yet to be resolved and efforts are being made to reach agreement on them.
