Handing over the major portion of their tax revenues to the federal budget, cities are virtually in no condition right now to carry out investment activity or implement social programs. A four-day seminar on the topic "Problems of Investment-Construction Policy in Russia," organized by the Union of Russian Cities and dedicated to a discussion of this problem, completed its activity yesterday. The seminar was attended by an array of the most diverse organizations. In addition to representatives of the structures of power--the presidential staff, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economics, State Committee on Construction, and Moscow Committee on Land--Russian and foreign scholars were also invited, as were the commercial organizations SAVVA R.E., RAIN [not further identified], and Housing Initiative. The representatives of 20 major cities of Russia tried to generalize the information provided by those who spoke and present the real state of affairs in the investment-construction complex throughout Russia as a whole and in the localities as well. The results turned out to be disappointing. It was clear from the presentations of representatives of the federal authority that the municipalities can rely only on themselves in resolving the housing problem. The government is presently able to finance only the program for provision of housing to military servicemen and (partially) to inhabitants of the North who have resettled in the central regions. Nor can local authorities rely on assistance from commercial structures in the financing of housing construction, although the experience of many firms using a contributory-construction arrangement tapping funds of the populace may find application in the regions. In the opinion of representatives of the municipalities, the relationship between powers of the central and local levels of authority must be changed. The government has stopped financing regional programs but has not reduced its control over the activity of city authorities. As a result, the municipalities are left one on one with their problems, left with a mass of directives and statutes regulating their activities. In addition, effective this year a significantly greater share of tax revenues is going to the federal budget. Seminar participants believe the only way out is to diminish control by the center and expand the powers of local organs of authority in the use of tax revenues. Results of the seminar will be generalized and reported in the conclusion of a group of experts, which will be provided to the committees on matters of local self-government under the federal legislative and executive authorities. These committees are presently drawing up proposals aimed at amending legislation on local self-government.
