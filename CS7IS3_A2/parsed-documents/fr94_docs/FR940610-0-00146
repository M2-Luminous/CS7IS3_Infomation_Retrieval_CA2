ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: In the Notices section of this Federal Register , EPA is granting an administrative exception to the general prohibition on early entry into pesticide treated areas for hand labor contained in the Worker Protection Standard (WPS) issued under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). That exception allows, for a 2-year period, under specified conditions, early entry by workers to harvest greenhouse-grown cut roses. To ensure that the regulated community is aware of that and future administrative exceptions to the early-entry prohibition, EPA is amending the WPS to add a new §170.122(e)(7) that allows the regulated community to locate Federal Register notices that set forth the terms and conditions of the administrative exceptions. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 10, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Therese Murtagh, Chief, Occupational Safety Branch (7506C), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, (703) 305&hyph;7666. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background and Purpose EPA issued the WPS on August 21, 1992 (57 FR 38102, 40 CFR Part 170). The WPS includes a prohibition (§170.112) against routine early entry into pesticide treated areas to perform hand labor tasks during restricted-entry intervals (referred to as ``early entry''). Section 170.112(e) of the WPS provides a process for EPA to consider and grant administrative exceptions to this prohibition on early entry. In the Notice section of this Federal Register , EPA is granting the first such administrative exception for early entry to harvest cut roses. To ensure that the regulated community is aware of, and able to locate, that and future administrative exceptions, EPA is amending §170.112 by adding a new paragraph (e)(7) identifying the Federal Register citations and effective dates for administrative exceptions granted under §170.112(e). The addition of paragraph (e)(7) to §170.112 is a technical amendment. It does not make any substantive changes in the WPS or §170.112. Accordingly, EPA finds that there is good cause to make this amendment effective without notice and opportunity for public comment because they are unnecessary. Under §170.112(e), EPA provides notice and an opportunity for comment on proposed administrative exceptions. There is no need for separate comment on adding a cross-reference to §170.112(e) to those published exception decisions. In addition, EPA finds that there is good cause to make this technical amendment effective immediately upon publication so that reference to the cut rose administrative exception, which is itself effective immediately in this Federal Register , will appear in the CFR immediately. II. Regulatory Assessment Requirements A. Executive Order 12866 Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51835, October 4, 1993), EPA must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and to the requirements of the Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this technical amendment is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 650(b)), EPA has determined that this technical amendment will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses since the technical amendment makes no substantive changes in the WPS. C. Paperwork Reduction Act This technical amendment contains no information collection requirements as defined in the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3502 et seq.).
