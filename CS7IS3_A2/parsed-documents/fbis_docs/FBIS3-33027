The Foreign Minister explained: "They have invited the Salvadoran Attorney General's Office to be present at the trial and have asked our investigating units to participate with their U.S. counterparts." The foreign minister said the U.S. Embassy is aiding the relatives of Jose Crescencio Diaz, the bodyguard murdered on 21 January in Soyapango. The U.S. officer left El Salvador almost immediately after Diaz' death. This moved the Salvadoran Government to send a protest note to the U.S. Government asking for penalties for whoever was responsible of violating Salvadoran immigration laws. On another issue, the foreign minister said it is expected El Salvador will be taken off the list of countries that violate human rights by the end of February or the beginning of March. Reportedly the UN Human Rights Committee, which is meeting in Switzerland, will be adopting this decision. The official said a group of Salvadoran experts is participating in that meeting and, if necessary, he would return to Switzerland to be present for the voting. Salaverria said: "As a result of the signing of the peace agreements, human rights violations that were a product of the war dropped considerably, and the country's situation looks different." Foreign Minister Salaverria said he has sent letters to the countries that are members of the commission to help in taking El Salvador off a list "on which we should not be listed."
