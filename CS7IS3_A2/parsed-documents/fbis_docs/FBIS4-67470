An official from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) said the proposal is aimed at awakening the interest of APEC member-countries to debt-for-nature swap arrangement. At present, only Mexico and the Philippines are taking part in the program among APEC member-countries. Robert Jara, project coordinator of DENR foreign assisted special project director, told BUSINESS WORLD the debt-for-nature swap scheme remains one of the more creative financing mechanism a Third World country can avail of in preserving its environment. He disclosed that during the recently concluded meeting of APEC's environment ministers in Vancouver, Canada, the proposal was adopted as one of the "framework of principles" approved by the APEC body. The principle specifically states that APEC member-economies should cooperate in exploring "innovative approaches to fund-raising scheme and mechanisms" in protecting the environment. The debt-for-nature swap program, however recently came under attack from various sectors claiming the arrangement had become virtually impractical because of the rising cost of the Philippine debt papers. The debt-for-nature swap arrangement is based on the principle that part of the foreign debt of severely indebted country is "canceled" by rechanneling it to a national currency fund directed to finance environment programs. Specifically, the program involves the purchase and subsequent cancellation of part of a country's foreign debt in exchange for the funding of local conservation efforts and a government commitment to protect the environment. Mr. Jara claimed the arrangement even has finance Secretary Roberto F. de Ocampo's endorsement. In a brief presented during the meeting of APEC's finance ministers last March, Mr. de Ocampo proposed debt-for-nature swap deals as one of the concerns which countries should adopt. Based on the copy of the brief obtained by BUSINESS WORLD, Mr. de Ocampo praised debt-for-nature swap arrangement as a "win-win" scheme which can allow the Philippines to address both its debt and environment protection problems, specifically in relation to fund lack. Mr. Jara admitted, however, that the program will not solve the country's debt problem as the amount of money involved is just too small to make a dent in the country's total foreign debt. On the other hand, he said it can help a long way in the country's conservation efforts. The country's debt-for-nature swap program is currently supporting biodiversity projects in the El Nido Marine Reservation and St. Paul River Subterranean National Park, both in Palawan, and in Mt. Pulog in Northern Luzon. The Foundation for Philippine Environment is overseeing the program in coordination with the Philippine Business for Social Progress. Earlier, Environment Secretary Angel C. Alcala, who represented the country during the APEC environment ministerial meeting, explained the discussions mainly focused on integrating environment issues with the economy or industrialization. It is an initial discussion on potential cooperation among APEC member economies in the area of environment and sustainable growth, he added. The meeting was held last 23-25 March and was attended by 150 delegates, representing APEC's 18 member-countries. APEC was formed in 1989 in response to increasing calls for closer economic cooperation among countries in the Asia-Pacific through increased intra-regional trade and investment flows.
