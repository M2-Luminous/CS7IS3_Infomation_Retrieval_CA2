Speaking about the new Cabinet, he said that "there is no government united by one idea or one logic." "There is a group of leaders of different ministries concerned about the future of these ministries. In the absence of a central economic concept it is difficult and psychologically impossible to withstand the lobbyists' demands coming from everywhere," he told the newspaper Izvestiya. To quote Gaydar, the old government managed to prevent hyperinflation, although inflation fever continues to torment the economy. The situation in foreign trade has changed and exports far exceed imports. The hard-currency reserve considerably increased: whereas at the end of 1991 the state treasury was almost empty, by the end of 1993 Russia's hard-currency reserves exceeded $4.5 Bn. The absolute deadlock in November 1991 was overcome avoiding an economic collapse, civil war and dictatorship, he said. He also said that his faction in the State Duma would rigorously and consistently work for broadening the citizens' right to individual and collective self-defense, toughening punishment for crimes and for involvement in organized crimes. In the current situation, a humane attitude to criminals at their victims' expense is at best out of place. I mean the decree on amnesty. Society will challenge such a decree and will be quite right, stated Gaydar.
