Amidst the expectations for Japan's contribution and with the vistas of space transportation in the coming 21st century, Rocket System, a company whose main business is launch services, is getting ready to function at the full capacity at which it was designed to function. The following is our interview with Mr. Takaki Yamada, the president of Rocket System. NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: It has been a long time since you were involved in rocket development as a civilian, when you were still with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. How do you feel now that the H-2 is successfully launched? Yamada: I was thrilled with it. Ever since the project started some dozens of years ago, we have been determined to produce the best in the world. Everyone from NASDA and the private companies involved in the project faced challenges in every area of cost, manufacturing technology, quality, and product performance, and we had to remove difficulties one by one to get to this point. The rocket prior to the H-2 included American designs, but the H-2 is exclusively made in Japan, all the way from design and manufacture to various tests. I am sure everyone must have felt a great relief with the success this time. It is impossible for me to express my feelings and emotions with words. Practically speaking, the launch not only marks this year as the year of birth for our company, but, I think it also marks the beginning of the space age for Japan. NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: The advanced countries of the world in terms of space development are already actively involved in the commercialization of the space activities. Can we expect the same thing to happen in Japan? Yamada: Satellites are closely tied to our daily lives in the areas of communications, broadcasting, meteorological observation, etc. Earth observation satellites play a major role in global environmental protection as well. Geodetic satellites, maritime navigational satellites, global position sensing satellites, etc., are ready to be used in many fields. Also, the manufacture of new industrial materials and medicines in the high-vacuum microgravity environment is attracting people's attention, so that these fields will increasingly create a need for launch vehicles. The two major fields of commercial utilization of space are communications and broadcasting. In addition, space stations will be operational by the end of this century. I believe that launch services will be more and more active in the future. NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Japan's presence in the space field will grow bigger, won't it? Yamada: The global point of view is necessary for us, since what Japan seeks in space exploration -- which carries the immense dreams of mankind and holds boundless potential -- is the happiness of mankind as a whole. Thus, it is important for us to cooperate with all the advanced countries of the world in space development -- i.e., with the United States, Europe, Russia and China -- in advancing the horizons of space. What comes to our mind first when we talk about the space business is the competition between countries, but the important thing for us to do is to cooperate first; the competition may come in the next phase. We have to look at space from the standpoint of how we can efficiently utilize it for the happiness of mankind, and how to make it contribute to earth's environment. NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: We understand that many launches are scheduled, but what are the pending issues? Yamada: Launching requires a huge investment; it involves a big risk as well. Therefore, it is practically impossible to redo it; an extremely high degree of reliability is a must. A continuous effort to improve technology is indispensable. Another thing is the cost. For the time being, launches are supported by the national budget, and because of that, we cannot afford to launch more than a few times a year. However, the cost will not come down unless we increase the frequency. Therefore, participation in the space market is quite important. NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Any other issues you wish to discuss? Yamada: We launch once in the spring and once in the autumn, with the cooperation of local people. In order to increase the frequency of the launches, we must have a more extensive negotiation with the local people in order to improve the launch environment. There is no question that we, the local people, have to buy in, but we must also discuss the issue from a broader point of view -- how to utilize space for the benefit of mankind and how Japan should contribute to it in the international sense. A serious issue for our company itself is how to achieve a cost reduction. A cost reduction is essential in improving the usage rate. If we can lower the cost 30 percent from the current level, or even 50 percent, we can increase the demand substantially. I believe that we can reduce the cost if we combine everyone's wisdom. We will seek the means of cost reduction in both hardware and software areas, including production control, quality control, and technology control. The company has a great responsibility in getting access to the world, the future, and space, and we wish to play an important role in the great progress of the space industry. [Boxed item] Sketch of Rocket System Rocket System is a private company that provides launch services for commercial satellites with the H-2 launch vehicle, developed by NASDA. It was established in July 1990 with investments from major space-related companies, including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries, Nissan Motor, and NEC. Its paid-in capital is Â¥484 million, and it employs about 40 people. Its principal function is to take the technological assets created by the R&D activities of NASDA and the companies involved in the development of the H-2 launch vehicle and develop them into a commercial business. Rocket System will provide a complete set of services that are based on the H-2 and the TR-1 test rocket and that range from quality assurance, production control, and sales to the launch services themselves. As for the launch itself, Rocket System subcontracts NASDA, which has a lot of experience. Launch services in other countries consist essentially of the commercial launches of satellites, and Japan intends to enter that business market, knowing that it is a late-comer.
