SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Chapter 19 of the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement (``Agreement'') establishes a mechanism to replace domestic judicial review of final determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty cases involving imports from the other country with review by independent binational panels. When a Request for Panel Review is filed, a panel is established to act in place of national courts to review expeditiously the final determination to determine whether it conforms with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of the country that made the determination. Under Article 1904 of the Agreement, which came into force on January 1, 1989, the Government of the United States and the Government of Canada established Rules of Procedure for Article 1904 Binational Panel Reviews (``Rules''). These Rules were published in the Federal Register on December 30, 1988 (53 FR 53212). The Rules were amended by Amendments to the Rules of Procedure for Article 1904 Binational Panel Reviews, published in the Federal Register on December 27, 1989 (54 FR 53165). The Rules were further amended and a consolidated version of the amended Rules was published in the Federal Register on June 15, 1992 (57 FR 26698). The panel review in this matter was conducted in accordance with these Rules. Background On August 16, 1993, the Binational Panel remanded the final determination to the Department of Commerce for action not inconsistent with the Panel's decision as follows: Commerce was asked to reconsider the exercise of its statutory discretion as to whether its disproportionality analysis should be conducted on an enterprise or industry basis, and provide the Panel a cogent explanation why it exercised its discretion in a given manner; and Concerning the appropriate allocation period for grants given to Norsk Hydro for the purchase of pollution control equipment, Commerce was asked to consider the IRS tables and the producer records, in a manner that satisfies the standard articulated in the IPSCO case of ``an allocation period which will accurately reflect the commercial and competitive benefit received by the plaintiffs in this case,'' and to provide a satisfactory explanation for its reasoning in support of whatever decision it reaches. On September 15, 1993, the Department of Commerce issued its Redetermination on Remand. Panel Decision On December 14, 1993, the Panel affirmed the redetermination in all respects. Dated: January 18, 1994. James R. Holbein, United States Secretary, FTA Binational Secretariat. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;1774 Filed 1&hyph;26&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;GT&hyph;M
