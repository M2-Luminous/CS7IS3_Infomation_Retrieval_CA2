Japan's trade partners then take action out of irritation, and Japan reacts in excessive surprise. This is a repeat of Japanese history. In the 1930's and 1940's, the United States and Europe frequently issued warnings against Japanese attempts to expand its influence to the Chinese mainland and Southeast Asia. The United States frequently sent signals to Japan warning that if Tokyo sent troops to Indochina, it would cut oil exports to Japan. For Japan at the time, the United States was its greatest source of oil. When the United States decided to ban oil exports to Japan, the decision took the Foreign Ministry, the Army, and the Navy by surprise. This is a good example of how Japan was insensitive to the reactions of foreign nations. The Nikkei average stock price plunged following the breakdown of the latest Japan-U.S. summit talks. U.S. sanctions against Japan are supposed to weaken the yen, but speculation that the Clinton administration hopes for a strong yen resulted in a sharp rise in the yen's exchange rate against the dollar, disrupting the foreign exchange market. This year the United States will hold an off-year election, and the U.S. Congress is deluged with bills for retaliation against Japan. President Clinton, who prefers reality to ideology, is about to lean toward a policy favored by Congress. Claiming the Japanese mobile phone market is closed, U.S. Trade Representative Kantor has already made clear the United States will impose high tariffs on Japanese manufactured goods. Excessive Reaction Prohibited Looking back, there was a time considered to be a watershed in Japanese history. Japan, which said "no" to U.S. demands for opening the Japanese market through numerical targets, now stands at another watershed. Japan, which said "no" to demands by Europe and the United States to open China's northeast region (Manchuria), began following a path of isolation after withdrawing from the League of Nations. Foreign Minister Matsuoka and the Japanese delegation which defiantly walked out of the conference room of the League of Nations received thunderous applause in nationalism-ridden Japan. There is no need to take seriously the current trouble between Japan and the United States because it is within the framework of security arrangements. But there are fears that the trouble, though small in stature, will repeat the pattern of excessive reaction. The fear cannot be ruled out that the economic friction between the two countries will develop into political distrust, thus hollowing our alliance. Japan follows the path of self-reform based on its own yardstick. At a meeting with President Clinton, Prime Minister Hosokawa viewed numerical targets as managed trade and rejected them. He made a correct decision at the meeting. If Japan accepts numerical targets, it is tantamount to acknowledging Japan is a special nation where the bureaucracy reigns. However, the question concerns the course which led up to the breakdown of Japan-U.S. framework talks. First, we believe policymakers and ordinary people were too insensitive to the existence of $130 billion in Japanese surplus. The surplus is a transfer of purchasing power. If one is indifferent to the continuation of the surplus for many years, he is not believed to have a normal nerve. Ministry of Finance and other Japanese Government officials who stick to the "logic of finance" have missed a chance to expand Japan's domestic demand. Their attitude reminds us of the behavior of the Japanese Army which stuck to the "defense of Manchuria to the last." Second, we wonder whether Japan is qualified to openly assert the market economy while opposing managed trade. The number of bureaucratic regulations shows no signs of shrinking despite administrative reform. The administration abuses the authority to issue certifications, licenses, and subsidies to intervene and threaten local governments as well as the private sector. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is in a situation where it asks economic organizations to comment on this and that. In the eyes of Americans, Japan is a nation where mammoths live that cannot be tamed by ordinary rules. The only way to have the mammoth buy goods is for foreign exporters to become ordinary animals or use the purchasing power of the mammoth. The U.S. Government probably feels it has chosen the latter. The U.S. Government distrusts Japan, saying the mammoth cannot easily become an ordinary animal and has no intention of becoming one. Unfortunately, we feel there is no strong leadership in the White House nor in Japan. The shortsightedness of staffers assisting the President is conspicuous. They seek only quick credit and show no willingness to objectively appraise the 15-trillion-yen stimulus package--the largest ever--on which Japan has belatedly decided. Stand on Market Mechanism To break the deadlock in Japan-U.S. relations, Japan should endure some pain, establish its own yardstick, and achieve self-reliance. Japan can attack other nations with its yardstick because it is a double-edged sword, and thus can also cut itself in reaction. If Japan does not accept the U.S. demand for settling numerical targets, it should make transparent its market activities at home and abroad, and the bureaucracy's intervention should be excluded. If the United States continues to demand managed trade and imposes a series of sanctions on Japan, we believe Japan needs to have a firm resolve to counter them. If the United States imposes sanctions on Japan, Japan should take its case to GATT and wait for the judgment of international opinion. In that incidence, the United States would lose the status of free trade champion, and Japan may become the champion of free trade in place of the United States. U.S. sanctions against Japan could deal a blow to Japanese enterprises, but those who would ultimately pay the price would be American consumers who are forced to buy high-priced goods and suffer from a shortage of goods. A weak dollar would be responsible for increasing the prices of imported goods and fueling inflation in the United States. In the United States, a substantial number of Americans have criticized the Clinton government for taking a tough trade stance toward Japan. There is no doubt the more Japan deals calmly with U.S. trade demands without displaying emotional reaction, the more the criticism will grow.
