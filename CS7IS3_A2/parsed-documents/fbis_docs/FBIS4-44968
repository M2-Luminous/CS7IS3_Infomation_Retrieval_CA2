Construction of the building cost more than 140 million Saudi riyals [SR] ($37 million) and took six months, and the building occupies a total area of 36,000 square meters. It consists of six towers that are connected to a series of roads and other buildings. Each tower is six stories high, and the building has parking areas and is equipped with the latest in communications technology, office equipment, computers, and informational technology. The building is built in the style typical of the province of 'Asir and its capital city Abha. AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that the estimated total expenditures for the building and its annexes was about SR310 million. The total was this high because it was necessary to compensate the owners of the real estate adjacent to the building, to prepare the ground surrounding this area, and to increase the surrounding planted green-belt area. The office of Engineer Ziyad Zaydan supervised the implementation of the project and worked on its architectural designs. The firm that implemented the project was the al- Buraydi Commercial and Contracting Corporation, and the project's cost was SR80 million. The inside furnishing and equipping of the building was done by the two firms Bayt al-Riyad and Kawkash [name as transliterated], which were paid SR40 million for the job. The design of the building incorporated a new architectural concept that is in keeping with Saudi Arabia's distinctive heritage and that has the ability to develop and change from the architectural point of view in accordance with future needs. The complex consists of two parts--the provincial government building and the building housing the principal auditorium for meetings. The latter contains amphitheaters planted with thick greenery in the form of a series of rising planted amphitheaters, and it also has a reflecting pool and several water fountains. The total area of the province of 'Asir is 40,000 square km, and the province has a total of about 700,000 inhabitants. The city of Abha is located on a mountainous highland near the Red Sea in the southern part of Saudi Arabia, it has a distinctive climate, it is small and is characterized by a quiet life, and it has many beautiful natural views. Abha is a rather densely-packed city, is located in a saucer-shaped elevation, and is surrounded by mountains and a green area, and there are many winding streets and roads both inside the city and on the sides of the highland area.
