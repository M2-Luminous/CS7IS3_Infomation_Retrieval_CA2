Metaoui: "Security Centers: First Release of Detainees"--first paragraph is EL WATAN introduction] [Text] The first detainees from the security centers in the south of the country were released yesterday from the Ain-M'Guel camp (80 km from Tamanrasset), we learned from reliable sources. The 50 or so individuals were put on an airplane. Thus, the appeasement measures announced last week by the spokesman for the National Dialogue Commission (CDN), concerning precisely the release of administrative detainees in the south and the lifting of house arrests, are beginning to be applied. According to the president of the National Human Rights Observatory (ONDH), Mr. Rezag Bara, there are 780 detainees in centers in the south. This figure is disputed by Mr. Yahia Adennour, president of the Algerian League for the Defense of Human Rights [LADDH], who estimates the number of "internees" at about 994 (600 at Ain-M'Guel and 394 at Oued-Namous in the Bechar governorate). He also claims that there is a third center in the Ouargla governorate, where "detainees are sorted out." In a communique released on 13 December 1993, the LADDH observed that about 10,000 individuals had been interned "without due process, since the interruption of the electoral process." At a press conference held at the end of October, the justice minister, Mr. Teguia, announced that security centers "had been closed." He said that the number of detainees never exceeded 5,000 (when the centers were set up). Yesterday's release will be followed by others, we also learned. However, it is not known whether all those detained in these centers will be released. The CND spokesman mentioned the release "of a first group of detainees." Some of these individuals are expected to have to answer for their actions in court (in theory, the Special Courts). Three hundred cases are said to have been referred to civil courts. As far as house arrests are concerned (which, as is known, are administrative measures taken by the Ministry of Interior) we learned that they affected some 100 individuals. These include in particular militants of the former FIS [Islamic Salvation Front], the SIT [Islamic Labor Union], and certain associations close to Abassi Madani's party. Hamas [Movement of Islamic Society] militants residing around Constantine and Ouargla are also said to be under house arrest. We should also mention that, according to sources close to his lawyers, Ali Belhadj, another leader of the former FIS, was just transferred from the Tizi-Ouzou prison to a secret location.
