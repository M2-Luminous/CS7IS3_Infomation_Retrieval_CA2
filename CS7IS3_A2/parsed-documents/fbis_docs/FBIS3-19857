[Rexrodt] As a result of the companies' efforts to trim production processes and of the slimming down of the economy, even more jobs may be abolished. That is why it is so important to break up the structures of the labor market: more flexibility, more part-time work. In 1995 at the latest, we will lastingly undercut the 4-million mark in unemployment. [Hoeren] Where are the new jobs supposed to come from? [Rexrodt] The greatest reserves exist in the service sector. If we give services to people a higher social standing again, there will be a labor boom in this field. [Hoeren] The Bonn government has repeatedly cut back social benefits. When will it finally be the turn of the big ones? [Rexrodt] We are working on a complete restructuring of the current system of subsidies: In the future, subsidies are to be generally granted only for a specific period. I am thinking of a period of five years. In addition, the state subsidies are to be reduced in certain steps within this period. We must also come to a regulation that state subsidies must be repaid on principle as soon as the company's economic situation has improved again. [passage omitted]
