Asked about the president's response to Shakhray's ideas he said Yeltsin promised to think them over. Shakhray did not have reasons to believe that the resignation would not be accepted. After resignation he is planning to concentrate on his work in the State Duma and the strengthening of local branches of his Party of Russian Unity and Accord. Shakhray is also convinced that his resignation will not have "avalanche consequences" for other members of his party in the cabinet: the Minister of Economy Aleksandr Shokhin, the Minister of Labor Gennadiy Melikyan and the Minister of Justice Yuriy Kalmykov. According to Shakhray, Russia is now at a crossroads, like a legendary Russian warrior having to choose one of three roads: to chaos, to transformation into a police state or to the formation of a full-fledged federation with broad rights of local government bodies. To make the last option a reality several fundamental steps should be taken. Firstly, Shakhray thinks the president and prime minister should start playing the part of arbiters in society. Secondly, the hard core of a confederation should be formed in the framework of the CIS so that the process is not led by such extremists as Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. Thirdly, Russia should start truly protecting the rights and interests of Russians in former Soviet republics. In the fourth place, Shakhray is convinced, "basic order should be restored" and spending on the government machinery reduced. In the fifth place, crime should be resolutely combatted. In the sixth place, a common national idea should be worked out. In Shakhray's opinion this should be the idea of reviving Russia. If the authorities remain inactive and fail to achieve political accord and resolve the problem of mutual debts in the economy, Shakhray predicts developments "according to the gloomiest script". Here is his vision of this script. In July there will be mass strikes and unrest among work collectives, primarily in the defence industry. This, according to Shakhray, can lead to the resignation of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in August. The situation can be such that Chernomyrdin will have to go himself in order to ease the social tension. In this case Shakhray named as possible candidates to the post the Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov, Deputy Prime- Minister Oleg Soskovets and the Chairman of the Federation of Manufacturers Yuriy Skokov. However, Shakhray foresees great difficulties with the approval of any of these candidates by the Duma. This can lead to calls for the dissolution of the lower house of parliament. In such circumstances the Council of the Federation could become opposed to the president. As a result the situation in October could be similar to the one in October 1993. Shakhray also thinks that Chernomyrdin can keep his cabinet unchanged only if he manages to resolve the problem of mutual debts. He went on to say that he sympathizes with the head of government adding that he did not have any conflicts with either Chernomyrdin or Yeltsin.
