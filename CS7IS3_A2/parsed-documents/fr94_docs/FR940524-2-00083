FR940524-2-00083 FR940524-2-00051 Index Option Trading: The Exchange proposes to base trading in options on the Index on the full value of the Index as expressed in U.S. dollars. The Exchange also may provide for the listing of full-value, long-term options series (``LEAPS'') and reduced-value LEAPS on the Index. For reduced-value LEAPS, the underlying value would be computed at one-tenth of the value of the Index. The current and closing index value of any such reduced-value LEAP will, after such initial computation, be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth. The trading hours for options on the Index will be from 8 a.m. to 3:15 p.m., Chicago time. Because the TSE does not operate during the Exchange's trading hours, the Exchange will disseminate the value of the Index based on the most recent closing value of the Index. Exercise and Settlement: The proposed options on the Index will expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month. Thus, trading in the expiring contract month will normally cease on a Thursday at 3:15 p.m., Chicago time, unless a holiday occurs. The exercise settlement value of Index options at expiration will be determined at the close of the regular Friday trading sessions in Japan, ordinarily at 3 p.m., Tokyo time. If a stock does not trade during this interval or if it fails to open for trading, the last available price of the stock will be used in the calculation of the Index. When option expiration dates are changed in accordance with Exchange holidays, such as when the CBOE is closed on the Friday before expiration, the last trading day for expiring options will be Wednesday and the exercise settlement value of the Index will be determined at the close of the regular Thursday trading sessions in Japan even if the Japanese markets are open on Friday. If the Japanese markets will be closed on the Friday before expiration but the CBOE will not, the last trading day for expiring options will be Wednesday. Surveillance Agreements: The Exchange expects to apply its existing index options surveillance procedures to Index options. The Exchange is pursuing market surveillance agreements with the Japanese Ministry of Finance and the TSE. These agreements will enable the Exchange to carry out its regulatory responsibilities with respect to the surveillance of trading in the stocks comprising the Index. Position Limits: The Exchange is proposing to establish position limits for Nikkei 300 Index options equal to 50,000 contracts on the same side of the market, with no more than 30,000 contracts in the series with the nearest expiration date. Ten reduced-value options will equal one full-value contract for such purposes. Exchange Rules Applicable: Except as modified herein, the Rules in Chapter XXIV will be applicable to Nikkei 300 Index options. CBOE has represented that it has the necessary systems capacity to support new series that would result from the introduction of Nikkei 300 Index options. The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it will permit trading in options based on the Nikkei Stock Index 300 pursuant to rules designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to promote just and equitable principals of trade, and thereby will provide investors with the ability to invest in options based on an additional index. (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition. (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants, or Others No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will: (a) By order approve such proposed rule change, or (b) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC.
