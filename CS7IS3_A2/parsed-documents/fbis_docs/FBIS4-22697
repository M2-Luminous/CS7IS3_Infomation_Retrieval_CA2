Ibragimov; place and date not given: "Who Needs Trade Unions? The Opinion of Chairman of the Tatar Republic Trade Union Council Farida Gaynullina"] [Text] [Ibragimov] The fourth agreement between the Trade Union Council of the republic, the Cabinet of Ministers, and the Association of State Enterprises of the republic was signed recently. Is the current agreement fundamentally different from previous ones? [Gaynullina] The range of coverage of problems reflected in agreements keeps growing and getting more specific year by year. For example, this year the consumer budget became 1,200 rubles [R] weightier: We succeeded in incorporating the services of baths and laundry facilities in it. A notion such as the price of unskilled labor appeared in the law on the minimum wage; this makes it possible to set the rate of Category I above the minimum wage. It is envisioned to ensure social protection for young people, women, and working people in certain sectors (the agro-industrial complex, the military-industrial complex, the sphere financed from the budget), and to reinforce and develop a system for amelioration of the law which would bring together various regulatory provisions touching on the rights of the people. The second reason is found in the area of politics: There have been attempts to belittle our role in society. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that in the process of privatization, some employers try to reduce our rights in the collectives to zero. All this prompts us to look for a legal avenue of protection. [Ibragimov] Perhaps the law did not have only supporters? [Gaynullina] No intense opponents came along. However, we had to fight for certain articles. For example, one article was not received well; there was a lack of understanding on the part of some deputies, associated with registration. Various norms are codified with regard to public organizations. According to some proposals, registration is not envisioned, whereas according to others it is mandatory. Registration of trade unions is forbidden according to international norms and legislation in effect. There are various versions. We propose to submit copies of the charter documentation as a notice. [Ibragimov] Does the new draft law include the right to form independent trade unions? [Gaynullina] I think this is behind us. To be sure, there is the Yedineniye in Chelny which has about 1,500 members in its ranks. However, such a right is included; various principles of trade union formation are envisioned. [Ibragimov] As you see it, what are the drawbacks of the new law? [Gaynullina] I do not at all think that the law is perfect. At present, it is being revised by a Supreme Soviet commission for acceptance in the second reading. This will be the law of the transition period, and it reflects today's realities. [Ibragimov] Despite all the difficulties, the number of nonstate enterprises is increasing. It is common knowledge that they do not have trade unions. [Gaynullina] Moreover, giving up trade union membership is, unfortunately, one of the conditions for hiring at some commercial enterprises. People are deprived of the right to protect their interests before the employer. We have already encountered such complaints in conjunction with illegal dismissals. We had to interfere for purely humane considerations. Women end up being deprived of their rights more often. There have been cases of work-related accidents, even fatalities. A certain amount of arbitrariness is felt. This issue was considered specifically at a recent plenum of the republic council devoted to occupational safety. Taking advantage of this occasion, I call on the employees of commercial enterprises to unite--it is easier to protect your rights in this way. [Ibragimov] Many people are criticizing the policy of privatization pursued in the city and the republic. Thus, recently the sociopolitical movement "Economic Breakthrough--Third Force" (for now, the only one to do so) expressed its opposition to the privatization program by way of putting leaflets on the stairways of houses. What is the position of trade unions on this issue? As I see it, this is something that merits consideration. [Gaynullina] Unfortunately it is impossible to think up an ideal version. Procedures for the privatization of housing contain elements of social injustice. Some have managed to obtain free housing while others have not. At present, the social norm comes to 16.2 square meters of housing per capita. It would be fairer if an additional fee to benefit those who do not have housing were collected when floor space above the established norm is privatized. Procedures for the privatization of enterprises on the first model also cause some concern; to my mind, they encroach upon the economic interests of labor collectives. However, we should also be mindful of employees in the sector financed from the budget. [Ibragimov] There has been talk in the corridors of power about providing compensation payments for employees of enterprises who are forced to work short work days or weeks. [Gaynullina] The draft decree is ready. We have familiarized ourselves with it and made our proposals. A source of funding has also been found: For the most part, compensation to those putting in short work weeks will be paid out of the employment fund, and partially from the republic budget. We think that the decree will be signed shortly.
