According to Akhsarbek Galazov, "the meeting was fruitful. I told the Russian president about the situation in the zone under the state of emergency regime, and the concrete steps being made by the leadership of North Ossetia on the settlement of the situation in the zone of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict. The road to peace and accord in the region lies only through negotiations, and these goals cannot be achieved by forcible methods." North Ossetian leaders also discussed issues connected with the celebration of the 220th anniversary of Ossetia joining Russia and the 210th anniversary of the foundation of the city of Vladikavkaz. The president of North Ossetia proposed within the framework of these celebrations to organize in Vladikavkaz a meeting of all leaders of the Caucasian region with the participation of the president of the Russian Federation and the head of the Russian government during which it would be possible to consider socio-political, economic and inter-ethnic problems, as well as the roads to peace and accord in the region. During his talks with President Boris Yeltsin, Akhsarbek Galazov stressed, the two sides also touched on the problem of signing a full-scale treaty between the Russian Federation and the Republic of North Ossetia. This would give the possibility to settle social and economic problems of North Ossetia more purposively.
