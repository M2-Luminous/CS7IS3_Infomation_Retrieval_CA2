The meeting came to the conclusion, Ivan Plyushch said, that the president and government should find sources for financing "a sensible number" of the armed forces of Ukraine. In connection with this a number of measures have been elaborated which will allow the number of personnel to be reduced by almost 100,000 persons and it is planned to conduct a substantial inventory of military property. After this the president and government will present proposals to parliament regarding the financing of defense expenditure. This point was included in the Supreme Council resolution on implementation of the law on the state budget for 1994. Despite many protests by people's deputies against the tax which, in accordance with Article 23 of the state budget, will be imposed on corporate and physical entities for each page of written appeals to bodies of executive and legislative authority, the article was not withdrawn from the adopted document. In accordance with a proposal by Andriy Pecherov, chairman of the commission for issues of planning, budget, finances, and prices, Article 23 will be put into practice by a separate legislative act. The calls by some deputies not to grant subventions to the Republic of Crimea until the legislation of that autonomous region is brought into line with the laws of Ukraine were not supported. Following the adoption of the Supreme Council resolution on implementation of the law on the state budget for 1994, which envisions it being reconfirmed every quarter, the question of submitting to a Ukraine-wide referendum the fundamental constitutional provisions on the organization of state authority and [local] self-government in Ukraine was presented for discussion. The latest version of the document was subjected to harsh criticism. After an hour's discussion not a single decision was made. The Supreme Council will continue its work 2 February.
