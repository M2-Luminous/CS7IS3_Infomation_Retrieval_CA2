Coming up are excerpts from this interview. The first question asked by the Slovene Radio and TV reporter was: What is the current situation in the battlefields? You have recently toured the front lines. Delic replied: [Second announcer] As a matter of fact, I am almost constantly touring the frontlines because that is the only way to be in command and in charge of your units. This is not merely a matter of visiting confrontation lines. This is rather a matter of gaining an insight into the situation and of carrying out the orders and decisions I issue on behalf of my general staff to the units under my command. We should say we expected that this signed cease-fire might hold in combination with those demands we had raised as a condition for our signing it -- that is, that the problem of Gorazde ought to be resolved, that the NATO ultimatum and UN Security Council resolutions are carried out and that the Serb aggressor's combat operations in other areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina should come to an end. What we are finding on the ground, though, indicates that these fundamental demands have not been honored and this in itself means that no basic conditions have been created for this agreement to come into being. We were ready, we had prepared maps, we had specified locations for liaison officers' observation points. The Serb side, however, did not accept this. [First announcer] He stated that this failure to comply with the cease-fire was yet another reason for the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the Croat Defence Council [HVO] to maintain their combat preparedness at an increased level. There was also a question about new weapons. Asked whether weapons were finding their way to Bosnia-Herzegovina and if so, how, General Delic said: [Second announcer] Apart from what has been captured from the enemy, one should say that most of the weapons, including those shown on TV, have come out of Bosnia-Herzegovina's factories. These are the main sources of our weapon supplies, as the embargo is after all being implemented as regards the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army as opposed to the other countries of the former Yugoslavia. Peace would come sooner if there were no embargo despite the fact that many are saying that the opposite would take place. If there were a balance of weapons and if the Serb aggressor were to start suffering defeats, that would force him to change his policy or to replace the people who have bloodied their hands as he would want to have this problem solved. [First announcer] One of the questions was how the joint headquarters of the army and the HVO is operating. General Delic said: [Second announcer] It ought to be said that the joint headquarters has not been set up [5-second transmission break] cannot order. The essence and the aim of this joint headquarters is to speed up the resolving of the remaining issues and further issues in the relations between the army and the HVO and to seek solutions. In other words, this is a coordinating body which suggests solutions in these spheres. The intention behind the establishment of this headquarters and new bodies within the joint headquarters was to gradually create a joint, unified command body of the federation's future army. [First presenter] The next question was: Do you believe that there will be no more clashes between the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the HVO? [Second announcer] It is logical to believe that they should not take place,as all political conditions have been created for sorting out things on the ground in the way they should be sorted out, to the satisfaction of both peoples. I personally think there is no reason for such a clash. Hence, our shared goal is to fight the Serbian aggressor. [First announcer] The last question: Every war has its own logic, its roots, its beginning , its culmination and, of course, its end. Which stage has the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina reached? General Delic said: [Second announcer] In terms of balance of powers, I personally think that the war has reached its peak. I believe that the Serbian aggressor has no longer the potential to reinforce its ranks. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army has the strength to embark on the liberating phase of armed struggle. This is, of course, a simplified view as it does not take account of international factors and their influence on the armed struggle in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This has hitherto been a very important element. In any case, in my opinion, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army has finished the defensive phase of war and is now entering the phase of war for liberation. Anyway, preconditions have been created for pressing ahead. Obviously, this renders the Serbian aggressor impatient in a sense as this creates pressure for finding a solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina as soon as possible -- hence, everything they have occupied by force and aggression in Bosnia-Herzegovina may come under threat, Army General Rasim Delic, chief of staff of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, said at the end of the interview with Slovenia Radio and TV.
