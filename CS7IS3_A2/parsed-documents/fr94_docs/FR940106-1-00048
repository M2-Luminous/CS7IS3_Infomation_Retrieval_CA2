FR940106-1-00048 FR940106-1-00011 Pursuant to its obligations under section 303(c)(3) of the Act, EPA reviewed the 1978 Delta Plan in 1980. While EPA approved the Plan, it was concerned that the 1978 Delta Plan standards would not provide adequate protection of striped bass and the estuary's fishery resources. EPA therefore conditioned its approval upon a set of ``interpretations'' of the standards, including commitments by the State Board to review and revise the 1978 Delta Plan standards immediately if there were measurable adverse impacts on striped bass spawning, or if necessary to attain ``without project'' levels of protection for the striped bass (as defined by an SBI value of 79). EPA also conditioned its approval on the State Board's commitment to develop additional criteria to protect aquatic life and tidal wetlands in and surrounding the Suisun Marsh. The State Board concurred with these interpretations in its letter to EPA dated November 21, 1980. In the years since the 1978 Delta Plan was adopted, these standards have not accomplished the intended goal of maintaining the SBI at a long term average of 79, the 1978 Delta Plan's estimate of ``without project'' levels. Indeed, during the 1980's, the SBI averaged approximately 7.5, and in 1983 and 1985 reached all-time lows of 1.2 and 2.2. Some of the decline in the SBI may be attributable to drought conditions in the late 1970's and again in the late 1980's. However, the highest SBI values actually attained since the 1978 Delta Plan was adopted were only in the teens and 20's, a substantial shortfall from the stated goal of 79. The precipitous decline in striped bass is indicative of the poor health of other aquatic resources in the estuary. Several species have experienced similar declines, including chinook salmon (the winter-run of chinook salmon is listed as a threatened species under the ESA, and is currently proposed for reclassification as endangered), Delta smelt (recently listed as a threatened species under the ESA) and Sacramento splittail and longfin smelt (both the subject of a recent petition for listing as endangered species). The California Department of Fish and Game (California DFG) recently testified that virtually all of the estuary's major fish species are in clear decline. (CDFG 1992b, WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;8) 2 2 If a reference was presented to the State Board during one of its hearings, this preamble will present citations in both the standard scientific form and in the State Board hearing record form. Accordingly, the eighth exhibit submitted by California DFG at the Board's interim water rights hearings in the summer of 1992 is cited as indicated. As fishery resources continued to decline, EPA on several occasions expressed its concern to the State Board about the need for standards to adequately protect these resources. Throughout the first and second triennial reviews ending in 1981 and 1985, EPA urged the State Board to review and revise the 1978 Delta Plan in accordance with EPA's 1980 approval letter. At the conclusion of each triennial review, the State Board made no changes. After its second triennial review, in a letter to EPA dated June 23, 1986, the State Board acknowledged that the 1978 Delta Plan standards were not adequate to protect the estuary's fishery resources. It then outlined the hearing process it was planning for revising the standards. In response, and as part of its consideration of the State Board's second triennial review, EPA, on June 29, 1987, sent a letter to the State Board stating that EPA could no longer approve the striped bass survival standards (or the related provision allowing relaxation of the spawning standard in drier years) because these standards did not adequately protect the designated uses. EPA recognized, however, that the State Board had initiated new hearings to revise the 1978 Delta Plan standards. EPA therefore indicated that it would await the results of the new hearings and approve or disapprove the revised standards after the State Board's submission to EPA of a complete set of revised standards. In addition to EPA's review under the CWA, the 1978 Delta Plan also received intense scrutiny under state law in California state court. This review culminated in a state appellate decision, United States, et. al. v. State Water Resources Control Board, 182 Cal. App. 2d 82 (1st Dist., 1986) (known as the ``Racanelli Decision'' after its author, Judge John T. Racanelli). Among that decision's many holdings was the conclusion that the 1978 Delta Plan's water quality standards had been impermissibly limited to those standards that could be enforced against only the SWP and CVP (instead of against all water users). The court took notice that the State Board had proposed hearings to develop revisions to the 1978 Delta Plan, and asked the State Board to remedy the Plan's shortcomings in those hearings.
