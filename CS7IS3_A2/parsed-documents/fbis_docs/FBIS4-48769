The circular was sent to directors-general of provincial departments on Tuesday. Mr Mhlaba said numerous complaints by civil servants had been received by his office and he noted them with sympathy, concern and appreciation. Committees to be nominated by the various political parties would deal with all grievances and imbalances. Until then: -- no new appointments or re-appointments would be made; -- no further promotions would be effected directly or indirectly; -- no improvement of remuneration or conditions of service would be processed, whether for parity purposesor not; and -- no contractual agreements would be made, unless money had been budgeted and contracts already negotiated. Such contracts had to be discussed with the relevant MEC [Member Executive council] before submission to the Executive Council. Mr Mhlaba said the former public service commissions of Transkei and Ciskei should compile a list of grievances to facilitate the work of the committees. He called on civil servants to desist from work stoppages, go-slows, strikes or withholding their best service. He said the circular had been issued to curb an unprecedented high rate of recurrent expenditure in the province. The curbs would be lifted when normality returned to the civil service.
