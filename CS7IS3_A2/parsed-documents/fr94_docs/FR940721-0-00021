FR940721-0-00021 FR940721-0-00009 This action will have no economic impacts other than a one-time cost related to the test fixture, for those manufacturers choosing the new procedure. In particular, they would have to add pneumatic or hydraulic rams to their test set-up. It is estimated that there would be a one-time set-up cost of $2,500. The test procedure would not require any design, retooling, or assembly changes. REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT: NHTSA has also considered the impacts of this final rule under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Vehicle manufacturers typically would not qualify as small entities. While some manufacturers of pedestal seats and seat belt attachments may be small entities, for the reasons stated above, NHTSA believes this final rule would not significantly affect them. The final rule will not affect the costs of pedestal seats, since the new procedure is optional. Because of this, small organizations and governmental units that purchase vehicles with pedestal seats should not be affected by this final rule. PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT: In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (P.L. 96&hyph;511), there are no requirements for information collection associated with this final rule. NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT: NHTSA has also analyzed this final rule under the National Environmental Policy Act and determined that it will not have a significant impact on the human environment. EXECUTIVE ORDER 12612 (FEDERALISM): Finally, NHTSA has analyzed this rule in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in E.O. 12612, and has determined that this rule will not have significant federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. CIVIL JUSTICE REFORM: This final rule does not have any retroactive effect. Under 49 U.S.C. 30103, whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a State may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance which is not identical to the Federal standard, except to the extent that the State requirement imposes a higher level of performance and applies only to vehicles procured for the State's use. 49 U.S.C. 30161 sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court. List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 571 Imports, Motor vehicle safety, Motor vehicles. In consideration of the foregoing, 49 CFR Part 571 is amended as follows: PART 571_FEDERAL MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY STANDARDS 1. The authority citation for Part 571 of Title 49 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. 322, 30111, 30115, 30117, and 30166; delegation of authority at 49 CFR 1.50. §571.207 [Amended] 2. Section 571.207 is amended by revising the heading of S3 and adding a new definition of `` Seat adjuster '' to S3 in alphabetical order; and by revising S4.2.1, and S5.1.1 to read as follows: §571.207 Standard No. 207, Seating Systems. * * * * * S3␣ Definitions. * * * * * Seat adjuster means the part of the seat that provides forward and rearward positioning of the seat bench and back, and/or rotation around a vertical axis, including any fixed portion, such as a seat track. In the case of a seat equipped with seat adjusters at different levels, the term means the uppermost seat adjuster. * * * * * 4.2.1␣ Seat adjustment. Except for vertical movement of nonlocking suspension type occupant seats in trucks or buses, each seat shall remain in its adjusted position when tested in accordance with the test procedures specified in S5. * * * * * S5.1.1␣ For a seat whose seat back and seat bench are attached to the vehicle by the same attachments. (a) For a seat whose seat back and seat bench are attached to the vehicle by the same attachments and whose height is adjustable, the loads are applied when the seat is in its highest adjustment position in accordance with the procedure or procedures specified in S5.1.1(a)(1), S5.1.1(a)(2), or S5.1.1(a)(3), as appropriate. (1) For a seat whose center of gravity is in a horizontal plane that is above the seat adjuster or that passes through any part of the adjuster, use, at the manufacturer's option, either S5.1.1(b) or, if physically possible, S5.1.1(c). (2) For a seat specified in S5.1.1(a)(1) for which it is not physically possible to follow the procedure in S5.1.1(c), use S5.1.1(b). (3) For a seat whose center of gravity is in a horizontal plane that is below the seat adjuster, use S5.1.1(c). (4) For all other seats whose seat back and seat bench are attached to the vehicle by the same attachments, use S5.1.1(b). (b) Secure a strut on each side of the seat from a point on the outside of the seat frame in the horizontal plane of the seat's center of gravity to a point on the frame as far forward as possible of the seat anchorages. Between the upper ends of the struts attach a rigid cross-member, in front of the seat back frame for rearward loading and behind the seat back frame for forward loading. Apply the force specified by S4.2(a) or S4.2(b) horizontally through the rigid cross-member as shown in Figure 1. (c) Find ``cg 1 ,'' the center of gravity of the portion of the seat that is above the lowest surface of the seat adjuster. On each side of the seat, secure a strut from a point on the outside of the seat frame in the horizontal plane of cg 1 to a point on the frame as far forward as possible of the seat adjusted position. Between the upper ends of the struts attach a rigid cross-member, in front of the seat back frame for rearward loading and behind the seat back frame for forward loading. Find ``cg 2 ,'' the center of gravity of the portion of the seat that is below the seat adjuster. Apply a force horizontally through cg 1 equal to 20 times the weight of the portion of the seat represented by cg 1 , and simultaneously apply a force horizontally through cg 2 equal to 20 times the weight of the portion of the seat represented by cg 2 . * * * * * Issued on July 15, 1994.
