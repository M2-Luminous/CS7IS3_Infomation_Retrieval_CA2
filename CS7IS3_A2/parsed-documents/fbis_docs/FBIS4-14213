FBIS4-14213 "drnes082_l_94008" FBIS-NES-94-082 Daily Report 27 Apr 1994 ISRAEL More on Defeat of Golan Bill More on Defeat of Golan Bill TA2704164794 Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew 1400 GMT 27 Apr 94 TA2704164794 Tel Aviv IDF Radio Hebrew BFN [Text] The Knesset today rejected the draft bills presented by NRP [National Religious Party] Knesset Member [MK] Yitzhaq Levi and Likud MK 'Uzi Landau on the Golan Heights by a majority of 57 to 47 votes. The draft bills sought to make any territorial concessions on the Golan Heights conditional on a parliamentary majority of at least 80 MK's. Our Knesset affairs correspondent Tamar Asalem reports: [Begin recording] [Asalem] MK Yitzhaq Levi presented his draft bill against the background of two remarks by the prime minister. The first asserted that a national referendum would be held prior to any withdrawal from the Golan Heights while the second referred to the evacuation of settlements. Levi said there was no official government decision on holding a national referendum and that Rabin could not be counted on to keep his promises. [Levi] The prime minister is the greatest retractor in Israel. No one goes back on his remarks as much as the prime minister. He immediately retracts every statement he makes. Every time he speaks he changes his mind. Therefore, I believe that he is worthy of this title. [Asalem] MK 'Uzi Landau continued the personal attack on Rabin. Landau caused a furor in the plenum when he read excerpts from 'Ezer Weizman's book about Rabin's collapse during his tenure as chief of staff and about how the collapse was passed off as a case of nicotine poisoning. The prime minister, Landau said, could not take pressure. [Landau] One cannot have confidence in him. He fails to keep his promises not because he does not want to -- he does -- but because he simply cannot. The prime minister breaks under pressure and has been suffering from chronic nicotine poisoning since 23 May 1967. [Asalem] Against this background, Landau said, the prime minister's promises could not be counted upon and the issue must be anchored in law. Minister Moshe Shahal, who replied on behalf of the government, called the personal attacks on Rabin ridiculous and said that these were the last-ditch efforts of pathetic individuals who had lost their political bearings. Moving on to the issue itself, Shahal said that the Golan Heights had never been consecrated by politicians, had not been occupied because it was holy land, and Israel's history had not begun on its basalt rocks. Shahal taunted opposition MK's, who have sought on several occasions to pass similar bills, by saying that in such historic times sitting on the opposition benches was not only frustrating but even tedious. The coalition's efforts to muster all possible support proved itself. SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim] also voted against the bills, which were defeated by a majority of 57 votes.
