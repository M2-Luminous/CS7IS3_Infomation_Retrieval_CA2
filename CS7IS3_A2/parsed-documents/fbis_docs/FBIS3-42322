The bouncers at the door, sporting Afghan caps and urban guerrilla outfits, beam at the turnout. The meeting, to discuss the Arab-Israel peace accord, has been called by the most influential of Britain's new radical Islamic groups, the Hizb-ut-Tahrir or Liberation Party. There is only a sprinkling of whites in the audience, mostly girlfriends and the cranks who turn up at every political meeting going. The evening kicks off with a warning from the platform against "the Jews, policemen and the spies present from the Western media." All eyes turn to the Guardian reporter sitting unveiled in the female section as the chairman says: "Don't speak to them." As the speeches get underway, the audience in the Essex town hall listens with rapt attention to a rambling three-hour outpouring of hatred of the West, Arab governments, Israel, democracy and any form of kafr or heathen authority. The teenagers eat every word. "It will be better for the Jews to become Muslims if they want to live in peace in tbe land of Muslims," says the party's deputy leader, Farid Qassim. In the daytime, Qassim works as a town planner, but at night he is teaching young Muslims about their "enemies." The Jews, he says, are the most powerful force in Britain. "Who signed the GATT agreement for Britain? Leon Brittan, a Jew. Who signed for the Americans? Another Jew." The audience jump from their seats, crying God is Great and shaking their fists. From the female section, a gloved hand goes up. Ilford-born Shazia, swathed in black, her face totally covered, asks how British Muslims can show their commitment to the jihad or holy war for which Qassim has called. "There is no such thing as British Muslims. There are only Muslims," he replies. The new radical parties, of which Hizb-ut-Tahrir is the fastest growing, are urging Britain's Muslims to think again about the ideals which have governed their lives for three generations. During those years, most have focused on securing economic prosperity, a place in society, while preserving their way of life. Now the radical groups are arguing against integration. They say that British Muslims are a part not of British society but of the Islamic ummah -- or world community -- and must be fully involved in the struggle against Western "oppression." Officials of the Commission for Racial Equality warn that the radical groups are planting a time bomb under harmony between Muslims and British society. The radicals are conducting a two-pronged offensive. They are challenging the managements of Britain's mosques by making humiliating public criticisms of the local imams' sermons. And Hizb-ut-Tahrir has taken over nearly all the Muslim student societies at London University colleges and campuses in other areas where Muslims form a large part of the community. This new fervour has a distinctly Middle Eastern flavour and has challenged the hold of Asian groups on militant circles. A number of the new groups have direct links with radical organisations fighting to overthrow Arab governments. According to one liberal Muslim journalist, Ehsan Massoud of Q News, Hizb-ut-Tahrir says Islam is the answer to all problems. "It is very attractive to young people, this pre-packaged Islam, particularly for those young Muslims who want to break out of the `biraderi' (clan) politics which dominate the society of their parents." Their challenge to the establishment occurs at a time when many young British Muslims are wondering about their future in a Europe which has allowed the massacre of thousands of Bosnian Muslims and the cancellation of Algerian democracy, and is now enforcing what they see as an inadequate peace formula on Palestinian Muslims. Such issues preoccupy liberals too. "We've been here for only 30 years, but the Bosnian Muslims have been in Europe for 500 years. They wanted to be Europeans. So what hopes are there for my future?" asked Massoud. Racial problems also harden support for the radical groups. "No matter how much I want to be British, I never will be because of my brown skin. I used to see everything as blacks versus whites, but now I see the struggle as Muslims against non-Muslims," said one Birmingham Muslim, a recent recruit to a radical organisation. A Birmingham psychiatrist, Dr Farouk Hashimi, said he believed the radical groups were providing many young Muslims with an identity. "Instead of rituals which they can learn at the mosque, the radical groups function as clubs, providing support, friendship. They give them an identity which British society hasn't." Islamic centres are proliferating. Most, particularly those centred around mosques, are harmless religious study circles and community groups, with links to local councils and British political parties. A recent study by Derby University turned up some 1,400 Islamic organisations operating in this country, but the academics believe that there may be as many as 4,000. Liberal Muslims say a climate of fear is growing in Britain's estimated 1,000 mosques as the fight for spiritual supremacy between liberals and radicals intensifies. Many imams and mosque officials say they feel besieged. Liberal imams say that when they refuse Hizb-ut-Tahrir permission to speak at their mosques, they become the target of campaigns by activists. One elderly imam from west London, who accompanied me to the Hizb-ut-Tahrir gathering, begged me not speak to him during the meeting. "You will get me into trouble with them and I don't want that," he said. "I have to deal with them in my community and I cannot go against them. Nobody can. I'm only going to the meeting to be seen. I don't agree with their views at all, there's too much hate in them. But you can't fight them." Young liberal Muslims say much of the blame for the inroads of the radical groups must be laid on the Muslim establishment. "They are operating the mosques as though they were still in Karachi," complained Ehsan Massoud. "We want better educated imams with more modern views, and more say in the management. But they won't let us in." One young radical described the present management committees of mosques as "groups of local supermarket millionaires in the pay of Saudi Arabia." A top demand by young Muslims is for sermons in English. They complain that the imams imported from Pakistan and the Middle East are often ill-qualified for the job and do not speak English. "I want to see the mosques more open to women. Many of the mosques ban women, and this is a Pakistani tradition, not a British one," Massoud said. Young Muslims also want their mosques to operate centres, providing advice on job problems, addiction or how to deal with social services. Imams should function more as counsellors and be less remote, the young Muslims say.... One suggestion is wider British training for imams. At present, there are only two main training centres. One, in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, offers the same education as that available on the Indian subcontinent. The other is the Muslim College in Ealing, which by contrast also offers courses in Engiish and history and training in counselling and dealing with government departments and courts. However, most of its students have been foreigners because no assistance is available for British Muslims. Another necessity, liberal Muslims say, is to establish a Muslim version of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, allowing the Muslim community to promote its interests with one voice. They say the lack of such a body has allowed radicals to corner the agenda. `Purify Every Inch' The following extracts are taken from Hizb-ut-Tahrir leaflets: Islam forbids you and forbids any Muslim from pledging their allegiance to America, Russia, Britain or France or any other disbelieving country... Allah has also forbidden the believers from taking the disbelievers as intimates and telling them their secrets and befriending them, for these disbelievers only seek to bring harm to the believers. The British establishment, its Government, its institutions, its education system, its media, will never be satisfied with us until they take us away from our religion of Islam. Muslims are sinful if they allow the disbelieving Jews to continue occupying the land of Palestine. They will not be relieved of this sin until they exterminate the Jewish authority over it, and liberate it, as well as purifying every inch from the filth of the occupying Jews. The idea of a democratic society is deceptive, dangerous and unworkable. The party considers it is haram (forbidden) to establish or participate in parties which call for capitalism, socialism, secularism, nationalism or any religion other than Islam. We are surrounded by a sea of kafr (disbelief). Kafr thoughts, practices and kafr systems of life. The Muslim ummah (community) has been seduced, tricked and subverted into a disastrous friendship with the kafr, the result of which has been the abandonment of our educational nexus for theirs, our moral nexus for theirs, our governmental nexus for theirs, our judiciary nexus for theirs, so that our anthropological distinctness has been submerged and eradicated until all that is allowed to remain is a romantic appraisal of our Islamic past in Museums of Mankind and other Jew-designated mortuaries of wisdom. From an unidentified leaflet in verse, distributed outside the Regent's Park mosque in central London: Do something to prove that on your shoulders there stands a head not a piece of cheese. Throw a stone, trigger a bomb, plant a mine, hijack a plane, do not ask how.
