While the Lebanese Foreign Ministry is expecting today to receive the Iraqi Government's reply to its request to lift the diplomats' immunity in order to try them before Lebanese courts, diplomatic sources expect the Iraqi reply to be negative and expect the Lebanese Government to expel Cultural Attache Khalid Khalaf and Cultural Attache Muhammad Kamil Kazim next week after indicting them in accordance with Lebanese laws. [passage omitted] The Lebanese judicial authorities have asked the Foreign Ministry departments to provide them with a copy of the full identity papers of 'Ali Sultan Darwish, the Iraqi consul in the embassy. Security authorities last night arrested Muhammad Rashid, manager of the al-Rafidayn Bank, and two of the bank's employees. They are being investigated at the same time as the Lebanese security forces continue to surround the Iraqi Embassy building. Security sources said that the siege will not be lifted until the wanted men are handed over. The Iraqi Embassy issued a statement rejecting the measures taken around the embassy as a violation of diplomatic norms. [passage omitted] As part of the security measures taken in connection with the assassination, security men raided a number of apartments in northern Beirut where members of the group that planned and carried out the assassination reside. The security men confiscated guns, ammunition, and silencers.

The paper AL-SAFIR, which published this information today, said that the order from Baghdad to assassinate al-Tamimi came in a coded telex message to the al-Rafidayn Bank center in al-Sadat Street in Ra's Beirut.
