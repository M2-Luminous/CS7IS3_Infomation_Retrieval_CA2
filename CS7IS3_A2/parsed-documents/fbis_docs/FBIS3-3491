I. In the past year, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress, the people of all nationalities in China have further emancipated their minds, seized opportunities, deepened reform, and opened wider to the outside world. As a result, China has enjoyed sustained, rapid, and healthy economic growth, and political and social stability. Unity among the nationalities has been further strengthened, and all fields of endeavor have continued to advance. In particular, the "Decision on Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure," made by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, shows that China's economy has entered a stage in which package reforms and breakthroughs in key areas are integrated. Although there are still contradictions and problems in our way of advance, as a whole China is in a period of massive development unprecedented in its history. The new situation of reform and construction in China has set new tasks and requirements for the CPPCC, and has also created better opportunities and conditions for improving the work of the CPPCC. Since the First Session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee, the Standing Committee, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and basing itself on the experiences of the past CPPCC national committees, has worked hard to explore new ways of fulfilling the CPPCC's functions of political consultation and democratic supervision in the new situation. The Standing Committee has stressed that the CPPCC should thoroughly understand its important position and role in the new period; should strive to fulfill its functions without overstepping its authority; should correctly understand its characteristics and select the proper angle in exploiting its advantages; should focus on the central task of economic construction, and refrain from formalism in participating in the administration and discussion of state affairs; should give full play to its specialized committees and organize its members to take part in various forms of activities regularly; should strengthen information work in order to promptly and correctly reflect people's sentiments and opinions; should vigorously widen its foreign contacts in coordination with the state's overall plan in foreign affairs; and so on and so forth. All these have been designed to enable the CPPCC, a unique form of democracy of the Chinese people, to better adapt itself to the requirements of the new period for socialist modernization; to fully play its role in the political, economic, and cultural life of the state; and to solidly and effectively advance the construction of socialist democracy, thereby guaranteeing in a better way the thriving of our undertakings, long- term stability in the country, and the realization of the great cause of the reunification of the motherland. In the past year, the CPPCC Standing Committee has conscientiously organized the implementation of the tasks set by the First Session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee. The Standing Committee has participated in the administration and discussion of state affairs while focusing on the central tasks of the country and has made new advances in various fields of work, thus bring about a more vivid and lively situation. The major achievements are: -- Conscientiously convene meetings, and strengthen discussions and consultations of important state affairs. Every year the CPPCC holds its plenary session to fulfill its functions, discuss policies of the state, attend the NPC session as observers, and participate in the discussion of the government work report, the work reports of the Supreme Court and the Supreme Procuratorate, the national economic and social development plan, the state budget, and other important matters. Meetings of the Standing Committee represent the major form of carrying out the function of political consultation and democratic supervision during the recess of the CPPCC plenary session. In the past year, the Standing Committee has held five plenary meetings to discuss the economic situation in the country and countermeasures to deal with the situation, the international situation, and other issues regarding the establishment of a socialist market economic structure, promotion of honesty in government institutions, and the fight against corruption. During these meetings, leaders of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, including Zhu Rongji, Qian Qichen, Wen Jiabao, and Wei Jianxing were invited to make reports on different occasions. While focusing on the central issue, the members of the Standing Committee exchanged views freely and put forward many valuable opinions and proposals, bringing about a new atmosphere in the participation in the administration and discussion of state affairs. Last June, the chairmanship meeting discussed and adopted the "Proposal on Strengthening Macroeconomic Regulation and Control To Check Inflation" submitted by the Economic Committee. The analysis on the country's economic situation and the countermeasures for checking inflation, contained in the proposal, were adopted by the party Central Committee and the State Council and thus played a positive role in helping the state to enforce macroeconomic regulation and control to ensure a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. -- Strengthen the work of special committees and organize the members to constantly take part in various activities. The special committees of the CPPCC are working groups which organize the members to constantly take part in various activities as well as important setups for developing the members' role of providing political consultation and democratic supervision, and of participating in and discussing state affairs. Over the past year, the special committees were very busy in organizing the members to take part in various activities. This has further whipped up the initiative of the members to participate in and discuss state affairs. Various special committees also carried out investigations and studied the building of the two civilizations and some important issues of the united front work, and put forward 24 investigation reports. Among those reports, "Some Suggestions on Developing and Stabilizing Grain and Cotton Production," "Suggestions on Saving and Protecting Cultural Relics in the Three-Gorges Construction Area," "Investigation Report on the Building of China's New and High Technology Development Zones," and "Investigation Report on the Issue of Helping Minority Areas Eliminate Poverty and Develop the Economy" were taken seriously by the party Central Committee, the State Council, and other concerned departments. Many suggestions have been accepted. Various special committees also held discussion meetings on formulating laws governing religion and donations by overseas Chinese, and on implementing laws to protect the rights and benefits of women and children, and laws governing teachers and taxation. They put forward a number of opinions and suggestions. -- Expand the fields of foreign contacts to enhance friendship and cooperation with other countries. From the end of November to early December last year, Chairman Li Ruihuan made formal visits to three South Asian countries at the invitation of the speaker of Nepal's Upper House, the speaker of the Indian Union Parliament and the chairman of the Pakistani Senate, and achieved complete success. This was a major foreign affairs activity last year by a principal leader of our country. It was also the first visit to foreign countries by the chairman of the CPPCC National Committee and was significant in the history of foreign contacts by the CPPCC. Chairman Li Ruihuan introduced China's reform, opening up and economic construction to leaders, concerned departments, and people of various circles of the three countries; explained China's peaceful and friendly foreign policy, the characteristics and functions of the CPPCC, and China's multiparty cooperation and political consultation system under the leadership of the CPC; enhanced the three countries' understanding of the basic situation of China's socialist construction, especially the political system of socialist democracy; promoted exchanges and cooperation between the CPPCC and parliaments of the three countries; and deepened friendship between the people of China and the three countries. Vice chairmen Ye Xuanping, Wu Xueqian, Seypidin Aze, Hong Xuezhi, Hu Sheng, Qian Weichang, and Sun Fuling also led delegations to a number of foreign countries, and made many friends. Over the past year, the CPPCC National Committee organized 15 delegations to visit 20 countries, received visits by delegations from various countries, and established new contacts with related organizations in 14 countries. As of now, the CPPCC National Committee has established friendly relations with 46 organizations, and the parliaments of 36 countries. -- Expand friendly contacts at home and abroad, promote the peace reunification of the motherland. With the goal of promoting two-way exchanges and "postal, transport and trade relations" between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee has strengthened relations and contacts with compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, and overseas Chinese abroad. In the past year, the Standing Committee received 20 visiting delegations, and some 500 people. Through extensive contacts with influential and noted personages, and people of various circles in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao regions, we have publicized our policies, and increased mutual understanding. Members of the CPPCC are from various sectors of society. They have maintained extensive contacts with compatriots at home and abroad. They have done a lot of useful work in developing exchanges and cooperation in the economic, trade, science and technology, and cultural fields between the mainland and the outside world, and between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. In particular, the members elected from Hong Kong and Macao have played a positive role in maintaining the stability and long-term prosperity in Hong Kong and Macao, and promoting the peaceful reunification of the motherland. -- Actively participate in the anti-corruption struggle and assist state organizations to effectively promote clean administration. In August last year, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council made plans for the anti-corruption struggle which won the wholehearted support of personages representing various democratic parties and sectors. In the course of this struggle, the Standing Committee earnestly carried out its democratic supervision functions as well as actively participated in general inspection of the anti-corruption struggle, organized by the party Central Committee. Six central inspection groups either headed or deputized by Standing Committee members or members of the CPPCC National Committee successively investigated the implementation of central anti-corruption plans in four State Council ministries and eight provinces. At its fifth meeting, the Standing Committee included the subject of anti-corruption and promotion of clean administration as an important agenda. The meeting held earnest discussions and forwarded many fitting opinions and suggestions. In addition, through various meetings and proposals, members held activities to promote the anti-corruption struggle and clean administration, promptly handled calls and opinions of people from various sectors, and actively forwarded various constructive suggestions. -- Improve members' inspection as well as offer suggestions and advice for reform and development. To make members understand more about China's reform and construction for better participation in political consultations, the general office conducted on-the-spot or trans-provincial and trans-regional inspection for members from Beijing and other localities. In the entire year, a total of 466 CPPCC National Committee members from 12 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities participated in inspection. The members went deep into the grass-roots level to understand the situation, and forwarded many good opinions and suggestions to which relevant central departments and local governments attached importance. The general office also sent members from Hong Kong and Macao to separately inspect Xinjiang, Jiangxi, and Hainan to enable them to understand more about national conditions in order to forward ideas and suggestions for local economic construction and social development. -- Strengthen work in handling and answering proposals. Proposals are an important way for various participating CPPCC units and individuals to carry out their consultative and supervisory functions as well as exercise their democratic rights. In recent years, the CPPCC's proposal work has been gradually moved onto a regular and systematic orbit. The Standing Committee of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee has emphasized the need to upgrade the quality of its work by attaching great importance to handling proposals. It followed up on investigation, worked jointly with others, and held consultations and discussion meetings to enhance the work of handling proposals. In the past year, a total of 1,900 proposals were handled and registered, of which 13 were submitted by parties and organizations. A total of 1,506 members, or 72 percent of the total number of CPPCC members, submitted proposals. By 15 February 1994, 1,881 proposals had been handled and answered. Even though some proposals handled did not result in satisfactory outcomes, many important opinions and suggestions were indeed adopted by relevant departments which produced good effects in implementing them. -- Earnestly receive opinions from all sides and make preparations for the CPPCC's constitutional amendment. The current CPPCC's constitution, revised in 1982, has played a very important role in initiating a new prospect for CPPCC work. In the past 12 years, China has made tremendous achievements in socialist modernization, resulting in profound changes in her outlook. In particular, since Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speeches during his inspection in the south, and the 14th CPC National Congress, China's reform, opening up, and socialist modernization has entered a new development stage. Essential amendments to China's Constitution, as well as the constitutions of the CPC and democratic parties, have been correspondingly made. By virtue of this, the CPPCC Constitution also needs to undergo necessary revisions. The second meeting of this Standing Committee adopted the "Decision on Proposing a Partial Amendment to the CPPCC Constitution" and set up a constitutional amendment working group headed by Li Ruihuan, and comprising Ye Xuanping, Wu Xueqian, and Hu Sheng as deputy heads. After half a year of efforts, an amendment to the CPPCC Constitution took shape on the basis of opinions solicited from responsible persons of various democratic parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, local CPPCC committees, and relevant units of the central authorities. This amendment contains mainly convergencies with the Constitutional Amendment with regard to some major wordings, such as the stress on the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the basic line in the primary phase of socialism, the system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the CPC, and the socialist market economic system; as well as replenishes -- after incorporating fresh experience and achievements in developing China's socialist democratic politics and in the CPPCC's work since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee -- relevant provisions on the CPPCC's performing the functions of political consultation and democratic supervision. The proposed amendment puts forward clearly: "The main functions of the National Committee and local committees of the CPPCC are to carry out political consultation and democratic supervision, and to organize for the CPPCC's various participating parties and organizations as well as people of all nationalities and all circles to take part in the administration and discussion of state affairs," and that "political consultation means consultations carried out before decisions are made on the cardinal policy and principle of the state and localities as well as important issues in the political, economic, cultural, and social life; and those carried out on major problems arising during the process of implementing such policy decisions." These two stipulations and the revision of other relevant clauses represent an incorporation of the "Opinions of the CPC Central Committee on Upholding and Improving the System of Multiparty Cooperation and Political Consultation Under the Leadership of the CPC," relevant contents of the "Temporary Provisions of the CPPCC National Committee on Political Consultation and Democratic Supervision" transmitted by the CPC Central Committee, as well as relevant guidelines of the First Session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee to specifically stipulate the major duties of the CPPCC. It is believed that such stipulations will have a major effect in standardizing and giving impetus to the CPPCC's work. In line with the principle of making only essential and partial revisions, this amendment does not alter any content in the existing constitution to which a revision is optional. We will propose resolving through state legislation, and other ways, any issues that need to be solved in the CPPCC's work but fall outside the capacity of the CPPCC Constitution itself. Having been adopted by the Fifth Standing Committee meeting of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee, the amendment to the CPPCC Constitution is now submitted for deliberation by this session. -- Forge closer ties and cooperation with local CPPCC committees and strengthen guidance for their work. As most local CPPCC committees were reelected at almost the same time last year as the CPPCC National Committee, vertical communication was thus especially needed in the course of opening up a new prospect in the work of local CPPCC committees. This Standing Committee, therefore, further strengthened its guidance for the work of local CPPCC committees in accordance with its constitution. For instance, principal responsible comrades from the CPPCC committees of various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities were invited to our Standing Committee meetings as observers to join in discussions on state affairs and the study of the CPPCC's work; our chairman and vice chairmen met with and heard work reports by comrades from local CPPCC committees when inspecting local work; the special committees concerned carried out cooperation and held joint work meetings with their counterparts in local CPPCC committees or conducted joint investigation and study on issues of common concern; training was conducted for several batches of responsible comrades from a number of city- and county-level CPPCC committees. All these moves were welcomed by local CPPCC committees. Committee members, since the First Plenary Session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee, the Standing Committee has made progress in its work. Many shortcomings and deficiencies, however, remain in our work. For example, consultations on issues of major importance need to be bolstered in terms of fuller research and more thorough investigation; democratic supervision by the CPPCC should be carried out -- in a more down-to-earth manner -- in coordination with reform, opening up of the state, and the development of political, economic, and social undertakings; and greater improvement is needed in the processing of motions submitted by the political parties, public organizations, and committee members. We are convinced that so long as we work with one heart and one mind, build on our successes, and overcome our deficiencies, we can continue our march forward. II. Committee members, 1994 will be a crucial year for China's reform, opening up, and the modernization drive. The basic policy for the party's and state's work -- that is, fully implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, seize the opportunity to accelerate the establishment of the socialist market economic structure, maintain a sustained, fast, and healthy development of the national economy, maintain political stability, and bring about all-around social progress -- has been decided. This year is the second year of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee. The basic policy for the work of its Standing Committee is to, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, hold high the banner of patriotism and socialism, revolve closely around the central task of the party and state in executing -- in a still better way -- its functions of political consultation and democratic supervision, improve efficiency in the participation in the administration and discussion of state affairs, and make due contributions in implementing the task of seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability. Accordingly, the Standing Committee has set the following as its main tasks for 1994: 1. Study the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics in a deep-going manner to enhance our common understanding. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a guide to action for a big country with a population of 1.1 billion to eliminate poverty to achieve prosperity, to eliminate backwardness, and to achieve modernization. In the past 15 years, people of all nationalities across the country have implemented this theory and scored world-renowned achievements. Building socialism with Chinese characteristics has become the supreme consensus among people of all nationalities across the country. The various democratic parties, public organizations, persons without party affiliations, and persons representing ethnic groups -- the components of the CPPCC -- must integrate theory with reality and study this theory on their own initiative so they will have a deeper understanding of the basic tenets of Marxism, a systematic understanding of the current national conditions of China, and a complete and accurate knowledge of the country's general principle and policy. Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping reflects in a concentrated way the theory on building socialism with Chinese Characteristics. We should make it the most important teaching material for us in conducting self-education, and in enhancing our understanding under the new situation. Deng Xiaoping's works contain a series of expositions on the nature, tasks, and functions of the united front and the CPPCC in the new period, carrying forward Comrade Mao Zedong's theory on the united front and people's democracy under the new historical conditions. We must study them in a systematic and deepgoing manner. Efforts should be made to study the new situation and new characteristics of CPPCC work in the course of establishing a socialist market economic system, dare to explore new ways, dare to act, uphold the principle of "democracy, realism, unity, motivational atmosphere," and implement, in a still better manner, the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the CPC. 2. Select important issues in economic construction, reform and opening up to the outside world, the building of spiritual civilization, and the people's livelihood as subjects for organized investigation and study, and conscientiously and properly participate in the administration and discussion of state affairs. Proper participation in the administration and discussion of state affairs is the essential requirement of the CPPCC's duties of political consultation and democratic supervision as well as an important criterion for measuring the CPPCC's work. We should closely revolve around the party and the state's central task in participating in the administration and discussion of state affairs, improve actual work results, and give play to the CPPCC's advantage of being intellect-intensive, and having widespread information sources and a relatively smooth vertical communication system, to vigorously promote socialist modernization. From late last year through early this year, the State Council successively introduced a series a reform measures aimed at accelerating the establishment of a socialist market economic system. As continually deepening reform of the economic structure would guarantee a sound structure for promoting economic development, we should unswervingly unite the people in support of the government's move to implement measures to deepen reform, and should look squarely at a series of new contradictions and difficulties arising amid the reform, to promote the integration of reform, development, and stability. This is the overall situation of the state. In unfolding various activities in political consultation, democratic supervision, and participation in the administration and discussion of state affairs, the CPPCC should conscientiously submit to and serve this overall situation. This Standing Committee will prudently select several issues of overall importance in reform, opening up to the outside world, and the building of spiritual and material civilization as subjects for comparatively systematic and in-depth investigation and study organized under the initiative of the general office of the CPPCC National Committee or relevant special committees, so as to find out about the various situations and put forward countermeasures. Whenever necessary, local CPPCC committees or the democratic parties concerned will be invited to take part in these activities. This Standing Committee or the chairmanship meeting should carry out earnest deliberations and make proposals to be formally submitted to the CPC Central Committee and the State Council. 3. Democratic parties and mass organizations should carry forward the fine traditions and play a more important role in participating in administration and discussion of state affairs. Democratic parties and mass organizations constitute an important foundation of people's political consultative organs, and they play a particularly important role in multiparty cooperation and political consultations. Promoted and nurtured by revolutionaries of the older generation like Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping over the last several decades, the CPC and various democratic parties have developed the fine traditions characterized by "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision, showing utter devotion to each other, and sharing weal and woe," as well as the fine traditions characterized by close cooperation, and discussion of state affairs among all parties of the people's political consultative organs. Today, not only should we inherit these traditions, but we must also carry them forward. Last winter and this spring, Chairman Li Ruihuan visited the central committees of all democratic parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and exchanged views with them on various situations. From now on the CPPCC National Committee should forge stronger ties with democratic parties and mass organizations, and give full scope to their roles in participating in administration and discussion of state affairs. We should attach even greater importance to their suggestions and motions, and create more opportunities for them to take part in administration and discussion of state affairs. All special committees should make it a regular practice to exchange views with democratic parties and mass organizations, and strengthen operational coordination with them. 4. CPPCC organs should contribute to maintaining political and social stability by forging closer ties with people of all nationalities in all sectors, earnestly reflect their views to the government, and coordinate their relations. CPPCC organs should establish closer ties with member units and members, and all member units and members should forge closer ties with people in various sectors. As the intensity of economic reform increases and more reform measures are introduced, the interests of different social groups will certainly have to be readjusted, and the readjustment will inevitably give rise to new social problems. Thus CPPCC organs at all levels are duty bound to maintain political stability and unity, mobilize all positive factors, and turn negative factors into positive factors to make sure that the government can successfully carry out its reform plans. All member units, special committees, and members of CPPCC organs must set examples of taking the interests of the whole into account and maintaining stability, and they must not do anything unfavorable to unity and stability. Meanwhile, we must take the initiative in going deep among those with whom we have established ties to hear and reflect their views, requests, and complaints. For those hot issues with which the masses are concerned, and to which they have responded strongly, we should actively seek ways and means that can solve them, and through participating in administration and state affairs discussion, urge the government to deal with them. For those problems that cannot be immediately resolved, we must also assist the government to enlighten the people so that the contradictions will not be aggravated. We must strive to help people of different nationalities and with different religious beliefs to understand one another and trust one another, and promote their unity through coordinating their ties. Special committees should pay particular attention to helping remote and impoverished areas through giving them intellectual support, and help these areas as well as minority areas and the former revolutionary bases set up production projects, and help them shake off poverty, improve their livelihood, and develop educational, cultural, and scientific-technical projects. 5. We should earnestly carry out democratic supervision through conducting effective inspection and presenting more constructive proposals. CPPCC organs carry out their democratic supervision primarily through putting forth suggestions and making criticism. CPPCC organs must therefore attach great importance to, and promptly reflect, the views and suggestions -- especially those critical views -- which member units and members put forth at various meetings, and during inspections. Democratic parties, mass organizations, and members of CPPCC organs should strive to demonstrate their supervisory role, improve the quality of proposals, be more efficient in examining and establishing cases for investigation, and analyze each and every case to make sure it is valid and will be handled constructively. On this basis, we should make sure that all proposals are handled promptly and properly. Bureaucratic conduct -- such as shelving the motions, stalling their handling, or handling them perfunctorily -- should be criticized through the media. Members of CPPCC organs should be encouraged to report and expose all lawless conduct. CPPCC organs at all levels should safeguard by law the responsibilities and rights of CPPCC member units and individuals to perform their democratic supervision. 6. Expand channels of contact in developing friendship with people abroad, promote peaceful reunification of the motherland. As the days of recovering Hong Kong and Macao in 1997 and 1999 are getting closer, and with the development of relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, the CPPCC must intensify efforts to promote peaceful reunification of the motherland. It is necessary to expand the scope of contacts; widen channels of contact in developing friendship; strengthen efforts to publicize the principles of "peaceful reunification" and "one country, two systems"; enhance mutual understanding; strengthen the study of the situation in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao; and improve coordination with all concerned departments. We will continue to promote the realization of direct postal, transport, and trade relations with the Taiwan region. We will continue to work for the stability and long-term prosperity of the Hong Kong region. We will firmly support our government resuming the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong according to the schedule despite all kinds of winds and waves [feng lang 7364 3186], and all kinds of artificial obstacles [ren wei di zhang ai 0086 3634 4104 7140 4293]. We will continue to work hard for the smooth transfer of political power and peaceful transition in the Macao region in accordance with the principles of the Macao Basic Law. 7. Give full play to the advantageous position of the CPPCC, continue to develop friendly contacts with parliaments and nongovernment organizations of various countries. The CPPCC's foreign contacts are an important component part of our country's overall foreign affairs. We must follow the principle of serving the interests of China's economic construction and overall diplomatic mission, give full play to the CPPCC's advantageous position of integration of the government and nongovernment sectors, and actively unfold activities in the field of external relations. In the new year we should, on the basis of consolidating our existing friendly relations, increase contacts with countries and regions which lack understanding of our country. In developing external relations, we can promote contacts with nongovernment friendly organizations as well as foreign parliaments. We should publicize the features of our country's system of socialist democracy in light of our country's special characteristics; we should turn the CPPCC's foreign contacts into links and bridges for promoting international cooperation and understanding in China; and we should strive to create a favorable international environment for china's socialist modernization drive. 8. Strengthen the organizational work of the CPPCC in an all-around way, raise the quality of cadres, and increase work efficiency. In order to create a new situation for the work of the CPPCC, we must effectively strengthen the ideological and organizational building of the CPPCC, and improve our workstyle and systems. We should carry out organizational reform, increase efficiency, raise the quality of service, and effectively improve all kinds of work of CPPCC organizations. We will ask cadres of various CPPCC organizations to seriously study job related knowledge, especially theory and policies of the united front work; attain modern economic, scientific and technological knowledge; heighten their sense of service; raise cultural and professional quality; and improve their ability to serve the united front work, to serve the meetings of the CPPCC, and to serve members of the CPPCC. We will vigorously advocate good practices for making constant progress, unity and cooperation, strictly observing discipline, paying attention to efficiency, and being honest in performing official duties. We will show concern for and train cadres, and create good conditions for the steady growth of middle-aged and young cadres. In short, we will strive to cultivate contingents of workers of the CPPCC who love work related to the CPPCC, and are good in ideology, professional skill, and workstyle. Fellow members, the 45th founding anniversary of the CPPCC as well as the 45th founding anniversary of the People's Republic of China will fall in this year. Let us hold high the banner of patriotism and socialism, unite closely around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, and struggle hard for the accomplishment of various tasks set by the current session, and score a new victory in the work of the CPPCC!
