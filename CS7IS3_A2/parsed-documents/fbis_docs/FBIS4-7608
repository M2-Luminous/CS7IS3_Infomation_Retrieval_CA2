However, members of Abdic's paramilitary units stepped in to make up for somewhat lower intensity of attacks launched by Karadzic's terrorists. The chetniks began by launching an artillery attack on the defense lines on the Grmusa-Srbljani plateau on the Bihac part of the front. Civilians were the victims of this madness again today. A 16-year-old girl was killed by a sniper shot. Abdic's paramilitary forces, reinforced by their chetnik allies, resumed their destructive attacks. On this occasion they shelled industrial facilities in the Cazin municipality belonging to the meat industry Puran in Pjanici. These facilities were one of the most important parts of Agrokomerc [food processing company founded by Abdic] in the Cazin municipality before the war broke out. The autonomists also attempted infantry breakthroughs in the Pecigrad area. [passage omitted]
