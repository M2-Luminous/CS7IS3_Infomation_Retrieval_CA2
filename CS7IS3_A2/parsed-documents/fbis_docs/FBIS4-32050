President Lech Walesa and his family voted in Gdansk at 1215. [Correspondent] President Walesa arrived at the polling station after attending Mass at the St. Stanislaw Kostka Church in Gdansk-Oliwa. His wife and daughter accompanied him to the district polling station. President, how do you assess the work of local government in the previous term in office? [Walesa] I think that in these conditions and after such a long time of being deprived of democratic liberties, local government has really achieved a lot. A lot, but the needs were even greater. [Correspondent] What do you expect from councillors who will be elected for the coming term? [Walesa] I hope they will learn from the experience of their predecessors and that they will concentrate even more on the most important issues to meet the demands of small communities, that they will resolve problems important to specific regions. [Correspondent] President, do you not think that a possible victory of the Polish Peasant Party may halt the political reform and decentralization of the state? [Walesa] This is unlikely and is not possible because the circumstances are different. That is the first reason. The second reason is that the system operates itself now. Politicians are not in the position to do much harm. They can make it difficult but not sufficiently difficult to destroy what has already been started. [Announcer] Correspondents from all over the country report that the elections are taking place peacefully. Interest has not been great so far. On average, there are eight candidates for one seat in multiseat constituencies, and three candidates in single-seat constituencies. In Chelm and Elblag Provinces, Senate by-elections are also being held.
