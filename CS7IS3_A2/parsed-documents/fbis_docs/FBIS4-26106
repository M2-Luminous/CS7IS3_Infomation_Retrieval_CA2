ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan faxed a message to C.F. Ku, president of Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) early in the morning suggesting that the two meet either in Taipei or a third place to exchange views on matters of mutual concern and on ways to boost cooperation between the two intermediary organizations. Wang said SEF and ARATS should work even closer and harder to promote cross-strait dialogue and various civilian exchanges in the wake of the Qiandao Lake travel disaster, in which 24 Taiwan tourists were killed. This was the second time Wang has pushed for a meeting with Ku this year. He also invited Ku to visit Beijing for high-level talks earlier in the year, but Ku did not accept that invitation. Cross-strait relations have remained at a low ebb since the March 31 tragedy on Qiandao Lake, which is in Zhejiang Province in southeastern China. Wang said in his latest letter that a high-level SEF-ARATS meeting is needed to reaffirm their good will toward each other and mend their differences over some cross-strait disputes. SEF Deputy Secretary-General Li Ching-ping said Wang's warm- hearted overture is laudable, adding that Wang's message had already been relayed to Ku, who is currently on a European tour. Li said SEF will discuss with the Mainland Affairs Council, which oversees SEF operations, how to respond to Wang's letter after Ku returns. Ku and Wang met in Singapore in April 1993 for the first time to lay a framework for SEF-ARATS exchanges. Several agreements were signed during the historic Ku-Wang meeting for institutionalized bilateral contacts. However, follow-up meetings between SEF and ARATS officials failed to proceed as smoothly as expected. SEF and ARATS are unofficial conduits for cross-strait exchanges in the absence of official ties.
