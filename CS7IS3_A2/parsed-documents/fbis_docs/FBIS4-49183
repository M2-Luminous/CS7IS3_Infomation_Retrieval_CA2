Christopher and the U.S. delegation accompanying him held lengthy talks with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad here Saturday [30 April]. They also had talks Saturday with Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' on ways of pushing forward the Middle East peace process and getting the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations resumed as well as on Israel's proposals and ideas about the peace process. According to diplomatic sources in the Syrian capital, the American secretary of state conveyed to Syrian President al-Asad a collection of Israeli ideas and proposals aimed at pushing forward the Syrian-Israeli track of the Middle East peace process, which started at the Madrid Conference held in October 1991. The sources pointed out that Christopher, who had previously met with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, assured the Syrian president that the new Israeli proposals and ideas were considered serious, and that these proposals and ideas could be developed through bilateral negotiations between the two parties, which should be resumed as soon as possible. The sources revealed that the new Israeli peace plan mainly includes the following points: -- Withdrawing Israeli forces from the occupied Syrian Golan Heights at three stages over eight years; -- Establishing full diplomatic relations; -- Setting up joint borders; -- Establishing economic ties between the two countries during the first stage of Israeli troops withdrawal; -- Concluding an agreement on a set of security arrangements that include setting up demilitarized zones on both sides of the join borders, on condition that the one extending to the Syrian side will be deeper than that to the Israeli side; and -- Stationing some U.S. troops and early-warning devices in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights, with the aim of ensuring the security of both countries. The new Israeli peace plan does also include eliminating the Israeli settlements set up on the Golan Heights. This requires that the bilateral negotiations should be expanded and joint military committees formed to determine the security arrangements, and that joint economic committees should be set up to study the question of sharing water resources in the Golan Heights. The sources said that the Israeli proposals and ideas are not only concerning the future of the Golan Heights occupied by Israeli forces in the 1967 Middle East War and annexed to Israel in 1981, but also include the issue of South Lebanon, whose solution would contribute to achieving progress on both the Syrian-Israeli and the Lebanese-Israeli tracks of the Middle East peace process. It was learned that Christopher showed Washington's readiness to dispatch a military force to ensure the security of both parties, pointing out that the Israeli ideas could be modified so as to fulfill the interests of both Syria and Israel. The sources said that Syria showed readiness to get the peace negotiations resumed in Washington, making some reservations about the Israeli proposals and ideas, particularly on the lack of Israel's readiness to withdraw completely from the occupied Golan Heights. Syria also made a reservation about the proposed Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights over eight years, suggesting that this withdrawal should be accomplished over three years at the most, and that Israel officially announce its recognition of Syria's complete sovereignty over the Golan Heights. As far as the normalization of ties is concerned, Syria prefers that a complete peace should be established and ties should be normalized after the complete and final withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Golan Heights. Syria agrees to the setting up of a demilitarized zone on the joint borders, on condition that such areas on both sides should be equal in size. Syria prefers that the joint border areas should be monitored by UN observers, but it has no objection to American troops operating on the joint borders within a UN peace-keeping force. On the situation in South Lebanon, the Israeli plan includes the following demands: -- South Lebanon should be demilitarized; -- The militias in South Lebanon, particularly that of the Hezbollah (Party of God) organization, should be disarmed; -- Israel's rights to the South Lebanon water resources should be guaranteed; -- The security of Jewish settlements in northern Israel should be guaranteed; -- Some Lebanese Army units should be stationed side by side with a UN peace-keeping force in South Lebanon; and -- Lebanon should sign a peace agreement with Israel in return for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from South Lebanon. It was learned that Syrian officials demanded that Israeli forces withdraw completely and unconditionally from South Lebanon in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 425. As regards the type of relations and normalization, Syria prefers that this should be accomplished with a general Arab-Israeli accord, and that what applies to Syria should apply to Lebanon. Christopher will leave here for Israel tonight, carrying with him a number of Syrian ideas and questions about the Israeli peace plan. These questions are believed to include how far Israeli forces will withdraw, whether Israel is ready to withdraw completely from the Golan Heights, whether it is ready to shorten the period proposed by it for the withdrawal of its forces from the Golan Heights, what guarantees will be given for the implementation of an Israeli withdrawal within a period to be agreed upon, and how far Israel will accept the idea of setting up two equal demilitarized zones on the joint borders. Although he emphasizes that the U.S. Administration is interested in achieving peace in the Middle East, Christopher argues that Syrian-Israeli channels should be opened and that the peace negotiations should be resumed with the aim of reaching a solution to fulfill the interests of both Syria and Israel.
