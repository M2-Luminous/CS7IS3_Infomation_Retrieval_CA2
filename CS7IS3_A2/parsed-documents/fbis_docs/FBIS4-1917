In 1993 the total transaction volume at the province's more than 8,600 markets reached 30.2 billion yuan (about 3.47 billion U.S. dollars), up by 29.53 percent over 1992. The majority of these markets are engaged in both retailing and wholesale business, and there are also some specific exchanges relating to commodities such as means of production, metals, grain and meat. Local officials attributed the boom of markets to preferential policies offered by the provincial government with regard to financial assistance, land-use and taxation. During the past two years, the province devoted some 1.2 billion yuan (about 137.9 U.S. dollars) to building up various forms of markets. The governments at all levels are also putting emphasis on taking macro-control over the management of markets to get rid of activities such as unfair competition, fraud and counterfeiting and make their development more healthy.
