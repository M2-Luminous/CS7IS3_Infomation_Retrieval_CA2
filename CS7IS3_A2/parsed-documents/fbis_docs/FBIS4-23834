FBIS4-23834 "drafr116_e_94007" FBIS-AFR-94-116 Daily Report 16 Jun 1994 WEST AFRICA Nigeria Police Chief Appeals To Public for Help Police Chief Appeals To Public for Help AB1606132594 Lagos Voice of Nigeria in English 1030 GMT 16 Jun 94 AB1606132594 Lagos Voice of Nigeria English BFN [Text] Following conflicting reports in the local and foreign media about Chief Moshood Abiola's whereabouts, Mohamed Okoija sought clarification from Alhaji Nuhu Aliyu, deputy inspector general of police in charge of operations, who is leading the search for him. [Begin recording] [Aliyu] Well, if you can remember clearly, in one of the interviews we have had either with you or with somebody else, I have always maintained that Abiola is in Lagos, and Chief Abiola, you know, is somebody who has a lot of places where he can take refuge, and a lot of people know it but they are not forthcoming to let us know. It is, in fact, very difficult for us to locate him without the cooperation of the general public, and this cooperation we are not receiving. [Okoija] Well, perhaps that can be expected because of the type of clout that he has. But, one wonders why all this is able to beat police network which we know nowadays is very sophisticated. [Aliyu] It is not very unusual that a person like Abiola in Lagos cannot be located. It is not unusual at all. What is very surprising is that in spite of all the efforts we have made....[pauses] We have struck a quite a number places, hoping that we were going to find him, and up to this moment we have not been able to do so. I just want to appeal to the members of the general public that as soon as they know or suspect where he is they should let us know. After all, he is not the only person that was declared wanted by the police, and those who were declared wanted by the police earlier than him showed up, and they are now in the court of law. If he shows up, he will eventually go to the court of law where he can be able to defend himself. I am surprised and disappointed why he has not shown up. [Okoija] Now, well, maybe the public is not cooperating because the price you put on him is not attractive enough. [Aliyu] In fact, to be honest with you, we shouldn't have put any price on him. The public should -- not only the public -- himself, he should have shown up. As soon as it was declared that he was wanted, he should have come out and said: Look, I am here. What are you looking for me for? And, (?that is how) we should now come, take him, take his statement, ask questions, and then we shall be in a position to know exactly what is going on. As at now, he is leaving everybody in doubt, because a person of his standing should not leave people in doubt. He should come forward and say exactly what it is all about. The utterances of the wife and the utterances of the Nadeco [National Democratic Coalition], these are just their utterances. In fact, they are just compounding issues for Chief Abiola, because as far as we are concerned, we of the police -- because the Nadeco secretary or the spokesman of the Nadeco, one (Ayo), (Bob Ayo) who has been saying that Abiola, they are making preparations to receive him in a big way -- well, if they are making preparations to receive him in a big way, then we of the police, on our own part, we are more than prepared to receive him, and I can assure you that as soon as Chief Abiola shows up, wherever, whenever, we shall be there to pick him up. [sentence as heard] [Okoija] Well, his camp is calling on him to form his government. That is a serious development. If he does form a government, what do we expect? [Aliyu] Government? I suppose you do understand that it is government of the day, and I suppose you know it yourself that even Abiola himself has recognized that government. If you (?have been) watching the television advert, it has always been showing that when Abacha became the president and commander in chief of this country, Abiola went to receive him, and congratulated him for becoming the commander in chief and head of state of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. If he sets up a parallel government, or as it is being claimed that he has proclaimed himself the president -- because if you read the interview or listened to the interview granted by Kudirat Abiola, it appears as if she was talking as the wife of a president -- that is treason, treason, a felony, a treasonable felony. Declaration of a parallel government, or a parallel government when in fact there is [a] government of the day, the offense is treason. [Okoija] Have you people been able to ascertain whether Chief Abiola is doing all this because he has encouragement from international quarters? [Aliyu] Well, if international bodies are encouraging him to commit treason -- a felony in Nigeria, a serious felony in Nigeria -- well, that is their own business. As far as we are concerned, in Nigeria, a person committing a treasonable felony -- if you remember there was a similar incident where a group of politicians in Nigeria were tried and convicted of a treasonable felony. [sentence as heard] [end recording]
