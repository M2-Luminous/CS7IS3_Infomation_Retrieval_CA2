Yogendra Nath Chaturvedi, additional secretary in the ministry, and other senior officials during their informal talks with reporters said that it was only a coincidence that the law was passed on eve of the prime minister's U.S. visit. According to some press reports, the law was passed in `haste' just before the prime minister's U.S. visit. Rao, by getting the law passed in the parliament, wanted to assure the United States that legal arrangements have been made to stop the theft of U.S computer programs. The Prime Minister's Office was afraid that this issue would be raised during Rao's visit. The general complaint of U.S. computer companies is that the theft of their computer programs is very common in India. The ministry officials today clarified that in fact the joint parliamentary committee formed to study the law had submitted its report on the last day of the monsoon session of the parliament. Following that, the law was given its final touches after consultations with various ministries, including the Law Ministry. It was not possible to table the bill to this effect in the parliament before the budget session. According to Chaturvedi, Shahid Ali Khan, former deputy director general of the Geneva-based World Intellectual Property Association, has termed the bill as the one of the best copyright laws in the world, which has incorporated all "progressive" steps keeping in view all new challenges likely to be posed. He said to ensure strict enforcement of the law at least in the state capitals, state governments are being asked to set up a cell in the police department. The cell will comprise police and military personnel. The training of these personnel for enforcement of the copyright law will be entrusted to the Human Resource Development Ministry. Other than this, the ministry will organize a seminar in November, with the help of World Intellectual Property Association, to create public awareness about the copyright law. Such seminars are also planned at the state level. Chaturvedi said that the main aim of the amended Coyright Law is to protect interests of big publishers, video and cable operators, writers, artists, and musicians. With this aim in view, the bill has a provision for setting up copyright societies. These societies will provide legal protection to their members. The members in turn will pay a small part of their royalty to the concerned society. Such societies are very popular in Balkan states, Japan, and Germany. However, it will not be compulsory for writers and artists in India to be members of such societies as it is in other countries. According to Chaturvedi, now video recordings of the public performances by artists, singers, dancers, and snake charmers will not be allowed without their permission. There was no such arrangement earlier. The law especially ensures that the royalty paid for the work of writers or artists will be clearly mentioned in the contract. It will also have to be made clear in the contract between the two sides as to what will be the transfer area, period and geographic limit of a copyright.
