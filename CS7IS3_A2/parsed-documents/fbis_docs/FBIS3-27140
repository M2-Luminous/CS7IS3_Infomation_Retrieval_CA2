According to a BBC TV report, Foreign Office Minister David Heathcoar-Amory told Parliament that the NATO's decision was clear. And it was for U.N. commanders to determine the nature of how weapons remaining within 20 km of Sarajevo are to be controlled by U.N. troops, he added. He said Russian shared with Britain and its NATO allies the same objective of lifting the siege of Sarajevo and bringing the conflict to an end. Earlier, British prime minister said the past 48 hours in B-H had been encouraging. Speaking on BBC radio, the prime minister expressed welcome to Russia's plan to deploy troops in Sarajevo and to persuade the Serbs withdraw heavy weapons by next Monday, as demanded under a U.N. ultimatum backed by NATO. But he warned though air strikes now seemed less likely, no one should think the peace process was inevitable. British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said if the Bosnian Serbs handed over their heavy weapons on time, it could pave the way for a new push for an overall peace in Bosnia.
