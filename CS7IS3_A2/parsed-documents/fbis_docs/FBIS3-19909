It was just as Employment Minister Michel Giraud was beginning to receive the trade unions to explain to them the virtues of the vocational training contracts [CIP] (or at least what remains of them) that Francois Mitterrand emphatically returned to his favorite theme, the protection of social achievements. His aim was probably mainly to go back over the recent G-7 meeting devoted to employment. "I and others in France have worked very hard to ensure that the big countries deal with the actual problems of their fellow citizens," he stressed. Defender of the Welfare State "That has been made possible because a few big countries are no longer advocating wage cuts or questioning social protection as a remedy for unemployment, although many countries still are tempted to do so." A temptation for whom? At all events, it is impossible not to see a relationship between the head of state's remarks and the slogans hostile to the vocational training contracts which are resounding in most of France's cities. Of course, Francois Mitterrand, despite the Socialists' defeats, "clings" to the image he intends to leave to posterity -- that of the defender of the weak and oppressed. His statements probably differ little, at least on this point, from those made at the G-7 meeting by Bill Clinton, one of whose avowed objectives is to prepare for the future by allowing wage earners to "gain higher qualifications and wages." On this point alone, because by stating, some 20 days before the signing of the GATT agreements in Marrakesh, that "there will only be lasting progress when social clauses are included in international agreements," the French president, even with the best intentions--who can decently approve of the shameless exploitation of child labor or political prisoners?--is nonetheless invoking the virtues of protectionism to eliminate relocations which destroy jobs. After having worked for a more open European single market, after having started the privatization of government companies, and after having allowed the power of the trade unions to decline, the president of the republic has stood out for one year now as the defender of the welfare state, which is being undermined by the increase in world trade, the decentralization of capitalism, and the recession. By fanning the funeral pyre of a vocational training scheme doomed before it was born, what could he hope to gain from the 750,000 young people without jobs? Probably their support...
