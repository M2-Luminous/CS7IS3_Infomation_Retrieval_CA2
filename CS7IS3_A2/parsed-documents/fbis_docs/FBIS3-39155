Could you make a general assessment? [Aliyev] My visit to Turkey aims at further developing the ties between Azerbaijan and Turkey, both on the level of states and peoples. Moved by this consideration, I accepted the invitation of the honorable President of Turkey Suleyman Demirel, who is our dear friend and brother, and came to Turkey. We held talks to solve these issues at the state level and to work out concrete measures. We held very fruitful and important talks, as a result of which we signed almost 16 agreements and protocols. Each of them is of the utmost importance and signals the direction of the future development of relations between the Turkish and Azerbaijani states. [Advan] An agreement on friendship and the development of multifaceted cooperation was also signed between Turkey and Azerbaijan yesterday. It includes an interesting article, which stresses that if either of the two contracting parties comes under any attack the other country will take the necessary measures against the aggressor. Do you think that this article will elicit a reaction from Russia? [Aliyev] If we have indeed attached our signature to such an article then we must remain true to that article. [Advan] Could we now consider the Baku-Ceyhan oil pipeline as a done deal? What measures were envisaged in this regard? [Aliyev] I issued a presidential instruction whereby I ordered the Azerbaijani Oil Company to conduct talks and finalize contracts with Western companies. Now, these talks will be held. It could be that at these talks the sides might agree or disagree with certain issues. This is only natural. Once these contracts are finalized, the oil pipeline issue will also be resolved. I do not doubt that the oil pipeline will pass through Turkey.
