The request was made in connection with the scheduled liberalization of interest rates on ordinary postal savings, equivalent to bank demand deposits, within this year. The Finance Ministry says that after liberalization, the interest rate on ordinary postal savings should be based on demand deposit interest rates, which are lower. In that case, the postal ministry says, the banks should be required to disclose detailed information on their demand deposit fund operations. Currently, the annual interest rate on ordinary postal savings is set at 1.32 percent, while that on bank demand deposits is 0.22 percent.
