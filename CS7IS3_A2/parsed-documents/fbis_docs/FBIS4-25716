We should focus the reform on, first of all, implementing, together with other parts of the country, a single foreign exchange rate; on abandoning mandatory plans on foreign exchange receipts and payments in the export trade, as well as the system of foreign exchange retention and delivery; and on introducing the system of settling and selling foreign exchange by banks. Second, we should formulate and perfect preferential policies to encourage exports. Third, we should accelerate the pace of changing the operating mechanisms of foreign trade enterprises, in linking their wage, bonus, and distribution system with their economic efficiency in earning foreign exchange through exports. Fourth, we should grant foreign trade autonomy to qualified productive and circulation enterprises and set up a number of comprehensive foreign trade companies. Fifth, we should strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control in foreign trade and establish a sound foreign trade operating order. In seeking to develop foreign trade and economic relations, we should pay particular attention to the work in the following aspects: We should rely on the region's resources in actively promoting the exports of agricultural, animal, native, and special products; ethnic handicrafts, and souvenirs for tourists. We should bring into play the frontier's advantage and improve the facilities of the existing trading ports. While expanding foreign trade, we should take the initiative to cooperate with neighboring countries in various fields; ensure the coordination of production, processing, and exportation links; and accelerate the integration of foreign trade, industry, agriculture, and technology. We should improve the investment environment in order to attract more businessmen to invest in Tibet, and we should explore various ways of absorbing foreign capital. To increase foreign exchange earnings through exports, we should continue to carry out regional cooperative projects, joint ventures, cooperation in related fields, materials exchanges, and the construction of joint export commodity production bases with enterprises in the hinterland. In seeking to promote tourism, we should, in centering on quality and efficiency, pay close attention to the resources of tourism markets and the development of commodities. We should open up new tourist routes and areas, and gradually set up a system of connecting tourist points, routes, and areas. Moreover, we should actively develop special tourist courses in mountaineering, exploration, and scientific surveys so as to strive to achieve breakthroughs in this year's number of tourists, tourism business volume, and tourism foreign exchange earnings. We should attach importance to and strengthen the work related to foreign affairs. We should actively coordinate with the state's overall diplomacy in ensuring a good job in border supervision, consular and foreign affairs, protocol, and cooperation with friendship cities. We should seek to create a sound peripheral environment and continuously expand contacts with foreign countries so as to promote Tibet's reform, opening up, and economic construction.
