In a statement to the Emirates News Agency, WAM, Bin-Husaynun said that during the visit he will convey a message from Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim al- Bid to His Highness UAE President Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan. The Yemeni minister denied that the ongoing conflict in Yemen is over oil, noting that oil was discovered in northern and southern Yemen before the unity and that there are big oil reserves in the North and South. He added that oil production projects are proceeding normally in the northern and southern oil fields. However, he said, exploration and drilling stopped at the beginning of the war operations. Asked if it is possible to continue talks about merger in light of the ongoing war between the North and South, the Yemeni minister said that Aden is now speaking about unity and the accord document [signed in Amman]. He said: What is required is to implement the document in letter and spirit, otherwise nothing else will be accepted by the Yemeni people. Asked about Sanaa's call for an immediate cease-fire provided that Aden recognizes legitimacy, the Yemeni oil and mineral resources minister said: Aden supports the cease-fire. It has responded to cease-fire calls by some Arab brothers out of its concern to stop Yemeni bloodshed.
