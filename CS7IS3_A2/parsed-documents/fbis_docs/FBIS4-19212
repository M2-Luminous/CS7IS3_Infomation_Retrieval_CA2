After a meeting between senators from across the political spectrum failed to produce accord on an institutional figure to take the Senate speaker's chair this afternoon, People's Party and Left Democrat Party representatives were reported to be holding further talks this evening. In the Lower House, where the right-wing Freedom Front has an absolute majority, Northern Leaguer Irene Pivetti has been tapped for the speaker's chair. In the Senate, where the Front is a few seats short of a majority, things are more complicated. The Northern League seemed determined to see Forza Italia's Carlo Scognamiglio placed in the Senate speaker's chair, despite the claims from Northern League chief Umberto Bossi earlier this afternoon that he did "not give a damn" about whether the economics professor made it or not. "Let's not bandage our heads up before we get clobbered," said Francesco Speroni, himself originally considered likely to become the right-wing alliance's candidate for the top Senate job. Roberto Maroni, the League's Lower House whip in the last legislature, commented "if Scognamiglio does not get elected then we will have to go back to the ballot box.... If Scognamiglio does not get elected, then (out-going Senate Speaker Giovanni) Spadolini will be, with the votes of the opposition which would mean that they had a majority. So President (Oscar Luigi) Scalfaro would have to give them a mandate." Scalfaro will hand out a prime ministerial mandate after the houses have elected their speakers. Meanwhile, parties are preparing for the opening of parliament by selecting whips and putting together caucuses. The National Alliance, heir to the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement, named Giuseppe Tatarella as its Lower House whip today, while the Northern League handed out more minor posts but did not choose whips. Roberto Maroni is unlikely to return to his Lower House floor leader place, but Francesco Speroni may stay on as Senate whip, well-informed sources said. The Christian Democrat Centre, the right-wing of the old Christian Democrat Party which split off when this renamed itself the People's Party, opted today to form its own parliamentary group, rather than merging with Forza Italia. The caucus will be closely linked to that of Forza Italia, alongside which it fought last month's elections under the Freedom Front banner. Heading the Christian Democrat Centre's whips in the Lower House is likely to be Clemente Mastella. On the left of the house, talks between the eight Progressive allies to form a single caucus ended with a decision to go ahead without the Socialists and Reformed Communists. The Progressive caucus will consist of 213 deputies and 122 senators, a communique released this evening said. Well-informed sources said that Progressive members, the Greens and Network, were championing out-going Lower House Speaker Giorgio Napolitano as Lower House whip for the Progressives, but this has not been officially confirmed. The Socialists, who decided today to keep up their own `visibility' in a separate parliamentary group, said they would be closely linked with the Progressive caucus. When the Senate meets tomorrow at 1030 (0830 GMT) for its first session of the 12th legislature, 87-year-old life Senator Francsco de Martino will preside for the second time, in his capacity as older member of the house. Voting for a new Senate speaker will take place in a secret ballot, with an absolute majority needed to win in the first two rounds of voting, to be held tomorrow, and an absolute majority of senators present needed to win in the third ballot. A run- off between the third ballot's two top candidates will decide the final winner if the vote goes to a fourth round. A breakdown of Senate seats on the basis of results in the March 27-28 general elections is as follows: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |154 |Freedom Front (Forza Italia, Northern | | |League, National Alliance, Christian | | |Democrat Centre) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |31 |Pact for Italy (People's Party, Segni | | |Pact) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1 |Val D'Aosta Union | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |3 |South Tyrol Party | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |2 |Pannella Ticket | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |122 |Progressives (Left Democrats, Communi-| | |st Refoundation, Network, Greens, Dem-| | |ocratic Alliance, Social Christians, | | |Socialists, Magris Ticket) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |2 |Others | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |11 |Life senators | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In the Lower House, which meets at 1000 (0800 GMT), the job of overseeing procedures will go to Alfredo Biondi, the oldest of the deputy speakers in the out-going legislature. To win the speaker's seat in the first round of voting, a candidate needs 420 votes, or those of two-thirds of deputies. In the second and third rounds, a winner would need the support of two thirds of those voting. From the fourth vote on, an absolute majority is needed. On the basis of last month's election results, the party-by-party breakdown should be as follows: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |366 |Freedom Front 122 Northern League | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |109 |National Alliance | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |95 |Forza Italia | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |32 |Christian Democrat Centre | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |6 |Pannella Ticket | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |2 |Autonomous tickets | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |213 |Progressive 114 Left Democrat | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |41 |Communist Refoundation | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |18 |Democratic Alliance | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |15 |Socialists | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |11 |Greens | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |8 |Network | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |6 |Social Christians | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |46 |Pact for Italy | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |33 |People's Party | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |13 |Segni Pact | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |3 |South Tyrol Party | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1 |Val D'Aosta Union | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1 |Independent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The 12th legislature is younger, more female, and more erudite than the previous one, and contains over 400 new faces. The average age in the Lower House has gone down from 49.8 top 46.3, while in the Senate the drop is from 54.9 to 52.4. The female presence in the Lower House has risen from eight percent to 13.9 percent, but in the Senate it has remained more or less stable. Only 30.9 percent of deputies and 40.4 percent of Senators have previous parliamentary experience, against an average of 44 percent last time round. Forza Italia boasts 95 percent of new faces, followed by the Northern League with 44.4 percent of newcomers in the Lower House and 61 percent in the Senate. University professors account for 25.8 percent of senators and 17.9 percent of deputies, while 13.3 percent of deputies and 12.4 percent of Senates are lawyers or judges. Almost 76 percent of senators have a university degree, making the upper house more learned than the Lower, where 67.5 percent have degrees. Law is the degree favoured by Italy's law-makers, but they must have been wishing they had studied geography when they found themselves having to make their way around the labyrinthine corridors of the parliament buildings with no maps provided. The next step after speakers are elected will be forming a government, with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro due to hand out a prime ministerial mandate as soon as this essential institutional task is carried out. Most bets for the premier's office are being placed on Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi, who was responsible for putting together the Freedom Front alliance of his party, the Northern League, National Alliance and some smaller parties. Berlusconi found an unlikely champion today in the shape of Serb ultra-nationalist Voyslav Seselj who welcomed the right-wing victory and said it was the sole reason for Italy not having been bombed after NATO jets took off from these shores on their recent air strike against the Bosnian town of Goradze. "Berlusconi is a patriot, and he will not go against his country's interests, and therefore he will object to NATO's taking off once again from bases in his country to strike Serbs in Bosnia," explained Seselj.
