FR940314-2-00065 FR940314-2-00040 Shawmut National Corporation, Hartford, Connecticut, and Boston, Massachusetts; Petition for Reconsideration of the Board's decision Shawmut National Corporation, Hartford, Connecticut, and Boston, Massachusetts (Shawmut), has filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the Board's decision dated November 15, 1993, not to approve its application to acquire New Dartmouth Bank, Manchester, New Hampshire. The Board's Rules of Procedure provide that a request for reconsideration of a Board decision must present relevant facts that for good cause shown were not previously presented to the Board. Shawmut represents in its request that relevant facts not previously considered by the Board are now available. In particular, Shawmut refers to its settlement with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission of charges of illegal discrimination by Shawmut Mortgage Company; its improved lending record as reflected by 1993 data filed under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA); the results of its efforts to ensure that HMDA data are accurate; managerial and organizational changes designed to strengthen compliance; and the results of steps initiated to improve its lending to minority and low- and moderate-income communities. In light of these facts, Shawmut maintains that the Board should grant the petition and approve the proposed acquisition. Notice of the filing of the petition is published in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the petition. The Board expects to act on the petition no later than May 2, 1994. Comments may be mailed to William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551. Comments addressed to Mr. Wiles may also be delivered to the Board's mail room between 8:45 a.m. and 5:15 p.m., and to the security control room outside of those hours. Both the mail room and control room are accessible from the courtyard entrance on 20th Street between Constitution Avenue and C Street, NW. Comments must be received not later than March 31, 1994. The Petition for Reconsideration may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, March 9, 1994. Jennifer J. Johnson, Associate Secretary of the Board. [FR Doc. 94-5895 Filed 3-11-94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6210-01-F
