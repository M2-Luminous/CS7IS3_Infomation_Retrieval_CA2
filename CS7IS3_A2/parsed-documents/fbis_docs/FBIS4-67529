GHANA Accra Ghana Broadcasting Corporation (GBC) Radio Network in English at 0600 GMT on 25 April reports that in order to check overdepletion of fish resources, the government has placed a ban on the importation of trawlers into the country. The radio says that the Ministy of Food and Agriculture is also taking steps to ensure that the ban on the use of undersized nets, dynamite sticks, and the fishing practice popularly called atidsa, where tree branches are place in water to serve as shelter for fish, is strictly enforced. According to the GBC, the deputy minister of food and agriculture in charge of fisheries announced this during a tour of some fishing communities in the Volta Region. A correspondent quotes the minister as telling the fishermen that the government is greatly worried about the high depletion rate of fish resources and is taking steps to check the situation. Accra Ghana Broadcasting Radio Network in English at 0600 GMT on 28 April states that delegates from five African countries are meeting at Aburi to work out a system of supporting environmental education initiatives in the subregion. The delegates are from Ghana, the Gambia, Nigeria, Sierra leone, and Kenya. A correspondent report states that the course is being organized by the University of Bradford in the United Kingdom and the May Day Rural Project, a nongovernmental organization supported by the Overseas Administration of Britain. This is a follow-up to similar seminars in Ghana and the United Kingdom where participants call for more training schemes to enhance dissemination of environmental education. The course aims to acquaint participants with the definition and historical evolution of environmental education by discussing the education strategy for Ghana and planning mechanisms to support the implementation of environmental initiatives in the subregion. NIGER Niamey Voix du Sahel Network in French at 1200 GMT on 22 April reports that in several areas of Filingue District there are large numbers of plants like acacia, albida, or gao, in the southeast which are being threatened by farmers and herdsmen. Most of the 30,000 inhabitants in the area are pastoralists and during the past agricultural season, a significant amount of grazing ground was used. This has created a phenomenon of environmental deterioration. The animal breeders have used trees to feed animals. According to an environmental officer, this phenomenon is growing and if this practice continues there will be no environmental regeneration. The environment department is finding it difficult to find alternatives for the animal breeders, but until they do there is a need to alert the farmers and herdsmen to the importance of natural regeneration for the environment. Paris AFP in French at 1120 GMT on 1 May reports ecologists in Niger have sounded the alarm about increasing usage of the plastic packings which pollute the country's main cities and have begun to threaten the health of human beings and livestock. On 23 April, Ecologica, an nongovernmental organization, launched a campaign called Plastic Packing-Free Environment Operation. Ecologica promised to supply schools with teaching equipment in exchange for the nonbiodegradable wastes they would collect. Ecologica has also called on beggars in urban centers to participate in the collection of plastic packings for recycling. The Ministry of Environment has admitted the severity of the problem, while confessing its inability to face it. According to highway services, plastic packings now account for half of household waste in the cities. In Niamey, the City Council put in place trash cans exclusively for plastic packing waste, but since the cans are poorly protected they are emptied by the first gust of wind. Sheep, goats, oxen, and asses wandering in the streets sometimes feed on this plastic waste. The veterinary clinic in Niamey says that in one month 30 animals suffered indigestion due to plastic packings. Human beings are also in danger since some people think that they can use the plastic waste as source of energy and inhale highly toxic substances. NIGERIA Lagos Radio Nigeria Network in English at 0600 GMT on 28 April reports the administrator of Adamawa State, Group Captain Gabriel Agbonene, has expressed concern over the problem of desertification.

[passage omitted] ZAIRE Kinshasa Voix du Zaire in French 1800 GMT on 29 April reports the rehabilitation of the Luki biosphere reserve in the Bas-Fleuve area has been launched by Benoit Kena Muauki, secretary general for environment. The reserve, which is confronted with serious environmental deterioration, abounds in natural resources which represent various economic, scientific, and esthetic interests. It is even recognized as part of the world network of biosphere reserves. In fact, for many months now, the Luki reserve has been confronted with deforestation problems as a result of extensive agricultural activities, illegal exploitation, and indiscriminate occupation of forest zones. To minimize damage, the authorities have decided to demarcate the reserve, repair bridges, and ensure the maintenance of roads. They have also decided to erect 105 boards to ensure the protection of this ecosystem.
