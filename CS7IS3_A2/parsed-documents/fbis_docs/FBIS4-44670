The facility was constructed as part of France's "PREPHA" hypersonic propulsion research program, and rounds out the three, already existing lines for testing ramjet missile applications. The facility will be used to validate the operation of large engines--up to flight Mach numbers of nearly 7--on the ground. The first tests of the PREPHA program scramjet will be conducted there in May 1994. The new test line can now compete with the best of those in the United States and Russia, and will be a driving force in future European efforts to work together on hypersonic propulsion.
