Today, you have shown more proof of unity and work in favor of Mexico's best interests. For the nation, the pact means that the nation is moving on the path toward stability and growth. Moreover, it represents the efforts undertaken by each sector and each Mexican to help the country curb inflation, advance in the modernization of its industrial plants, and above all, give more attention to the most needy. I must stress that inflation hurts most those who earn the least, and it shrinks the income of Mexicans. Now, after significant advancements, we have abated the most unjust tax to levels that for the first time will benefit more than half of the population -- young people who under the age of 25. Therefore, with their work and commitment to the pact, the economic sectors have contributed to inspire in the Mexican people new hope for a better future. Today we have renewed our willingness to discuss our problems and reach concerted agreements within the law as the only path Mexicans accept to meet our challenges and advance toward our goals. Government actions have been based on this principle for more than five years, moving forward with a new outlook -- an outlook of discipline, tolerance, and a clear concept of social justice. First, the agreement you have signed reaffirms the general guidelines and specific efforts previously agreed to in consolidating our economic and social advancements. Second, within the framework of the policy of fiscal and monetary discipline, the federal government commits itself to guarantee that the real increase in public expenses for employment and social programs -- which are very significant -- will reach the communities and the population more expeditiously. I must remind you that the government spends more now in resolving social problems because it maintains healthy public finances. As we have already announced, in 1994 social expenses will surpass 50 percent of the government budget, almost 10 percent of the GNP. These are the highest figures in our history. In this manner, our social and economic policies are consolidated as a solid pillar of a broad and profound strategy for the benefit of those who earn less. Third, the labor and business sectors -- within a framework of respect and solidarity, and, above all else, while taking into consideration the nation's best interests -- they are committing themselves to preventing and giving prompt solution to disputes that could emerge among the various productive forces. Fourth, the agreement stresses the priority attention that Mexican rural areas deserve and will receive. We will continue working together to make sure that rural areas will receive opportunities and a dignified and productive way of life. Finally, the various sectors that signed the agreement will have to work intensively, redoubling efforts. We will reinforce the established mechanisms in order to give the necessary follow-up to the acquired commitments, maintaining close communication among all economic sectors. Today and here, we reaffirm our commitment to defend and consolidate what we have built with so much work and effort, always based on our pluralism, our solidarity, and always -- always -- based on the law. Ladies and gentlemen: It is within the legal path that we will guarantee social peace and tranquillity in Mexican homes, as well as a just and sustained development for the benefit of all our compatriots. Following that path -- the path of the law, which benefits us all, because we must all abide by the law -- we will be able to advance in peace toward our objectives of growth and social justice. Thefore, at this renewed phase of the pact, we reaffirm our commitment with the state of law, which guarantees the defense of our most precious values. There are serious problems we must face. At all times, however, it has been through concerted efforts and strict compliance with the law that the Mexican people have attained their goals. Let us clearly understand and remember that no problem, no matter how great or complex, is unsurmountable by itself. The government and society will continue working for the country's sovereign development with the unity of all Mexicans. Therefore, today we again reaffirm our pride as Mexicans and our confidence in our future. Thank you very much. [applause]
