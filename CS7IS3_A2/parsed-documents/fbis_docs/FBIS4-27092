The Supreme Court has removed the legal obstacles to the holding of the conference after nullifying the order earlier issued by Judge Marciano Bacalla of the Quezon City Regional Trial Court which prevents the holding of the conference. The Supreme Court ordered Bacalla to desist from implementing the restraining order which prevented the organizers of APCET from holding the conference inside the University of the Philippines [UP]. A few minutes after hearing the Supreme Court's decision, the APCET organizers said the conference will go ahead, starting at 0700. Meanwhile, Judge Bacalla said that he will abide by the Supreme Court decision annulling his order. The Supreme Court, however, supports Ramos' order banning foreigners attending the conference. In the meantime, APCET organizers have already started the registration of delegates to the conference, scheduled to start at 0700 at the Malcolm Hall of UP-Diliman. As of the time of publication, 20 foreign delegates have registered. The organizers explained that it is still not final as to where the conference will be held. Aside from UP-Diliman, other venues are being considered like the San Jose Seminary and UP-Manila. According to a report, 40 more foreign delegates are expected to arrive today. Among the expected delegates is a Japanese who is a member of the Diet, identified as Assemblyman (Gona). Gona is scheduled to arrive tonight. Immigration personnel are still on alert at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport [NAIA] to implement the ban on foreign delegates attending the conference. In this regard, two delegates are currently being investigated at the immigration office in NAIA. Those being questioned are Timorese Zacarias Dakosta of the Timorese Democratic Union and Harold Nuncio, who holds an Australian passport.
