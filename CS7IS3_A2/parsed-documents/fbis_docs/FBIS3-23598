Won't We Be Left Without Both Combat MiG's and Il Passenger Aircraft?"] [Text] The Situation The drastic and frequently wholesale reduction of the defense order has placed the majority of enterprises, KBs [design bureaus] and NIIs [scientific research institutes] in an extremely difficult situation. In order to survive and not lose unique cadres, one of them, on an emergency basis, has begun to develop and produce consumer goods, others -- more serious equipment: Medical equipment, lathes, and production lines for various sectors of industry, and still others -- among whom are Moscow Aviation Production Association (MAPO) -- have taken a course toward retooling the enterprise for scientific-intensive high-tech civilian production related to those products that they previously produced. Today you can see the new Il-114 short-range aircraft, the "Grach" T-101 multi-mission 9-passenger aircraft, and "Aviatika-890" ultralites alongside the MiGs in MAPO's assembly shop. It would seem that this is an ideal example of conversion. But, alas, for the time being, there is no ideal variant. No matter what good intentions guided the aircraft builders when they decided to produce passenger aircraft that are so needed today instead of combat aircraft, enormous resources and the presence of firm orders are once again required for the realization of these programs. "We cannot independently begin series production of civilian aircraft, especially large aircraft, without the state program," says Association General Director Vladimir Kuzmin. "But, unfortunately, events are unfolding in such a way that we cannot count on that support, at least in the short term." In the association's enormous assembly shop where up to two dozen combat fighter aircraft were assembled every month in previous times, today they also build two dozen, but ultralites. These small, multi-mission aircraft are also needed but, as they say, they don't make the difference. The Il-114's could make the difference for MAPO but their series production, as we learned from a conversation with Association Deputy Chief Engineer Aleksandr Dmitriyev, is impossible without budget financing of MAPO and its subcontractors. "We began work on this aircraft in 1991 in parallel with the Tashkent Aircraft Plant," says Aleksandr Fedorovich. "We hoped that, jointly with our Uzbek colleagues, the process of series production of the aircraft would be much faster and cheaper but our hopes were dashed with the disintegration of the USSR. Without the state program, there is no real price policy with the suppliers. There is no financing for the development of parts. As of today, the airframe is practically already ready but we cannot purchase the engines, avionics, and onboard equipment from the parts suppliers -- there aren't any resources. We need to pay 1.5 billion rubles for engines alone. And there aren't any guarantees that we will be able to pay back this money in the future. Based upon the most modest estimates, the cost of the new aircraft will be approximately R12-15 billion. Today, what Russian airline company can afford this aircraft?" And what is the result? We won't be flying in new Il-114's, but in ancient Yak-40's or An-24's. And when they completely exhaust their service life, and that will occur in 1996, we will transfer to trains or we will purchase aircraft abroad as, incidentally, we already do with long-range airliners. Matters with "Grach", the developer and customer of which is "Roks-Aero" Stock Company, aren't much better. More than R1 billion is required just to begin tests of the first aircraft which recently left the association's assembly shop. But if "Grach" at least has some chance of taking off, then for the foreseeable future the MiG's that you can see at the plant actually don't have any chance at all. For the third year, the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense is not ordering a single fighter aircraft from the association, for reasons that we all know. But even with the complete absence of the defense order, the aircraft builders don't intend to give up on combat aircraft. No matter how difficult it is for the association today, work on the production line where the assembly of MiG-29's is occurring is not being curtailed for even a day. Our photo-correspondent caught Master Petr Vasilyuk and Fitter-Assembler Vladimir Bychkov at that moment when they were completing work on one of the fighter's assemblies. The aircraft builders link the association's future not only with the MiG-29 but with its new modification -- the MiG-29M multi-mission fighter aircraft. This is a very promising aircraft which not only Russian but also foreign aviators have been eying for a long time. And with the proper financing, MAPO would have certainly already begun series production of the aircraft. It is distressing that military programs have been terminated, but it is doubly distressing that the green light has not really been given to civilian projects. Due to the absence of financing, many defense complex enterprises have been compelled to resort to job reductions and to the termination of not only military but also civilian production which, in turn, results in the extinction of entire directions of domestic industry and, primarily scientific-intensive directions. Already right now we can cite quite a few examples when some defense plants have completely lost their previous profile and now produce products on unique lathes that could have been produced in small primitive shops. The Moscow aircraft builders could also find themselves in some other field. A few of them know that in Moscow it is difficult to name such a large facility in the construction of which they would not participate. Here are only a few of them -- the Kremlin State Palace, "Rossiya" Movie Theater, the Olympic Stadium, the Circus at Vorobyevyye Mountains, Paveletskiy Train Station... And in MAPO's shops they also made Kremlin stars, sarcophagi for the mausoleums of V.I. Lenin, Georgiy Dimitrov, Ho Chi Minh, and Augustino Neto, the clocks that were installed on the White House and many other things. So, MAPO specialists will not be left without a crust of bread. But, with this attitude toward the financing of conversion programs, Russia could remain not only without combat aircraft but also without civilian aircraft.
