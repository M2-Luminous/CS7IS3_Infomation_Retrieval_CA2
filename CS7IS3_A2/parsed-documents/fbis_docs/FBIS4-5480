To develop democracy, we must satisfactorily carry out the following: Protect human rights and other basic civil rights already inscribed in the constitution; scrupulously consider and resolve complaints and denunciations by the people; make arrangements for the people to participate in public affairs; contribute views to the formulation of party policies and important government bills, and improve electoral activities. To effectively achieve this, party organizations must firmly grasp the party's conceptions and policies, evaluate the actual situation, and devise plans and measures to get every job done. In practicing socialist democracy, we must resolve to fight bureaucracy, officialism, corruption, wasteful spending, and the abuse of privilege. We must fight manifestations of extreme democracy and adopt dictatorial measures against elements committing acts of betrayal against the fatherland, undermining national security, and violating the people's interest. -- We must step up and improve the quality of legislative work, build a uniform and consistent legal system, and institutionalize party lines in all areas of the social life. -- We must intensify our didactical dissemination of laws, improve the people's knowledge of and their sense of respect for the law, ensuring that the law is complied with scrupulously, uniformly, and fairly. -- We must continue to streamline and renovate the state working apparatus, ensure a unified authority and clear-cut work distribution, and develop the effect of the three rights [quyeenf] -- legislative, executive, and judicial. We must act in accordance with the principles of democratic centralism. The political report puts forth the orientations for improving the working quality of the National Assembly, undertaking administrative reform, continuing to strengthen the judicial system organizationally and renovating its activities to develop the efficiency of the state working aparatus. 8. We must renovate and rectify the party, broaden the all-people great unity bloc, and consolidate the close relationship between the party and the people. As initial efforts to review various aspects of party-building work have just been undertaken, there are issues which we must continue to study and review with more depth if we are to draw on correct experiences. The political report raises the following main points in party building: a. "We must strengthen political and ideological work and ensure the political and ideological unanimity of the entire party. We must keep party cadres and members constantly aware of the party's conceptions and policies, improve their knowledge, and help them remain firm on the path toward socialism. We must creatively apply and develop Marxism-Leninism, Ho Chi Minh thought, and all the intellectual quintessences of our time, sensitively take hold of new things and correctly handle everything arising from reality." Intensifying political and ideological activities is an urgent and fundamental duty arising from our party's leadership requirements in the present stage. It is important that the party must raise its knowledge to the level required of it by its tasks if it is to lead our national revolution to develop its advantges, seize opportunities, overcome all dangers, and surmout all ordeals. Because of the disintegration of the socialist system in the Soviet Union, confidence in the socialist path has somewhat wavered among certain segments of party cadres and members. Worse, certain people have opted for another path. They have propagated their erroneous conceptions that are at variance with party lines. We must intensify political theory indoctrination to consolidate the revolutionary stance of our party cadres and members, and attempt to "iron out erroneous viewpoints, illusionary conceptions, and idelogical vacillations. We must struggle against manifestations of opportunism, rightism, dogmatism, and conservatism. Party cadres and members must scrupulously comply with all party resolutions and directives and the state law and must not abuse democractic liberties to propagate view that are contrary to party lines." "Party members, especially party cadres at various levels, must constantly steel their revolutionary qualities and ethics, and study harder to improve their knowledge." b. "We must strengthen the unity and unanimity within the party and must adopt organizational principles for party activities, especially the principles of democratic centralism, collective leadership, and individual responsibility. We must steel our revolutionary ethics and build for ourselves a wholesome lifestyle against wasteful spending, corruption, and illegal dealings. We must guard against individualism, indiscipline, arbitrariness, despotism, departmentalism, and nepotism. We must attach importance to the safeguarding of the party and must maintain internal and national secrecy. We must guard against all the schemes and tricks aimed at causing cadres to deviate ideologically. We must increase our control over the implementation of the party's lines, policies, and regulations."
