Dozens of shells were again fired at Zivinice today. The prevailing view here is that the aggressor has decided to intensify combat operations so as to endanger the safe use of the nearby Dubrave Airport for humanitarian flights. It is well known that the United Nations are determined to open this airport soon, and it is also well known that the aggressor's side is rejecting this. The general alarm in Zivinice has already been sounded three times today owing to the shelling.
