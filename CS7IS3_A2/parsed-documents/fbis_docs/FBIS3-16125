"Ukraine has pledged to pay 100 million U.S. dollars by the end of March as part of its debt which amounts to about 1.3 trillion roubles," Vladimir Podmarkov, chief engineer of Russia's Gazprom gas concern, said on Monday. Russia and Ukraine agreed in Moscow on March 10 that Ukraine will pay 50 per cent of its debt for 1993 with financial means, including hard currency, and the rest with equipment and materials for Gazprom. The debt for the first quarter of 1994 will be paid only with financial means. Russia resumed gas supplies to Ukraine, following the agreement. Presently, it pumps 195 million cubic meters of gas daily to Ukraine. As for Belarus, its debt for Russian gas supplies has totalled about 400 billion roubles. It has failed to make the promised payments so far. In retaliation, Russia has cut gas supplies to that republic. Podmarkov said Russian gas supplies to Moldova and the Baltic states are within the agreed limits.
