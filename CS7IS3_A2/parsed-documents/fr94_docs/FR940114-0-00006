FR940114-0-00006 FR940114-0-00002 Final Regulatory Impact Analysis The Final Regulatory Impact Analysis describing the options considered in developing this final rule and the impact of the implementation of each option is available on request from the above-named individual. Background This final rule amends 7 CFR part 1468 to set forth determinations with respect to the support prices for shorn wool, wool on unshorn lambs, and mohair for the 1993 marketing year. A general description of the statutory basis for such determinations in this final rule was set forth at 58 FR 37876 (July 14, 1993). A total of seven comments were received during the 30-day public comment period that ended August 13, 1993. Three respondents recommended that no changes be made to current support rates. Three respondents recommended that the price support programs be eliminated. In response to these 6 comments, it should be noted that although the proposed rule will be adopted without change, the wool and mohair programs will cease to exist after December 31, 1995. One respondent suggested that full payment for wool on unshorn lambs should be made only on unshorn lambs up to 125 pounds, liveweight, and that no payments should be made on any weight exceeding 125 pounds. The respondent cited a problem with the current payment method which prorates payments based on the amount of weight gained while the lamb is owned first by the producer and later, a lamb feeder. The respondent noted that prorating payments encourages the production of over-fat lambs_a product that is not wanted by the American consumer_resulting in low lamb prices to the detriment of producers. This comment has not been adopted because it would increase recordkeeping requirements significantly for both ASCS and program participants, and it would require ASCS to make major revisions to the current procedure for calculating unshorn lamb payments. The potential savings resulting from lower payments would not be sufficient to justify such an increase in the administrative burden. After considering these comments, the following determinations have been made with respect to the wool and mohair price support programs for the 1993 marketing year. Support Price_Wool on Unshorn Lambs In accordance with section 703 of the Wool Act, the support price for wool on unshorn lambs shall be determined by taking 80 percent of the difference between the 1993 support price for shorn wool and the 1993 national average market price for shorn wool, multiplied by 5 pounds (the amount of wool pulled from the pelt of an average 100-pound unshorn lamb). Support Price_Mohair In accordance with section 703 of the Wool Act, the support price for mohair for the 1993 marketing year shall be $4.738, which is equal to 85 percent of the comparable percentage of parity at which shorn wool is supported for the 1993 marketing year. The support programs conducted pursuant to the Wool Act are subject to the provisions of the Balanced Budget and Deficit Reduction Act of 1985, as amended. As a result, the price support levels announced in this rule may be recalculated to comply with this Act. List of Subjects in 7 CFR part 1468 Assistance grant programs_agriculture, Livestock, Mohair, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Wool. Accordingly, 7 CFR part 1468 is amended as follows: PART 1468_WOOL AND MOHAIR 1. The authority citation for 7 CFR part 1468 continues to read as follows: Authority: 7 U.S.C. 1781&hyph;1787; 15 U.S.C. 714b and 714c. 2. Section 1468.4 is amended by revising paragraph (b) to read as follows: ยง1468.4 Eligibility for payments. * * * * * (b)(1) The shorn wool support price for the 1991 through 1995 marketing years shall be 77.5 percent of an amount which is determined by multiplying 62 cents (the support price in 1965) by the ratio of: (i) The average of the parity index (the index of prices paid by farmers, including commodities and services, interest, taxes, and farm wage rates) for the three calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which such support price is being determined and announced to: (ii) The average parity index for the three calendar years 1958, 1959, and 1960, rounding the result to the nearest full cent. The shorn wool support price shall be as follows: (A) 1991_$1.88 per pound. (B) 1992_$1.97 per pound. (C) 1993_$2.04 per pound. (2) The payment rate for wool on unshorn lambs for the 1991 through 1995 marketing years shall be 80 percent of the difference between the national average price received by producers for shorn wool during a specified marketing year and the shorn wool support price multiplied by 5 (the average grease wool yield per hundredweight of live, unshorn lambs marketed). The payment rate for wool on unshorn lambs shall be as follows: (i) 1991_$5.32 per hundredweight. (ii) 1992_$4.92 per hundredweight. (iii) 1993_an amount equal to 80 percent of the difference between the national average price received by producers for shorn wool for the 1993 marketing year and the 1993 shorn wool support price, multiplied by 5. (3) The mohair support price for the 1991 through 1995 marketing years shall be established at such level, in relationship to the support price for shorn wool, which is determined necessary to maintain approximately the same percentage of parity for mohair as for shorn wool. The mohair support price shall be set within a range of 15 per centum above or below the comparable percentage of parity at which shorn wool is supported, as determined and announced by CCC. The support price for mohair shall be as follows: (i) 1991_$4.448 per pound. (ii) 1992_$4.613 per pound. (iii) 1993_$4.738 per pound. * * * * * Signed at Washington, DC, on January 6, 1994.
