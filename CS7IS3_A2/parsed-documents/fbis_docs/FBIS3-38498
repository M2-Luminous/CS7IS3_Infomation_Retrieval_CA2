As the late Menderes [prime minister in the 1950's] would have said, "we have now entered the uphill election campaign." The struggle has already gone beyond the limits of local elections. An atmosphere similar to a general election prevails in the country. We will go on talking and thinking about elections for two more months. Turkey will redirect its attention to the home front and again be unable to see what is happening around her. We already lost Azerbaijan, and if things continue like this we will also lose Nakhichevan from under our very noses. It was not enough that we lost Azerbaijan; if things continue like this Azerbaijan will even start giving Turkey trouble. There is a newspaper called "SES" in Baku. It is under the control of President Geydar Aliyev. The paper has almost become the press organ of the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. Some days ago, it pronounced Apo [alias of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan] "the great Kurdish hero." Almost every day the paper advertises Abdullah Ocalan's books. Could such a paper ever have been published during the Elchibey period? Of course not. Yet, we not only failed to come to the support of Elchibey, we even backed Aliyev. During visits to Turkey, we pressured Elchibey in order to catapult Aliyev to the forefront. We held Aliyev in esteem. Now, the result is here for everyone to see. Now, it is useless to be sorry. Now efforts are under way to hatch a series of plots in Nakhichevan, yet, we remain blind to these developments. We have withdrawn into ourselves so much that we have no idea of what is going on under our very noses. Today "an Aliyev terror" is sweeping through Nakhichevan. The Nakhichevan Assembly has been unable to meet for the last seven months. It is Geydar Aliyev who prevents the convocation of the Assembly. There is a total lack of law and order in the country; this is what Aliyev really wants. He shelved the Constitution and is running Nakhichevan as he sees fit. Three deputies are in jail. Most of the members of the People's Front are under detention. The homes of most of the People's Front members were either burned down or demolished. The place has been turned into ruins. Many people are under detention. More than 200 people applied to the Turkish consulate and asked for political asylum. The Nakhichevan deputies appealed to and asked for the help of the Turkish parliament, saying: "Tell Geydar Aliyev to put an end to this oppression." In short, Nakhichevan is on fire. Aliyev's terrorism is continuing with the greatest intensity. As always, Turkey has again remained a spectator. As was done in the case of Azerbaijan, there could be those who say: "Why should we care about Nakhichevan?" They could also argue that "Those are Nakhichevan's domestic affairs." Yes, it is true that these are Nakhichevan's domestic affairs, but this time around, the situation is radically different. Nakhichevan is fast becoming a place that might cause Turkey trouble. Though 10,000 Kurds lived in Nakhichevan, until now there was no "Kurdish movement" there. No problems arose because there were no instigators around, but now the situation has changed. The PKK has now laid its hands upon Nakhichevan. It is trying to sow the seeds of a "Kurdish movement." The PKK is roaming freely in Nakhichevan. The borders are porous. They enter and leave the place as they wish. They move between Armenia and Nakhichevan. They enter from Iran. They also enter Turkey whenever they like. This is not all. The PKK even has training camps on Nakhichevan's borders with Armenia and Iran. Hundreds of PKK members are being trained in Nakhichevan. Geydar Aliyev's armed units remain mere spectators. Nakhichevan is fast becoming the center of a serious threat to Turkey. Is Turkey not aware of what is going on? Of course it is, but no clear policy has been formulated on Nakhichevan. As in the case of the policy towards Azerbaijan, Turkey has again remained a mere spectator and has assumed a wait-and-see attitude. As regards Nakhichevan, we will again do what we usually do: We will be too late to act and then will be sorry for the missed opportunity.
