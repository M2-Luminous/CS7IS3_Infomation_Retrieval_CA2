FR940621-0-00036 FR940621-0-00017 This rulemaking applies only to ``new installations;'' therefore, the FAA has attempted to minimize direct costs to operators while enhancing operators' safety. In Notice 90&hyph;11 the FAA estimated that automatic ELT's would cost an additional $150 to $400 per unit, and that survival ELT's would cost an additional $875 to $1,225 per unit. However, as a result of analyzing more recent data received from ELT manufacturers, the FAA has reduced its estimates of incremental costs. Automatic ELT's are estimated to cost an additional $50 to $200 per unit, and survival ELT's are estimated to cost an additional $250 to $750 per unit. Conversely, the FAA has increased its estimate of incremental installation costs for automatic ELT's from $75 to $150 per unit. G-Switch Eight commenters express concern about the design specifications of the TSO&hyph;C91a crash sensor, known as a G-switch. These eight commenters agree that the current TSO&hyph;C91 G-switch needs improvement because it is the primary cause of an ELT's failure to activate. Several commenters note that the FAA/NASA report estimates a 95 percent rate of effectiveness increase expected from using the TSO&hyph;C91a G-switch. FAA Response: On the basis of the current performance of TSO&hyph;C91a ELT installations and the conclusions reported in the FAA/NASA report, the FAA determined that TSO&hyph;C91a provides an adequate G-switch specification for sensing an airplane crash and would minimize the number of activation failures and false activations. In the event of false activation, the ELT monitor would alert the pilot or ground personnel. Additionally, the RTCA has determined that the TSO&hyph;C91a standard is an appropriate specification to be included in the RTCA/DO&hyph;204 standard for 406 Mhz ELT's. Batteries Seven commenters specifically raise the issue of batteries as a factor in ELT's poor performance. Several commenters indicate that an alternative to lithium chemistry batteries is needed and additional battery research should be conducted. Suggestions for new battery types ranged from use of solar batteries to use of size ``D'' batteries. FAA Response: The FAA has found that most battery problems can be eliminated if aircraft owners ensure that the ELT and its battery receive a proper inspection as discussed in the next section, ELT Maintenance. The status of FAA requirements for lithium batteries was discussed previously. ELT Maintenance Consistent with the FAA/NASA report, 19 commenters note lack of proper maintenance as a contributing cause of the current unsatisfactory performance of TSO&hyph;C91 ELT's. Most of the commenters agree that scheduled inspection of ELT's is necessary to reduce the number of false alarms and to ensure their proper working order. The NTSB, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), ACK Technology, Inc., and The National Association for Search and Rescue (NASAR) call for mandatory inspections. FAA Response: The FAA agrees with these comments concerning ELT maintenance and with NTSB recommendation, A&hyph;87&hyph;104, that recommended replacing TSO&hyph;C91 ELT's with TSO&hyph;C91a ELT's. The FAA/NASA report also concludes that an inspection and maintenance program for ELT's is necessary. As discussed in the background section of this preamble, an estimated 15 percent of ELT failures have been maintenance related. The FAA already provides for mandatory ELT inspections in the regulations and in TSO's. Meeting the inspection requirements is a responsibility shared among the manufacturer, the inspector, and the aircraft owner or operator. Maintenance of ELT's is a major issue; accordingly, this section will digress from discussion of the comments to emphasize these requirements. This is necessary so that users understand the FAA's requirements concerning ELT maintenance. ELT Maintenance Requirements_An Explanation Subpart E of Part 91 provides inspection and maintenance requirements for the continued airworthiness of the aircraft and all of its components. Also, ยง91.207, of subpart C, requires that each ELT be in an operable condition and provides specific requirements for battery replacement. Technical Standard Order C91a requires that instructions for periodic maintenance, which are necessary for the ELT's continued airworthiness, be provided with each unit manufactured under the TSO. These instructions must contain specific information to ensure that appropriately rated persons will be able to inspect and maintain ELT's in an airworthy condition to meet the needs of the flying public and the SAR community. Manufacturers of the earlier (TSO&hyph;C91) ELT's, however, were not required to submit periodic maintenance instructions to the FAA with their TSO approval applications. Therefore, the content and usefulness of instructions provided with TSO&hyph;C91 ELT's may vary, depending on the approach used by each manufacturer.
