In a statement to PRENSA LATINA, Morales said the integrationist trend was evinced during recent meetings held by the Latin American Economic System and at the Ibero-American Summit. The spirit is very healthy for the hemisphere -- Morales said -- because it opens the path toward the continent's economic unity, which will put the area in a better position to compete with blocs in other areas of the world. Morales said the AEC is made up of three regional blocs, the Anglo-Caribbean Community (Caricom), the Central American Integration System (SICA), and the Group of Three, made up of Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia. We hope this integrationist trend to link all regional blocs on the continent, including Mercosur [Common Market of the South] (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay) and the Andean Pact (Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Colombia), will continue, he added. Morales said he will attend a technical meeting in Caracas on 27 and 28 June to complete the future organization's charter. In addition, he said, we will continue to work on new subjects, like the AEC's working agenda and formulas for the secretariat's structure and operation. He confirmed that a foreign ministers meeting will be held on 29 June in Caracas, where the charter will be approved and the date and place for the definitive creation of the AEC will be established. So far, Bridgetown, the capital of Barbados, is scheduled to begin receiving on 4 July heads of state of member countries to form the AEC, which is regarded as an intergovernmental organization for regional consensus, consultation, and cooperation.
