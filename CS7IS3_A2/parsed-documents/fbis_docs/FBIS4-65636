Greek Foreign Ministry Spokesman Konstandinos Bikas said alternative solutions to the Cyprus issue should also be examined, adding that it is not possible to continue the current time consuming process. This, he said, is necessary because of the continuing Turkish intransigence and the lack of political will, which were confirmed at the latest meeting between Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's deputy special representative in Cyprus, and [Turkish Cypriot Leader Rauf] Denktas.
