One of these decisions, he stressed, is the disarmament of Cyprus. President Kliridhis made his statement this morning at Larnaca Airport before leaving for Strasbourg, where he will address the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly. President Kliridhis was talking with regard to the backstage deliberations at the Security Council regarding the UN secretary general's report. With the intervention Of Britain, the president said, the first report prepared by the UN secretary general's representatives in Cyprus did not circulate officially. The second one, which was prepared later, did. But the president said the British side claimed it intervened so that no report would circulate for 15 days so as to give the Turkish side time to accept the documents. President Kliridhis revealed that the UN secretary general's report, which was not circulated, noted very clearly that the Turkish Cypriot side does not have the political will to find a solution. He said the report also noted that there was no progress on the substance of the Cyprus issue or the Butrus-Ghali ideas, because there was no political will from the Turkish side. [passage omitted]
