Selective trade sanctions against state sector enterprises -- a compromise solution that has been mooted in Washington -- would be "impossible" to implement, they said. The retaliatory measures would apply mainly to trade, but would also include foreign investment and imports as well as other non- economic areas such as culture, said Jiao Sunfen, director-general of the foreign investment department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation. "The actual measures are still a secret, but you can be sure our retaliation will be no lighter than the US measures against China," she said. In the area of foreign investment, restrictions would be placed on the mainland investments of US enterprises which approved of the cancellation of MFN, she said. "When approving projects, we will approve other (countries) first and then take differing treatment for different US companies," she said. "If the US company opposes (the cancellation of MFN) we will give them some encouragement," she said. "Others will face some restrictions." Asked whether every US company investing in China would have to state publicly its attitude on the issue, Jiao said her department would "investigate and learn about" each company instead. The proposed countermeasure strategy is consistent with the Chinese Communist Party's "united front" approach to foreign affairs, in which friendly forces in foreign countries are invited to stand with Beijing in return for certain rewards. Jiao said every department of the Chinese government would be asked for suggestions on retaliatory measures. Jiao had just returned from the US as a member of the delegation to New York and Los Angeles led by the Foreign Trade Minister, Wu Yi, to drum up support for MFN extension. She said most of the 750 companies that attended seminars in the two cities opposed the linking of trade and human rights. "This feeling is clearer this year than last. Even the US Treasury Secretary, Lloyd Bentsen, said the two should not be linked," she said. China's foreign investment -- about 7 per cent of which is from the US -- would feel "some effects" if MFN were denied, but the losses would mainly be felt by US companies already in China which exported mainly to the US. Jiao said steps to improve human rights in China were "necessary", but that this was a matter for senior leaders to decide. "But these steps are not to say the human rights situation in China was bad before, or that because of the unreasonable US pressure we are taking measures to improve human rights." Also speaking in Guangzhou yesterday was the president of Citic Trading, Xu Shiwei. Xu said China's purchases of large high-technology items from the US including Boeing aircraft would be curtailed if MFN were not renewed. "We certainly would take this step. It would mean the US would lose the market" said Xu, who was formerly commercial counsellor to the European Community. Xu said the proposed targeting of state-owned companies would be "impossible" to implement from a political and a practical point of view. "Not giving MFN to state enterprises is tantamount to saying no to China, because state enterprises are the mainstay of our economy," he said.
