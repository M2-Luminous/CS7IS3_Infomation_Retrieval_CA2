FR941012-0-00141 FR941012-0-00011 In the final rule, OSHA has expanded this provision to provide that no work is commenced until yarded trees are stabilized and safely located. OSHA believes it is necessary to apply this provision to all work done in the area of yarded trees. The WIR survey indicates that the single greatest cause of accidents in the logging industry is being injured by a tree, log or limb and a significant number of employees were injured performing bucking and limbing (Ex. 2&hyph;1). If operations, such as bucking or limbing, are located too close to other work operations, unsuspecting loggers could be injured by a rolling log. Moreover, if yarded trees or stacks of trees are not stabilized, loggers performing work activities involving these trees could be at substantial risk of injury if the unstabilized trees move, shift or roll. In the final rule, OSHA has not retained two proposed requirements from this paragraph. The first would have required the examination of spar trees for defects before they are rigged. This provision has been deleted because it relates to the construction of cable yarding systems that is not covered by the final rule. The second provision would have required unstable trees and spars to be guyed to ensure stability. Some commenters said that requiring employees to climb on and rig unstable trees presents a greater hazard than does felling an unguyed tree (Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;21). The weight of the climber and his rigging gear could cause the tree to break off and fall over, resulting in serious injury or death to the climber. OSHA has addressed in other ways the hazards associated with danger trees through other practice requirements. For example, the final rule requires danger trees to be felled or removed before any work can be commenced in the area. Loading and Unloading Paragraph (h)(6) of the final rule specifies various work practice requirements regarding loading and unloading trees onto transport machines or vehicles. These requirements were based on those in the 1978 logging standard and various State logging standards (Ex. 2&hyph;17, 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20, 2&hyph;22, 38J, 38K). OSHA believes these work practices are necessary to protect employees from being hit by machines, vehicles, trees and logs during loading and unloading. The WIR survey indicates that five percent of the injuries reported occurred during loading or unloading (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The State of Washington study indicated that five percent of all deaths occurred during loading and unloading operations (Ex. 4&hyph;129). Paragraph (h)(6)(i) of the final rule requires that the transport machine or vehicle be positioned to provide working clearance between the vehicle and deck of trees or logs. This provision parallels the requirement contained in the proposed rule. The 1978 ANSI logging standard contained a similar provision. Several commenters supported the need for adequate room between transport equipment and trees or logs (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). These commenters pointed out that room needs to be provided on the landing for the transport machine or vehicle and its counterweights, especially when landings are on sloped terrain. The record supports these commenters' position. According to the State of Washington study, almost 10 percent of all deaths reported occurred when an employee was struck by mobile equipment and five percent of all deaths involved employees performing loading operations (Ex. 4&hyph;129). OSHA believes that the employer must consider several factors in determining an adequate work clearance for loading and unloading. These factors include, but are not limited to, the type of loading machine and transport vehicle being used, the physical characteristics of the load being moved, and the layout of the area where the operation is being conducted. For example, if the vehicle is a self-loading log truck, it will have to be positioned close to the deck of logs to allow the truck to be loaded. On the other hand, if a crane or other material handling machine is used to load and unload the transport vehicle, the machine must be positioned so that it can reach both the deck of logs and the vehicle without exceeding the rated capacity of the machine. Paragraph (h)(6)(ii) of the final rule requires that only the loading or unloading machine operator and other personnel that the employer demonstrates are essential shall be allowed in the work area during loading and unloading. This provision parallels the provision contained in the proposed rule and in the 1978 ANSI logging standard. There were no comments opposing this provision. OSHA believes this provision is necessary because, as discussed above, many injuries and fatalities in the logging industry involve loading operations. For example, the State of Washington study reported that three employees were killed when they were struck by logs falling from the transport vehicle during loading (Ex. 4&hyph;129).
