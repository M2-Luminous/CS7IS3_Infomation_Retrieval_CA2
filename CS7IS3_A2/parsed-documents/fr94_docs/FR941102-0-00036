FR941102-0-00036 FR941102-0-00006 12 CFR Parts 225 and 262 [Regulation Y; Docket No. R&hyph;0853] Applications Under Regulation Y AGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. ACTION: Interim rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: These rules implement the streamlined notice procedure recently enacted in Section 319 of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (``Riegle Act'') for the formation of a new bank holding company that results from a corporate reorganization of a bank by the current shareholders of the bank. These rules also implement section 321 of the Riegle Act, which amends the Bank Holding Company Act and the Bank Merger Act to authorize the Board to shorten the post-approval waiting period for bank acquisitions and mergers (during which time the United States Attorney General may review the competitive effects of a proposal approved by the Board) from 30 to 15 days with the consent of the United States Attorney General. Because the procedures prescribed by section 319 and section 321 are effective immediately, the Board has proposed the following as an interim rule that will take effect immediately. The Board is seeking comments on this interim rule, and will amend the rule as needed to address the comments received. The Board also is currently developing additional initiatives to reduce the regulatory burden associated with its application and notice procedures, and invites comment on any suggestions in furtherance of these initiatives. DATES: Interim Rule effective on November 2, 1994; comments must be received by December 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should refer to Docket No. R&hyph;0853 and may be mailed to William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 20th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20551.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 3(a) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)) (``BHC Act'') requires Federal Reserve Board approval prior to consummating certain transactions resulting in the formation of a bank holding company, or in the acquisition by a bank holding company of shares or control of a bank, subject to certain exceptions. Section 319 of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;325, section 319, 108 Stat. 2160, 2224 (1994)(``Section 319'')) amends section 3 of the BHC Act to establish a notice procedure for the formation of a new bank holding company resulting from a corporate reorganization that involves substantially the same shareholders. 1 In connection with section 319, section 320 of the Riegle Act provides an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 for securities issued by a bank holding company pursuant to such a reorganization. 1 Section 319 also amends section 5(d)(3) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1815(d)(3))_commonly referred to as the ``Oakar Amendment''_to eliminate the requirement for prior Board approval of transactions by banks owned by holding companies to merge with thrift institutions. Under the Riegle Act, Oakar transactions continue to require the prior approval of the appropriate Federal banking agency for the acquiring institution, and all Oakar transactions must comply with section 3(d) of the BHC Act, the ``Douglas Amendment.'' No amendments to the Board's regulations are needed to implement these amendments to section 5(d)(3). In addition, section 321 of the Riegle Act (Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;325, section 321, 108 Stat. 2160, 2226 (1994)(``Section 321'') permits the Board, with the consent of the U.S. Attorney General, to shorten the post-approval waiting period for bank acquisitions and mergers from 30 days to 15 days. The interim rule implement the provisions enacted in sections 319 and 321 of the Riegle Act. Comment is invited on all aspects of these proposals. Formation of a New Bank Holding Company Under Section 319 By its terms, the notice procedure added by section 319 2 applies only if certain conditions are met. Specifically, the formation of a new bank holding company may be consummated 30 days after providing written notice to the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank if: (1) The shareholders of the bank will acquire, as a result of the reorganization, the shares of the newly formed bank holding company in substantially the same proportional interest as they held in the bank; (2) the bank holding company would meet, and its resulting subsidiary bank would meet, certain financial and capital standards; (3) the bank holding company would not, as a result of the reorganization, acquire other banking or nonbanking interests; and (4) during the 30-day notice period, the Reserve Bank or the Board does not object to the proposal. 2 Any application to organize a bank holding company that was filed with a Reserve Bank prior to September 23, 1994 will continue to be processed under the existing rules.
