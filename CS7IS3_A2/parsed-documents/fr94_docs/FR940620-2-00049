FR940620-2-00049 FR940620-2-00028 Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement on the Draft Pacific Coastal Barriers Study AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice advises the public that the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) intends to gather information necessary for the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Pacific Coastal Barriers Study and accompanying maps (Study) that have been mandated by the Coastal Barriers Improvement Act of 1990. This notice is being furnished as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Regulations (40 CFR 1501.7) to inform other agencies and the public on the scope of issues to be addressed in the EIS. Comments and participation in this scoping process were solicited by the FWS from other agencies and the public during the preparation of the Draft Study. All previous public comments received by the FWS during the review of the Draft Study are being reviewed and will be considered part of the scoping process for the preparation of this EIS. DATES: Written comments should be received by July 20, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be addressed to: Regional Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 911 N.E. 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232&hyph;4181. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Paula Levin, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 911 N.E. 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232&hyph;4181, (503) 231&hyph;2068. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Ronald Singer is the primary author of this document. Coastal barriers are unique landforms which provide protection for diverse aquatic habitats and serve as the mainland's first line of defense against the impacts of coastal storms and erosion. Congress recognized the vulnerability of coastal barriers to development by passing the Coastal Barriers Resource Act in 1982 (CBRA). CBRA (Public Law 97&hyph;348) established the Coastal Barriers Resources System (System) that prohibits all new Federal expenditures and financial assistance within the units of that system unless specifically excepted by the CBRA. This action was taken because Federal expenditures and financial assistance have the effect of encouraging development of coastal barriers. By restricting these Federal expenditures, Congress intended to minimize the loss of human life, wasteful expenditure of Federal revenues, and damage to fish, wildlife, and other natural resources associated with coastal barriers along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts. In 1990, Congress passed the Coastal Barrier Improvement Act (CBIA). The CBIA (Public Law 101&hyph;591) tripled the size of the system by adding coastal barriers of the Great Lakes as well as additional areas along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts. The coastal barrier system currently includes 560 units, comprising almost 1.3 million acres and about 1,200 shoreline miles. The CBIA also directed the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) to prepare a study which examines the need for protecting undeveloped coastal barriers along the Pacific coast of the United States south of 49 degrees north latitude through inclusion in the system. This area includes the States of California, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington; American Samoa; Guam; the Northern Marianas; and all other Pacific Ocean territories and possessions of the United States. In addition, the Secretary was directed to prepare maps identifying the boundaries of undeveloped coastal barriers within this area. The Secretary delegated the authority to develop the Study and accompanying maps of undeveloped coastal barriers of the Pacific Coast to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). Notices of availability of FWS-developed Draft Coastal Barrier Maps were published in the Federal Register on April 23, 1992 (57 FR 14846) for Oregon; May 29, 1992 (57 FR 22821) for Washington; July 7, 1992 (57 FR 29883) for California; and August 14, 1992 (57 FR 36668) for Hawaii. Following the 90 day public comment period, the draft maps were revised to address any technical errors noted during the comment period. The revised draft maps, and all comments received, were forwarded to appropriate State Governors for their review and use in formulation of recommendations as to which State areas should be included in the System. The FWS developed the required Draft Study and revised draft maps of areas under consideration for inclusion in the Coastal Barrier Resources System in 1993. The FWS made the Draft Study and maps available for a 60 day public review and comment period on December 17, 1993 (58 F.R. 66016). Appropriate State Governors were afforded an additional 30 days for review and comment. On February 23, 1994, the FWS extended the public comment period until March 25, 1994, and for appropriate State Governors until April 25, 1994. Between January 5, 1994, and January 18, 1994, a total of 15 public meetings were held in Oregon, Washington, California, and Hawaii regarding the draft study and accompanying maps. Press releases were issued in all affected areas. Mailings of the draft maps and Study were provided to individuals and central locations on FWS mailing lists, supplemented by mailing lists provided by State Coastal Zone Management program managers. Announcements of availability of the maps and Study were also widely disseminated. Coastal barrier units which occur on Tribal lands were included on the 1991 draft maps but deleted from the 1993 study maps at the request of the Tribal sovereign nations. Neither the CBRA nor the CBIA provide guidance regarding the inclusion of Tribal lands in the System. However, inclusion of coastal barrier units which occur on Tribal lands in the System would meet the purposes of the Act, particularly given the sensitive living resources associated with these areas. Recognizing the sovereignty of the Native American nations, the Department of the Interior (Department) solicited the input and recommendations from each affected Tribe during the formulation of the Draft Study. These Tribal recommendations will be submitted to Congress with the Department's final Study recommendations or at a later date following appropriate coordination. The environmental review of the Draft Pacific Coastal Barriers Study and accompanying maps will be conducted by the FWS in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4371 et seq), other appropriate Federal regulations, and FWS procedures for compliance with those regulations. The Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) will be made available to the public for review and comment by Spring, 1995. Dated: June 14, 1994. Thomas Dwyer, Acting Regional Director.
