The clear political negotiation result was turned in Aho's mouth into the negotiation basis for an EU agreement. Arto Nieminen reports: [Nieminen] After Prime Minister Aho's domestic comments it was very difficult to believe that Finland and Sweden had achieved negotiation results on the same day. While Sweden raised glasses to the negotiation result, actually a victory, the agreement had changed between Brussels and Helsinki into nothing more than the basis for talks on an agreement. In other words, according to Aho, Finland now has a result that provides the basis for achieving a result, whatever that means. This is what Aho had to say during the night: [Begin Aho recording] This settlement will not go to a referendum. I listened to a piece of news that said that if the referendum accepts this, then the matter is clear. This is not an agreement to join the EU. This is a political solution that enables the conclusion of an agreement to join the EU. Much work is still to be done on this that must be brought to a conclusion. In addition, I would like to stress here that quite a few of these matters were left dependent on our national actions and I am sure it is in the interest and to the advantage of all that the content of these national solutions will soon be clear. [end recording] [Nieminen] According to Aho, at first it must be clarified what the agreement actually contains in detail. Negotiations will be started on the domestic subsidy measures which the EU agreement requires. Thus, further negotiations are to be held at least in Finland. Aho thought that about a week would be spent on studying the agreement. [passage omitted]
