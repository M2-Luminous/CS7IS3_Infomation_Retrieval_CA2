Quite simply because BASE already occupies a strong position in each of its special fields of operation. It is within British Aerospace, an island that seems to have been spared by the interplay of mergers, conglomerations, and consolidaitons most of the aviation activities of this British-style industrial empire are currently plagued with. This haven of peace is called BASE, an acronym for British Aerospace Systems and Equipment, and it is a 100 percent subsidiary of the combine that specializes in aviation equipment. BASE employs 1,100 people divided between its head office in Plymouth and Stevenage, the BAe's industrial center for missile operations. At first glance, BASE's activities may seem to be fairly disparate and not particularly complementary to one another: motion detection and flight controls, navigation, optronics, radomes, accident recorders, and, lastly, secured communications. Actually, while these activities still appear to be very diversified, a sorting out process was effected as far back as two years ago. It led to a 30 percent reduction in force and the disappearance of a good many fields in which BASE did not possess significant capability. Following these cuts, Nigel Randall, the general manager of BASE, retained only those special fields in which his company is viable and has its own potential for development. Because, at the British Aerospace level, BASE is a featherweight with its sales volume of about 50 million pounds sterling (Fr435 million) as against 4 billion pounds for the combine. And its activities quite obviously do not figure centrally in the combine's chief strategies. Therefore, Nigel Randall has to run his company like an independent business that must find its own markets, clear a regular profit margin, and be able to finance itself. With regard to its main specialty, motion detection and control surface activators, Nigel Randall presents BASE as the bigges European manufacturer of gyros, an activity fostered over the years by equipping the missiles produced by the parent company. The company also inherited the activities of Sperry GB, taken over in the mid-1980s, and has developed its own fiber-optic gyrolaser and gyrometer techniques on the basis of those activities. With 60 of its LINS 300 gyro units produced to date (see box), BASE, along with Sextant Avionics, is currently the only European manufacturer to mass produce inertial gyrolaser units. These gyro units have already been delivered installed on British Aerospace aircraft, the Hawk 100 and 200s, but also on the Anglo-Italian EH-101 helicopter and on the F-5retrofits in the Near East. In its second special field, navigation, BASE has developed a digital cartography system, Terprom (terrain profile matching), which has been retained by the U.S. Air Force on its F-16s. Based on a Mil-Std-1750A processor, this equipment makes use of the digitized terrain that it has in its memory bank and the soundings of the radio altimeter to re-erect the aircraft's navigation system with an accuracy range of 40 meters. To date, Terprom has racked up over 700 sorties, 500 of them on the F-16. The third special field: optronics, in which BASE has developed Autotrack, a video gyrocompass ball with truly universal capabilities since it can be found mounted on surface, naval, or airborne platforms, as the core of fire-control units for the Rapier 2000 ground-to-air and Swingfire antitank missiles, the Sea Archer naval antiaircraft cannon, and, lastly, GEC-Marconi's new TIALD laser designation pod. BASE's fourth special field, radomes, was also developed with British Aerospace missiles. So, naturally, this activity was established in Stevenage. BASE produces radomes for the whole possible range of carrier speeds: from polyester radomes for transport aircraft to the ceramic radomes of multiple-mach missile via epoxy for supersonic aircraft and polyimide for missiles. With regard to BASE's fifth special field, accident recorders, Nigel Randall pointed out that there has never been any reason for complaining that their recorders ever lost any data during a crash over 30 years of service. Today, 15 different types of aircraft are equipped with BASE recorders, from the old Vickers VC-10s to the latest Tornados. The sixth and last field is secured communications. Classified under this field, we find products as diverse as HF and VHF antennas, interface modules for the Mil-Std-1553, Stanag 3910, Arinc 429 and 629 buses, and, lastly, the MPS2000 secured air freight system that the Royal Air Force has just ordered. BASE has today reached a turning point in its development. Having for a long time made a living form markets overlooked by its combine, the subsidiary is now turning resolutely toward the competitive market. For example, it has been smart enough to develope ceramic accelerometers and gyrometers that are cheap--but capable of withstanding acceleration forces of up to 10,000 Gs--for Merlin mortar shells. Toward the end of this year 1,000 m[.sup]2[/] of surface area provided with precision machines were allocated for the production of these sensors at the Plymouth plant, which enabled them to step up the production rate to 100 units a month. Today, plans are ready for increasing the pace to 100,000 a month by three years from now to tackle the automobile market through the Japanese Sumitomo combine, with which BASE is discussing the venture. The marketing of radomes is competitive. The successes recently recorded outside the parent company prove it: radomes for the Eurofighter 2000, the Brazilian AMX, the Catrin d'Agusta helicopter for battlefield surveillance, and the Pakistani Mirage III and Singapore F-5 retrofits. This led BASE to open a shop this year for repairs on radomes for Boeing 737 and 767s in addition to the work it already had with the BAe 125 and 146s. To get next year off to a start, BASE is putting a new generation of static memory recorders on the market which combine in the same housing the recording of conversations and of aircraft parameters (A & C No. 1448). The idea being to install two identical combined recorders per aircraft to ensure total redundance of recordings and to ward even farther off the risks of loss of data in the envent of a crash. BASE provides thehardening of its recorders against crashes and has formed a partnership with the Japanese firm, Kokusai, which supplies the memory units and, in return, permits the British company to have access to the Japanese Air Force market. As we can see, Nigel Randall is not lacking in projects for his company. But, declining to divulge overly many figures when he was questioned, he contented himself with asserting his very great confidence in the future of his company, whose sales, according to him, should show a growth rate higher than 50 percent over the next few years. Box: British Aerospace Bridgehead in NH90 It is not easy for a British equipment manufacturer to establish himself in a program in which England is not participating. Let's not make ourselves out to be angels; the reverse is probably also true. And yet, this is the challenge that Andy Parritt, who is in charge of BASE sales, has set himself for his LINS 300 inertial gyrolaser unit, which he wants to install in the NH90, a French-Italian-German-Dutch helicopter program. Nevertheless, Andy Parritt is not acting rashly and he carefully evaluated his chances of success before launching on this venture. For him, the NH90 no longer resembles past joint programs. In those programs political considerations blocked the interaction and forced them to divide up the tasks among the member states, sometimes even at the most elementary levels. Andy Parritt is familiar with this situation: His company shares the building of the Eurofighter radome with an Italian partner, Alenia, a Spanish partner, INTA [National Institute for Aerospace Research], and a German partner, DASA [German Aerospace] (ex-TST). And his gyrolaser unit has not been retained for this same aircraft in order to redistribute the responsibilities to Italy, to the advantage of a unit to be supplied by Lital--but whose gyros are to be manufactured by Litton in the United States! As concerns the NH90, on the other hand, the distribution of responsibilities among the states was effected at the higher level to leave more room for the training of the teams that are candidates for the program. And this was done in the name of a certain measure of economic efficiency, necessary under the circumstances because they will have to be able to offer the helicopter on the more competitive civil aircraft market. Thus Andy Parritt draws the conclusion that he has been offered a chance. His LINS 300 unit is credited with existing in a version that was developed for the EH-101 helicopter, whose basic missions (antisubmarine warfare and search and rescue) are similar to those of the naval NH90. These missions are the most demanding from the point of view of navigation and they will determine the dimensions of the future European helicopter's guidance systems. Thus Andy Parritt explained that his gyro unit could be adapted to the NH90 specifications at a lower cost. Specifically, BASE has developed some functions for the EH-101 that are particularly appreciated for a naval helicopter. Thus the LINS 300 is capable of aligning itself in flight by automatically re-erecting itself on the basis of data from the GPS [global positioning system] or the Doppler radiosonde, over water as well, which makes it possible to take off from land by shunting the few minutes normally required to complete an alignment or at sea without any special device for loading the ship's reference data into the helicopter's computers. This ease of operation of the LINS 300 does not, nevertheless, compromise its accuracy, which reaches the 0.2� mark, thus allowing the helicopter to in flight designate to its carrier vesselits objectives on the surface of the water so that it can adjust its guns. Andy Parritt confided to us that he is right now finalizing a partnership agreement with a French specialist in navigation. Contacts have also been made with Eurocopter France at a higher level. Even if the struggle is not an easy one for Andy Parritt, the combine to which he belongs is already offering the Tiger, in a joint venture with Eurocopter, in the British call for bids for an attack helicopter. In the event this bid is successful, BASE's presence in the NH90 program would be a ready-made occasion for a round of compensations which Her Majesty's government would not fail to demand. So Andy Parritt has decided to try his luck.
