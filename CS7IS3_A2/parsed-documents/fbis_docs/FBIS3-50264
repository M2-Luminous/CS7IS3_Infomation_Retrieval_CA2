[Fridner] Your most recent guest comes from a country that became independent only recently. How has the emergence and existence of this state, the Slovak Republic, been received in Poland? [Walesa] I do not really know how it has been received in Poland. We know that we have to be neighbors, that our relations must be good, and they have the chance to be so. We are only in the process of forming them. How they will look depends on how successful we are going to be in forming them. I am convinced that we are going to be good neighbors, and we will do everything in our power so that our respective countries benefit from the neighborhood. [Fridner] Are you aware of any political problems between our two countries? [Walesa] No, I am not aware of any problems. We can be satisfied with our talks and experience to date. That is, however, just a matter of political experience and declarations. So far, we have not been able to project the good into deeds. Of course, we must understand that one cannot ask much from a state that has been organizing for only one year. I am convinced that as the two countries will be able to put their domestic affairs in order, our cooperation will develop and we will reap more benefit therefrom. There are no limits. We have the desire and great hope, but something must be done about their realization. We, politicians, can create the conditions, but we cannot substitute for the directors, managers, or bank owners, who must convert our fine resolutions to practical measures. [Fridner] That will apparently be the issue in question. Despite the good political relations between our countries, the economic relations have not been developing very favorably. The mutual trade indicators have been declining over the past few years. Are you aware of something that could change this trend? [Walesa] I would really like to do everything I can to reverse these adverse tendencies. If we had a centrally controlled command system, we might have compelled something. In the system based on economic freedom, however, it is difficult to force the bankers or private businessmen to cooperate. I am convinced that we will show each other what is attractive in our respective countries, and this will be a stimulus for the people who intend to realize our hopes. [Fridner] Do you think that these questions will play a significant role in your upcoming talks with President Kovac? [Walesa] I know from our previous meetings with President Kovac that we think alike. I hope that he will bring along people who deal with specific problems, people from enterprises, financiers, and managers. We will get them together with such people from our side, and instruct them to scrutinize our economic possibilities in an expert, technical manner. [Fridner] Both our countries belong to the Central European region. The guarantee of the security of this region is among its main problems, and that particularly after the reinforcement of the nationalist tendencies in Russia. How do you feel about the situation after the Brussels NATO Summit and the trip of the U.S. President to Europe? My premise is that, in Prague, you had a chance to meet with President Clinton and the presidents of the countries of the Visegrad Group. [Walesa] We have attained that for which we hoped. Unfortunately, the dearth of solidarity and teamwork on our part has become obvious. Therefore, certain problems have been solved for us by others. I am not denigrating the significance of the Partnership for Peace idea. If we deal jointly with some problems, we can benefit from this initiative in the future. As I say, however, there must be solidarity among us. There must be solidarity in dealing with our common problems. The question of security is one of them. I can tell you that, with President Kovac, we understand each other very well regarding this issue. There is a certain difference of opinion between us and the Czechs, but if we act together, the Czechs will also support us. The U.S. Partnership proposal may be a good idea. Nevertheless, its effect on us will depend on our application. [Fridner] After the Prague meeting, several commentaries proclaimed that the Visegrad Group was buried there, that it is dead. Do you share this view? [Walesa] If that were true, it would be against the logic of the present world. After all, if the borders are to be overcome, a regional cooperation is simply a fact, and you cannot do anything about it. One can form various configurations but they must be all based on what the life brings. We are here, in this region, and we are closer to one another than we are to America or elsewhere. The Hungarians, you, and Poland agree on this. Even the Czechs agree, if not on all issues. So far, it has not been politically necessary for us to speak in a single voice. Such a unity was only necessary on issues like the abrogation of the Warsaw Pact or CEMA [Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]. The Czechs are right that we are not facing similar problems right now. Regional cooperation is unavoidable. I am in favor of those of us who agree with it taking certain organizational steps now. It can be a cooperation between the Defense or Foreign Ministries, oriented at solving various problems. In some questions we can proceed jointly, in others individually. [Fridner] You were one of the main protagonists of the struggle against the communist totalitarianism. How do you feel about the presence of the left-wing forces in the Polish Government, moreover, forces that are to a great degree rooted in the communist camp? [Walesa] I have spoken about it a lot, and I have not changed my opinion. After 50 years of the one-party system, people are divided into the active and the passive. The active people are further divided into those prepared and those unprepared. The best prepared people come from the power circles. The less prepared are the ones who did not have the power, for instance the members of the Solidarity movement in Poland. Now, as the better prepared rejected all the elements that used to instill society with anxiety, as they promise to build a free social order, a market economy, their superior preparation gives them a better chance of success. Peoples do not wish to fight all the time. They fight when they do not like something, and then they return to work. Those, who offer better solutions, win elections. After some time, five-ten years, when we look at the programs again, we will redistribute ourselves politically. There will be an opportunity to prepare oneself for the government and fulfillment of the program. Actually, nothing happened in Poland, it is a certain law of nature, and similar occurrences can be expected in all other countries. [Fridner] Do you believe that the left wing will continue with the reform process initiated by the Solidarity governments? [Walesa] I, as president, and all the other active people, even if less prepared for government, will be on guard regarding our orientation. We will not allow a change of what we have achieved. We will intervene at the slightest deviation. The system, which has been established now, is a good one. The parliament is not as divided as it used to be. We "won in quarrels" various things, but the issues in question were in fact legal solutions. The current parliament is almost unanimous and has a good chance of collecting everything that the previous period indicated and turn it into laws very rapidly. It is a very interesting situation from the vantage point of Polish history. [Fridner] The Slovak public is quite interested in the fate of their countrymen, the Slovaks living in the most southern part of Poland. To what degree does the Polish state help to implement the rights of this minority, particularly in the spheres of education, culture, and religious services? [Walesa] These are specific affairs, and they should be dealt with by the governments. Since you asked me, however, I would like to say this: If we are going to be in an integral Europe, these issues will look different. If we are going to be divided, they will surface. Therefore, I would like all these countries -- Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic -- to get in the same orbit. This would eliminate all talk about matters of this type. Everybody would have the freedom of movement but, at the same time, however, he would keep in mind that we live in the same house. Since this has not happened, these problems prevail, and we differ in opinion on them, we can be even dissatisfied. That is, because we are not a part of an integral European organism, there are differences resulting in further differences, and they give rise to problems that lead to such a question as you asked me.
