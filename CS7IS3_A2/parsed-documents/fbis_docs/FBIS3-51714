The privatization of the company has been postponed for the third time, and should be completed tomorrow. The auction was not concluded because only 64 percent of the shares, worth 90 billion real cruzeiros, had been sold. In order to transfer the company it is necessary to sell 75 percent of the shares. Brokers will bid for the remaining shares tomorrow. The auction lasted 11 minutes. The demonstrators, who were on the streets and did not get close to the stock market building because of security measures, decided to stage a march during which they stoned the facades of several banks in downtown Rio de Janeiro. A military policeman was wounded in the face, and a military police battalion closed the street. [passage omitted] The march cut off traffic in Rio Branco Avenue, one of the main downtown avenues, and ended in front of the Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation] building. Two people were reported wounded during the incidents, but no one was reported arrested.
