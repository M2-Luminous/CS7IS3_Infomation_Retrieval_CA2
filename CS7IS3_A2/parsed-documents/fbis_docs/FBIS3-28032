He branded the present South Korean regime as a fascist, treacherous regime seeking confrontation. He said Kim Yong-sam has intensified the suppression of the people, keeping intact the fascist laws and repressive tools of the "Sixth Republic" through false reforms, wearing the "civilian" veil. "Kim Yong-sam has driven South Korea deeper into the position of double domination of U.S. and Japan, totally frozen the North-South relations and continuously staged the nuclear war exercises," he noted.
