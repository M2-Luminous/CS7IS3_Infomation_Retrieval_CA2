On the occasion of this historical day, the national agricultural conference will be magnificently opened in Pyongyang, the revolutionary capital, amid the great interest of all the people and agricultural workers. This conference will be a rally of victors vigorously demonstrating the greatness and invincible vitality of our party's program of socialist rural construction, and a new milestone in developing our country's socialist rural economy onto a higher stage. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song sent a historical letter, "For the Ultimate Solution of the Rural Question Under the Banner of the Socialist Rural Theses," to the national agricultural conference. In the letter, the respected and beloved leader proudly summed up the victorious achieved by our party and people in the struggle to implement the rural theses, and presented a militant task to bring about a new upsurge in the rural construction. This letter is a banner of struggle which makes it possible to achieve a historical victory in ultimately solving the rural question which is the most difficult problem in socialist construction. On the day of the 30th anniversary of the publication of the rural theses, we have once again received the great classical work which brilliantly elucidates the future of our socialist farms. This is a great happiness for our people and agricultural workers. Our people and agricultural workers are looking back with pride at the historical course that achieved great victory and change in the socialist rural construction under the leadership of the party and the leader. The socialist rural theses published 30 years ago, was a historical event greatly significant for the revolutionary struggle of our people for the victory of the chuche socialist cause. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il pointed out: The "Theses on the Socialist Rural Question in Our Country," provided by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is our party's program of the rural construction, and a magnificent blueprint to ultimately solve the rural question. Correctly solving the rural question is a fundamental problem related to the success or failure of the socialist cause. The work to firmly consolidate politically, ideologically, materially, and technically the socialist system and to achieve complete victory in socialism are greatly dependent on how to solve the rural question. From the early days, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song put great emphasis on the question of farmers and agriculture and put forth all his energy to solve it. He published the rural theses at a historical period when it was imminently demanding to elucidate the correct road in the socialist rural construction. Thus, he gave a complete explanation in this important question of the era. The rural theses is a chuche-oriented rural construction program which wholly elucidates all theoretical and practical problems that arise in the socialist rural construction such as the essential content of the socialist rural question, the fundamental principle in solving it, and the basic task and method to carry out the rural construction. With the presentation of the rural theses, the road to industrialize and modernize agriculture, revolutionize and achieve working classification of the farmers, and to create farms, which were dominated by century-old backwardness, into abundant and civilized socialist farms, were clearly elucidated. The publication of the theses was an event of the era which provided a shortcut in constructing a classless society and a completely successful socialist society which man had so earnestly desired. In the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's ideological and theoretical achievements, he pioneered a new turning point in the socialist construction theory because he put forth a magnificent program in the socialist rural construction from the early days, and embraced faith in socialism to the world's revolutionary people. This cannot by any means be weighed at any cost. The 30 years from the time of the publication of the theses up until the present were 30 years of victory and traits in which the most brilliant examples were created in solving the socialist rural question. The circumstances of our socialist construction in the past were not smooth at all. We accelerated socialist rural construction under a difficult condition in which the nation was divided and the imperialists' vicious aggressive maneuvers prevailed. However, thanks to the great rural theses, our people and agricultural workers could brilliantly resolve difficult and gigantic tasks raised in socialist rural construction. The great vitality of the rural theses has been fully demonstrated in the fact that our socialist rural economic system has been firmly consolidated politically, ideologically, materially and technologically. As the result of brilliant implementation of the three lines of the revolution--ideological, technological and cultural--put forward by the rural theses, our peasants' political and ideological outlook and our farms' material and technological foundation have been changed beyond recognition. Today our agricultural workers, assuming the chuche idea--our party's great revolutionary ideology--as their firm faith, have been united with the party and the leader [suryong] more firmly than ever, and are highly displaying the noble fine communist customs. Even amid antisocialist maneuvers unprecedentedly intensified by the imperialists and reactionaries in recent years, our agricultural workers firmly defended the agricultural front by absolutely trusting only the party and the leader without a slightest degree of wavering. This clearly demonstrates their noble spiritual and moral outlook. The great changes effected in our peasants' ideological and mental world and work-style are the most precious achievement incomparable to several million tons of grains. A great advance was registered in implementing the rural technological revolution through the struggle to carry to accomplishment the rural theses. The task of introducing water utilization system and electrification was realized a long time ago, and the task of mechanization and chemicalization was also achieved. As the result, the historic task of rural technological revolution set forth in the socialist rural theses has been accomplished basically. Last year, in the wake of the 30th anniversary of publication of the theses, we attained a unprecentedly good harvest by overcoming serious phenomena of abnormal weather. This clearly proves how mighty the material and technological foundation of our farms is. With brilliant achievement of tasks of rural cultural revolution, the peasants' civilized life has been brought into full bloom and our farms became more look like cities in the cultural field. The political, ideological, material and technological foundation which our people provided amid the struggle to carry to accomplishment the rural theses is very firm. Today socialism takes deep root in our farms and became something indispensable to the life of our agricultural workers. The great vitality of the rural theses has been clearly displayed in the fact that an epoch-making turn was effected in our people's historic advance to achieve the complete victory of socialism. Achievement of complete victory of socialism is a strategic goal which we must attain without fail in socialist and communist construction. The key to accomplishing this task is to remove the class difference between the working class and peasants by solving rural problems. Industrialization and modernization of agriculture and revolutionization and classization of peasants have been vigorously pushed ahead under the banner of the theses. As the result of this, the differences between cities and farms were drastically reduced. In addition, the standard of management and operation in cooperative farms came closer to the advanced management standard of industry. Thus, material and technological means in ownership by all of the people came to have overwhelming weight in agricultural production. All this illustrates that the condition is becoming mature for gradually turning cooperative farms in our country into farms owned by all of the people. We have already solved basic problems in socialist rural construction. We can proudly declare that we have now occupied a lofty peak looking at final solution of agricultural problems. The socialist rural theses also displayed great might in fully demonstrating the superiority of socialism of our own style by smashing the imperialists' antisocialist maneuvers. The imperialists and reactionaries have historically carried out vicious slanderous and smear campaigns against the socialist rural economic system which was established by reflecting the aspirations and desires of the popular masses. Taking advantage of the collapse of the socialist system in some countries, the imperialists carried out antisocialist maneuvers more viciously. The great victory we attained in the struggle to accomplish the rural theses in the past 30 years proved that antisocialist sophism disseminated by the imperialists is a total falsehood. The socialist rural economic system in our country is a most superior rural economic system of our-style which has embodied the chuche idea and is a most solid and vigorous rural economic system that is advancing along the road of socialism based on collectivism. With the brilliant embodiment of the rural theses, agricultural production constantly developed and the peasants' independent and creative life fully bloomed in all domains of politics, economy, and culture in our country. Through the reality of socialism, people came to believe firmly that only socialism can achieve the peasants' long-cherished desire. Indeed, the socialist rural theses put forward by the great leader are an immortal militant banner which enabled us to strengthen our-style socialism into an indomitable stronghold and which provided us with a firm guarantee for the final victory of socialism. The great victory and achievements we attained in the struggle to carry to accomplishment the rural theses in the past are a brilliant fruition of the wise leadership of the respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song. Traces of the leadership of the great leader, who led the rural economic work with tireless and sleepless energy, are embroidered on the road of socialist economic construction in our country. By always putting forward the agricultural front as one of the major offensive fronts in socialist construction, the respected leader personally became the commander and brilliantly resolved all problems--large or small--raised in rural economy and agricultural production. By constantly giving on-the-spot guidance to farms throughout the country, he created the chuche agricultural method--a most scientific farming method suitable to practical situation in our country--and led our agricultural workers to implement the party's agricultural policy. The energetic guidance of the respected leader was a source for us to effect an epoch-making advance in agricultural production. The guidance of the party and the leader over socialist rural construction has been consistent with firm principles. The principle of giving priority to the ideological revolution, which the great leader consistently maintained; the principle of strengthening the guidance of peasants by the working class, the support for agriculture by industry, and support for farms by cities; and the principle of strengthening the party's guidance on rural economy, worked as the banner consolidating our socialist rural positions into indomitable strongholds. Even in recent years when the imperialists' antisocialist maneuvers were carried out more disguisedly, the party and the leader led us so that we can highly demonstrate the superiority of socialist collectivist economy by firmly maintaining the principle of socialism in management and operation of rural economy without a slight degree of wavering. This is a brilliant achievement made by the party and the leader in rural construction. The entire course of socialist rural construction in our country eloquently shows that only by the great party and the great leader with uncommon wisdom, outstanding leadership and firm principle, can the socialist rural problems be brilliantly resolved without a slight deviation and vicissitudes. Today we are faced with the honorable task to consolidate and develop our country's socialist rural economic system and to effect a new upsurge in farm production, based on the great victory we achieved in the socialist rural construction. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught in his recent letter: All functionaries of the agricultural sector and working people should vigorously accelerate the socialist rural construction with exalted faith, upholding the banner of the socialist rural theses. We should, above all, deeply bear the great pride in having the most correct program [kangnyong] for the socialist rural construction and should stoutly carry out the struggle to implement it. The ideological and theoretical policy linked with the great rural theses is our firm guideline for today and tomorrow. All party members and working people should stoutly struggle, being deeply aware of the fact that they can make a new upsurge in the rural construction and farm production only when they advance along the single road elucidated by the theses without deviation. By doing so, they should endlessly glorify the leadership achievements that the great leader have made without sleep or rest for a long time in solving socialist rural problems. All party members and working people should learn in depth the great leader's historical work, "For an Ultimate Solution to Rural Problems Under the Banner of the Socialist Rural Theses," make it their bones and flesh, and stoutly carry out the struggle to implement programmatic tasks presented in the work. In order to implement the heavy task faced by the rural economy today, it is important to intensify and develop the three revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--in accordance with the demand of the socialist rural construction in a new stage. We should intensify indoctrination of the agricultural working people on principles of the chuche idea and should effectively carry out ideological indoctrination, including class and collectivism indoctrination, for them so that they can arm themselves firmly with our party's revolutionary ideology and the chuche idea and can firmly establish a revolutionary view of leader. By doing so, we should make all agricultural working people become resolute fighters who devotedly struggle to protect and defend the socialism of our own style under any situation, with firm faith in the victory of the socialist cause. We should consolidate the results achieved in irrigating, using electronics, mechanization, and the application of science in rural areas and fully demonstrate the might of the results as well as thoroughly implement the chuche farming method, so that we can further develop all domains of farm production, including grain production. All agricultural working people should achieve, without fail, the high goal of grain production presented by the party this year, the first year of the adjusting period [wanchunggi], by greatly displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude, upholding the party's agriculture-first policy. We should continue to concentrate great efforts in elevating the agricultural working people's technological and cultural levels and making our rural areas more civilized, in accordance with the demand of the intellectualization of the entire society. We should vigorously carry out the three revolutions in rural areas, strengthen our support for rural areas, and constantly improve and intensify the guidance and management of rural economy, so as to brilliantly implement the historical task of turning the cooperative property into the all-people property [hyoptongjok soyurul choninminjok soyuro nomginun yoksajok kwaop] in the future. It is important to enhance party organizations' militant functions and role in order to constantly consolidate and develop our socialist rural economic system and to vigorously accelerate the agricultural production. All rural party organizations should intensify ideological indoctrination of a broad range of agricultural working people, unite them more firmly around the party, and actively agitate the masses to implement our party's agriculture-first policy and the chuche farming method. Party organizations should actively help and lead all functionaries of the agricultural economic sector, so that they can deeply bear their honorable duties and missions for the party and the revolution, constantly revolutionize themselves, and vigorously push ahead with the work of implementing the rural theses at the front of the masses. The socialist rural construction, which has entered a new higher stage today, has the endlessly bright future. We will brilliantly achieve the ultimate solution to socialist rural problems in the near future, as long as the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, who is leading the chuche socialist cause along the single road of victory, stands at the forefront, and as long as the glorious Workers Party of Korea leads us. Let us all stoutly struggle to achieve the ultimate solution to socialist rural problems and to consummate the chuche revolutionary cause, firmly united around the party Central Committee headed by the respected and beloved Comrade Kim Il-song. Hurrah for the 30th anniversary of the publication of the great socialist rural theses!
