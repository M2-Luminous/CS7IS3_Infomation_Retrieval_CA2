FR940912-0-00009 FR940912-0-00004 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 9 CFR Part 92 [Docket No. 93&hyph;110&hyph;2] Importation of Horses; Quarantine Requirements AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Affirmation of interim rule as final rule. SUMMARY: We are adopting as a final rule, without change, an interim rule that amended the regulations concerning the importation of horses by adding Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Finland, Guinea-Bissau, the Member States of the European Union, Slovenia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and the nonrecognized areas of the former Yugoslavia (Montenegro and Serbia) to the list of countries where contagious equine metritis (CEM) exists, and by adding Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates to the list of countries considered to be affected with African horse sickness (AHS). Outbreaks of CEM, a highly transmissible venereal disease, have been reported in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Finland, Guinea-Bissau, Slovenia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and the nonrecognized areas of the former Yugoslavia (Montenegro and Serbia). The Member States of the European Union either are affected with CEM or trade horses freely with other Member States that are affected with CEM, without testing the horses for the disease. Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates trade horses freely with other countries where AHS, a fatal viral disease, exists. The interim rule imposed prohibitions or restrictions on the importation of horses that have been in these countries to protect horses in the United States from CEM and AHS. Neither disease is known to exist in the United States. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 12, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Joyce Bowling, Staff Veterinarian, Import-Export Animals Staff, National Center for Import-Export, Veterinary Services, APHIS, USDA, room 766, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;8170. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background In an interim rule effective and published in the Federal Register on May 13, 1994 (59 FR 24886&hyph;24889, Docket No. 93&hyph;110&hyph;1), we amended the regulations in 9 CFR part 92 concerning the importation of horses by adding Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Finland, Guinea-Bissau, the Member States of the European Union, Slovenia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and the nonrecognized areas of the former Yugoslavia (Montenegro and Serbia) to the list of countries where contagious equine metritis exists. The interim rule also added Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates to the list of countries considered to be affected with African horse sickness. Comments on the interim rule were required to be received on or before July 12, 1994. We did not receive any comments. The facts presented in the interim rule still provide a basis for the rule. This action also affirms the information contained in the interim rule concerning Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Executive Order 12778, and the Paperwork Reduction Act. Further, for this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived the review process required by Executive Order 12866.
