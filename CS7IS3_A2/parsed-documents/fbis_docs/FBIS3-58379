The heads of state and government of the military alliance decided to express their concern about the conflict in former Yugoslavia. [passage omitted] Several delegations, including Belgium's, refrained from setting a timetable for intervention, recalling that it is not up to NATO to launch air strikes, since operations in the area are made at the request of the United Nations. Here is Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene speaking in an interview with Willy van der Vort: [Begin Dehaene recording] Let us say that NATO has clearly confirmed its willingness and its support for intervention, but that these are UN actions, and the decision has to be taken by the United Nations. So, contrary to the impression that might have been given after the statement by the secretary general yesterday evening, there is no misunderstanding between the United Nations and NATO. What NATO is putting forward today are actions to be implemented within the United Nations, and the final decision will be taken by the United Nations. The Serbs said yesterday that air intervention against their positions in Bosnia could have serious consequences. We have to keep this in mind, but I think at the same time that to remain without action is fraught with another danger, namely that the Serbs will think they can do what they like. [end recording]
