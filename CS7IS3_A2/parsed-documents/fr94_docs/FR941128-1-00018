FR941128-1-00018 FR941128-1-00003 Accordingly, the Agency required, in paragraph (k)(3) of the permit space standard, that each authorized entrant wear a body harness with attached lifeline and that the lifeline be attached to a secure anchorage point outside the permit space, except where the employer can establish that the use of a retrieval system would increase the overall risk of entry or would not contribute to the rescue of the entrant. OSHA anticipated that the retrieval system, where used, would enable a rescuer (either the permit space attendant or personnel summoned by the attendant) to extricate an entrant without being exposed to permit space hazards. OSHA recognized that the use of a retrieval system will be infeasible in some instances. Accordingly, §1910.146 also contains requirements pertaining to rescuers who enter permit spaces to perform rescues, in paragraphs (k)(1) and (k)(2) of the final rule. These requirements were included to ensure that designated rescuers were adequately trained and equipped to safely (for both authorized entrants and the rescuers themselves) perform effective rescues. Paragraph (k)(1) applies to employers, such as fire departments and contract rescue services, whose employees will perform rescue at other employers' workplaces, as well as to employers who have their own employees perform rescues. OSHA recognizes that many employees who perform rescue are not employees of the host employer. In addition, fire department and other public sector rescue service employees are only covered by OSHA standards in State Plan States. Section 3(5) of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C. 652) provides that the term ``employer'' does not include the United States or any State or political subdivision of a State. For States which administer approved OSHA state plans, section 18(c)(6) of the OSH Act provides that State and local government employees in State Plan States are covered by the State OSHA standard equivalents to the Federal OSHA standards. OSHA believes, based on the number of informal inquiries received, that many State and local governmental entities whose employees provide rescue services for permit spaces are already voluntarily complying with the provisions of §1910.146(k)(1) even where there is no legal requirement to do so. The ability of rescue and emergency services to provide timely and effective assistance to authorized entrants is a critical element of compliance with paragraphs (d)(9) and (k) of the standard. Under the permit space standard, affected employers can set up their own employee-staffed rescue services or arrange to have persons other than their own employees provide rescue services. As discussed in the preamble to the final rule (58 FR 4524), OSHA anticipates that a rescue and emergency service composed of an employer's own employees will usually have a faster response to a rescue summons than a rescue service composed of persons other than the employer's own employees because the employer's own rescuers are far more likely to be ``on-site.'' Accordingly, the Agency believes that it is appropriate to use a rescue service composed of persons other than on-site employees only when there is reasonable assurance that the designated rescuers can effectively respond to a rescue summons in a timely fashion. OSHA notes that it also may be feasible for an employer to select a mix of on-site and off-site (or a mix of employee and non-employee) rescue capabilities for that employer's particular circumstances. The provisions of existing §1910.146(k) do not preclude such arrangements. The standard requires simply that employers plan ahead for rescue and ensure that an adequate rescue capability is in place for permit space entries. Paragraph (k)(2) of the standard applies to employers who arrange to have persons other than their own employees provide permit space rescue and emergency services. Paragraph (k)(2) requires affected employers to inform the rescue service of the hazards they may confront when called upon to perform rescue at the host employer's facility and to provide the rescue service with access, for planning and practice rescue purposes, to all permit spaces from which rescue may be necessary. Paragraph (d)(9) of the standard requires employers to ``Develop and implement procedures for summoning rescue and emergency services, for rescuing entrants from permit spaces (emphasis added), for providing necessary emergency services to rescued employees, and for preventing unauthorized personnel from attempting a rescue.'' OSHA believes that the requirements of paragraph (d)(9), in conjunction with the requirements of paragraph (k), place a responsibility on employers to take whatever actions are necessary to provide for the effective rescue of authorized entrants from permit spaces. Further, OSHA believes that any host employer who fails to consider such factors as the response time, equipment and state of training of rescue services not composed of the host employer's own employees, when an employer chooses to arrange for such services, is not complying with paragraphs (d)(9) and (k). In their June 22, 1993 letter to OSHA, the USWA contended that existing §1910.146(k)(2) does not specifically address the timeliness with which a rescue service must respond to a rescue summons. The USWA believes that such an omission permits the host employer to arrange for the use of a rescue service without any consideration of the rescue service's capability to respond in a timely manner. According to the USWA, this situation would very likely result in the death or serious injury of authorized entrants, because there would be no assurance that the rescue service could arrive in time to perform an effective rescue. In addition, the USWA stated that the standard fails to include any meaningful provisions dealing with accountability for the adequacy of a non-host employer rescue service. Thus, they believe, an employer could avoid responsibility for the adequacy (e.g., the equipping and training) of rescue and emergency services. Further, the USWA contends that existing §1910.146(k)(2) discourages employers from providing an employee-staffed on-site rescue service and encourages the disbanding of any such existing rescue services.
