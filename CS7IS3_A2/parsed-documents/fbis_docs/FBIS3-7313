The election was a crucial test for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa because it was the first gubernatorial election fought between the seven ruling coalition parties and the LDP since the Hosokawa government took office last August, throwing the LDP into opposition after 38 years of unbroken rule. Former Vice Gov. Masanori Tanimoto, 48, was backed by the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Komeito, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], the Japan New Party (JNP), the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), new party Sakigake [Harbinger] and the United Social Democratic Party. Tanimoto defeated LDP-backed Hiroshi Ishikawa, 51, a former House of Councillors member, and Japanese Communist Party-backed Takashi Shimizu, 51, a doctor. The election was held to fill the post vacated following the death of Yoichi Nakanishi. Tanimoto garnered 283,992 votes while Ishikawa had 275,854 votes and Shimizu 47,624 votes as of 10:50 P.M. with 98 percent of the votes counted, Election Administration Committee officials said. The officials said 70.9 percent of some 887,000 eligible voters turned out. During the election campaign, Hosokawa and LDP President Yohei Kono both visited the prefecture to canvas for votes. The election was regarded as a prelude to a House of Councillors election next year, and the next general election, as well as a litmus test of election cooperation among coalition parties in a single-seat electoral district. The Diet has enacted a package of political reform bills to replace the current multiseat constituency system for the lower house with the combination of single-seat district and proportional representation. The implication of the election result is expected to give an impetus to a coalition move to create a new party to fight jointly against the LDP in other elections, political analysts said. Shinseito and Komeito have advocated merging coalition partners into a single party, while the SDP, Sakigake and the DSP call for a "moderate multiparty system." The governor's race was also seen as a proxy war between Keiwa Okuda, chairman of the lower house steering committee and a key member of Shinseito and LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori. Both Okuda and Mori have been elected from the No. 1 constituency in the prefecture.
