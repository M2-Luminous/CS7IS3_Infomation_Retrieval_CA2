The following day, the freight, a total of 327 crates, was taken away in a German truck, escorted by several cars. But the trip came to an end after a few kilometers. German police stopped the convoy, having been tipped off by the military prosecutor at Wuensdorf. They arrested 11 people, including an honorable Russian lieutenant colonel: Anatoliy Golubev (33), head of the Wuensdorf Army Hunting Club. An inspection confirmed the suspicion against the recreational hunter. The freight documents indicated "sports guns" addressed to a Hamburg trading company, but what the crates actually contained was much hotter stuff: 9,810 9-mm guns of the "Makarov" type. This mishap of the Golubev group showed for the first time to what extent Russian troops in Germany are involved in arms trading. Colonel General Matvey Burlakov, supreme commander at Wuensdorf has disputed such links up to now. Concerned about the image of his troops, which will finally withdraw during 1994, the supreme commander emphasized time and again that his people were not involved in Mafia-like activities around the garrisons, where officers are blackmailed, wagons of cigarettes are traded, and supply goods trafficked. In the surroundings of the garrison, the jobbers, who mostly come from the CIS, carry out their rivalries with guns: police quite frequently recover corpses of dead gangsters from hotel rooms and lakes in Brandenburg. On Christmas Eve, a Russian civilian died in a shootout among mafiosi near Sperenberg. When a fight among dealers in front of the WGT headquarters got out of hand last week, a guard fired his gun. An asylum-seeker from Azerbaijan was killed. Colonel General Burlakov says that his garrisons are downright beleaguered by radical dealers: "The circle is getting ever closer." But the arrest of gun shipper Golubev shows that many an insider has a finger in the pie. Both the majority of officers at Wuensdorf and the Army leadership in Moscow have seen it that way for a long time. At the end of November, Burlakov received a very embarrassing coded telegram ("No. 2267, 2268", "No copies"). In this telegram, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev told his governor at Wuensdorf to increase discipline and order within his troops. Following this, Burlakov made a written note saying that he wanted to effect the direction "forcefully, if necessary." The leadership in Moscow criticized generals and officers for increasingly misusing their ranks for private affairs. Grachev: "A lack of control in the distribution of funds designated for the troops encourages such affairs." There have also been instances where high-ranking officers were involved, such as Colonel Alexeji Varlevich Belikov, who is stationed near Magdeburg. The son of a former commander in chief at Wuensdorf was suspected of smuggling cigarettes. While the final withdrawal of the troops, scheduled for the end of August, is approaching, greed amongst the WGT troops is on the increase. Military prosecutors are investigating the case of officers selling off a complete set of aerial photographs of the former GDR territory from the headquarters "topography section" to a Berlin company via middlemen. The 11,000 photographic plates on the scale of 1:22,000, were made in the early 1950's, and were used, among other things, to spot inherited environmental problems. The 48 crates were traded in return for a shipment of computers from Singapore worth 90,000 German marks [DM] -- a nice bargain for the Russians who are getting worried about their future: Later on, back home in Russia, a colonel has to make do with the equivalent of DM120 per month. Even more bizarre is a deal that is currently being investigated by the military authorities, and that again involves Lieutenant Colonel Golubev, who has established a trading company at Berlin-Karlshorst, together with other partners. Recently, Golubev received 17 wagons containing parts for prefabricated houses produced by the Russian Army. According to Army lawyers, the imports are to be sold as hunting lodges in Germany for DM50,000 each. The contract was signed by resigned Lieutenant General Maganov, the head of the Army's Hunting Club in the Moscow Defense Ministry. Another officer who profited from good German contacts is the former deputy chief of staff of the Western Group, General Lieutenant Leonid Cherbakev. He was deputy head of the Konversion Wohnraum [living space conversion] company, which also owns Army enterprises and WGT land. Investigators accuse him of trying to smuggle money and raw material out of the country in an Army aircraft last April, controlling the action from Moscow. When the load was checked, trading documents on weapons, raw material, and radioactive material were seized. Another officer accused of embezzlement and customs offenses is General Lieutenant Seliverstov, a former general with the WGT Air Force. Seliverstov is considered the organizer of a sensational transfer of presents: In 1992, via middlemen, WGT officers had procured an S-class Mercedes worth over DM150,000 for the leadership of the Defense Ministry and shipped it to Moscow. The moral decline within the troops makes their boss gloomy. "The vices of society," Grachev tells his Wuensdorf governor Burlakov in a telegram, "are seeping ever deeper into officers' circles."
