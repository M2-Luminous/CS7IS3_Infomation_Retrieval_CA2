Snegur said during the meeting that he met Saturday [9 April] with Igor Smirnov to discuss in particular the fate of the political detainees. According to the President, only unusual solutions could lead to a breakthrough in this problem. According to him the problem is in the center of the public attention, because "things went too far." Snegur mentioned that he will do everything possible to release the patriots. But he was also "confused with the fact that the weekly TARA [the country], Christian Democratic Popular Front of Moldova publication, often aggravated the situation by publishing articles that oppose the pursued objectives." President Snegur appraised that the problem could be settled "only by means of reasonable compromises and expressed his hope that all progressive forces will realize this fact," concluded the communique.
