Aliyev asked Turkey to increase its arms supplies to Azerbaijan and assured the Turkish officials that Russia's military forces can only be deployed in his country within the CSCE framework and together with the military units of other countries. Aliyev said, however, that he will not completely turn his back on Moscow. Replying to the questions Turkish journalists asked him, Aliyev asserted: "I shall neither open nor close Azerbaijan's door to Moscow. Azerbaijan will remain an independent country." Stressing that Russia is in the region and that it has 50,000 troops in Armenia and Georgia, Aliyev said: "Moscow wishes to increase the number of its troops. Russian military units guard the Armenian and Georgian borders with Turkey. Considering that state of affairs, Russia can be described as having intervened in the region." Aliyev, who buys arms from the generals in Moscow who are known as arms dealers, has asked Turkey to supply more arms to Azerbaijan so that Baku can reduce its dependence on Russia. Meanwhile, Nedzhmettin Sadykhov, Azerbaijan's former chief of staff who has accompanied Aliyev to Turkey as his military adviser, is holding talks with military officials in Ankara. Aliyev has asked President Demirel and Prime Minister Ciller to agree to send more officers to Azerbaijan to train the military units of that republic. Demirel and Ciller have promised every kind of aid to Azerbaijan.
