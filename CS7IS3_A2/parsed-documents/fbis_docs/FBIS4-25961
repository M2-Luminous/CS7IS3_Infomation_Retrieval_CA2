The tax exemption which was begun early this month would last until the end of next year, according to an internal circular issued by the State Council, China's cabinet. The circular said state-run wholesalers responsible for sales of grain and edible oil to urban residents, military units and farmers would be exempted from various taxes including corporate tax and value-added tax during the holiday. State-run wholesalers for fodder are also granted the preferential treatment, Chinese sources quoted the document as saying. The move was the latest effort by the government to combat inflation which has risen above 20 percent in major Chinese cities in the past few months. The spriralling prices have become a matter of great concern to the leadership, which is worried that they may prompt social unrest. Inflation and rampant corruption were said to be major factors behind the student-led protests in 1989 which ended with the bloody military crackdown in Tiananmen Square. Meanwhile, sources said the government's pledge of intensive action to boost agriculture was in vain since local governments and most central ministries were reluctant to implement the policies. Despite food production goals laid out by the State Council earlier this year, no concrete measures were actually in place, a Chinese economic source said yesterday. Beijing's plans involve pumping an additional 1.9 billion yuan (HK$1.69 billion) into the agricultural sector--but only a trickle of the amount has been placed. Beijing also planned to import great quantities of chemical fertiliser and pesticides this year, but just a small portion of the quota had been fulfilled so far, sources said. [passage omitted]
