Local farmers in drought-hit areas such as Yongjing County, Dongxiang Autonomous County, Gaolan County and Lanzhou city have built pumping facilities with cheaper electricity generated by nearby hydroelectric power stations on the Yellow River. According to local officials, the pumping projects have irrigated about 133,000 ha [hectare] of farmland along the river. More than 300,000 local residents, who used to have to fetch drinking water from wells or rivers far away, are now able to drink clean water from the Yellow River, which used to be called "China's sorrow". With stable irrigation, some of the areas, such as Jingtai, Gaolan, Jingyuan and Yuzhong Counties and Baiyin city have developed into high-yield production centers of grain. Jingtai County used to depend on an average of 1.34 million kg of grain allocated and moved in from other parts of the country each year before the Jingtaichuan Electrical Pumping Project was completed in the locality. Now, farmers in the county sell 7.5 million kg of surplus grain to the central government annually besides reserving enough grain for themselves. More than 100,000 residents from other drought-stricken areas of the province have moved to areas within the irrigation range of the Yellow River. Lanzhou, the provincial capital, and Baiyin city, one of the country's leading production bases of nonferrous metals, have gone a step further; they have made good use of the vast areas of tidal zones along the river and have built 1,000 ha of fish ponds, which turn out 1,900 tons of freshwater fish a year. Moreover, farmers around Baiyin have also developed some 2,000 ha of quality rice fields and 2,670 ha of orchards on the banks of the Yellow River.
