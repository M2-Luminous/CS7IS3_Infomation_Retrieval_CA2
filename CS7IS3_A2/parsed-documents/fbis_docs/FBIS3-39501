The Bundesbank writes this in its new monthly report. Because of the continuing weakness in investment and in private consumption, recessionary trends have not been overcome completely in western Germany, but, together with a strong recovery in construction at the end of last year, recovery in the export sector gives particular reason for confidence. Strong economic growth has continued in eastern Germany. Now economic expansion is no longer supported solely by the construction sector, but increasingly also by the manufacturing industry. According to the Bundesbank, for the first time in more than a year, exports clearly increased in the last two months of 1993. In October and November, exports exceeded those of the two previous months by 5 percent. As a result of the tangible recovery in export business, the trade balance surplus -- 16 billion German marks -- was twice as high as in August and September. Foreign orders to the manufacturing industry continued to rise strongly during the last quarter of 1993; they were 8.5 percent higher in real terms than during the corresponding months of the previous year. Growth was particularly high in automobile industry and in machine building. According to the Bundesbank, this was due partly to economic recovery in some European countries and in the United States. The competitiveness of German companies improved because, among other things, of the exchange rate against important European currencies and the U.S. dollar. In the Bundesbank's view, the German import demand had already reached its low point in the summer months of 1993. Regarding domestic demand in western Germany, the still-existing weaknesses were concentrated on private consumption and investments. The increases in the income of private households are more than devoured by price hikes and higher rates and fees. The inclination toward investments is hurt by the lower company profits, the still- missing expectations for the future, and a continuing low capacity utilization. Even though the downward trend in production has been stopped, capacity utilization is still low because of the previous long decline while plans for company expansions are relegated to the back burner. In total, domestic orders in investment goods sector were 5 percent lower during the last quarter of 1993 than during the corresponding period the year before. The companies' gross fixed investments were about 10 percent lower. In eastern Germany, indicators have gained in dynamism, the Bundesbank thinks. This is due, above all, to a steady expansion of domestic demand, which indicates that industrial products have become increasingly competitive.
