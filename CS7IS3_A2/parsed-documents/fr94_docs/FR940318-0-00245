Exemptions State and local governments are exempted from these fees under section 305(e)(2) of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2665. 3. Determination of Fees Participants listed in the RMP and RCP programs on the effective date of this rule will be sent, by EPA, an annual renewal application with appropriate fee calculation at least 30 days prior to the payment due date. This renewal application also serves as an organization's or individual's payment invoice. Fees will be assessed based on the information in EPA's proficiency program data bases. Participants who intend to pay the invoiced fee amount shall complete the renewal application and send the appropriate payment to EPA following the procedures in section B.3. Organizations or individuals who believe the invoiced fee amount is incorrect or wish to amend or adjust their listing status shall do so by indicating the appropriate corrections or adjustments on their renewal application. Corrected renewal applications for the RMP Program or the RCP Program shall be sent to: Radon Proficiency Program Information Service, c/o Sanford Cohen and Associates, Inc., 1418 I&hyph;85 Parkway, Montgomery, AL 36016. EPA will review the corrected renewal application, adjust the payment invoice amount (if appropriate) and issue a revised invoice. Participants shall pay the corrected amount within 30 days of receipt of the revised invoice. If the appropriate fee or revised renewal application for an individual or organization participating in the RMP or RCP program has not been received by EPA on or before the payment due date, EPA will send, by certified mail, notice to the individual or organization that they will be delisted from the proficiency program unless they pay the fee within 30 days of receipt of this second notice. If payment has not been received by EPA within 30 days of the participant's receipt of the second payment invoice, the organization's or individual's listing will be removed from the proficiency program. New or initial applicants to the RMP or RCP programs will be assessed a fee at the time of their initial application. EPA will send a payment invoice to the new applicant upon acceptance of its initial application. The invoice will state that the applicant will be given 30 days to remit payment. The fee assessed will be prorated quarterly, based on the acceptance date of the application. If the appropriate fee has not been received by EPA by the payment due date, the application will be returned to the submitter and the applicant will not be listed in the proficiency program. 4. Payment Procedures Each remittance to EPA under this rule shall be in United States currency and shall be paid by certified check, personal check, or money order made payable to the order of the ``U.S. Environmental Protection Agency'' and sent to: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Headquarters Accounting Operations Branch, Radon Proficiency Program User Fees, P.O. Box 952491, St. Louis, MO 63195&hyph;2491. The fee shall be submitted with the original copy of the EPA invoice. Collection of fees shall begin in the fiscal year beginning October 1, 1993.

Failing the RMP Measurement Test Organizations that fail the initial measurement performance test or the re-test for a particular device must re-apply to the RMP program for that device. EPA notifies all primary participants in writing of their measurement performance test results and listing status. Any fee paid to EPA in the process of attaining a listing of a particular device will not be refunded if the device fails to meet the RMP program criteria as stated in the Radon Measurement Proficiency (RMP) Program Handbook, EPA 520/1&hyph;91&hyph;006, February 1991. Should the organization elect to re-apply, EPA will assess a new fee based on the information provided in the organization's reapplication.
