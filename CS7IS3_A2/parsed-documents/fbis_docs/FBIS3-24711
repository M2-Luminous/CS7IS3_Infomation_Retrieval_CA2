I mean, it is absolutely false. We just called (Killer Bay). Our commanders are all there. In fact, they are jubilating today -- it is our leader's birthday -- so they are shocked by the news. It is not true, but what emanated from Monrovia is that some disgruntled elements who happened to have once lived in Bong County are getting together. They want to attack us. As you know, various forces in Liberia have tried to fight us. They consider us as an elephant; everybody is trying to get a piece of the elephant. They have all tried their best, but to no avail. [White] But has this Bong Movement attacked your forces at all? [Mulbah] They have never attacked us. This is.... [pauses] I mean, it is indeed a shock. As I told you, we do not know where Niinartey got his story from, but you can have a dinner party in (Killer Bay). You can equally have a big party in Salala. The Salala area is under complete control. I just saw General Vanney, Gen. Gueye, and Gen. Siafa Nomadia all in control of those areas that your reporter was referring to this afternoon. Things are well, and this can indeed be attested to by the UNOMIL [UN Observer Mission in Liberia] people we have in our area who have been deployed. [White] But why are people then fleeing? [Mulbah] People are not fleeing. This is why I say we are shocked. We don't know where you got your story from.... [White, interrupting] This is relief officials.... [Mulbah, interrupting] Probably, your.... [White, interrupting] This is relief officials. They are saying that thousands of people have fled the fighting. [Mulbah] It is not true. We are not fighting, and I think you need to send Niinartey Allison here. We are prepared to take him at the places he referred to to confirm the story. [White] But hasn't Charles Taylor himself requested ECOMOG to send some troops to the area immediately to bring things under control? [Mulbah] We have asked for troops to be deployed in our areas as per the Cotonou Accord. This is what was said on our radio. [White] So, it is not a special request to go and fight these Bong people? [Mulbah] No, it is not a special request. I think we are capable. We are in a position to defend ourselves, but we are not ready to do anything otherwise but to abide by the Cotonou Peace Accord.
