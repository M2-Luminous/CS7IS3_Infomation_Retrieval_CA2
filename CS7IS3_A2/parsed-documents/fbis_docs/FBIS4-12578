In a statement to AL-THAWRAH, he said that the embargo is an expression of a tendency by the superpowers not to respect the will of peoples and nations seeking to achieve progress. He added that this embargo is beginning to show its negative effects on Iraq and Cuba. Assessing Cuban-Iraqi relations, Rodriguez said: Relations between our two friendly countries, Cuba and Iraq, are deep-rooted and have been continuously developing in various fields. We believe that continuing the policy of reinforcing relations and improving cooperation between our peoples will serve the interests and objectives of both countries. We also believe that this cooperation is necessary, useful, and important, in light of the difficult circumstances our two countries are facing. On the objective of his visit to Iraq and his talks with Iraqi officials, the Cuban guest said: My visit to Iraq is aimed at furthering cooperation and developing relations of friendship between our two countries and peoples, not just under the current circumstances, but also in the future. My visit is also aimed at getting a broader outlook on the circumstances our friends in Iraq are facing. At the same time, I hope to brief our friends on the situation in Cuba. I was happy with the talks I held with our friends, the officials in Iraq. I was even happier to find that our friends, the Iraqi officials, understand the circumstances facing Cuba. My talks were brotherly and very fruitful.
