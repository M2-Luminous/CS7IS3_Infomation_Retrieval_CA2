FR941006-1-00150 FR941006-1-00016 The total value of the benefits of unit-dose packaging options is the sum of the value of reducing both mortality and morbidity risks. The selected option, requiring unit-dose packaging for all products containing 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit, would result in benefits of reducing mortality risks of between $280 million and $618 million and reduced morbidity valued at $61 million. Therefore, total discounted benefits of this option are between $315 million and $618 million. Table 7 summarizes the costs and benefits of the packaging options.

Warning Labels a. Costs. Every petition submitted to FDA requested that the agency require that iron-containing product labels contain warning statements about the potentially fatal effects of pediatric poisonings from accidental ingestion of iron-containing products. The cost associated with warning statements are the cost of redesigning the label, disposing of old labels, and administrative costs. In January, 1994, FDA published final rules regarding nutrition labeling of dietary supplements in accordance with the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (NLEA) and the Dietary Supplement Act of 1992. In its analysis of those rules (59 FR 352), FDA determined that the incremental cost of label changes for dietary supplement manufacturers is approximately $1,500 per label. FDA is proposing that the label warning statement be printed directly on the immediate container of the product, i.e., the container that holds the tablet or capsule, and on the principal display panel of the retail package, if such package is not the immediate container. If a product is sold in unit-dose packaging, the product would be required to bear the warning directly on each unit-dose package or on a strip of unit-dose packages in such a way that separating the unit-dose packages would not destroy the warning labeling. Manufacturers of all 300 iron-containing products will be required to change their labels on both the product container and the retail package to incorporate warning statements. However, because manufacturers of iron-containing products with 30 mg or more per dosage unit will also be required to change their packaging, they will not incur any incremental cost in adding a warning statement to the product container. Therefore, the labeling costs will be incurred by all 300 products for the retail package and for 150 products for the product container. The total cost would be a one-time cost of $675,000 (300 × 1.5 × $1,500).
