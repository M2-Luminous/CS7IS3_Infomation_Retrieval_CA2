In his statement dated on June 10 and faxed from his residence in Beijing to the Cambodian co-premiers the king said, "this current report brings me to ask that you free, for humanitarian reasons, the very sick prisoners and more particularly those who, in general, have not committed serious crimes or violent crimes". "Many defendants who are particularly impoverished, notably the women, have stagnated in preventative detention for months or even years awaiting judgement", Sihanouk said in the statement, which was dated Friday. Sihanouk said the freeing of sick prisoners would enable the country's penal authorities to improve prison conditions while waiting to find adequate financial means for the creation of new detention centres".
