The Board consists of the 12 European Community central bank governors and of institute president Alexandre Lamfalussy of Belgium. The institute is the forerunner of the European Community's central bank. Raymond, 60, is managing director for credit at the Bank of France, the French central bank. The institute Board also appointed the heads of three of the five departments within the European Monetary Institute. Dutchman G.P.J. Hogeweg, coordinating director at the Dutch central bank, will head the Economics and Statistics Department. Hanspeter K. Scheller, from the secretariat of the E.C. governors' committee, will head up the general secretariat. And J.S. Etherington of the Bank of England will manage the Department for Communication and Information Systems. Lamfalussy told correspondents that "one or two appointments have not yet been decided on at this stage." The institute also has an Administration Division and a Finance Division. On another matter, Lamfalussy said the European Community central bank governors were not much worried about consequences of the mild increase in U.S. interest rates announced on Friday by the U.S. Federal Reserve. He said after a meeting in Basel with governors of E.C. central banks that "The consensus was that some such measure had been expected, and that it was not really a surprise." "The majority of the governors thought that, so far, the financial markets' reaction had been relatively calm. The governors did not express any major worries about the conduct of European monetary policies, at this stage."
