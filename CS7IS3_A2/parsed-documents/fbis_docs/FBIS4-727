So the evacuation operation is over. This morning the situation was very dangerous at Kigali airport. Because of confrontations between the government army and the rebels, foreign troops, too, were jeopardized. The Rwandan army pounded the rebels with heavy artillery. A shell fired by the rebels exploded at the airport. There were no casulties. The blue helmets have demanded that firing should cease and have fired warning shots. The withdrawal of the Belgian paras is meantime being continued at a higher rate. [passage omitted] But from Kigali we have received the report that the blue helmets, too, have permission to leave as quickly as possible. For the time being, the Defense Ministry in Brussels is unable to confirm this.
