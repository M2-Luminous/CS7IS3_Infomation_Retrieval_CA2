Silvio Berlusconi and Forza Italia, Gianfranco Fini and the National Alliance, and Umberto Bossi and the Northern League, won -- according to the latest projections -- an absolute majority of seats in the Chamber of Deputies and most probably also in the Senate, even if projections for the Senate only give the Alliance a relative majority rather than an absolute one. The Left, which was grouped around the Progessive Alliance, was defeated. The Center, led by Mario Segni and Mino Martinazzoli, was also penalized. Unless there is a major surprise, the Italian Socialist Party, La Rete, Democratic Alliance, and the Greens will be without a quorum in the new parliament.
