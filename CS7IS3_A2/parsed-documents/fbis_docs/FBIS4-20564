This system enables the production of simple FEM models whose numerical calculations agree quite well with actual measurements. In this paper, we give an overview of the system and discuss some applications of the system in design. 1. Introduction As automobiles have gotten more sophisticated and higher quality over the past few years, there have been more and more demands for vibrational sounds to be reduced. The large degree to which the exhaust system contributes to vibrational sound makes it necessary that even small measures be taken to reduce vibration. Due to earlier studies to make the automobile lighter, cheaper, and faster, a lot of hope is being placed on simulation technology. The vibrational sound produced by the exhaust system of a car can be divided into three types, namely, emission noise, radiation noise, and vibration transmission noise. A study was launched to analyze vibration transmission by the finite element method.[.sup](1,2,3)[/] The method that had been used until now involved a stress analysis using a plate model of the tailpipe joined to the muffler. An actual exhaust system, however, uses both a catalytic converter and flexible pipe, so it takes an enormous amount of time to create a computation model when trying to make a plate model of all the elements. Furthermore, since doing analysis requires specialized knowledge, the average design specialist finds it difficult to use such systems. That being the case, in trying to reduce internal car noise caused by the exhaust system and improve the tailpipe's ability to withstand engine vibration, we developed a vibration characteristic analysis system for exhaust systems that the ordinary design engineer could use. A system such as this enables a series of work operations starting with the preparation of the computation model to the display of results to be performed effortlessly on a CAE terminal. The system also enables models of catalytic converters and flexible pipes to be done simply and accurately. In this paper, we provide an overview of the analysis system, and discuss ways of practically reducing vibration in cars by studying the computational accuracy of the exhaust system which includes a catalytic converter and flexible pipe. 2. System Outlined In order to analyze the vibration transmission characteristic of the entire exhaust system, we built a system in which the ordinary design engineer could do on a CAE terminal without much difficulty. In Figure 1, we show the configuration of the system and the computational flow. The system consists of CAD, preprocessing, postprocessing, a characteristic data unit, and a solver. Figure 1. Calculation Flow The computation model is concerned with the area directly after the exhaust manifold from the flange to the end of the exhaust system, but also includes various support elements mounted to the body. As seen in Figure 2, the model is made one component at a time and a standard mesh pattern is used to automatically separate the components in the database. The model separates the different pipes into beam elements, and the muffler, flange, and supports into plate elements. In developing the model, consideration is given to reducing the rigidity of the curved pipe, and to reducing the Young percentage in materials. The engine vibration data, which is input externally, and the actual data on things such as quality, dynamic spring constant, and attenuation constant, which are the characteristics of the flexible pipe and catalytic converter, are input from a CAD terminal. Figure 2. Modeling Image In Figure 3, we illustrate a computation model. This particular model consists of 3,000 nodal points and 2,100 elements, and took more than 16 hours to create. This was, however, five times faster than conventional systems when it comes to making a model of this type. Figure 3. Structure and FEM Element Division of Exhaust System Merely by separating the input into eigenvalue and response calculations, we eliminated the need to set analysis conditions which require a lot of time and special expertise. The computer used for the calculations was a Cray Y-MP supercomputer. The analysis program used was called NASTRAN. The calculated results were displayed so that reconfigured diagrams, animation, vibration, stress frequency characteristics, and stress distribution could be processed with minimal operation. This type of system allows an ordinary design specialist to create a computation model, display the results, and analyze the vibration transmission characteristic of an exhaust system. 3. Study of Computational Accuracy Using the FEM system, we did an analysis of the exhaust system and compared the results obtained with actual measurements based on hammer excitation. The areas of comparison were the frequency responses obtained from the resonance mode and No. 1 support unit in the exhaust system. 3.1 Basic Exhaust System The basic exhaust system shown in Figure 3 is comprised of a sub-muffler, a main muffler, and pipes and supports that link them together. In Figure 4, we show a comparison between calculated and actual measurements. There was good agreement between actual and calculated values for both the frequency responses and resonance modes. In terms of computation accuracy, the resonance frequency fell within +/- 10 Hz and the vibration level to within +/- 5 dB, providing a level of accuracy good enough for commercial use. Figure 4. Base of Exhaust System 3.2 Exhaust System With Catalytic Converter We added a catalytic converter to the exhaust system used in the previous section and studied computation accuracy. We input the actual mass and moment of inertia along three axes of the catalytic converter, and as shown in Figure 5, constructed a model in which the mass points were linked by solid body and spring elements. In Figure 6, we show a comparison between calculated and actual measurements. There was good agreement between actual and measured for both frequency responses and resonance modes, and due to the addition of the catalytic converter, we were able to estimate the changes in the vibration characteristic of the exhaust system. In terms of computation accuracy, resonance frequency fell within +/- 10 Hz and the vibration level was within +/- 10 dB, providing us with a level of accuracy good enough for commercial use. Figure 5. FEM Model of Catalytic Converter Figure 6. Exhaust System With Catalytic Converter 3.3 Exhaust System Built With Flexible Piping We added flexible pipe to the exhaust system used in the previous section and studied computation accuracy. We input the actual mass and dynamic spring constant along three axes of the flexible piping, and as shown in Figure 7, constructed a beam model. In Figure 8, we show a comparison between calculated and actual measurements. There was good agreement between actual and measured for both frequency response tendencies and resonance modes. There was a big gap of more than 90Hz between actual and measured in the vibration level, but this was because the calculated results produced a frequency response diagram in which there was a uniform applied damping constant throughout the entire excitation mode compared to actual measurements in which the damping effect on the flexible piping was irregular. Figure 7. FEM Model of Flexible Pipe Figure 8. Exhaust System With Flexible Pipe As we have seen above, using this system, we are now able to satisfactorily estimate the vibration transmission characteristic of an exhaust system. 4. Applications for Reduced Exhaust System Vibration The main compelling force acting on the exhaust system is the vibration of the power plant, which includes the engine among other things. Generally speaking, when the resonance frequencies of the exhaust system are vibrating at the same frequency as these, the exhaust system vibrates severely. This causes sound problems such as poor idling or loud internal noises, and strength problems as well, including the inability to withstand resonating vibrations. To resolve these problems, we installed flexible pipe, a mass damper, and dynamic damper to help reduce the points of resonance and resonance levels, and reduce the body transmission force by tuning the support system (cf. Figure 9). Figure 9. Conceptual Scheme for Reducing Exhaust Vibration 4.1 Effect of Bending Rigidity in Flexible Piping We examined the effect that the bending rigidity of the flexible pipe has on the overall vibration characteristic of the exhaust system. For the computation model, we used the same exhaust system as was used in Section 3.3 above which had a catalytic converter and flexible pipe, and input the bending rigidity of the pipe as initial -20% and -40% changes. In Figure 10, we show the frequency response results for the No. 1 support unit. We can predict from this that changing the bending rigidity of the piping to more than 50Hz is an effective means of reducing the resonance frequency of the exhaust system. Figure 10. Effect of Spring Constant 4.2 Effect of Support Positions Next, using the same computation model as in the previous section, we examined what effect the position of the No. 1 support unit, which is a response point, has on the overall vibration characteristic of the exhaust system. We moved the position of the support unit backward relative to the exhaust system at 100mm intervals. In Figure 11, we show the frequency response results for the No. 1 support unit. This has a 50Hz or more effect on the exhaust system, so we can estimate what the effect will be relative to the resonance mode. For example, in contrast to resonance frequencies in the 60Hz resonance mode, we can estimate that the peak characteristic of the vibrations will all but disappear by moving the support unit back by 200mm. Figure 11. Effect of Flexible Pipe Position 4.3 Practical Applications in Cars Finally, we look at some examples of how this system can be applied practically to actual car exhaust systems that have adopted flexible pipe as shown in Figure 12. This exhaust system had an exhaust system resonance of about 25Hz when first developed. In Figure 13, we show the actual and measured frequency responses of the No. 2 support unit before any corrective actions had been taken. By studying numerous cases, we determined that adding a No. 2 support mass damper would be an effective corrective measure. In Figure 14, we show the numerical results from adding the damper. In the actual car, adding the damper was effective in reducing resonance vibration by 2Hz and the vibration level by 5 dB. Figure 12. FEM Element Division of Exhaust System Figure 13.
