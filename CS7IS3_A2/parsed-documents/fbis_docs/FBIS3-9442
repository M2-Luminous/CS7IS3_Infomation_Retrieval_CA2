We voiced some criticism, but it is important in these new circumstances to have UNPROFOR's mandate redefined so that it can start implementing the Vance plan and the UN Security Council resolutions. In this context we drew attention to priority tasks such as border controls between Serbia and Croatia, the disarmament of those Serb paramilitary formations -- since there is no peace without this -- the return of refugees, and the restoration of communications. We have also pointed out the willingness of the Croatian Government to take the necessary confidence-building steps and to guarantee all human rights as well as territorial self-government to the Serb ethnic community in the Knin area, the Glina and Knin districts where before the war, according to the 1991 census, the Serb population was in the majority. Let me add that I listened with a great deal of satisfaction to almost all the members of the UN Security Council who reiterated the support of their governments for the territorial integrity of the internationally recognized borders of Croatia and their readiness to define in future UNPROFOR's mandate so that, as I said, it can carry out its task. Without a solution of the UN-protected zones in Croatia, there can be no stable, no final peace in Bosnia- Herzegovina. By signing the Washington agreement we took a huge step toward peace, but this is also why the question of the UN-protected zones in Croatia should also be resolved. Thank you.
