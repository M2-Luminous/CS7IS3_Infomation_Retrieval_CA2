He, who is attending the on-going national machinery industry working conference, said the development of the auto industry is directly related to the development of all the country's industries, involving roads, communications, education, construction and many other fields. He is convinced that implementing the new policy will exert significant influence on and bring changes to the full range of socio-economic life. According to the ministry's latest statistics, last year China produced 1.28 million autos of all kinds, up 20 percent from the previous year, of which 234,000 were sedan cars; motorcycle output stood at three million, making China the world's second largest motorcycle producer after Japan. He said that in the coming few years, major attention will be paid to the construction and remolding of existing auto projects, and the ministry will not approve any new projects assembling complete vehicles. Major attention will also be directed to the development of key parts for cars, economical cars, special chassis for large, medium- sized and small buses, special cargo vehicles, new car engines and motorcycle engines. Sources said that in the past 40 years China put only about 34 billion yuan into the auto industry, and the money has been widely divided for an overabundance of local projects. At present the one million automotive output capacity is distributed across more than 100 auto plants, while the three million motorcycles were produced by over 100 plants. At the end of last year China had 1.2 million sedan cars, of which 70 percent are imported overseas products. In the late 1980s, China shifted the direction of auto development to cars and car parts and defined eight major car construction projects. If the planned investment of more than 22 billion yuan is accomplished at the scheduled time, the eight enterprises will be able to produce 780,000 cars in 1997, which can basically meet domestic vehicle demands. In the coming years China will also pay attention to the development of economical cars to meet the demands of well-to-do individuals and families.
