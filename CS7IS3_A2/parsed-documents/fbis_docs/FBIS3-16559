Despite the fact that the previous meeting of the delegations was held in September 1993, Bulovas said that the Russian-Lithuanian negotiations were going well. The sides agreed that the main volume of work was to be done at a level of groups of experts. Bulovas said that the list of issues that were to be discussed at the new round of talks was not yet finalized. However, he believes that the discussion is likely to focus on border crossing and travel from one state to another. These problems were discussed at last week's meeting of groups of experts.
