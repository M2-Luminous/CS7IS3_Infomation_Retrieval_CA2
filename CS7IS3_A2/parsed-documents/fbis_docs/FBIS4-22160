The aim: participation in the "ASIA-94" and "FIDAE-94" aerospace shows, on which between $1 and $1.5 million was spent. [passage omitted] "We go to all these exhibition with hope. Nowadays, we are prepared to sell licenses, test methods, and know-how -- this could secure a living for ourselves and affiliated plants for some time at least," Academician Anatoliy Obukhov, chief designer at the "Bazalt" Science and Production Association, the Russian Federation's largest producer of mines, munitions, aircraft bombs, and grenade launchers, explained. "Today, I no longer see any other ways for the defense complex to survive." [passage omitted] [Correspondent] What, according to your calculations, is the safety margin for you, for munitions producers in general? [Obukhov] A year, I think, for all of us. After a year, everything will be finished. [Correspondent] But is this really such a terrible thing? There are many countries without these types of munitions plants, and they manage.... [Obukhov] Let's begin from the premise that cartridges, projectiles, and aircraft weapons are still needed -- without them, the Army and Navy, even in peaceful conditions, simply cannot exist, not to mention the fact that the number of localized conflicts in the world is not decreasing. Did anybody bother to calculate how much it would cost to purchase all this abroad for our Armed Forces before destroying our own munitions sector? I can merely assume that nobody is going to sell us anything on the cheap, and that they are unlikely to make the latest models available for purchase. On top of all that, we are in this instance providing jobs not at home but abroad, and what is more we are falling into direct dependency on suppliers (and it is vital to be 100-percent sure of such alliances). But, in general, it has long been time to clarify our position: Either we consent to the role of being the West's raw materials appendage with all that ensues from this, or we strive to preserve and develop our own technologies. [Obukhov ends] And there is another factor which has been voiced in one form or another in many conversations. Whether Russia likes it or not, its place on the armaments market may very soon, and without any particular hue and cry, be taken by its powerful southeastern neighbor. Having saturated the world with cheap rugs, clothes, children's toys, and other consumer goods, and having earned on the strength of this around $100 billion last year alone, it, according to expert testimony, will calmly undertake to buy up military technologies. A small proportion has already been acquired from the Russian military-industrial complex. The possible consequences of this require special discussion, but defense workers are growing increasingly certain that the Chinese have the power to swamp the markets with cheap weaponry and military hardware. In America's Backyard What, then, was the outcome of Russia's participation in the Singapore and Chile exhibitions? There is no simple answer. After all, aircraft, like weapons, are not snapped up in a couple of days. [passage omitted] In Santiago, we happened to strike up a conversation with two "defense workers" who had come here with the "Tor-M1" and "Tunguska" complexes -- the pride of the Russian military-industrial complex. "We displayed the `Tor-M1' in Abu-Dhabi, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Greece, and now we have come to Chile. There is enormous interest everywhere," Valentin Osilov, deputy chief designer of the "Antey" Concern, explained. [Correspondent] How many items were sold in this time, and to whom? [Osilov] So far, not a single item. [Osilov ends] The picture is the same for the "Tunguska," the only sample of which made its way secretly to one of the NATO countries. Likewise, no customers can be seen waiting in line for the vast majority of other military-industrial complex products either. Yes, of course, everyone is in raptures, the front pages of the newspapers are littered with huge headlines like "Russians Again Conquer the World!" but the problem is how to turn this into business.... Red-Brown Bill? Revenue from the sale of weaponry from the USSR, and subsequently from Russia, fell from $20 billion in the 1980's to $1.9 [billion] in 1993. Much has been written about the reasons for this -- these include the general warming up of the situation in the world, the loss of major "clients" like Iraq or Libya, the instability of the situation in Russia, and erratic after-sales service, not to mention poor advertising. Would not, therefore, Russia be better off completely renouncing such persistent presentation of its aircraft, weaponry, and hardware abroad? This would hardly be sensible -- everybody we managed to speak with was agreed on this. If only because nobody in the whole world disputes the competitiveness of Russian products. Yes, it is necessary to advertise them more effectively; yes, it is vital to seek out new contacts, to convince people of the superiority of our goods, to search for mutually acceptable options, and ultimately to win over potential partners -- indeed, can we survive without this? There are enough experts in the Russian Federation with a highly developed knowledge of such sensitive matters -- including in the recently created "Rosvooruzheniye" State Committee, the State Committee for the Defense Sectors of Industry, and "Aviaeksport." But, even if they were magicians, their efforts would be worthless without powerful political support. The following is a trite example: When the United States heard about the preparations underway for Russia to sell Malaysia a batch of MIG aircraft, American senators and military experts flocked to Kuala Lumpur, and even the U.S. President's personal representative gave the Malaysians the honor of a visit. A mass of options was offered, right up to a significant price cut -- if only they would take the F-16 instead. As a result, the Americans "shoved in" their own machines, while Russian representatives have spent over a year fighting to settle the details of their contract. The managers of a number of U.S. firms concerned by Russia's attempt to display its wares in Singapore in the appropriate way also appealed to the White House for help. And, typically, the President did not label them "fascists" or take them to task for trying to become a burden around the neck of the American people, but instructed that $600,000 be allocated from the state budget to cover their expenses at the Singapore airshow. (It is hardly a coincidence that the Americans were given the lion's share of the time to demonstrate their hardware, and Russia as a result, to use the lively expression of our interlocutor, was frankly dumped.) Bill Clinton, like, moreover, his predecessors, is not averse, if need be, with Hillary at his side, to going to the other end of the Earth in order at odd moments to undertake the defense of their military-industrial complex. And advisers hardly need to tell him that revenue losses from the trade in weapons represent a loss of influence by the state, and the weakening of its zones of interests, or, for instance, that he who flies ultimately rules the world. You have to have a pretty rich imagination to present Andrey Kozyrev or Boris Yeltsin in the role of defenders of the interests of the military-industrial complex.
