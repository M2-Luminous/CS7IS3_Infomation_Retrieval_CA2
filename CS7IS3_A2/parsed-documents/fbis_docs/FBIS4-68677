Snisarenko: "Tyumen Oblast Gets Its Duma"] [Text] It is specifically a duma, since according to the proposal of the organizational committee the deputies were offered two names for the supreme representative body of state power in Tyumen Oblast--the oblast duma or the legislative assembly. The deputies chose the oblast duma by a majority of votes. And now let us proceed in order. The meeting of the oblast supreme body was called to order by the chairman of the organizational committee, A. Kayumov. All 17 elected deputies were present, along with the head of the oblast administration L. Roketskiy, his deputies, representatives of the Yamalo-Nenetsk and Khanty-Mansi Okrugs, the representative of the RF [Russian Federation] President, G. Shcherbakov, members of the former oblast Minor Soviet, and representatives of the mass media and the trade union organs. Prior to the election of the chairman of the Tyumen Oblast Duma, the meeting was conducted by Deputy S. Kirichuk. On its first day of work, the duma heard the report of A. Zhikharev, chairman of the oblast electoral commission. The duma ratified the temporary regulations of the representative body of state power for Tyumen Oblast, the Statute on the Representative Body of Oblast Power--the Oblast Duma. After the recess, the deputies undertook a review of the most interesting question on the agenda--the election of the oblast duma chairman and his deputies. We must note that the proposal presented by Deputy A. Korelyakov to elect the duma chairman on a non-fulltime basis and to reduce the technical apparatus of the oblast duma to a proportion of one to one, with the number of apparatus workers equalling the number of deputies, was rejected. However, another proposal presented by this same deputy was passed--that of introducing an amendment to Article 4 of the Statute on the Representative Body of State Power in Tyumen Oblast--the Oblast Duma. This amendment stated that a deputy has the right to obtain any information in the oblast and federal organs of executive power and the ability to bring this information to his voters. By the results of the fourth round of voting, Nikolay Pavlovich Baryshnikov, the deputy head of administration of Khanty-Mansi Okrug, was elected chairman of the Tyumen Oblast Duma. At the suggestion of the new chairman of the oblast duma, Vladimir Nikolayevich Tretyakov was elected as his deputy. A detailed account of the first day's work will be presented in the next issue.
