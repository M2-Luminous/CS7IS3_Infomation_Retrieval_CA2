In him, we can find traces of heroic fighting during wartime, the quality of an exemplary worker, and a struggling and aggressive character. The stunning and moving achievements he made in leading the people of Xiadingjia through arduous efforts have long been widely known on the agricultural fronts all over the country. Not long ago, comrade Ai Qi, my old comrade-in-arms and an author, gathered material, despite his old age, in the mountainous areas of eastern Shandong and wrote down what he saw and heard there and completed the book. After reading it, I acclaim it and have mixed feelings. Using detailed facts, the book illustrates how the protagonist killed his enemies, made achievements, and then vowed to pioneer a cause back home; how he bought a donkey for a generously high price and engaged in war in adverse conditions among the hills and rivers; how he made reforms and brought forth new ideas and led the masses in a struggle to get rich. This enables people to know the broad-mindedness and courage of this unyielding old soldier and this undaunted man. The book also tells with subtleness touching stories about him including how he did not hang on to his achievements but would rather become a peasant, how well he has strictly taught his children, how he has remained uncorrupted, and how he withdrew to the second front and how his remaining enthusiasm burned. This enables us to feel deeply how he has worked selflessly for the public interest and what lofty ideals he has by keeping his hands clean, and how he has closely integrated himself with the masses, and how he has harmoniously integrated his career and life. All this is usual and lofty, respectable and credible. As an ideal, Comrade Wang Yongxing and the people of Xiadingjia reflect the spiritual outlook of China's 800 million peasants; that is, they ardently love the party, the country, the troops, and firm socialist beliefs; and that they have the heroic courage of pioneering a cause and struggling courageously, they have the aggressive spirit of being devoted to reform and bringing forth new ideas and the fine virtues of considering the situation as a whole and making a sacrifice sincerely.... This is the supremely lofty soul of the Chinese people and is the motivation rallying the people's support and invigorating China. The PLA is a great army. Over the past 60 years or more, tens of thousands of youths with lofty ideas have been steeled in this revolutionary cauldron. They have made indelible contributions to the liberation of the Chinese people and to construction. Comrade Wang Yongxing is a good example of demobilized and handicapped servicemen and is a piece of good steel from the cauldron of the army. Countless people like Wang Yongxing have added glory to the army and have sacrificed for the country with unlimited loyalty to the party and full ardor and sincerity. One can see from them that our Army's glorious traditions are being carried forward on all fronts and have become a bright torch reflecting on the Great Wall of steel. People who have been through the years of war deeply realize that in order to struggle for national liberation and national independence, it is necessary to endure countless dangers and difficulties and blood-and-fire tests and to pay the cost of sacrificing oneself and forgetting about death. Today, the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics under the party's leadership presents extremely heavy and arduous tasks and still demands that we pioneer a cause arduously and struggle continuously. The publication of the book will offer people vivid teaching material so they can have a strong belief in the party's leadership, have strong trust in socialist beliefs, and carry forward the glorious traditions. From it, we can absorb political nutrients, cultivate our morals, arouse the revolutionary spirit, overcome all difficulties, and proceed from success to success with full confidence in our hearts. What needs mentioning is that the author comrade Ai Qi was a former serviceman. Since retirement, he has devoted himself to the great tide of reform and construction by writing courageously and ardently. This persistent spirit is valuable and deserves praising. I sincerely congratulate the publication of the book and look forward to the publication of more new works by comrade Ai Qi.
