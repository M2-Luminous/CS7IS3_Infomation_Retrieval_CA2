Woltjer returned from Israel on Thursday [24 February] and is the draftsman of the European Parliament's (EP) opinion on the peace talks. After his three-day visit to the Occupied Territories and Jerusalem, Woltjer came to the conclusion that the EU should put more pressure on Israel. He proposed that the EU should use both the association agreement and its financial protocols with Israel -- involving millions of guilders in loans -- to influence the peace process. "Everything must be done to improve the appalling living conditions of the Palestinians in the Occupied Territories, otherwise the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement is doomed to failure," Woltjer said. In April the EP will debate the current state of the peace agreement. "The European Commission then will be asked to increase the pressure on Israel," the Netherlands MEP announced. He spoke of "positive-critical" pressure on Israel, because in his opinion the rapprochement policies of the Rabin government were the only correct ones. "Rabin must be helped against the pressure of the army and the opposition," he said. In the meantime the EP has formed an ad hoc delegation for Palestine including all the European parties. This delegation, led by Claude Cheysson and Woltjer, wants to monitor how the Commission is fulfilling the promises made to the Palestinians since the peace agreement between Israel and the PLO. Woltjer returned from his mission to the territories occupied by Israel "with little euphoria." He blamed the Israeli Government for the bloodbath in Hebron. "They are responsible in the Occupied Territories," Woltjer said. "With my own eyes I have seen how Jewish colonists walk round everywhere armed. The government allows that and therefore, as the ruler in the area, it is also guilty." According to what he saw, the Palestinian population as yet has seen nothing positive from the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. The perspectives for an Israeli-Palestinian detente were very poor, he said. The Palestinians in the Occupied Territories indeed will gain more say over tourism, health care, and education. "But if they want to build just one hospital they have to ask the army for permission, because 60 percent of the land has been nationalized by Israel," Woltjer said. He questioned the viability of Gaza, where Israel is demanding a safety zone which includes approximately half the Gaza Strip and also "accounts for the most usable land." Woltjer accused Israel of sabotaging the export of Palestinian agricultural and market gardening products. The EP has demanded that the possibilty exist for these products to be exported directly to Europe. "But in practice," Woltjer said," the Israelis carry out detailed security checks, the costs of which are then passed on to exporters. This makes the earnings of the exporters very small." Therefore the building of a harbor in an autonomous Gaza is an "absolute necessity." The EU has made approximately one billion guilders available for the Palestinian refugee camps and, among other thins, it finances education centers. But Israel is blocking the import of materials, because Jerusalem wants the Palestinians to pay sales tax on deliveries. "Europe and Israel are arguing about the issue," he said.
