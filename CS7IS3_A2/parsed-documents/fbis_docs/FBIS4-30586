FBIS4-30586 "dreas124_d_94022" FBIS-EAS-94-124 Daily Report 28 Jun 1994 South Korea Reportage on Strikes, Responses Continues Reportage on Strikes, Responses Continues Subway Strike Continues Fifth Day SK2806052094 Seoul YONHAP in English 0508 GMT 28 Jun 94 SK2806052094 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, June 28 (YONHAP) -- The Seoul subway workers' strike continued for the fifth straight day Tuesday with the fatigue felt by non-striking workers, after working overtime for the past four days, causing a reduction in operating hours and leaving many commuters stranded during the morning rush hours. On lines two and three, operating hours were cut with trains running from 6:00 A.M. to 10:00 P.M., instead of from 5:00 A.M. to 12:00 P.M. Moreover, intervals between train runs were extended from three minutes to six minutes, causing traffic congestion at nearly all stops during the morning rush hours. At Sadang station, a transfer point for lines two and four, some 300 stranded passengers delayed a train's departure by about 15 minutes at 8:40 in the morning. However, on lines one and four, which are linked with the national railroads, the intervals were back to the near-normal three to four minutes, as national railway operations were nearly normalized with striking train engineers returning to work. As of 8:00 A.M. Tuesday, 3,823 or 44 percent of the 8,724 striking subway workers had returned to work, according to the Seoul Metropolitan Subway Corp. Consequently, the corporation extended the deadline for returning to work to 4:00 P.M. Tuesday from 11:00 A.M. Saturday. As a result, whether subway operations are normalized within the week depends on how many more striking workers return to their posts by the new deadline. Corporation officials said the number of strikers returning by the extended deadline would determine whether lines two and three could resume normal operations within the week. Meanwhile, railroad operations are rapidly returning to normal as more than 90 percent of striking workers have returned to work. The Korean National Railroad (KNR) said Tuesday that freight train operations, including those for containers, oil and cement, had reached normalcy, with cargo train runs increasing to the pre-strike level of 543 a day across the country. Commuter train operations on major lines also achieved 90 percent normalcy, while passenger train runs on trunk lines such as Seoul-Pusan, Taejon-Mokpo and Iri-Sunchon increased by 15 from Monday to 82, 18 percent of the normal level. Passenger and cargo train runs totaled 1,444 across the country for the day, more than 70 percent of the pre-strike level, the KNR said. By late Monday, 2,866 locomotive engineers, or 96 percent of the striking engineers, had returned to work or expressed their intention to do so, and 1,986 assistant engineers, or 95 percent, and 1,122 rolling stock inspectors, or 76 percent, followed suit.
