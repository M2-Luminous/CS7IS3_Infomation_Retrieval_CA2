Obviously, the Palestinian stance regarding the issues under discussion does not please the other parties. Therefore, sometimes the Palestinian side is given a breather, and at other times it is spurned until its positions have cooked on a low fire until the pressure affects it. Although comparison between the Palestinian-Arab dealings on one hand and the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on the other is not pertinent, especially after taking into account the common Arab destiny and the single pan-Arab affiliation, those pressures have, however, drawn the attention of observers and made them inquire about the secret of their sequence within a span of a few days. Observers are also intrigued by the Palestinian reaction, which presumably will be forthcoming, and by the possible repercussions of such a reaction. Palestinians have the right to adopt positions compatible with their supreme national interests just as any other people inside and outside the Arab world, particularly as those interests do not at all contradict the interests of the Arab brothers. Hence, apart from being natural and healthy, disagreements between Palestinians and their brothers are at the same time premature since the occupied territories are still subject to the authority of the Israeli occupation. Any talk about agreements, regardless of their shape or extent, is like placing the cart before the horse. The Palestinian stance seeks an honest implementation of the Declaration of Principles, as affirmed by Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, who prior to leaving Amman stressed the need for implementing the provisions relating to Israeli withdrawal and establishment of a Palestinian national authority. In the face of rapid developments, the Arab brothers are supposed to rise to the level of the historic and grave responsibilities and challenges and enhance coordination to confront the dangers threatening the unity of their positions and the comprehensiveness of their cause.
