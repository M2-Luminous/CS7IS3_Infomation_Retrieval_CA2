It will last for two days. [passage omitted] According to the Baltic desk officer at the Russian Foreign Ministry, Aleksandr (Udaltsev), Russia has not taken upon itself any obligations regarding a troop withdrawal deadline. The key obstacle in the interstate talks is the fact that several sets of documents have so far not been signed. Russia is aiming for a social guarantees agreement for Russian military pensioners and their family members to be concluded at the same time as a timetable and a deadline for the Russian troop withdrawal are set. According to (Udaltsev), the talks opening today must focus precisely on these issues. The Foreign Ministry of the Republic of Estonia received yesterday's statement of Aleksandr (Udaltsev), a Russian Foreign Ministry employee, with amazement. The Foreign Ministry finds that the content of (Udaltsev)'s statement is in conflict with both the CSCE and UN documents, as well as with Russian previous statements. The Estonian side is the more surprised by Russia's behavior because during the latest rounds of talks the Estonian side had made concessions on the issue of the troop withdrawal deadline, without possessing a satisfactory timetable. The statement of the Estonian Foreign Ministry notes that hopefully (Udaltsev)'s statement must be seen as a position of a Russian diplomat on the eve of another round of talks, so as to influence the talks. Should this, however, become Russia's official position then the issue of suspending the talks will be seriously on the agenda, due to Russia's unconstructive behavior.
