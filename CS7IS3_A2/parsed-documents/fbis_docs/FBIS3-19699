The financial subsidies from Bonn that had been applied for and approved arrived much too late for its startup. Not until the 800,000 German marks [DM] finally arrived were the company founders able to decisively increase the tempo of expansion, according to Friedrich Luecking, Parsytec's marketing chief. Today, the manufacturer of parallel computers has 150 employees and--only eight years after startup--sales of nearly DM30 million. Sales specialist Luecking is certain that without government money "we would not have achieved such rapid growth." Other financiers--such as the big banks--kept aloof. At the time, only the Aachen City Savings Bank granted the founders of the enterprise a loan. The experience of the Aachen electronics tinkerers is not an exception. Whoever has ideas but no capital and wants to establish a company in Germany has a rough time of it. Private financiers are a scarce commodity, banks insist on collateral, and government grants are to be landed--if at all--only after nerve-deadening struggles with forms and long waiting periods. It is understandable that Erich Haeusser, head of the German Patent Office, laments: "No one in Germany really risks capital for innovations." If, in the management suites of industry and the banks, the people with reservations continue to maintain the upper hand, according to the top guardian of patents, "German business and industry will be throwing jobs away." To date, it has been primarily too costly workers, sleepy managers, and regulation-crazy politicians that have been held responsible for Germany's malaise as a location for business and industry. On the other hand, it was not only Mannheim economics professor Wolfgang Buehler who consistently included the banking system among the "assets" of Germany as a place to do business. No wonder: The German financial houses have remained spared of crises such as the savings and loan scandal in the United States or the real estate debacle in Japan. Even during the deepest recession the major banks in Frankfurt have achieved record profits--proof for Manfred Weber, general executive manager of the National Association of German Banks, of the "stabilizing effect" of the universal banking system. Because German credit institutions are permitted to engage in all types of financial business and are allowed to accumulate undisclosed reserves almost at will, they can consistently show profits. But Ingo Walter, a professor at New York University and at INSEAD [European Business Management Institute] in Fontainbleau, believes that it is often the case that "success is a sign of failure" because "great stability" has a reverse side to it--"a lack of growth." The cost to the German economy, according to bank expert Walter: "too high capital costs" and "too little receptivity to innovation." The close relationship between credit management and industry--resulting from links to house banks, equity interests, and directorships--that once made the economic miracle possible, is now increasingly acting as a brake on growth. Dieter Wolf, head of the Cartel Office, also lamented during the latest hearings before the Economics Committee of the Bundestag on the subject of "the power of the banks" that the strong influence of the banks "has a tendency" to act in a way that is "inimical to innovation." Germany's managers have thus far not been heard uttering such sharp criticism--no one would like to ruin things with his house bank during a recession. Yet when the Munich IFO Institute [Institute for Economic Research] was commissioned by WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE to sound out 702 companies, the managers, under the protection of anonymity, dispensed with their reserve: Some 59 percent complain about too little competition among German banks and 63 percent regard their willingness to undertake risk to be too low when compared to international standards. New York expert Walters believes that, in contrast to the Americans, the British, and even the French, the Germans have apparently not grasped the "principle of diversification"--harsh criticism since, after all, every economics student today learns portfolio theory that teaches that a combination of speculative investments can entail lower overall risk than the respective individual risks. Yet the Germans, bank researcher Walter observes, are still always looking at things on project-by-project basis rather than looking at entire portfolios. The unfortunate consequences: There is too little risk capital for innovation and establishing new companies. For all that, it looked in the 1980's as if the banks were awakening from their lethargy. Under the sponsorship of financially strong institutes, holding companies were springing up everywhere. The successes in California's Silicon Valley invited imitation: The average return on capital of American venture capital companies reached 20 percent. The Germans tasted blood and from 1982 through 1987 the volume of investments grew from DM785 million to just under DM1.6 billion. When quick success was not forthcoming, things went downhill again. Instead of investing in risky, innovative projects, the holding companies preferred to buy into established medium to small-sized companies. Holger Frommann, managing director of the National Association of German Financial Investment Companies, does not like to use the terms "venture capital" or "risk capital" any more because of their "negative sound." True venture financing, according to Hans-Joachim Hass, chief of the Economic Policy Department at the BDI [Federal Association of German Industry], "hardly exists any more." The extreme aversion to risk on the part of German banks has proven to be particularly unfortunate for reconstruction in eastern Germany. It helps little that Federal Chancellor Kohl repeatedly makes a personal appeal for the promised "bank billions." Bad consequences of the lack of risk capital: Most east German inventors and companies are facing the threat of losing their patent rights. Only 18 percent of former GDR patents had acquired full legal patent protection by the end of 1992; the Patent Office estimates that about 50 percent of them are usable, however, yet the money is only sufficient for the registration of individual inventions. Consequence: For companies, the innovative potential is lost. Whether in the east or the west--there is enough money, complains Klaus Bregger, chairman of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] Association of Small Businessmen, but it is just "being put in the wrong place." The big banks have given "the cold shoulder" often enough to the founders of software companies and biolabs: "The banks are lacking in expertise and intuition." The conservative predominance of the established money houses has created a climate that leaves little room for venture capital. For the minority of risk-loving investors in Germany there are few opportunities to invest in expanding companies because young firms are a scarce commodity on the stock market--underwriting is handled almost exclusively by the banks and their creditworthiness requirements are far more stringent than the legal regulations. Whereas more than 800 firms were launched on Wall Street last year, precisely nine new companies made it to the stock market in Germany. Whether the Bonn government's plans for the registration of a "small joint stock company" can make a decisive difference remains yet to be seen. No doubt about it: The German equity market is underdeveloped and, in addition to restrictive regulations and fearful investors, it is the leisurely banks that are primarily responsible for it. Moreover, for a long time foreign investors were not enthusiastic about Siemens, Daimler-Benz, or Mannesmann stock because, in contrast to the Anglo-Saxon world, the financial markets hardly play a role in the control of companies in Germany. Unimpressed by short-term capers, members of the board of directors from banks and friendly companies saw to the reconciliation of interests among workers, managers, and shareholders. Yet what for a long time had been a "mainstay," the British magazine ECONOMIST groused, is now developing into a "burden" because the conflicts of interest are becoming critical--the conflict between the desire of employees for lifelong employment and that of shareholders for better return on capital, for example. According to American professor Walter, the scandal surrounding the metal company [as published] causes doubts about the German system to continue to grow. The very thing happened in that case that bank participation on boards of directors was supposed to prevent: "The theory was good but the practice of it was not very successful." The New York economist hopes that the affair of the metal company could--certainly in a way similar to that of the insider scandal involving IG Metall [Industrial Trade Union of Metalworkers] boss Franz Steinkuehler--initiate reforms in the German system. The Federal Government's second Capital Market Development Law, after all, provides for stricter regulations concerning insiders and the establishment of an independent regulatory authority for securities. Werner Seifert, head of Deutsche Boersen AG [German Stock Exchanges, Inc.], is citing the emergence of an "equity culture" in Germany. But banking official Weber warns against "exaggerated expectations:" "We have a long road ahead of us." Innovative company founders can hardly muster that much patience and the call for state intervention is thus rapidly becoming louder among Bonn economic policy makers: The CDU wants to create tax breaks for high-tech investors, and Jenoptik chief Lothar Spaeth wants to entice private investors, banks, and the government to join together in a collective innovation fund--a proposal that makes Minister for Economics Guenter Rexrodt shudder. He is not at all in favor of the government "jumping into"--of all places--that most noble discipline of the free market economy: the allocation of risk capital. The Aachen Parsytec Company has already drawn its conclusions from the stunted venture capital market in Germany: It wishes to sell shares on the stock market--not in Frankfurt or Duesseldorf, however, but rather directly to risk-loving investors--in the United States.
