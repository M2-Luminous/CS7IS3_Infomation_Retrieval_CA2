The talks during this meeting dealt with the Arab situation and the efforts being exerted to tackle the situation in fraternal Yemen. AL-THAWRAH stresses that Syria is actually qualified to play a pioneering pan-Arab role, and that it was the first to achieve solidarity and unity. Its Arab and international credibility has given it this pivotal and effective role that has attracted the sons of the Arab nation. AL-THAWRAH reviews some of Syria's achievements and stands, such as the October war, its sacrifices for the sake of the Palestine question and Lebanon's unity, and its efforts to achieve unity with Egypt, Libya, Jordan, Sudan, Iraq, and Algeria. The paper also reminds us of Syria's pan-Arab stand at the Geneva summit between President Hafiz al-Asad and President Bill Clinton. The Arabs and the world were unanimous that President al-Asad negotiated on behalf of all Arabs. AL-THAWRAH says: It is a stand that is committed to defending Arab rights and the Arab nation's interests, to achieving its unity, to settling differences among Arab brothers, to preventing internecine fighting and bloodshed, and to defending every pan-Arab achievement, such as Yemeni unity, which is an important step toward achieving Arab unity. Syria stands with the fraternal Yemeni people in their concern about safeguarding their unity, defending it, and protecting it from any reckless action or any attempt to torpedo it. AL-THAWRAH adds: Al-Asad's Syria has frequently warned against the dangers posed by Arab differences, which Israel seeks to create. The paper calls for assuming responsibility to achieve Arab unity and to adopt a unified stand, particularly in light of the current changes in the world. Israel is exploiting these changes to besiege the Arabs, increase their differences, and isolate them from their friends in order to force them into capitulation and normalization. Unity is needed to face Israel, especially while it abides by occupying land, annexing Jerusalem, building settlements, and bringing more Jewish settlers. AL-THAWRAH also notes President Hafiz al-Asad's statement that Syria's policy has always been based on achieving Arab solidarity. In addition to this, Syria advocates unity and calls on others to achieve it, whether with us or with the other Arab states. We have always warned of the dangers posed to the Arabs if they do not achieve solidarity and unity. Arab solidarity is the cornerstone of the joint Arab action on which we build our subsequent steps. Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: Based on all of this, Damascus attached great importance to the Yemeni issue in order to arrive at a quick and practical solution to the current crisis, and to foil the scheme of internecine fighting and partition, taking into consideration that safeguarding Yemen's resources necessitates the establishment of a strong unified state, especially since Yemen enjoys an important location on the Arab and international map.
