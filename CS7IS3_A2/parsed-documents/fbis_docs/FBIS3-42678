It should be specified immediately, though, that their numbers are not, for that matter, as great as it would seem to many of our compatriots plagued by arbitrary administrative rule. Thus the number of employees of the organs of state and municipal administration in our country is comparable with the number of their colleagues in France, although our population is about three times larger. But the urgent need for the speediest formation of the institution of a modern civil service in Russia has not lowered the intensity of the political passions which have flared up in this connection. The key proposals of a working group on reform of the civil service which had been formed in the Office of the President of the Russian Federation and which believe that it is the latter who should be at the head of the hierarchy of Russian officialdom in all branches of power were blocked back in the spring on the pretext of the possible opposition of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation. Instead of an edict on the establishment of a system of public service itself and the creation under the president of the Russian Federation of a body to administer it, there appeared an edict on priority measures for a reform of the civil service (which, strictly speaking, simply did not exist), according to which merely a consultative body--the Council for Personnel Policy--was formed under the president. One further edict creating an organ of administration of public service under the auspices of the government was prepared secretly in parallel in the machinery of the government and with the direct participation of the State Legal Administration (the draft edict with official signatures was found during a search in the office of V. Romanyukha, a senior official of the government bureaucracy). Attempts were made once again at the start of November to remove from the jurisdiction of the president questions of leadership of the civil service and to convert the government bureaucracy into the organ of administration of public service (see NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA for 10 November). Directive N732-rp of the president of the Russian Federation on the formation of a working group to draw up a draft Statute on the Federal Civil Service of the Russian Federation issued shortly after this (and thanks, possibly, to the prompt intervention of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA) was, seemingly, to have tightened the control of the actual head of state over the process of formation of a modern civil service in Russia. But the supporters of the utmost strengthening of the positions of the government--even if thanks to the competent authority of the president--still made one further attempt a month later, more successful this time, to seize the initiative in the solution of this key question of our constitutional development. A tactical calculation on the inevitable law-making commotion on the eve of publication of the Constitution was made here. On 23 December the president was hastily presented for signature--before the text of the new Constitution of the Russian Federation had been published--a draft edict on confirmation of the Statute on Federal Public Service. The draft represented a hurriedly reworked version of this edict which had been prepared in secret in October-November in the government bureaucracy with the support of the State Legal Administration. That the Office of the President did not know about this edict follows, for example, from a remark of Mr. Filatov, who considered the adoption of a public service act a matter for the very near future (see ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA for 23 December). Given the multitude of provisions which have been referred back and which require the elaboration of additional legal enactments (this is precisely the task set in Edict No. 2267 of the President of the Russian Federation), it will take a long time for this document to become "passable" through an exacting representative body. So the adoption of the act any time soon is out of the question. On the pretext of the lack of resolution of the question of the organ of administration of public service this fundamental issue was omitted from the text of the Statute on Federal Public Service proposed for confirmation, although it was this matter which could alone have justified the hasty signing of the corresponding edict prior to the Constitution having taken effect. In the current situation a provision referring leadership of the institution of a civil service functioning in all branches of power to the jurisdiction of the president, as head of state and top official standing above all branches of power, will have to pass through the State Duma. There is no certainty here that the country's new legislative body will airily agree to such powers being reserved to the president. The present statute reduces them to the right to confer the class rank of "actual privy councillor." The extension of the executive's control to an institution which should in principle encompass all branches of power would signify a violation of the principle of the separation of powers and the government's impermissible interference in the sphere of competence of the head of state. The objective need for a strengthening of his role determines also the logic of the constitutional process in present-day Russia. Under the conditions of the immature political structure of society and undeveloped parliamentarianism, with most general notions of what kind of judiciary we should have, with the absence of harmony in the government, and without any experience of work in its possible coalition composition, alternative institutions of power based on traditional, rational-legal, or charismatic authority (primarily the institution of the presidency) remain the few guarantors of the preservation of statehood in the difficult period of the implementation of profound socioeconomic reforms. It would be strange were the president to forgo the prerogative, natural for his status, of leadership of the federal civil service of the Russian Federation, agreeing to be merely an actor in the ritual dramatizations of conferment of a class rank, presentation of credentials, distribution of decorations, and so forth. It will become clear in the very near future whether the president retains this most important instrument of realization of his competent authority or entrusts it to someone else or whether someone who is most farsighted avails himself of it. Who?
