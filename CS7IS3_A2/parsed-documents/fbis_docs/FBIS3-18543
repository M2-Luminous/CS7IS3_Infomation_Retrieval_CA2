[Begin recording] [Bildt] The German contribution was very important in the final stages of these negotiations, and we have also had reason to thank other people: The Belgian foreign minister made important contributions, and we had the opportunity to be in contact with the British foreign secretary at a decisive stage; so these complement the contributions that were naturally made by the Greek chairmanship. I think the German political will was of decisive importance. [Unidentified reporter] So without that contribution there might not have been any agreement? [Bildt] We cannot know that, but I think that it played a decisive role, in that the negotiations were able to continue at a critical stage and lead to a conclusion, and it is also playing a big role in that negotiations are now continuing with Norway and will, I believe, lead to a result.
