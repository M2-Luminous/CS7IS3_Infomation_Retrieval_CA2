FBIS4-30420 "dreas123_d_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-123 Daily Report 27 Jun 1994 South Korea Seoul, Pyongyang Venues Opposed Seoul, Pyongyang Venues Opposed SK2706040794 Seoul CHOSON ILBO in Korean 27 Jun 94 p 3 SK2706040794 Seoul CHOSON ILBO Korean BFN [Editorial: "Seoul and Pyongyang Should Be Avoided"] [Text] It is our opinion that the designation of Seoul and Pyongyang as the venue for a North-South summit should be avoided. In other words, Seoul and Pyongyang should be avoided as the venue for the summit unless the North-South summit is held merely for the sake of talks. If President Kim Yong-sam visits Pyongyang, North Korea will report that "South Korea's Kim Yong-sam came to Pyongyang, the capital of the chuche revolution." And if Kim Il-song comes to Seoul, Kim Il-song himself will not be very pleased with his visit. Besides, North Korea, in its Pyongyang television network, will give enormous publicity to the banners of the students from the National Federation of University Student Councils [Hanchongnyon] and Kwangju-South Cholla Province District Alliance of University Student Councils [Namchongnyon], and members of the so-called Chuche Idea Faction [Chusapa] in South Korea, who warmly welcome "their leader's triumphal entry into Seoul." These two anticipated events are not desirable for the productivity of the talks. What we are furthermore concerned about is the possibility that the talks may end up with external splendor but with no internal substance. This is because we are not sure about Kim Il-song's true intention and because "spectators" may dramatize the talks as the "greatest show on the earth." Truly, the talks this time should be held in a sincere atmosphere, should proceed in a substantive manner from the beginning to the end, and should advance toward the settlement of problems without becoming a show. To attain this, commotions over parties and ceremonies, making empty speeches, toasts, picture taking, spectators' racket, sightseeing, reporting of amusing gossip and stories, performance of stage shows, dinners hosted by mayors of Seoul and Pyongyang, and other show-like events, as seen in the past, should be totally excluded. This type of talks should not be attempted from the onset. Instead, the top leaders of the two sides should meet in a secluded villa or a country house in Mt. Sorak in the South and Mt. Kumgang in the North, and in-depth discussions should be held calmly on key points of essential issues without having any banquet and delivering speeches. In addition, the attempt of so-called well-known figures and VIP's wishing to join the event, should be thoroughly blocked. For this, it is furthermore necessary for the two top leaders to hold a calm, substantive meeting in a place far from the capital sphere. Thus, we hope that during the 28 June preliminary contact the two sides will designate a third place for a summit, other than Seoul and Pyongyang, and will agree to have only officials concerned attend the event and not hold festival-like events by inviting unnecessary celebrities. If they really want to have some people attend the site, it whould better to invite children. We wish to see that sincere talks be held in a plain and even pious atmosphere by excluding spectators.
