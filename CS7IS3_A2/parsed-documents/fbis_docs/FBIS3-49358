[no closing quotation mark as received] At the same time Zieleniec stressed that there were many questions of mutual interest in the Central European region which should be solved within the Visegrad Four group (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary). These were the questions directly connected with life in the area, economic cooperation and cooperation in the building of the region's infrastructure as well as "several political problems," he said. On the other hand, however, the philosophy of the transformation of Czech society is characterised by "relying on its own strength," Zieleniec said. He said he did not consider it appropriate to unnecessarily emphasise the exclusiveness of the Visegrad group. The exclusion of other countries from the European integration processes was not in the interests of Czech foreign policy, he said.
