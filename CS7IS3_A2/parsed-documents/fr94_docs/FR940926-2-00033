The Commission was established by Congress to make a full investigation of the policy implications and appropriate uses of risk assessment and risk management in regulatory programs under various Federal laws to prevent cancer and other chronic human health effects which may result from exposure to hazardous substances. It is expected that the Commission members will continue their inquiries and discussions on the five topical areas mandated by Congress: review of the National Research Council's report Science and Judgment in Risk Assessment (1994); exposure scenarios; uncertainty and variability; risk management; and cross-agency consistency. For information about the Commission, please call Joanna Foellmer at 703&hyph;308&hyph;8087. Dated: September 19, 1994.
