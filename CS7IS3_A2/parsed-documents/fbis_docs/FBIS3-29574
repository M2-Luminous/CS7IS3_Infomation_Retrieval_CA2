The people's genuine life has come into full bloom in the socialist fatherland's rivers and mountains. During the revolutionary turning year when our country's socialist construction enters a new developing stage, we have glorified with loyalty and feats the worthwhile year of struggle when all the party, all the Army, and all the people should be mobilized to bring about the great revolutionary upsurge in all front lines. The morning of the most meaningful day -- the February national day -- breaks in the chuche-oriented fatherland. With the unfolding of the history of a new year, 1994, full of confidence and optimism, the February national day is the greatest national felicitous day for which everyone has earnestly waited. On the morning of the meaningful February national day, the people's minds have been constant, like the blue pine trees in the forests of Mt. Paektu, and have been clear, like the waters of Mt. Sobaek, and are going toward the secret camp -- the native home in Mt. Paektu. Mt. Paektu's secret camp is the native home where the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, the sagacious leader [chidoja] of our party and people and the supreme commander of the Korean People's Army [KPA], was born. The voices of the anti-Japanese fighters that were raised when they experienced the greatest national felicitous day in this humble house now seem to ring out. The future of Korea is brilliant, because Mt. Paektu's bright star is brilliant. Indeed, the birth of Mt. Paektu's bright star was a grandiose sunrise of the great guiding star that will inherit and complete the chuche revolutionary cause pioneered by the great leader [suryong], was a historic event that promised the brilliant future of mankind, and was a great national fortune that we should uphold another great man with the Mt. Paektu's legendary hero and the anti-Japanese female general. Our people have enjoyed the great happiness and glory through 16 February. The immortal chuche idea has brought into full play a stronger magnetism and invincible vitality. The party's leadership has become the lifeline, thus all the party, all the Army, and all the people have breathed and acted with a single ideology and consciousness and the chuche-oriented socialist cause has been victoriously advanced. This reality shows our party's authority and might. All the people have been firmly united around the party with fidelity. The communist virtue of devoting all sincerity and even life to society, groups, and comrades is the genuine appearance of our society. A heyday in all fields, including politics, economy, military, and culture, has been unveiled. The revolutionary line of independence, self-reliance, and self-defense in national defense bears brilliant fruit in our country. This is the outstanding pride and might of our country. Socialism of our own style has pressed hard on the heels of the enemy without wavering in the face of vicious challenge and threat and of the moves of separation and blockade by imperialists and reactionaries. Our people have been proud of this glorious era in combination with the esteemed name of the dear leader comrade. All dignity, glory, and happiness that our people enjoy are the greatest privilege and fortune that can be obtained only by upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il -- great leader with [yongdoja] literary and military accomplishments, loyalty, and filial duty; and outstanding ideological theoretician, politician, and military strategist; and model of loyalist unfailingly faithful to the fatherland the people -- at the head of the party and the revolutionary Armed Forces. On the morning of the February national day, all the people across the country are looking up to the building of the party Central Committee on which our glorious party's flag is unfurling. The compatriots in South Korea and overseas and world revolutionary people turn their envious eyes upon Pyongyang. The people upholding the great leader [yongdoja] are the happiest people. The people who do not uphold the great leader are the unhappiest people. This is truth. Looking around today's world, our people deeply feel this truth and they have deeply experienced the truth through their lives. All of our people have the great glory and happiness of upholding the great leader [yongdoja]. We extend the greatest glory and warmhearted thanks to the leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. We deeply wish General Kim Chong-il, our supreme commander, long life and good health. Our people's wish contains not only the absolute faith that we and the fatherland cannot exist without you, but also the ever- victorious confidence that we can win a victory if you exist. The dear leader comrade has tided over all tribulations with firm will and matchless grit and turned adversity into prosperity by single- heartedly rallying the hundreds of thousands of people through broad-scope politics and the politics of benevolence. With the great grit of never being shaken by any thunder and lightening and with unrivalled strategy of [word indistinct] everything in the world, the dear leader comrade makes millions of enemies tremble. Our people have been convinced that as long as there is the dear leader comrade, there is nothing that our people fear and cannot implement. Thus, even when the enemies brought the dark clouds of a nuclear war and threatened our people while talking about special inspections and collective sanctions, our people were not shaken at all. No matter how hard the imperialists may maneuver to separate and blockade us, our people, upholding the party's revolutionary economic strategy, have brought into full play the grit of self-reliance and fortitude and the might of single-hearted unity. On the morning marking the great national felicitous national day, the only wish cherished deep in the people's mind is long life and good health of the leader comrade. We wholeheartedly wish the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il--fate of our nation, fate of the country, great defender of the socialist cause, and symbol of victory--long life and good health for the sake of the completion and victory of socialism of our own style, independent reunification of the country, realization of turning the whole world into independence, endless happiness of our people, and the prosperity of the country for good.
