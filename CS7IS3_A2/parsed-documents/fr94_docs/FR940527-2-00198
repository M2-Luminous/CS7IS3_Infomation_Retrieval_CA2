FR940527-2-00198 FR940527-2-00152 In accordance with 24 CFR 570.420(e) and 570.420(h)(3), and with the requirements of section 102 of the Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (HUD Reform Act), HUD is issuing this NOFA for New York State's Small Cities Program for Fiscal Year (FY) 1994 to announce the allocation of funds for Single Purpose and Comprehensive grants, and to establish the deadline for filing grant applications. The NOFA explains how HUD will apply the regulatory threshold requirements for funding eligibility, and the selection criteria for rating and scoring applications for Comprehensive grants and for scoring projects in applications for Single Purpose grants. Section I.A.3 of this NOFA provides a description of certain statutory amendments that apply to the HUD-Administered Small Cities Program, even though conforming regulations have not yet been adopted. The statutory amendments listed in Section I.A.3 require little or no regulatory elaboration. Conforming amendments will be made to 24 CFR part 570, subpart F in future rulemaking. Other information about the Small Cities Program will be provided in the application kit, which will be made available to applicants by HUD's New York and Buffalo Offices. 3. Statutory Changes Both the National Affordable Housing Act (Pub. L. 101&hyph;625, approved November 28, 1990) (NAHA) and the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992) (the 1992 Act) amended Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (the HCD Act). Various amendments made by the two recent statutes are applicable, as described below, to the funds made available under this NOFA. a. Principal Benefit Certification. NAHA amended section 101(c) of the HCD Act to require that at least 70 percent of the CDBG assistance provided over a specified period must be used for activities that principally benefit low- and moderate-income persons. Applicants must certify that CDBG assistance will be used as required by the amended section 101(c). The principal benefit certification has been revised to incorporate this change from 60 percent to 70 percent. b. Program Income. In determining the applicability of CDBG requirements to the use of program income, section 804 of the 1992 Act removes any consideration of whether the grantee is still participating in the CDBG program. This means that program income generated from projects funded in FY 1993 and thereafter will always be subject to all of the CDBG requirements. c. Microenterprise and Small Business Development. Section 807(c) of the 1992 Act defines a ``small business'' as one that meets the criteria set forth in section 3(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632(a)), and defines a ``microenterprise'' as a commercial enterprise having five or fewer employees, one or more of whom own the enterprise. Additionally, section 807(c) of the 1992 Act provides that in the provision of assistance under ยง570.203(b) to for-profit microenterprises and small businesses, HUD will not consider the use of CDBG funds for training, technical assistance, and other support costs provided to such entities to be planning or administrative costs. (Section 807(c) also directs HUD not to consider CDBG funds as being used for a planning or administrative activity when the funds are used to pay costs to develop the capacity of the grantee (or a subrecipient) to provide training, technical assistance or other support services to small businesses or microenterprises. Consequently_since these activities are not to be considered as planning or administrative activities_they are subject to compliance with the national objective requirements.) d. Lump Sum Drawdowns. The use of lump sum drawdowns for residential rehabilitation has been re-authorized for CDBG funds appropriated after Fiscal Year 1992. e. Eligible Activities _(1) Changes Affecting Existing Categories_(a) Assistance to For-Profit Businesses. Section 806(b) of the 1992 Act amends section 105(a) of the HCD Act so that CDBG assistance provided to for-profit businesses is not limited to activities for which no other forms of assistance are available, or to activities that could not be accomplished, but for that assistance. (b) Direct Homeownership Assistance. NAHA amended section 105(a) of the HCD Act to provide that CDBG funds can be used to provide direct assistance to facilitate and expand homeownership among persons of low- and moderate-income. Under this provision, CDBG funds may be used to: subsidize interest rates and mortgage principal amounts for low- and moderate-income homebuyers; finance the acquisition by low- and moderate-income homebuyers of housing that is occupied by the homebuyers; acquire guarantees for mortgage financing obtained by low- and moderate-income homebuyers from private lenders (except that assistance under Title I of the HCD Act may not be used by recipients or subrecipients to guarantee mortgage financing directly); provide up to 50 percent of the downpayment required from low- and moderate-income buyers; and pay reasonable closing costs normally associated with the purchase of a home incurred by a low- and moderate-income homebuyer. While this provision was set to expire on October 1, 1993, it has been extended to October 1, 1994 by section 807(b) of the 1992 Act. Under the terms of this provision, the locality must commit funds to a specific homeowner prior to October 1, 1994. It is extremely likely that this provision will be extended until October 1, 1995. Applications will be rated assuming that the extension will be granted. (c) Code Enforcement. Section 807(e) of the 1992 Act adds ``private improvements or services'' undertaken in an area to the list of activities that may be considered, together with code enforcement, in determining whether CDBG funds may be used to pay for the code enforcement in an area.
