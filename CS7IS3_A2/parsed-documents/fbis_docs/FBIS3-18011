The party says it cannot understand why the preparation of the agreements was delayed for two years, thus, losing the time when the agreement could have been based on terms more advantageous to Latvia. The party is surprised why international experts have not unveiled their views on the environmental and health effect of the Skrunda radar yet. The findings missing, the radar facility has become an object of conflicts and political speculations. The issue of the amount of rent for the radar's functioning should not be left only with the presidents of Latvia and Russia because the Latvian Constitution grants the country's president no such prerogative. The party wants Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs to also sign the anticipated rent contract.
