I asked Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang: "Have you ever calculated the cost of your anticorruption measures?" They replied: The two anticorruption measures we have proposed -- "maintaining the Army with regular taxes" and "maintaining the government with regular taxes" -- do require huge expenses from the government; the precondition for them is that the state must boost its powers to increase revenue. This issue has been addressed in a national situation report, entitled: "Report on China's State Powers," coauthored by Hu Angang and another scholar, Wang Shaoguang, in which they made a detailed analysis of the problem. What we are proposing -- like lowering tariff rates, abolishing non- tariff trade barriers and foreign trade franchises, and seriously restricting monopolies -- does not require many government resources, except a reduction in tariff income. Howver, what we gain from stimulating technological imports and promoting the competitiveness of domestic enterprises will be far greater. Breaking trade monopolies will reduce social trade costs by a considerable margin. The deregulation of interest rates and merging them with market rates, as we propose, will earn the government handsome revenues, because when commercial banks earn huge profits, the government will obtain enormous resources from the banks' profit remittances and through taxing them. Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang stressed: The ability to halt graft is a yardstick by which we can meaure if a political system is really institutionalized and efficient. We believe that stamping out corruption through institutional innovation depends on the progress not only of economic, but also political structural reforms, and of the development of socialist democratic politics. As political development in China trails economic development, and political structural reforms lag behind economic structural reforms, the focus of the next reform program should be an active and steady push for political structural reform. This, then, requires other significant reformist measures; for example: the division and checks of political powers, the scope and delimitation of government functions, streamlining and restructuring government organizations, the pursuit of a civil service system and the improvement of government officials' quality, strengthening the supervisory system, asserting the independence of the judiciary, improving the legal system, allowing the media a watchdog role, and so on. On the means of pursuing the anticorruption campaign, Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang said: The anticorruption campaign cannot rely on mass movements or political campaigns, which cannot tackle the institutional flaws and failings from which corruption grew. The former two either spawn confusion or result in turmoil. The fight against corruption is an institutionally innovative activity. It must be carefully designed, thoroughly organized, and patiently enforced. Its completion will not be in fiery and noisy campaigns or revolution, but the end result of a daily, orderly, almost undetectable process. There has never been any significant social reform in history that "owed its success to one decisive battle." The most successful road for institutional reform is that of active gradualness.
