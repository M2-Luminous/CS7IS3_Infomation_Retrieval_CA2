Its potential applications are many, in the automobile industry as well as avionics. The guidance of vehicles, whether they be robots, rockets, planes, missiles, or simply automobiles, has become a topic of research of major interest to industrialists. Determination of the vehicle's trajectory necessitates the use of an instrument that measures speed of rotation, namely, the gyrometer. The problem is to design and build a gyrometer that is at one and the same time reliable, economical, small, and as easily integrated into an automobile as any ordinary electronic component. The CEA [Atomic Energy Commission]-LETI integrated optics laboratory at Grenoble has been working on this problem for the past several years, in cooperation with PSA and Sextant Avionique. After having demonstrated the feasibility of integrating such a component on a silicon substrate, they have now received financing in the amount of 11 million French francs [Fr] from the Ministry of Research and Higher Education, under the Technological Leap program, to develop the device and prepare its industrialization. "The use of optics for gyrometers is now very old," says Patrick Mottier, head of this LETI laboratory. "It has been used in the laser and fiber-optic gyrometers developed by firms such as Thomson and Photonetics." But use of these very costly devices (around Fr10,000 for the gyrometers used in some Japanese cars) is essentially confined to rockets, submarines, and satellites. With the advances being made in integrated optics--enabling the production of conventional components (lenses, mirrors, separators, etc) on a glass or silicon substrate--the idea of developing an integrated optical gyrometer has made way rapidly. Many Difficulties Need Surmounting The principle of this device rests on what opticians call the Sagnac effect: A light guide, wound spirally, is fed at both ends by one and the same light source, a laser diode. The resulting two light beams circulating in opposite directions produce interferences, and, as this light loop rotates, the difference in level of interference is linked directly to the speed of rotation. In fiber-optic gyrometers, the light guide consists of an optical fiber several thousand meters long, wound in a loop some 10 centimeters in diameter. In the device developed by LETI, the optical fiber is replaced by a light guide on silicon, 80 centimeters long and 3 centimeters in diameter. "To lower production costs and attain components costing a few tens of French francs, we would like to reduce the size of this loop," says Patrick Mottier. "But we are limited by propagation loss along the ring." The principal drawback of these integrated optical devices is in fact their optical loss, which is 10,000 times that of fiber types. If the circuit is too long, the signal is greatly attenuated and becomes impossible to detect! Reducing Manufacturing Costs While LETI has contributed its components-integration skills, PSA and Sextant have worked mainly on the signal processing. The two firms do not by any means have the same philosophy in this venture. "PSA approaches it as a potential user. Sextant, on the other hand, wants to master the technology of producing these optical circuits," says Patrick Mottier. Be that as it may, the three partners, as of now, are bent on improving the prototype they have developed. Their objectives: reduction of optical losses, choice of a better source and the optimal frequency, and above all, lowering of the eventual manufacturing cost. The outlook: many long months of work!
