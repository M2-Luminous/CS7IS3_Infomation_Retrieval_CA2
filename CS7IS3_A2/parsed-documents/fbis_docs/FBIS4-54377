FBIS4-54377 "dreas103__a94033" FBIS-EAS-94-103-A Daily Report 21 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Tax Commission To Propose Administrative Reform Plan Tax Commission To Propose Administrative Reform Plan OW2605053494 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese 21 May 94 Morning Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2605053494 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] The government's Tax Commission (an advisory panel to the prime minister) has decided to make an emergency proposal for five-point administrative reform on the assumption that drastic tax reform will be implemented. The proposal points out the need to work out "a five-year administrative reform plan," among other things calling for integration or abolition of special status corporations; to set goals for correcting the price gap between domestic and foreign products; and to revise the current system of setting public service charges. Commission Chairman Kan Kato will submit a report to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata in early June. The commission thinks that as it will have to come up with a recommendation on drastic tax reform by the end of June, the government must present to the public its stand on administrative and financial reform to obtain public understanding on tax system reform, which will include a consumption tax hike. The commission is also expected to refer to specific ways of achieving administrative reform led by politicians and free of meddling by bureaucrats; it is extremely rare for the commission to make such a recommendation. The five points in the proposal comprise: 1) Formulation of the "five-year administrative reform plan"; 2) formulation of the "five- year local administrative reform plan"; 3) revision of the current system on setting public service charges; 4) setting of goals for narrowing the price gap between domestic and foreign products; and 5) making public how spending in welfare programs is calculated. The commission has held informal consultations on the matter with the Economic Council (an advisory panel to the prime minister; chaired by Gaishi Hiraiwa) and the Fiscal System Council (an advisory panel to the finance minister; chaired by Eiji Suzuji) to take concerted action on tax reform. If the three parties reach agreement, the report is expected to be submitted in their joint names. Then, how Prime Minister Hata uses his political leadership will become a new focal point of issue in the goal for achieving tax reform. The commission intends to ask the government to indicate specific areas of and plans for reform in formulating "the five-year administrative reform plan" including integration and/or abolition of government projects and government-invested special corporations. The Ad Hoc Commission on Administrative Reform (the third administrative reform council chaired by Eiji Suzuki) once tried to promote the plan to integrate and/or abolish special corporations. But, since the council tried to apply the reform to all special corporations, it incited opposition from the entire bureaucracy. As a result, the council could not incorporate the plan into its final report. Taking this failure into consideration, the Tax Commission has reached a decision to promote this plan by taking a different approach. As far as the "five-year local administrative reform" is concerned, since the role of local governments in promoting the welfare vision programs is expected to grow, the commission will call for tough administrative reform in local governments, for instance, by proposing to set up a system to restrict the number of local public service personnel. Regarding the issue of public service charge hikes which Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata has decided to freeze, the commission intends to ask the government to revise the current system of setting charges as a way of promoting industrial rationalization. It is thinking about asking the government to replace the current system with the "price cap system" [as published] which sets ceiling and allows decisions on charges more flexibility. As for the welfare vision programs, the commission will ask the Finance Ministry and Health and Welfare Ministry to make public how they came up with estimates on future welfare spending.
