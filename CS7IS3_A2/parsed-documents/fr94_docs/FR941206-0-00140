FR941206-0-00140 FR941206-0-00019 The proposed explicit requirements for determining the volatile organic concentration of a hazardous waste using information in a waste certification notice prepared by the waste generator are not included in the final rule. Instead, for hazardous waste that is not generated by the TSDF owner or operator (i.e., waste shipped to the TSDF from off-site sources under different ownership), the final rule allows the TSDF owner or operator to determine the waste volatile organic concentration by either testing the waste when he or she accepts delivery of the hazardous waste or using appropriate information about the waste composition that is prepared by the generator of the waste. The generator prepared information can be included in manifests, shipping papers, or waste certification notices accompanying the waste shipment, as agreed upon between the waste generator and the TSDF owner or operator. 4. Tank Standards Several changes to the tank standards have been made since proposal. An exemption from the tank standards has been added for those affected tanks used for biological treatment of a hazardous waste in accordance with requirements specified in the rule. Changes have been made to clarify the regulatory text regarding the tank cover design and operating requirements. Also, the conditions have been clarified that must be met for a particular tank to use a fixed-roof type cover without any additional controls in accordance with the subpart CC standards. Finally, provisions have been added to the rule to address those special situations in which emergency venting of the tank or the air emission controls installed on the tank is necessary for safety. 5. Surface Impoundment Standards Changes to the surface impoundments standards have been made to be consistent with the changes to the tank standards as applicable. 6. Container Standards Several changes have been made to the container standards since proposal in addition to limiting the applicability of the subpart CC standards to containers having a design capacity equal to or greater than 0.1 m3. The air emission control requirements for affected containers have been revised to provide several air emission control alternatives from which an owner or operator may choose one with which to comply. For containers having a design capacity less than or equal to 0.46 m3 (approximately 119 gallons), an owner or operator may place the hazardous waste in drums that meet U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) specifications under 49 CFR part 178 without any additional testing, inspection, or monitoring requirements. An owner or operator is also allowed under the final rule to place the hazardous waste in tank trucks and tank railcars that are annually demonstrated to be vapor tight using Method 27 in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A without any additional testing, inspection, or monitoring requirements. The requirements for waste transfer operations for containers have been revised under the final subpart CC standards. Submerged-fill of hazardous waste that is loaded into containers by pumping is required only when transferring the waste into containers having a design capacity greater than 0.46 m3. Submerged fill of the waste is not required when filling smaller size containers such as 55-gallon drums. The air emission control requirements for owners and operators treating hazardous waste in open containers have been revised. Whenever it is necessary for the container to be open during the treatment process, the container is required to be located in an enclosure connected to a closed-vent system with an operating organic emission control device. The final subpart CC standards include specific enclosure design and operation requirements which allow the enclosure to have permanent openings for worker access. Finally, the container standards have been revised to be consistent with the safety venting provisions added to the tank and surface impoundment standards. 7. Closed-Vent System and Control Device Standards The design and operating requirements for closed-vent systems and control devices have been changed to be consistent with those requirements already applicable to TSDF owners and operators under subpart AA in 40 CFR parts 264 and 265. The subpart AA standards have been in effect since 1990 and establish RCRA air standards to control organic emissions from process vents on certain types of hazardous waste treatment units.
