"I don't have the feeling that officials on the ground -- those who represent the UN secretary general -- are firmly committed to resorting to force everytime it's necessary," Juppe said on Europe 1 radio. "One must act faster and be more determined," he said, referring to this weekend's failure by North Atlantic Treaty Organisation warplanes to retaliate against Serb forces in the western Bihac region, despite calls for strikes by French peacekeepers. One French peacekeeper was killed in the Bihac pocket last week. French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, who visited Bihac on Sunday, strongly criticized "the often overly long delays, (and) the too heavy administrative and political procedures" preventing immediate retaliation when blue helmets come under fire. He had earlier spoken of his concern to the UN's special envoy to the former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi. Juppe, for his part, said that "Americans, Russians and Europeans had to convene again around a table," failing which there could be no global solution to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia.
