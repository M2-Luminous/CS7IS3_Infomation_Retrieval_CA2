FR940208-0-00094 FR940208-0-00031 Eight CHUs, or portions thereof, are designated in California (Chemehuevi, Chuckwalla, Pinto Mountain, Piute-Eldorado (includes Fenner DWMA), Ivanpah, Fremont-Kramer, Ord-Rodman, and Superior-Cronese). All are managed primarily by the BLM according to guidance provided in the California Desert Conservation Area Plan of 1980, as amended (Desert Plan), and the 1992 California Statewide Desert Tortoise Management Policy (Tortoise Management Policy). The Desert Plan defines four classes of land use with differing management goals and prescriptions. Classes include controlled use (wilderness and areas recommended for wilderness), limited use, moderate use, and intensive use (vehicle travel restrictions range from designated routes only in limited-use areas to no vehicular restrictions in intensive use areas). The Tortoise Management Policy designates three categories of desert tortoise habitat in which varying levels of protection are afforded to the desert tortoise and its habitat. Additional management guidance is provided in livestock allotment management plans (AMPs), habitat management plans (HMPs) for desert tortoises and other wildlife species, the East Mojave National Scenic Area Plan, and management plans for specific ACECs. The West Mojave Coordinated Management Plan and the Eastern Colorado Desert HMP are BLM management plans currently in preparation that will have an important effect on desert tortoise management in California. The West Mojave Coordinated Management Plan will be the basis for a programmatic section 7 consultation for BLM activities in the western Mojave Desert and may serve as a basis for habitat conservation plan(s) for local governments in the section 10(a)(1)(B) permit process. The Eastern Colorado Desert HMP will address all BLM activities in the Chuckwalla Bench area and will provide a framework for a programmatic section 7 consultation. The Chuckwalla CHU is managed by the BLM and the Navy (Chocolate Mountains Aerial Gunnery Range). Parts of the Superior-Cronese CHU are managed by the Army (National Training Center at Ft. Irwin) and the Navy (China Lake Naval Air Weapons Station). The Fremont-Kramer CHU includes a portion of Edwards Air Force Base. Portions of the Piute-Eldorado and Ivanpah CHUs in California are within the boundaries of the East Mojave National Scenic Area, which affords special protection to the area's natural, scenic, and other values (BLM 1980). Several programmatic and other biological opinions have resulted in additional regulation of activities within desert tortoise habitat in California. Biological opinions have limited grazing of sheep to category 3 habitats. Programmatic consultations have been completed for land use plans at the Naval Air Weapons Station and the Rand-Fremont Valley areas. The Service has also completed a biological opinion concerning the on-going mission for the Army's National Training Center at Ft. Irwin. Programmatic consultations also exist that define standard terms and conditions for mining operations disturbing less than 10 acres, for non-competitive vehicle races, such as poker runs, which occur on designated routes in some desert tortoise areas, and for the four OHV management areas within the western Mojave Desert. The Service and the BLM are currently developing a programmatic approach to long-term pipeline maintenance. The Service and the Navy are also informally consulting on a programmatic consultation for training activities at the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC) and within the Chocolate Mountains Aerial Gunnery Range. In Nevada, the majority of the desert tortoise habitat is managed by the BLM under the Clark County Management Framework Plan. The Stateline Resource Area of the Las Vegas District has prepared a draft Resource Management Plan that proposes designation of ACECs for desert tortoises; however, this document has not yet been finalized. Livestock grazing in Nevada is restricted to the period of June 15 to March 1, in accordance with the BLM's proposed livestock grazing program and the Service's biological opinion that analyzed that proposal. However, as of this date, the BLM's decision to implement this seasonal restriction has been stayed by an Administrative Law Judge. Although Interior Board of Land Appeals Administrative Law Judges have the authority to review land use decisions made by Interior agencies, they lack jurisdiction needed to review biological opinions issued by the Service. In southern Clark County, portions of the Piute-Eldorado CHU are also managed by the National Park Service (Lake Mead National Recreation Area). In 1991, the Piute-Eldorado Valley was established as a Tortoise Management Area (TMA), as mitigation for the incidental take of desert tortoises in the Las Vegas Valley, pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act. The Short-Term Habitat Conservation Plan for the Desert Tortoise in the Las Vegas Valley, Clark County, Nevada (Regional Environmental Consultants 1991), which described this mitigation, provides land-use control measures for this area. These measures include prohibition of competitive and commercial events, except in some portions of Eldorado Valley, placing livestock grazing areas into non-use status, and designation of roads and trails.
