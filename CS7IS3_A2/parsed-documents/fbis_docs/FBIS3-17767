Pavel Grachev's visit is evoking special interest here. I will recall that it was postponed twice, the last time because of the broad anti-Russian campaign started by the opposition last December. The cancellation of the visit obviously disappointed the official authorities at the time. For more than two years our countries did not have any agreements on military cooperation. Bucharest does not hide the fact that it sees its security only under NATO's roof. Romania was the first to sign the Partnership for Peace Treaty with it. At the same time, despite all kinds of statements on its striving toward military cooperation with the West, Romania understands perfectly well that it cannot do without an accord on military cooperation with its most powerful neighbor in the east. Today, Pavel Grachev and Romanian Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca discussed and signed such a document. [Grachev] It is a comprehensive treaty that presupposes a resumption of the most normal relations with the sovereign state of Romania. [Zheleznyak] Technical cooperation is of special interest to Romania. Its Army is equipped with artillery, tanks, aircraft, and other Soviet-made hardware. The country has no money to replace it, but spares and ammunition are needed to keep the military hardware in operational condition. The Russian defense minister plans to attend military exercises and meet the president and prime minister of Romania.
