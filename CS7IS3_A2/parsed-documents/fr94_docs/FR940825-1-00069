Verification of eligible immigration status shall be conducted by the responsible entity simultaneously with verification of other aspects of eligibility for assistance under a Section 214 covered program. (See §812.6(g).) The responsible entity shall verify eligible immigration status in accordance with the INS procedures described in this section. (b) Primary verification _(1) Automated verification system. Primary verification of the immigration status of the person is conducted by the responsible entity through the INS automated system (INS Systematic for Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE)).

If the INS SAVE system does not verify eligible immigration status, secondary verification must be performed. (c) Secondary verification _(1) Manual search of INS records. Secondary verification is a manual search by the INS of its records to determine an individual's immigration status. The responsible entity must request secondary verification, within 10 days of receiving the results of the primary verification, if the primary verification system does not confirm eligible immigration status, or if the primary verification system verifies immigration status that is ineligible for assistance under a covered Section 214 covered program. (2) Secondary verification initiated by responsible entity. Secondary verification is initiated by the responsible entity forwarding photocopies of the original INS documents listed in §812.7 (front and back), attached to the INS document verification request form G&hyph;845S (Document Verification Request), to a designated INS office for review. (Form G&hyph;845S is available from the local INS Office.) (3) Failure of secondary verification to confirm eligible immigration status. If the secondary verification does not confirm eligible immigration status, the responsible entity shall issue to the family the notice described in §812.9(d), which includes notification of appeal to the INS of the INS finding on immigration status (see §812.9(d)(4)). (d) Exemption from liability for INS verification. The responsible entity shall not be liable for any action, delay, or failure of the INS in conducting the automated or manual verification. §812.9 Delay, denial, or termination of assistance.
