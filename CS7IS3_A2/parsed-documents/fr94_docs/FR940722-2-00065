SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On August 27, 1992, Grieshaber & Co., Inc., Kennesaw, GA, 30144, submitted to CDRH an application for premarket approval of the Grieshaber Scleral Buckling Balloon Catheter. The device is a scleral buckling balloon catheter and is indicated for use as a temporary implant to buckle the sclera to facilitate retinal reattachments where multiple or single breaks in the anterior two-thirds of the globe do not subtend a retinal arc of more than one clock hour (6 millimeters). The application includes authorization from Storz ® , St. Louis, MO 63122&hyph;6694, to incorporate information contained in its approved premarket approval application (PMA) for the Lincoff Balloon (P820009). In accordance with the provisions of section 515(c)(2) of the act as amended by the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990, this PMA was not referred to the Ophthalmic Devices Panel, an FDA advisory panel, for review and recommendation because the information in the PMA substantially duplicates information previously reviewed by this panel. On June 2, 1994, CDRH approved the application by a letter to the applicant from the Acting Director of the Office of Device Evaluation, CDRH. A summary of the safety and effectiveness data on which CDRH based its approval is on file in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) and is available from that office upon written request. Requests should be identified with the name of the device and the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document.

A petitioner may request either a formal hearing under part 12 (21 CFR part 12) of FDA's administrative practices and procedures regulations or a review of the application and CDRH's action by an independent advisory committee of experts. A petition is to be in the form of a petition for reconsideration under §10.33(b) (21 CFR 10.33(b)). A petitioner shall identify the form of review requested (hearing or independent advisory committee) and shall submit with the petition supporting data and information showing that there is a genuine and substantial issue of material fact for resolution through administrative review. After reviewing the petition, FDA will decide whether to grant or deny the petition and will publish a notice of its decision in the Federal Register . If FDA grants the petition, the notice will state the issue to be reviewed, the form of review to be used, the persons who may participate in the review, the time and place where the review will occur, and other details. Petitioners may, at any time on or before August 22, 1994, file with the Dockets Management Branch (address above) two copies of each petition and supporting data and information, identified with the name of the device and the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received petitions may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. This notice is issued under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (secs. 515(d), 520(h) (21 U.S.C. 360e(d), 360j(h))) and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 5.10) and redelegated to the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (21 CFR 5.53).
