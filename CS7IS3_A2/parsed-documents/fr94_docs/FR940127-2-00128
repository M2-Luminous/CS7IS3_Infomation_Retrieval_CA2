Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to agree to conform to such standards. 6. The Shareholder Services Plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1 (b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b&hyph;1, except that shareholders need to enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b&hyph;1. 7. The trustees will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning the amounts expended under the Shareholder Services Plans and Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plans and the related Service Agreements complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of shares will be used to justify any distribution or servicing fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the trustees to justify any fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the independent trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties. 8. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that Service Payments made by a class under a Plan and any Class Expenses will be borne exclusively by that class. 9. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the classes and the proper allocation of expenses among the classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'') who has rendered a report to applicants, which has been provided to the staff of the Commission, that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Funds that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert will be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the Commission pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect to such reports, following request by the Funds (which the Funds agree to provide), will be available for inspection by the Commission staff upon written request to the Funds for such work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, and Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``Special Purpose'' report on the ``Design of a System'' as defined and described in SAS No. 44 of the AICPA. The ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time. 10. Applications have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses among the classes of shares and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial report referred to in condition 9 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 9 above. Applicants will take immediate corrective measures if this representation is not concurred in by the Expert or appropriate substitute Expert. 11. The prospectus of each class of shares will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different compensation with respect to one particular class of shares over another in the Funds. 12. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the trustees of the Trusts with respect to the Multi-Class System will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished to the trustees.
