Davorin (Zaberscak), counsellor at the Croatian embassy in Moscow, commented on the new situation for our radio station. [Begin (Zaberscak) recording] The sanctions were adopted at the United Nations and Russia's representative spoke in favor of sanctions. Any country's parliament might make a decision on discontinuing support for the decision, but this decision was made at the international level. Sanctions can only be lifted at the level at which they were adopted. We believe that until Serbia and Montenegro recognize the borders of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina as they were before the war, borders which the international community and this country recognized, it will be difficult to talk about lifting sanctions.
