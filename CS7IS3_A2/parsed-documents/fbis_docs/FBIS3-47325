On 20 December, Sino-Japanese working-level talks were held in Beijing on security issues. At the beginning of the talks, the Japanese delegation was surprised when Chinese officials hinted they would welcome a "leak" of topics to be discussed at the bilateral talks. An official said: "While Asian nations used to feel the `Japan threat,' this is now being replaced by the `China threat.' We would like to explain our policy thoroughly, and to obtain Asia's understanding. Japan can explain us to other nations." During the talks, the Chinese officials repeated their assertion: "We are just trying to maintain the minimum military strength for national defense." However, the Japanese Government conveyed the Chinese standpoint to the Asian nations through diplomatic channels. In January, Japan and China agreed to hold the first security talks between the Defense Agency and Chinese Defense Ministry in Beijing in February. Japan feels bad about its wartime aggression, and China is changing through rapid economic growth under the opening-up policy. The two nations are going to open up military exchanges for the first time in the 50 years since World War II. In post-Cold War Asia, the two nations are beginning to seek new security relations. The Sino-Japanese security talks by defense authorities were advocated by the Defense Agency. Last November, (former) Director General of the Defense Agency Keisuke Nakanishi secretly told (former) U.S. Defense Secretary Les Aspin: "As director general of the Defense Agency, I would like to visit China. I want to go there as soon as possible -- probably during the cherry blossom season." In reply, Aspin said: "That is a good idea. But we would like you to inform us of what China says." Nakanishi's true intentions are seen in the 1993 defense white paper. The 1993 white paper has a new section entitled: "Efforts To Establish a New Security Environment." In this section, the paper notes "promotion of international exchanges with foreign military officials will directly deepen mutual understanding with these nations." And it stresses "further promotion of dialogue is needed" especially for security in the Asia and Pacific region. In view of the presence of various ethnic and religious groups, the Defense Agency has a plan to establish regional security through a network of bilateral exchanges with various nations, rather than a multinational agreement. In this sense, China is the biggest target to achieve this objective. The security policy of postwar Japan has been promoted under a liberal interpretation of the peace constitution. Even under such circumstances, the Defense Agency and Self-Defense Forces [SDF] have always been "bit players" in the nation's postwar history. Although the SDF's role in UN peacekeeping operations has been positively discussed since the Gulf war, the conclusion of the cold war has led the world into an era of disarmament to enjoy the "dividends of peace." The significance of the Defense Agency is now in question since the Hosokawa administration pledged an SDF scale-down through reviewing the nation's defense buildup plan. Security Is Ensured Through Exchanges What is the role of the "outlawry-of-war forces" in national security in the new era? In reply to the question, the Defense Agency is preparing the following answer: "To ensure national security, exchanges of military officials should be promoted to deepen mutual confidence with neighboring nations." The agency is seeking Japan's initiative in confidence-building efforts in Asia to overcome the trend of SDF rationalization. Since the Tiananmen Square incident, China has been seeking better ties with neighboring nations, such as the ROK and SRV. However, these Asian nations are becoming wary of China's naval force buildup and policy for the Spratly and Paracels Islands. In this regard, the Defense Agency believes China will deal positively in security talks with Japan. A top agency official said he wants to hold talks on a regular basis, and noted: "The Chinese military authorities have close relations with the CPC leadership. That is why we attach importance to rerect dialogue with the Chinese Defense Ministry." The Defense Agency already has frequent exchanges with most Asian nations except China. The National Defense Academy and staff colleges of the Ground, Maritime, and Air SDF currently have 315 foreign-national students from 14 countries, including the ROK and Thailand. In return, some Air SDF officers are scheduled to study at the ROK air staff college this year. The National Institute for Defense Studies also receives military officials of Asian nations to dispel their suspicion that "Japan may again step onto the trail of past wrongdoing." As one of the guests, vice commandant of the Philippines National Defense Academy said: "I have learned Japanese people are not jingoistic." Seeking the Initiative Senior Defense Agency officials noted that international exchanges in this field are helpful to obtain neighboring nations' understanding of Japan's prudent defense policy, saying: "As a major economic power, Japan is certainly qualified to take the initiative in confidence-building efforts in Asia." On the other hand, international politics analyst Kazuhisa Ogawa said: "National security should be discussed in view of not only military affairs, but also food and energy policies. For example, Malaysia has a think tank called the Institute for International Policies. The institute has policymaking authority superior to the Defense Ministry and other government agencies. But Japan has no mechanism which overcomes bureaucratic sectionalism. The Defense Agency should not believe it can take the initiative in Asia without help from other government agencies." Mutual trust between military officials is superior to the deterrent force of ultramodern weapons--will Asia accept such a proposal made by a nation with a peace constitution?
