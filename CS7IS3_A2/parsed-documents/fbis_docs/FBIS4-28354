With Prime Minister Hata offering a forward-leaning response to Diet interpellation on the issue of satellite information-gathering, a debate on reconnaissance satellites has arisen. At the same time the United States and Russia have begun actively to sell satellite information overseas in line with defense conversion in both countries. With Japan, too, upgrading its observation satellite technology, the line between the technology's military and peaceful uses is gradually disappearing. How far will the "information-gathering capability" of Japan's satellites go? Among new projects under SDC consideration are the ALOS [expansion unknown] land observation satellite and the DRTS [expansion unknown] satellite for satellite-ground station data transmission. ALOS, for which the National Aerospace Development Agency of Japan is planning a launch around 1999, will weigh approximately 3.5 tons and orbit at approximately 700 kilometers. The satellite will be equipped with an optical sensor able to perceive visible and near-infrared light as well as a synthetic aperture radar [SAR] able to gauge the earth's topography by using reflected microwaves. The optical sensor will have a high resolution capable of distinguishing between objects 2.5 meters apart. The satellite's SAR will have somewhat less resolution capability, but its microwaves will not be attenuated by clouds, enabling the satellite to conduct observations day or night under various atmospheric conditions. The resolution of Japan's earth observation satellites has improved dramatically. The resolution of its first observation satellite, Momo, launched in February 1987, was 50 meters; for the earth resources satellite Fuyo, launched in February 1992, it was 18 meters. The resolution of the earth observation platform ADEOS [Advanced Earth Observing Satellite], a scientific satellite slated for launching in 1996, is eight meters. The 2.5 m resolution projected for ALOS will far surpass the respective 30 m and 10 m resolutions of America's Landsat and France's SPOT [expansion unknown] satellites. Making the aperture of the light sensor's telescope and the focal distance for the ALOS satellite approximately twice that of the ADEOS will improve the former's resolution. Using the ALOS, it will be easy to make maps with contours of 1:25,000. The Science and Technology Agency explains its significance as "a tool for cooperation with Southeast Asia, which is having difficulties making maps." Detailed observation of how forests are being cut and what damage is taking place due to acid rain will also reportedly become possible. At first ALOS was called HIROS [expansion unknown], the "HIR" standing for "high resolution." But the name was changed so as not to emphasize its high-resolution capability. Apparently at play, according to an individual involved, was the feeling that publicizing high-resolution capability "would give a pretext to the United States to try to sell us the U.S. high-resolution commercial satellites soon due to come on the market." The goal for the data relay satellite, for its part, is the establishment of a 24-hour observation system. DRTS will therefore be launched prior to ALOS into a high 36,000 km geostationary orbit. The observation satellite will be unable to send data directly to Japanese ground stations when on the other side of the earth, but will be able to send a large volume of information on a real-time basis via the relay satellite.
