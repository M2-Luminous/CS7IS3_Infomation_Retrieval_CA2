According to Hammad, the negotiations could be complete and the first Palestinian representative appointed "within a month." Currently, the PLO has no representative at the Vatican City, but Hammad, who is accredited with the rank of delegate-general in Italy, is responsible for formal relations. Chatting with reporters on the fringe of a conference of Palestinian and Israeli scientists and researchers organised by the Italian National Research Council, both Hammad and Israeli Ambassador in Rome Avi Pazner voiced optimism over the future of the Middle Eastern peace process. Pazner confirmed that negotiations will start shortly on extending Palestinian autonomy from Gaza and Jericho to other Israeli-controlled areas. "But Jerusalem is not on the agenda and will never be divided," he said, as he reported that the autonomy process was going better than expected. The Mideastern peace process and the progress towards Palestinian autonomy had produced "very fine" results, said the diplomat, adding that the events of recent months represent a "revolution" for the region. He was also asked about the Israeli attitude to the presence in the Berlusconi government of hard-right ministers and deputy ministers from the National Alliance, whose roots lie in the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement. "We'll judge by the facts, what they do and say, not what others say about them," replied the diplomat, repeating the position taken by Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres when he met his Italian confrere Antonio Martino in Luxembourg on June 13. The opening of the conference was also attended by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.
