Masayoshi Takemura said Hata's minority administration is not in "good shape" and defined it as a government that takes charge of "certain things" for a "certain period." Takemura made the remarks in a campaign speech in front of the Shimbashi Railway Station in central Tokyo. He was joined by eight of the party's 15 House of Representatives lawmakers who also gave speeches. Sakigake, previously a small body in the seven-party coalition of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, left the coalition last month during the process of picking Hata as Hosokawa's successor, complaining of the coalition's way of selecting a new leader. Departure of the leading coalition Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan, SDPJ] put the Hata administration on a minority power base. Political analysts predicted that the Hata cabinet will be forced to resign en masse or call a snap election of the powerful lower house as early as June after the Diet legislates the state budget for the current fiscal year that began April 1.
