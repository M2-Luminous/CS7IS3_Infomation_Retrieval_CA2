The bureau, quoted by the Economic Daily [JINGJI RIBAO], did not specify which city had the highest price increases, but named 18 in which inflation registered between 26 percent and 39.3 percent. All of the 18 cities named were in the eastern half of the country, the majority of these in coastal areas with the notable exceptions of Xian and Urumqi. Conversely, nearly all the cities with inflation rates of less than 20 percent were in the interior. Taking January and February together, the rate of inflation rose about 20 percent over the same period the previous year, and 25 percent year-to-year in the big cities, the report said. Major contributors to February's roaring inflation included vegetables, grains, and seafood, which rose in price between 30 percent and 53 percent. In another report Monday, the China Youth Daily [ZHONGGUO QINGNIAN BAO] quoted the bureau as estimating March's urban inflation rate at not less than 20 percent. These statistics and predictions underline the difficult task facing the government, which had promised to keep inflation below 10 percent for 1994.
