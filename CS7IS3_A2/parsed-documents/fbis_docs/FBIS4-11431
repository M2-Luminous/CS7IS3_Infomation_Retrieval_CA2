FBIS4-11431 "drlat082_b_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-082 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 Haiti Further on Police Raid in Raboteau Further on Police Raid in Raboteau FL2604183694 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio in French 1030 GMT 26 Apr 94 FL2604183694 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio French BFN [Excerpts] On 22 April, between 23 and 26 persons were allegedly killed in the coastal city of Gonaives, northwest of Port-au-Prince, by soldiers during a police operation staged at dawn in a working-class neighborhood, according to corroborating sources. It is the most serious act of collective repression committed in a provincial city since the 30 September 1991 coup d'etat. The neighborhood [Raboteau], which is the main slum area in Gonaives and is famous for its resistance to the Duvalier dictatorship in 1983, is reputedly home to numerous partisans of President-in-exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide. [passage omitted] The [Justice and Peace] Commission, which considers an additional investigation necessary for a final assessment of the event, does not rule out the possibility that even more people were killed or injured because the attackers fired on homes at a level that would compel occupants to exit. The Justice and Peace Commission describes the situation in Raboteau as very tragic. The populace, men and women of all ages as well as children, had to flee the area where gunfire was heard throughout throughout the day on 22 April. The Justice and Peace Commission points out that the 22 April raid, carried out by military troops and well-known members of the Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti, followed a first wave of terror in Raboteau after the suspicious burning of tires in the streets. In fact, says the Justice and Peace Commission, the forces of order were looking for a man named Arnault Mtayer, also known as The Cuban, which gave rise to searches without warrants and the sacking of several houses in Raboteau.
