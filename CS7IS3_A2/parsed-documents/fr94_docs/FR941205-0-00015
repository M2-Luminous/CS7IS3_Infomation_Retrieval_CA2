FR941205-0-00015 FR941205-0-00002 The provisions of the proposed rule are adopted with several amendments in the final rule. Sections 208.3(c)(5) and 208.7(a)(1) of the final rule will be amended to provide that the 150-day period shall commence upon the receipt by the INS of a complete application for asylum. The filing of an incomplete application shall not commence the 150-day period provided that the INS has returned the application by mailing it within 30 days in accordance with 8 CFR 208.3(c)(5). Section 208.7(a)(4) also will be amended to specify that an applicant's failure without good cause to appear for an interview under section 208.9(a) precludes the applicant from receiving employment authorization under section 274a.12(c)(8). Failure to appear without good cause to receive the decision of the asylum officer under section 208.9(d) shall be treated as delay caused by the applicant and shall toll the 150-day period. A new paragraph 208.7(a)(5) will be added to specify that the new rules governing eligibility for employment authorization do not apply to persons whose asylum applications have been filed prior to January 4, 1995. Finally, section 208.2(b) will be amended to state that an immigration judge may permit a referred applicant to file an amended application, but that any delay caused by such a request shall extend the period within which the applicant may not apply for employment authorization. 8. Renewal of Employment Authorization (Section 208.7(d)) Proposed Rule: Section 208.7(d) would be amended to require that in order for employment authorization to be renewed before its expiration, an application must be received by the INS at least 90 days before the employment authorization expires. Under current regulations, applications for renewal must be received at least 60 days prior to expiration. Comment: Several comments criticized this proposal for placing an unfair and unnecessary burden upon applicants for renewal. The comments stated that the INS should be able to process renewals within 60 days. Some comments stated that renewal of work authorization should be assigned to INS District Offices, and not to the INS Service Centers, because the District Offices are more likely to have access to information regarding the alien's status. One comment approved of the practice of charging a fee for renewal of work authorization. Response and Disposition: Under 8 CFR 274a.13(d), the INS district director shall adjudicate the application for renewal of employment authorization within 90 days of receipt. The lack of uniformity between the current 60-day rule for filing renewal applications and the 90-day rule for adjudicating such applications led to disagreements between applicants and the INS. The INS believes that fewer disputes will result if these periods are uniform. The INS agrees that many such applications can be adjudicated in significantly less than 90 days, and will continue to work for improvements in this area. Due to the workloads involved in processing a large volume of employment authorization requests, however, the Department believes that it would not be prudent to establish a shorter mandatory period for the adjudication of such requests. Accordingly, these provisions of the proposed rule will be adopted without amendment in the final rule. 9. Interview and Procedure (Section 208.9(a)) a. Mandatory vs. Discretionary Interview Proposed Rule: Current regulations require that for each application for asylum within the jurisdiction of an asylum officer, an interview shall be conducted by that officer. The proposed rule would provide that interviews on asylum applications are discretionary. Comments: Many comments opposed making interviews discretionary. Some rested their objections in part on constitutional grounds; these concerns have been addressed above in subheading 2. The comments also expressed concern that direct referral of claims without an interview to an immigration judge is inappropriate because the written application often is not a reliable indicator of the strength or weakness of the applicant's claim. The comments argued that a system of discretionary interviews and direct referrals would be unfair because many applicants are unable fully to articulate their claim in writing due to language barriers, lack of understanding of the laws governing asylum, or innocent reliance on unscrupulous paid preparers of asylum applications. These comments argued as well that the asylum interview is of significant benefit because it allows the applicant to present the facts of the case in a nonadversarial manner and compels the asylum officer to consider the full range of facts, including all relevant country conditions, before making a determination in the case. While many comments acknowledged the advantages of adversarial proceedings before an immigration judge in eliciting the facts of an asylum claim, the commentators generally felt that the value of an asylum interview should be given greater weight. Several comments stated that the proposed rule would be contrary to the legislative intent behind section 208 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1158, because Congress contemplated that asylum determinations would be made independent of exclusion and deportation proceedings. Several comments claimed that the system of discretionary referrals would actually make the process less efficient because applicants would be forced to present their claims in a longer, more formal hearing before an immigration judge. The comments claimed that this would increase overall expense to the Government, exacerbate the problem of delay in asylum adjudications, and undermine the intent of the proposed rule to streamline the asylum system.
