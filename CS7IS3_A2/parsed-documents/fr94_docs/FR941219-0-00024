FR941219-0-00024 FR941219-0-00013 The second change made in this provision reverses the decision made by the LSC Board in 1988, which interpreted the language of the LSC Act to prohibit a recipient board member from receiving compensation from any recipient, not just the one on whose board the member sat. The effect of the 1988 revision was to prohibit field program staff from sitting on state and national support center boards, and vice versa, and thus prevented support centers from being accountable through their boards to the programs that they were intended to serve. This revision restores and clarifies the prior LSC policy that was in existence from 1975 to 1988 and which reflects the intent of Congress. Both the Legal Services Corporation reauthorization bill that passed the House in 1992 (H.R. 2039) and the bill that was approved by the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources the same year (S. 2870) would have amended the LSC Act in a manner consistent with this revision. All but one comment favored this revision. Finally, this section clarifies that all board members may receive a per diem payment for expenses in lieu of actual expense reimbursements, so long as such a payment is reasonable in light of actual average costs. Recipients are required to have written procedures for such payments. Per diem payments may be easier for programs to administer and may encourage board members to save money on items such as meals and lodging by setting the per diem at a relatively low rate. Language in the current rule was deleted to make it clear that reimbursement could be made for expenses incurred by recipient board members on the same terms and conditions that are applicable to non-board members, when such board members are involved in other program activities not directly related to their board membership or service; e.g., attorney board members who volunteered to drive a program client to a meeting or a hearing could receive reimbursement for automobile expenses, or attorney board members who did pro bono work on behalf of the program could receive reimbursement for travel expenses for attending an out-of-town settlement conference. Sections 1607.5 (b) and (c) This section includes two new provisions that clarify how the compensation prohibition relates to a recipient's private attorney involvement program. Paragraph (b) makes it clear that, for those rural programs that operate in areas where there are so few attorneys that it is difficult or impossible to find attorneys willing to serve on program boards, the Corporation could partially waive the compensation prohibition to allow partners and associates of board members to participate in judicare or other compensated PAI activities. Comments generally favored this provision. However, one comment cautioned that the waiver should be limited to those rural situations in which, essentially, it would be otherwise impossible to recruit attorney board members. According to the comment, ``[t]here is a danger that the delivery system could be skewed to direct resources towards associates or partners of board members and away from the employees of the program.'' Most comments spoke of the problems of finding sufficient attorneys in rural areas to participate in PAI programs. No changes were made to the proposed language in response to comments. However, it is the intent of the Corporation that the waivers be used sparingly. Paragraph (c) was added to clarify that attorney board members can receive referrals of fee-generating cases and participate freely in the recipient's pro bono PAI programs on the same terms as any other attorney. This is particularly important for rural areas where there are few private attorneys. Section 1607.6␣Waiver Section 1607.6(a) There is no change in this waiver provision which was designed to cover those programs, primarily reservation-based Native-American programs, that existed prior to the creation of the Corporation and had nonattorney majorities on their boards. In lieu of attorneys, most of those programs include tribal advocates who practice in tribal courts. Section 1607.6(b) This provision is added to permit the Corporation president to waive any of the provisions of this rule that are not mandated by law, if the recipient demonstrates that it cannot comply with them because of the nature of the population, legal community or area served or because of special circumstances, such as conflicting requirements of the recipient's other major funding sources. The proposed rule had a separate waiver provision for client board membership, but the LSC Board rejected the language. The proposed waiver for client board membership was intended for recipients that are not statutorily required to have clients on their boards to seek a waiver from the requirements of this rule. The rule applies to any recipient that receives financial assistance from the Corporation pursuant to §1006(a)(1)(A) of the LSC Act. The statutory requirement for client membership, however, applies only to recipients organized solely for the provision of legal assistance. Comments from client representatives persuaded the Board to continue the client board membership requirement for any recipients that are subject to this rule. The Board agreed with the comments that any recipient funded by LSC funds would benefit from the client input and that clients would be better served as a result of their ability to have input into board policy decisions. The language of (b)(1) has been amended to include a reference to ``legal community'' to make it clear that the nature of the legal community, as well as requirements of state law, could be considered as a basis for a waiver. The Board recognized that there may be programs, especially in rural areas, where there are peculiar problems or situations within the legal community that may make it necessary or desirable to permit the recipient to have a governing board that varies from the normal. An example would be for those programs that serve Native American populations and practice in tribal courts. The president, through the waiver authority, could permit the recipient to substitute one or more tribal advocates for attorney board members. In addition, this provision could be used as authority for partial waiver of the compensation prohibition, to permit a recipient to adopt policies that would allow partners or associates of a board member to participate in compensated PAI activities supported by the recipient.
