The fighting is between the movement's two main ethnic groups, the Mandingos, who support ULIMO leader Alhaji Koromah, and the Krahns, who are loyal to Gen. Johnson. Gen. Johnson and his supporters launched a dawn attack on 25 March on Tubmanburg, the ULIMO headquarters, which he claims he has taken control of. "We have total control over Tubmanburg and are currently dislodging the remnants of the Mandingo fighters who are still hiding there," Gen. Johnson stated. According to him, the attack launched on Tubmanburg at dawn on 25 March aimed at preventing the Mandingos, Alhaji Koromah's supporters, from killing Krahns and other tribal group members. These accusations were denied today by Major Sekou Kromah, a close associate of Alhaji Koromah. He also denied that Johnson has taken control of Tubmanburg and stated that "fighting is continuing there." At the beginning of March, a series of clashes between the Krahns and Mandingos led to the death of about 200 ULIMO troops.
