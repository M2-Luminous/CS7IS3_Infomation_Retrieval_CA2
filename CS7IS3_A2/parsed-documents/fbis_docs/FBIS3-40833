Katyal: "Italy Agrees To Step Up Economic Cooperation"] [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 3. Noting similarities in their perceptions of global developments, India and Italy today agreed to intensify contacts at the highest level of their foreign offices. Views were also exchanged on ways to step up economic cooperation--now that Italy is to participate in the Indian Engineering Trade air in 1995 as a partner country, for the second time in ten years. The Foreign Ministers of both the countries, Mr. Dinesh Singh and Prof. Beniamino Andreatta, now here, held wide-ranging discussions, covering bilateral and global issues, apart from the developments in their respective regions. Prof. Andreatta called on the President, Dr. S.D. Sharma, and met the Finance Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh for talks on the specifics of economic cooperation. Prof. Andreatta had earlier held economic portfolios, as the Minister of Budget and Economic Planning and the Minister of Treasury. His visit now is looked upon for a deepening of economic relations. In June last year, the first Indo-Italian Industrial Forum, held in Venice and inaugurated by Dr. Manmohan Singh, was regarded a major success. Measures to solve problems: According to an official spokesman, Mr. Dinesh Singh briefed Prof. Andreatta on steps taken by India to seek a peaceful solution of its problems with Pakistan as also on the outlook of cooperation in South Asia within the SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) framework. They also exchanged views on the situation in the Central Asian republics, with Prof. Andreatta welcoming India's growing cooperation with these countries as a factor of stability. The two Ministers welcomed the recent cooperation agreement and the Joint Political statement between Indian and the European Union, underlining the desire of the two sides to intensify relations in economic and political fields. Also, they exchanged views on the reform of the U.N., specially the expansion of the Security Council, and the U.N. peace-keeping operations, with particular reference to Somalia. India's economic reforms were one of the subjects of discussions with Dr. Manmohan Singh who expressed the hope for the increased involvement of Italian business and industry in the Indian market, taking full advantage of the new opportunities for investment and joint ventures. They agreed that steps needed to be taken to intensify contacts between businessmen and to disseminate information regarding the opportunities that had opened up.
