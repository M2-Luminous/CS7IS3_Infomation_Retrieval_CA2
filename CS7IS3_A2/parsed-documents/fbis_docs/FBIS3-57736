MPs cannot not assume the enormous responsibility for the future and the health of people in Latvia if the problem is as important as the Skrunda issue is, Ulmanis said Jan. 26. Latvia has evidence of new-type radiation across its territory what could be aimed at determining movements of space objects, Ulmanis said. In his opinion, Russia is looking for new ways to control the airspace above Europe and Latvia. If the guesses prove right, Latvia could possibly attain reduction of the term for the preservation of the radar station, the president said. As reported, Russia wants to keep the radar for five more years. If Latvia agrees to this condition, Russia will complete the withdrawal of its troops by September, said Russian delegation head Sergei Zotov.
