DATES: Comments on this proposal should be received by January 17, 1995. ADDRESSES: Comments should be sent to Nancy G. Miller, Senior Attorney, Administrative Conference of the United States, 2120 L Street, NW, Suite 500, Washington DC 20037.

A copy of the Administrative Conference's request from OMB, including the proposed interview protocol, can be obtained from Ms. Miller. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Administrative Conference of the United States is sponsoring an evaluation of the use of negotiated rulemaking at the Environmental Protection Agency. A portion of the evaluation involves use of an interview protocol to gather information from participants in several of EPA's negotiated rulemakings, which will be compared to information gathered from participants in several rulemakings that EPA conducted using conventional rulemaking procedures. Interviewees will be drawn from samples of participants, including agency personnel, the regulated communities, state and local governments and others who participated in the rulemaking processes. The total burden is estimated to be 400 hours. The average burden per respondent is expected to be one hour, and will occur only once. It is expected that there will be approximately 400 respondents. The Administrative Conference has asked the OMB for expedited review of this request. Dated: December 12, 1994. Jeffrey S. Lubbers, Research Director.
