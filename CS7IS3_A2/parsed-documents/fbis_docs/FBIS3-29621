Although Japan has welcomed Pyongyang's promise to open its nuclear facilities to inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), "Japan will not welcome it any more if it is not to be carried out," Hata said at a news conference. Hata's remarks represented a criticism of North Korea which on Monday informed the IAEA that it plans to grant visas to IAEA inspectors after first talking with the United States. Inspectors for the UN nuclear watchdog agency had planned to begin checks of North Korean nuclear facilities this week, but have yet to receive the necessary visas from Pyongyang. Hata also suggested that Japan will closely follow the issue, saying the situation may change in a couple of days since North Korea has asked the international nuclear watchdog for discussion. In Washington, the State Department said the U.S. will not set a date for the third round of high-level talks with North Korea until IAEA inspections begin.
