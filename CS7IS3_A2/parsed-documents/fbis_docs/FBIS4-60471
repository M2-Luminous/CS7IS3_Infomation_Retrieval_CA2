Iran and Egypt broke diplomatic ties after the 1979 Islamic revolution and maintain diplomatic contact at interest section level. The spokesman, quoted on Tuesday by the radical daily JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI, said Velayati would only go to Cairo to take part in a meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), and the visit "has nothing to do with bilateral ties." "Given the nature of the Egyptian government, Iran has no intention of boosting ties beyond the interest section level," he said, adding that Velayati "would not meet any Egyptian officials" during his visit. It will be the first to Egypt by a senior Iranian official since the revolution. [passage omitted]
