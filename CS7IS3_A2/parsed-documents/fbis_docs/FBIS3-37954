Andrejevs explained that Latvia can only rely on the gentlemanly behavior of the countries and organizations that have given advice in supporting Latvia if, as a result of concluding the agreement, Latvia's security is somehow threatened. Andrejevs added that at present even the governing coalition is not fully unanimous as to whether such an agreement would be profitable to Latvia. Therefore the discussion on this theme is still continuing. Besides, Latvia will not conclude the agreement if Russia does not back down on the issue of the social provision for Russian military pensioners, added Andrejevs. Speaking of the decision of the Russian State Duma on amnesty for participants in the unrest of 1991, Andrejevs emphasized that this question is an internal Russian problem. But in the longer term, it could strengthen the hand of the extreme radical and conservative wings in Russia, which would not be favorable to Latvia. Thus the potential danger grows, added Andrejevs. Besides, such a resolution also shows the balance of power in the Russian State Duma.
