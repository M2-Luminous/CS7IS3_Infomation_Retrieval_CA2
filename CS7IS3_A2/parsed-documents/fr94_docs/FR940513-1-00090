SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Lake Erie water snake is found on the islands of western Lake Erie and the adjacent mainland of Ohio and Ontario, Canada. It has been proposed for listing as a threatened species due to strong evidence that its numbers have declined dramatically, primarily as a result of the destruction of its habitat and human persecution, and that the threats to the habitat and to the snakes themselves are continuing. The Federal Register notice announcing the proposing of the Lake Erie water snake for classification as a threatened species was published on August 18, 1993 (58 FR 43857). The original comment period ended on November 16, and the deadline for receipt of public hearing requests was October 4. On October 12, 1993 (58 FR 52740), a second notice was published extending the comment period until November 16, 1993. On October 5, 1993, the Service received a request for a public hearing on this proposal from Donald J. McTigue, representing Baycliff's Corporation. A second request for a public hearing was received by the Service on October 13, 1993, from H. R. Clagg, President of the Johnson's Island Property Owners' Association. The Service has scheduled two hearings in the area potentially affected by the listing proposal. Those parties wishing to make statements for the record should have available a copy of their statements to be presented to the Service at the hearing. Oral statements may be limited to 5 or 10 minutes, if the number of parties present necessitates some limitation. There are no limits to the length of written comments presented at this hearing or mailed to the Service. Oral and written comments receive equal consideration. In order to accommodate the hearing, the Service also reopens the public comment period. Written comments may now be submitted until June 16, 1994, to the Service office in the ADDRESSES section or at the public hearing. Author The primary author of this notice is Ronald L.
