Vladimir Kryzhanovskiy told a news conference in Moscow on Monday that the Ukrainian parliament had now approved all the points of Article Five of the Lisbon Protocol. "This eliminates the main problem, and now everything is ready for joining the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons in the immediate future," he said. All nuclear arms will be removed from Ukraine, he said. Kryzhanovsky said the Ukrainian legislature had charged the government with the exchanging of the START-I ratification instruments and instructed it to take more efforts to enter into relevant international agreements. The ambassador did not rule out that Ukraine's membership in the Nonproliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear state would be approved by the present parliament, but said this was most likely to be done by the next legislature, to be elected on March 27. Commenting on Ukraine's relations with Russia, Kryzhanovskiy said there was some friction but that it had set off no conflicts between the two nations. As for the idea of the incorporation of the Ukrainian autonomous republic of Crimea into Russia through a Crimean referendum, he said it would be the same as the incorporation of Russia's Kuril Islands into Japan on the basis of the results of a referendum by the Kuril population. "That's not serious," he said. He said none of the former Soviet republics, including Russia, "has given a kopeck" to return Crimean Tatars to Crimea.
