This applies, among other things, to the embargo and the sanctions established by the United Nations, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told journalists today, commenting on the recent decisions of the U.S. Senate and the Russian State Duma, envisaging the possibility of a unilateral revision of international obligations. In the run-up to the Geneva meeting, we found ourselves on the threshold of a kind of war between parliaments. The U.S. Senate decision provides for the possibility of the embargo on arms deliveries to Bosnia being lifted unilaterally. In our Duma there are not a few supporters of a unilateral lifting of sanctions against Belgrade. It is true, the minister said, "Lukin's amendment" fleshed out the latest Duma decision, and it is "fairly balanced." In the Yugoslav conflict, all sides are bearing their share of the responsibility, Kozyrev said. It is therefore not fortuitous that in the communique of the ministers' meeting on Bosnia, both hotbeds of the conflict -- both Gorazde and Brcko are mentioned -- even though we had to argue a bit in this connection. The head of Russian diplomacy believes that unilateral revisions of the UN Security Council [UNSC] decisions would only result in the destruction of the system of international relations. In that case the fulfillment of international treaties would be out of the question, he said. That is why the paragraph that mentions strict observance of all UNSC resolutions has been included in the Geneva document.
