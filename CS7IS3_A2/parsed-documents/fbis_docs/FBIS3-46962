That day, the National Unification Board [NUB] revealed that the volume of the government-approved North-South trade for 1993 indicates $190.49 million of import and $10.228 million of export, thus amounting to a total of $206.647 million. This figure shows six percent decrease from the amount of previous year of $231.503 million. The NUB observed that the reduction of North-South trade, which showed the increase each year, is prompted by strained North-South relations since North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The NUB, however, revealed that the trade of last December amounted to $40.304 million in 64 cases, showing 8.9 percent increase from the previous month. In particular, the actual trade amount approved by the government on processing-for-wage deals was $4.338 million in 43 cases last year, showing an increase by a factor of 7.8 over the $556,000 in 10 cases in the previous year. The NUB official noted that this increase indicates a new possibility for North-South trade.
