But not all of the nearly $500 million invested in Nuclei's unfinished industrial facilities in Resende (RJ) [Rio de Janeiro] will be wasted. Brazilian Nuclear Industry, the group's holding company, intends to use part of the equipment to transform the imported enriched uranium into powder and then into pellets. The pellets will then be transformed into the fuel elements, which are currently made by another company branch. In order to make this adaptation viable it will be necessary to invest an additional $15 million in the Nuclei facilities. Only South Africa and Brazil have built installations to enrich uranium through the jet nozzle process. But the project is today considered economically unfeasible, besides having been questioned in scientific circles. Jet nozzle technology involves the separation of uranium's heaviest isotopes (238) from lighter ones (235). In this process the uranium ore is made to circulate in a gaseous form (hexafluoride) through equipment operating successive cascades. The predominant uranium enriching process in the world today is called the ultracentrifuge process. In this process the machines rotate instead of the gas (uranium remains in solid state up to a temperature of 56 degrees centigrade. At higher temperatures it becomes uranium hexafluoride gas). A proposal studied earlier was to incorporate Nuclei facilities into the Aramar project that is being built by the Navy, which developed its own untracentrifuge technology to supply fuel to the nuclear submarine now under construction. The idea did not prosper because Nuclei was designed to produce 160,000 enriched uranium units a year (enough to supply the Angra-2 and Angra-3 power plants), while the submarine will only need 1,000 units.
