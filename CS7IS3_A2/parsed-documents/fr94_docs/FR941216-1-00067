FR941216-1-00067 FR941216-1-00011 (t) Application of section 274(m)(3). If an employer's deduction under section 162(a) for amounts paid or incurred for the travel expenses of a spouse, dependent, or other individual accompanying an employee is disallowed by section 274(m)(3), the amount, if any, of the employee's working condition fringe benefit relating to the employer-provided travel is determined without regard to the application of section 274(m)(3). To be excludible as a working condition fringe benefit, however, the amount must otherwise qualify for deduction by the employee under section 162(a). The amount will qualify for deduction and for exclusion as a working condition fringe benefit if it can be adequately shown that the spouse's, dependent's, or other accompanying individual's presence on the employee's business trip has a bona fide business purpose and if the employee substantiates the travel within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section. If the travel does not qualify as a working condition fringe benefit, the employee must include in gross income as a fringe benefit the value of the employer's payment of travel expenses with respect to a spouse, dependent, or other individual accompanying the employee on business travel. See §§1.61&hyph;21(a)(4) and 1.162&hyph;2(c). If an employer characterizes as compensation under section 274(e)(2) the amount paid for or incurred for the travel expenses of a spouse, dependent, or other individual accompanying an employee, then the expense is deductible by the employer as compensation and no amount may be excluded from the employee's gross income as a working condition fringe benefit. Par. 4. Section 1.274&hyph;2 is amended as follows: 1. The second sentence of paragraph (c)(6) is added. 2. The paragraph heading for (f)(2)(i) is revised. 3. The paragraph heading and introductory language of paragraph (f)(2)(iii) is revised. The revised and added provisions read as follows: §1.274&hyph;2 Disallowance of deductions for certain expenses for entertainment, amusement, or recreation. * * * * * (c) * * * (6) *␣*␣* This paragraph (c)(6) applies to club dues paid or incurred before January 1, 1987. * * * * * (f) *␣*␣* (2) *␣*␣* (i) Business meals and similar expenditures paid or incurred before January 1, 1987.*␣*␣* * * * * * (iii) Certain entertainment and travel expenses treated as compensation.
