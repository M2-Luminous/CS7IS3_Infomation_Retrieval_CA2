"And for interior minister: Maroni," Umberto Bossi mumbled. "Maroni who?" the PANORAMA correspondent asked. "How do you spell it?" Bossi, annoyed, spelled it for him. "He is a lawyer from Varese and is my friend." "What is his first name?" the correspondent asked. "Roberto." It was in late November 1991. Giulio Andreotti was prime minister, Vicenzo Scotti was interior minister, the DC [Christian Democratic Party] was still in existence, and Achille Occhetto headed the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left]. It was a century ago; the newspapers were still writing "the Leagues," and the real League--Bossi's League--had a total of one deputy and one senator: Bossi himself. In his little office in Rome, the boss agreed to play the role of "shadow prime minister" and rattled off the list of hypothetical cabinet ministers: Speroni for foreign affairs, Formentini for economy, Ms. Pivetti for immigration, Miglio for institutional reforms. It was only in fun, because the threshold of power seemed so far away. The reality is that now, two and one-half years and 178 members of Parliament later, it is easy to verify that Bossi was wrong regarding his own list. Except for one person on the list: the self-styled "lawyer" from Lozza, a town of 900 souls located a stone's throw from Varese. Maroni is not a lawyer; he only has a law degree. Nonetheless, he is the new interior minister--a fact that needs to be emphasized, because it is one of those things--such as Fiorello being the idol of the masses or Nelson Mandela the president of South Africa--that is hard to believe. Since Wednesday 11 May, Roberto "Bobo" Maroni, 39, is married to Emi Macchi, has two small children, is a former employee of Avon Cosmetics, and is also an amateur bluesman [preceding word in English] and (to hear him tell it) a good soccer player--has been the chief at Palazzo Viminale, the ministry that has the secrets and the dossiers as well as 4,215 officials, 208 prefects, and 150,000 employees (including 100,000 police). No one therefore any longer ridicules, in the manner of Mino Martinazzoli, Maroni's scatological nickname. No one any longer asks, "Maroni who?" The complete "color" commentary on his personality has by now appeared in the political columns: his passion for the Hammond organ in the Distretto 51 band [preceding word in English] (13 members, and a rhythm and blues [preceding three words in English] repertoire ranging from Wilson Pickett to Otis Redding); the sax, in the manner of Bill Clinton; and the mini Olympics with his old friends from Varese. Maroni's political biography has also been extensively reported: the student marches in his youth ("But I never got into trouble"); his votes for Proletarian Democracy; the founding of Radio Varese (originally the voice of the local Left, today the voice of the League); the momentous meeting with Bossi in 1979; the memorable fiasco of the little local-dialect newspaper NORD OVEST (three issues, 20 copies sold); his election to the Varese municipal council in 1990; his election to the Chamber of Deputies in 1992, in which he received 30,000 votes; and his experience as League caucus leader in the Chamber. Paradoxical as it may seem, the Maroni of the past two or three years is precisely the Maroni who is least well-known. But how in the world did this "pudgy little League fellow"--the gentle and likeable Bobo of the impossible negotiations (with Occhetto, with Mario Segni)--manage to land the one cabinet post that in Italy ranks second in importance only to Silvio Berlusconi's? Bossi wanted him there of course, to some extent because of his gifts of equilibrium and moderation, and to a great extent because of his unshakable loyalty to the boss's directives. But there is a secret reason for the irresistible rise of the "saxophone man," and a culprit as well: the press. Many League leaders, encouraged by the supreme leader, have always harbored a dislike, verging on hatred, of newspapers and journalists that is unrestrained, self-confident, and almost ontological. Talking to the "hacks of the regime" was a sin; at most, you were allowed to make an occasional sarcastic remark in their presence. Give them an interview? Fine, but they are not to be trusted. The League's press secretaries served as a barrier to protect the boss [preceding word in English]. And as for its spokespersons, of what use are their statements if Bossi changes his mind from one day to the next? But Maroni was different. As a little boy he perhaps wanted to be an astronaut or big league soccer player, but assuredly not interior minister. He knows how to play the "advocate" in writing (as demonstrated by the brilliant "Lombard diaries," published in PANORAMA). And he has a talent that is not found among League supporters as a whole and is perhaps a legacy of his leftist activism: self-ridicule, which enables him to view the League's menacing slogans objectively. As a result, this right-hand man of Bossi always enjoyed a privileged relationship with journalists. He spoke to the "hacks" and in return clearly enjoyed a growing popularity with them. All they had to do was dial 0337 et cetera, and he answered. He responded to them (without going too far); preached the Bossi doctrine; and kept his appointments. Any journalist who has covered the League in recent years remembers a Maroni dressed in jeans [preceding word in English], preferably white; a wrinkled jacket; dreadful multicolored ties; and a portable phone ("My battery doesn't last long"). If you ran into him at the Varese city hall or in the Chamber of Deputies offices, he always appeared to be there by chance ("See what I have to do"). And at the great League festivals, congresses, meetings, and swearing-in ceremonies--whether he was there for work or pleasure--he always spent the night in the company of the "specialized" journalists, speculating about the mystery that surrounded the lineups in the 1961-62 soccer championships. All this effort and approachability have obviously borne fruit in terms of image, but if that image had depended, for example, on the period of Maroni's activity in Varese as councilman in charge of road construction and maintenance, one would have had to shudder at the thought of his becoming interior minister. Should the road through the Sacro Monte be closed to traffic? Maroni asks the advice of his newspaper friends, who supply him with a dozen ecological intellectual slogans [preceding word in English] of the "Breathe your mountain" type." He thanks them, thinks it over, and after a week comes up with this Lombard populist opinion: "The mountain is respected if you take the shuttle." And there is more. In Maroni's city they tell this version of the old story of the "rotating" one-way streets. Hardly had the new municipal council taken office in early 1993 when it became necessary to reduce the levels of pollution and traffic. The new one-way directions were adopted, and the merchants were furious. Maroni adopted a posture of goodwill and agreed to meet with them--one at a time and one per evening--and promised each one that he would systematize the solution. Because Maroni is someone who keeps his promises, he really changed the one-way streets--changed them every morning, because every evening he was confronted by a merchant who had been angered by the changes made that morning. The story may have been somewhat embroidered by an envious fellow resident, but that is "Bobo's" philosophy: Be careful not to displease anyone, even if it means contradicting yourself. In February he proclaimed: "None of the proposed cabinets includes any elected officials from the AN [National Alliance]. That will absolutely never be," and we know what happened. Two years ago he in fact told PANORAMA: "With someone like me as interior minister, all of Italy's skeletons of the past 20 years, from Piazza Fontana to Ustica, will be jumping out of the closets." Poor fellow, not even he believed it at the time. Let us hope this time he will have the courage not to contradict himself--even if he has to displease someone.
