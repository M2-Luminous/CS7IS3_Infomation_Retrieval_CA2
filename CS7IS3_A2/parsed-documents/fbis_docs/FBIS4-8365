Protection Force (UNPROFOR) representatives said on Tuesday. The delegations of RSK and the former Yugoslav republic of Croatia signed the agreement to end hostilities and disengage troops in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb on March 30. The agreement has been effective since April 4. UNPROFOR representatives in Sector South, Alan Roberts and Lieutenant Colonel Paule Sautvel, told a news conference that heavy weapons had been completely withdrawn, that the withdrawal of troops from the lines of confrontation is soon to be completed, and that the problems of the four outstanding locations will be solved by joint committees. The deployment of U.N. peace-keepers along the line of confrontation is still in progress and Roberts and Sautvel said and their taking over is further delayed by the slow mine clearance operations [sentence as received]. The conflict between RSK and Croatia broke out in 1991 following Croatia's forcible secession from former Yugoslav federation and an attempt to reduce the status of the Serb people to that of an ethnic minority. RSK was proclaimed by Serbs in their ethnic and historical territories within the arbitrary communist-era borders of Croatia. RSK has been U.N. protected area (UNPA) since March 1992, and UNPROFOR mandate was extended for another six months in March.
