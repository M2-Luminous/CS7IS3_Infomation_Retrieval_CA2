F. Radionov, M. S. Marshunova, Arctic and Antarctic Scientific Research Institute; UDC 551.590.3] [Abstract] Two global decreases in the total transparency of the atmosphere have been observed in long-term measurements of the total fluxes of direct solar radiation in the Arctic and Antarctic. These were associated with the eruptions of Agung in March 1963 and El Chichon in April 1982. Direct measurements of the spectral aerosol optical depth of the atmosphere at both poles showed that a new decrease in total transparency since 1982-3 is associated with an increase in aerosol attenuation. Measurements of optical d epth using the ABAS solar photometer were used to pinpoint the effect of the eruptions of Mt. Pinatubo (Philippines) and Mt. Hudson (Chile). It was found that the aerosol optical depth of the atmosphere in 1992 was a factor of 2-3 larger than the average value and was comparable with the value observed in the Arctic after the El Chichon eruption. Tables present atmospheric transparency values and aerosol optical depth figures for this time period (and other periods, for comparison). Figures 2; tables 2; references 4: 3 Russian, 1 Western.
