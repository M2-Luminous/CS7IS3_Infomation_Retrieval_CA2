In 1993, after the convocation of the first session of the eighth provincial people's congress, courts at all levels across the province used Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the 14th party congress as the guidance, conscientiously implemented the guidelines of the resolution of the first session of the eighth provincial people's congress on the work report of the provincial Higher People's Court under the leadership, supervision, and guidance of the party committees and the people's congresses at all levels and the Supreme People's Court, acted in close connection with the central tasks of the party and the state, comprehensively strengthened all tasks centering on judicial work, and provided effective legal service and judicial guarantee for deepening reform and opening up and for accelerating economic construction. These were manifested in the following: First, courts at all levels across the province upheld the viewpoint that handling more cases, handling cases rapidly, and handling them well as the most direct and effective service for reform, opening up, and economic construction, further strengthened all judicial tasks, accepted a total of 187,945 cases of the first instance, and completed 188,009 cases (including leftover cases from the previous year), up 3.1 percent and 3.6 percent respectively over the previous year. The rate of comprehensively winding up cases was 98 percent, 5,644 cases more were completed as compared with the previous year; cases which were not completed showed a decline of 5.7 percent from the previous year. This showed that new progress was made in judicial work. Second, courts at all levels across the province persisted in linking judicial work with reform, opening up, and economic construction, gave prominence to service on their own initiative, expanded the service sphere, strengthened service measures, enhanced the service level, gave simultaneous attention to the quality of handling cases, efficiency, and results, and made new progress in making judicial work serve reform, opening up, and economic construction. Third, courts at all levels across the province persisted in regarding forming an image of "listening to reason while enforcing law, and performing their work most justly and honestly" as their objective, regarded building spiritual civilization as a motivation, and strengthened the ranks of judicial personnel. Among the courts across the province, 195 had been named civilized units by their local party committees and governments, accounting for 97 percent of the total number of courts; among the court cadres and policemen across the province, 2,856 cadres and policemen were commended and awarded, accounting for 25.1 percent of the total number of cadres and policemen. This showed that new progress was made in building the ranks of policemen. The new progress in judicial work and the self-development of courts across the province should be attributed to our efforts to grasp the following three aspects of work: 1. We unceasingly deepened the guiding ideology for judicial work and conscientiously expanded the degree of serving reform, opening up, and economic construction. Since the beginning of 1993, particularly after the issuance of the central major policy decision on strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control and the "decision of the CPC Central Committee on some issues concerning the establishment of the socialist market economic structure" adopted at the third plenary session of the ah CPC Central Committee, the provincial court, on the basis of conscientiously conducting investigation and analyzing the new situation facing judicial work, successively held work meetings and meetings of court presidents on three occasions to study guidelines on how to consciously deepen judicial work and to strengthen the work on serving reform, opening up, and economic construction. The meetings set forth the necessity to ceaselessly emancipate the mind; renew the idea of enforcing laws; firmly foster the idea of taking the overall situation into consideration, the idea of service, the idea of policies, and the idea of accomplishing something; bring into full play the legal means' key functions for strengthening the macroeconomic regulation and control and standardizing the socialist market economic operation; justly enforce laws; improve work efficiency according to the policy on the inherent efficiency of the socialist market economy; stress the benefits from enforcement of laws; bravely eliminate the influence of the local protectionism and the departmental protectionism according to the requirements for the socialist unified, open-typed, and large-scale markets; enforce laws in a unified way; accurately handle the new-typed cases cropping up in the course of replacing the old systems by the new and under the situation that laws are not stipulated in explicit terms; persist in the accurate law enforcement orientation; and provide effective legal services and judicial guarantees for setting up the socialist market economic system. Due to the ceaseless deepening of the ideology for guiding the trial work, we enhanced the awareness of regulating and controlling the macroeconomy, developing the socialist market economy, and serving the struggle against corruption and the safeguarding of the social stability. First, we especially and concentratively attacked criminal activities and expanded the dynamics of dealing blows to various serious criminal offenders who jeopardize social order. The courts at various levels across the province unswervingly implemented the principle of sternly and immediately punishing criminal offenders and sentenced 16,254 criminal offenders who caused legal effect, including 6,589 criminals who were sentenced to five years of imprisonment or more or even to death, accounting for 40.5 percent of the total. The courts got involved, in advance, in the cases involving gangs of criminals and the major evil cases that society and the masses paid attention to; and tried every possible means to immediately try these cases. When waging the province-wide "spring attack," "100-day fortified battle," and "strict blow" struggles, we concentratively organized several province-wide attacks and maintained the momentum of the attacks. Second, we concentrated energy to try major and appalling economic criminal cases and strengthened the dynamics of strictly punishing economic criminals. The courts at various levels across the province generally set up leading groups to try major and appalling economic criminal cases and also set up a perfect system to report and supervise the handling of major and appalling cases. Persistently in line with the principle of strict punishment according to laws, we sentenced 2,777 criminals who were guilty of corruption and bribery and caused legal effect, including 884 or 31.8 percent of criminals who were sentenced to five years of imprisonment or more and even to death. According to the party Central Committee and the provincial party committee's requirements for making achievements in the current-stage struggle against corruption, the provincial court concentratively organized forces and tried two groups of criminals who were involved in the major and appalling economic cases. In the forms of public trials and public pronunciation of the judgment, we strengthened propaganda and expanded the social effect of handling cases. Third, in line with the demands for economic development, we strengthened the dynamics of regulating, according to laws, the relationship among various sectors of the economy. The courts at various levels across the province positively explored new ways for serving the economic construction and expanded the service channels. The courts accepted and handled first rulings on 36,816 economic cases, and the lawsuits on these cases were marked at 2.51 billion yuan, respectively increasing by 14.4 percent and 90.8 percent over the previous year. According to the provincial actual conditions, the courts from higher levels downward carried out the special service activities of clearing up debts, defaulted taxes, and loans. By adopting lawsuit and non-lawsuit means, the courts at various levels handled 17,979 enterprises' clearing-up cases, these cases were marked at 890 million yuan, and 358 million yuan were retrieved for enterprises. By launching the activities that the tax affairs organizations jointly investigated, handled, and cleared up the cases of paying taxes and fines that should have been paid, 238 million yuan worth of defaulted taxes were paid. Actively working in cooperation with the financial departments, the courts examined and handled, according to laws, 4,965 cases of withdrawing loans; and withdrew 265 million yuan of overdue loans and idle funds. Thus, the courts played a positive role in enlivening capital and promoting the development of the economy. 2. We persisted in enforcing laws strictly and strived to upgrade the law-enforcement level. To safeguard the unity and sanctity of law-enforcement and ensure impartial enforcement of laws, courts at all levels in the province always regarded strict law-enforcement and improvement of law-enforcement level as a very important task. First, we further improved the supervisory and restrictive mechanisms focusing on judicial supervision. While paying attention to standardized management of judicial work, strictly implementing the open trial system, and conducting large-scale inspection on law- and discipline-enforcement, we further improved the work mechanisms that separate registration of cases from trial of cases, trial of cases from law-enforcement, and trial of cases from supervision, and we worked out corresponding work systems to add impetus to the supervisory work and raise its level. Through the judicial supervision, courts at all levels in the province handled 13,144 appeals for reexamination and retrial, of which 4.3 percent, or 566 cases, had their verdicts changed according to law. By strengthening judicial supervision, we corrected improper judgments of cases and erroneous deeds in law-enforcement. We also drew on experiences and lessons form this to promote the law-enforcement level. Thanks to inspection on law-enforcement, we attained an accuracy rate of more than 96 percent and 91 percent in enforcing substantive laws and procedural laws, respectively. Second, we further strengthened the systems to ensure the quality in handling cases, which is focused on the system of investigating and affixing the responsibility for wrong cases. The provincial court began to experiment with this system in March last year at the courts at two levels in Qitaihe and Harbin cities, Suihua Prefecture, and state farms, clarified the scope of wrong cases, the major persons to be held accountable, measures for punishment, and procedures for handling, and established and improved relevant supporting measures. This system helped effectively enhance the sense of responsibility of cadres and policemen, improve the quality and efficiency in handling cases, promote honesty in performing official duties, facilitate the establishment and improvement of the mechanism of competition for cadre management, reform the patterns of trial, strengthen management, and raise the overall level of judicial work. After conscientiously summarizing the experiences of the experiment, the provincial court in December last year held a work conference on disseminating this system in the courts throughout the province. It decided that this system be applied by the courts at all levels in the province beginning 1 January this year in order to improve the supervisory mechanism for handling cases and the systems to ensure the quality. Third, we strengthened guidance to lower levels, with the focus on conducting investigation and study on implementation of laws and policies. To correctly handle the new types of cases emerging in reform, opening up, and economic construction in a timely manner, the provincial court organized and concentrated efforts to conduct investigation and study on how the seven intermediate courts and 34 grass-roots courts tried the new types of cases on bills, bankruptcy, and disputes over border trade and, in view of the problems that existed, formulated and issued documents to standardize the trials of cases on bills, bankruptcy, labor disputes, and real estate, and cases involving foreigners. These documents offered operable opinions on issues concerning enforcement of policies and laws and standardized law-enforcement activities. 3. Focusing on the anticorruption struggle, we greatly improved the contingents of cadres and policemen. To conscientiously implement the arrangements of the party Central Committee, the provincial party committee, and the Supreme People's Court on waging the anticorruption struggle and to achieve success in the anticorruption struggle of the provincial court, the provincial court formulated in a timely manner the "opinions on the anticorruption struggle to be waged by all the courts in the province in the near future" and the "work plan for the organs of the provincial court to wage the anticorruption struggle in the near future," clarified the major problems to be addressed and the methods, steps, ensuring measures, and basic requirements of the struggle, and thus promoted the in-depth development of the struggle in the courts at all levels of the province. First, we conducted extensive and intensive education to oppose corruption and advocate honesty among cadres and policemen. By carrying out ideological mobilization and organizing outstanding judges to make mobile reports on their deeds, the province conducted education among cadres and policemen on the typical cases of violating the law and discipline and better dealt with the ideological problems committed by cadres and policemen with regard to "having nothing to do with them," "implicating others and adopting a wait-and-see attitude," " indulging in self glorification," and of "being insufficient in confidence." Thus, the consciousness and firmness of cadres and policemen in successfully waging the struggle against corruption were enhanced. Second, clearing up and consolidation were carried out. By persistently regarding as an emphasis the work of encouraging cadres at or above the section level to perform their official duties honestly and to conduct self discipline, the province adopted the methods of conducting self examination and inspection; setting up hot telephone line and boxes for reporting cases; visiting the departments concerned; and sending letters to solicit opinions to deal with the problems in the following fields: Personnel in charge of handling the cases accepted the treat given by the offenders while taking food, boarding, and travel together with these offenders. Personnel accepted the money of offenders for paying their investigation expenses that are originally official. Personnel handled the cases by accepting bribes through doing the offenders a favor and giving a favorable decision in line with personal relationship. Personnel accepted bails and investigation expenses for probation by violating the regulations. In line with the difference of these problems, the province handled them respectively. Of the 37 offenders who committed 35 cases by seriously violating the law and discipline, 30 were imposed on with the sanctions of party and administrative disciplines; and seven were transferred to the procuratorial organs to pursue their criminal liabilities. Those who accepted bails and investigation expenses for probation were ordered to return the money within the given date. Third, we further established or improved the systems of performing official duties honestly. In line with the problems exposed in the struggle against corruption, courts at all levels across the province formulated or improved at their own level the systems of enforcing the law honestly and encouraging administrative honesty and anticorruption and further reinforced the supervisory work. While deeply waging the struggle against corruption, courts at all levels across the province also further enhanced the ideological and political work and extensively carried out the activities of fostering the fine image of people's courts, tribunals, and judges who are "the best in being impervious to reason, being justice, and being honest". They also vied to carry out the activities of scoring outstanding achievements and the emulation drive for carrying out on-the-job training for personnel. All of these have led cadres and policemen to foster their correct outlook on life and value; vigorously encouraged the development of the spirit of making selfless contributions, serving the people wholeheartedly, and strictly enforcing the law; and vigorously upgraded the political and professional quality of cadres and policemen. Courts across the province achieved new progress in various work in 1993 and achieved larger progress in some fields. However, in line with the demands cropping up in developing the new situation and tasks, they still have some problems that brook to be neglected, which chiefly are as follows: The initiative of few courts in serving reform, opening up, and economic construction is not strong; their ways to render service in this regard are not wide; and their dynamics in this regard is not enough. Problems of not strictly enforcing the law and making unfair decisions in few cases still exist. Few cadres and policemen lack the sense of public servants and adopt a lukewarm, rigid, rude, and blunt attitude toward the masses. Specific cadres and policemen often commit the problems of handling the cases by doing a favor to offenders, giving favorable decisions in line with personal relationship, seeking personal gains by taking advantage of power, and violating the law and discipline. Measures adopted by courts for self improvement have been totally implemented. The supervisory mechanism of strictly running the courts have to be further improved and implemented. The interference of local and departmental protectionism is still very serious. Difficulties cropping up in enforcing the law have not been fundamentally overcome. As for the existing and aforementioned problems, we will adopt a seek-truth attitude and realistic measure to carry out earnest study over them and to earnestly resolve them. Fellow deputies, at present, China is in an important historical period of deepening reform and comprehensively accelerating economic development. In the whole process of building the socialist market economic structure, we must rely on law enforcement to guarantee the operation of the market economy and use legal means to adjust all relations and disputes in the market economic activities. The people's courts which are holding an important status of enforcing law will face a higher demand and more complicated tasks, and will play a more prominent role and shoulder more important responsibilities. In order to meet the need of the development of the new situation in a better manner, we have defined the guidelines for the work of courts across the province in 1994, which are: Use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee as the guidance, comprehensively strengthen all judicial work, give priority to trying major and appalling cases, persist in strictly enforcing law, enhance the law enforcement level, realistically strengthen self-development, strive to upgrade and improve all work, and provide effective legal service and judicial guarantee for accelerating the establishment of the socialist market economic structure and promoting an accelerated development in our province's economy. The general demands are: We must create a momentum in dealing blows to criminals, achieve effective results in handling major and appalling cases, make big progress in readjusting the relations in various economic sectors, comprehensively enhance the law enforcement level, and achieve new progress in all undertakings. To realize the aforementioned guidelines and general demands, we must stress the following five aspects of work: First, we should deal strict blows to criminal offenses that seriously harm public security so as to safeguard social stability. It is necessary to proceed the work from the overall situation of providing a stable social environment for the establishment of the socialist market economic structure, continue to uphold the strategic principle of "taking a two-handed approach in work and be tough with both," resolutely deal blows to all kinds of criminals who seriously harm public security, and do all we can to safeguard social stability. We must maintain a momentum of dealing blows to criminals, resolutely deal blows to such crimes as murder, robbery, rape, hooliganism, serious theft, "bus and train robbery and waylaying," and "six vices," particularly the crimes committed by cliques involving the underworld society. We should strengthen the degree of dealing blows, uphold the principle of punishing criminals heavily and quickly in line with law, and rapidly try and resolutely mete out heavy punishment for criminals who seriously harm public security. It is necessary to expand the effect of dealing blows, conduct concentrated and special activities on dealing blows to criminals of different scales, with different substance, and at different levels in a timely manner, and give further play to the overall functions of courts in joining the comprehensive management of public security. Second, we should strictly punish serious economic criminals, safeguard economic order, and promote the deepening of anticorruption struggle. It is necessary to unceasingly deepen understanding on the necessity of dealing blows to economic crimes under the new situation and give priority to dealing blows to state functionaries who abuse their posts to engage in corruption, bribery, and misappropriation of public funds; and resolutely deal blows to such crimes as smuggling, cheating, making or selling fake or inferior products, and tax evasion. We should uphold the principle of punishing criminals strictly in line with law, resolutely resist and eliminate interferences from all sectors, and resolutely mete out heavy punishment to those who deserve heavy punishment and capital punishment to those who deserve death punishment in line with law. We should deepen anticorruption struggle through strictly punishing serious economic criminals in line with law. Third, we should regulate the relations in the economic sectors in line with law and promote the sound performance of the social market economy. It is necessary to proceed from the provincial conditions and characteristics and give further play to the functions and role of judicial work in regulating the relations in various economic sectors. We should actively try all sorts of cases on disputes emerging in the course of accelerating the establishment of the modern enterprise system, on developing the market system, on improving the economic regulation and control system, and on improving the rural operational system and reform of the foreign trade system in line with law and promote the development of the socialist market economy. Attention should be paid to trying and handling the cases of new categories that have a direct bearing on the market economy, such as the cases concerning stocks, bills, bonds, futures agent, money-lending, and leasing. The research for the application of laws and policies should be strengthened in a timely manner in order to set forth standardized opinions. The experiences that facilitate economic construction should be summarized and deepened continuously, and such special service items as the cleanup of defaulted debts, loans, and taxes should be strengthened until good results are achieved. Fourth, the disputes among the people should be handled appropriately, the legitimate rights and interests of citizens, legal entities, and other organizations should be protected actually, and social stability and unity should be guaranteed. We should conscientiously handle according to law the frequently occurred cases such as the cases concerning marriage, families, compensation, inheritance, houses and grounds, as well as the cases that involve many aspects and exert great influence, such as the cases concerning mountains and forest, irrigation facilities, and land. We should actively try and handle various kinds of cases of new categories, such as the cases concerning copyright, reputation right, portrait right, labor disputes, and real estate, so that we can resolve contradictions in a timely manner and promote stability, unity, and the building of socialist spiritual civilization. Special attention should be paid to handle in a timely and appropriate manner the cases with regard to the reduction of peasants' burdens in order to actually protect the legitimate rights and interests of peasants and mobilize peasants' enthusiasm in production. Fifth, the building of the ranks of court workers should be strengthened further to ensure strict law enforcement. We should continue to grasp the administration of justice with one hand and grasp the building of the ranks of court workers with the other hand. Efforts should be made to improve the political and professional expertise of court workers in order to try and handle cases more efficiently and in better quality and ensure strict enforcement of laws. We should extensively and profoundly launch the activities of fostering the image that people's courts, people's tribunals, and people's judges are most reasonable, most fair-minded, and most honest. We should fully understand the importance, necessity, and urgency of launching the activities under the new situation of building the socialist market economic structure, and should attach high importance on and do a solid job to launch the activities by regarding it as the goal and guiding principle for the building of the province's ranks of court workers. We should administer people's courts and the police strictly, strictly enforce laws and discipline, give rewards and punishments impartially, and straighten out discipline and work style in a timely and concentrative manner to prevent unhealthy trends from growing and spreading. We should further expand the channels of legal supervision, democratic supervision, and mass supervision, profoundly launch anticorruption campaign, and continuously give prominence to resolving such illegal issues as abusing one's power to seek personal gain, accepting gifts and bribes, practicing favoritism when trying cases, and unwarranted pooling of charges in order to correct unhealthy trends of trades. The discovered clues for resolving violations of laws and discipline should be investigated through to the end, and once these violations are verified, they should be dealt with severely without any indulgence and accommodation. We should vigorously strengthen the building of ideology and work style of leading bodies, actually build leading bodies of people's courts at all levels into a core of leadership that is tough in politics, good in style of work, competent in work, honest and strict in administration, and impartial in enforcing laws. So, we an ensure the strict enforcement of laws. Fellow deputies, under the new situation of accelerating reform, opening up and establishing the socialist market economic structure, all the work of people's courts in the province are confronted with new challenges and tests. We should further enhance the sense of mission and the sense of responsibility, closely depend on the leadership of party committees at all levels and on the supervision and support of people's congresses at all levels to forge ahead and work hard in order to provide effective legal service and judicial guarantee for the province's reform, opening up, and economic construction.
