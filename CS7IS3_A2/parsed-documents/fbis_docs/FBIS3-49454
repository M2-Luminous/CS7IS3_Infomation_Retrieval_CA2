But we know that not only do we have no prospect of joining NATO either today or in the foreseeable future, we have no reason to expect anyone to ever tell us when we can join NATO and under what terms. The decision due to be made at the NATO summit will be a disaster for Polish diplomacy. Could it have been avoided? In a certain sense, no. Once Poland had formally announced its desire to join NATO, and especially once Russia had expressed its objection to this, it has not been possible to back down. The postcommunist coalition government could certainly not have withdraw Poland's bid to join, for the significance of such a volte-face would have been obvious. But should Poland have made such an effort to join? What We Wanted For Poland, NATO membership would have been a triple success. Symbolically, it would have satisfied our pro-Western ambitions and permitted an exceptionally favorable integration with the most important political and military structure of the West. But most of all, it would have guaranteed us a degree of security that our country has never known. Our NATO bid was brought on by fears of a possible repetition of our recent negative past, and no one can say that these fears are not justified. It is enough to consider the danger of reemerging Russian expansionism. The conclusion was automatic -- Poland simply had to apply for NATO membership. Why Did They Not Want Us? But it is Poland's thirst for security guarantees that made NATO reject our bid. Considering a possible expansion of NATO, its members asked themselves whether accepting Poland or any other former eastern bloc country to their ranks would increase their security. The answer had to be no, on account of the genuine threat to Poland from Russia. Out of all the countries of Central Europe, only the Czechs were graded for membership differently, which would explain their ostentatious departure from Visegrad solidarity. In the event of a Russian attack on Poland, NATO would have to help Poland as a member country, otherwise the principle of collective security would cease to exist, and hence NATO itself would become defunct. Why should NATO risk accepting us? Fear of Russia and Russia's Fears Poland's response to this question is obvious. If Poland remains outside NATO, Russian extremists might be tempted to attack it, and it would certainly encourage instability in a strategically key part of Europe. NATO agrees with this view, but insists that such an eventuality is less of a risk than the issue of security guarantees to Poland. The British guarantees made to Poland in 1939 are quickly brought to mind in this regard. Western historians have denounced these guarantees as particularly irresponsible. What is more, NATO views the Russian opposition to its expansion not as an impermissible case of Russian interference, which is what Warsaw thinks, but as as a justifiable expression of Russia's concern for its own security. Let is leave aside the problem of whether or not Poland's NATO entry would strengthen [Russian Liberal Democratic Party leader] Zhirinovskiy's position (as Strobe Talbott, the new pro-Russian U.S. secretary of state, claims it would), or whether, on the contrary, it would force the Russian extremists to think again (as our Foreign Ministry rather naively believes). The point is that Russia is and will remain for a long time NATO's only potential adversary in Europe, and it cannot fail to react in a hostile manner to the prospect of moving the line of potential confrontation several hundred kilometers closer to its border. This strategic consideration is important. Because of it, Germany was the only NATO country to support our application to join, for in the event of our joining NATO, the line of confrontation would no longer correspond to the eastern German border. NATO has no reason to antagonize Russia, especially at a time of imperial fever. But even a democratic Russia would have to oppose our membership of NATO. At the thought of an eastward shift of the NATO border, any Moscow government would react just like President Reagan reacted in the 1980's to the threat of an expansion of communism in Central America. NATO is prone to accept the Russian point of view. Vain Hopes So it is hard to understand why so much hope was attached in Warsaw to just one statement from President Yeltsin, whereby Russia had no objection to our efforts to join NATO. After all, it was clear that whatever Yeltsin might say, Russia's geopolitical interests would not change. Poland's NATO membership would bring it a host of troubles but no tangible advantages. Why did we expect NATO to accept us? It was a mistake to make a formal application to join, especially when this application was justified by a threat to Poland -- in other words, a threat to NATO. The fact that others made this mistake at the same time as us makes no difference. It is Poland, not, for instance Hungary, that is the basic object of the Central European contest of strength. Those who think they might move the West by referring to noble principles and past services rendered should talk to the president of Bosnia. Stakes Too High? It is not out of the question that if we had not applied for full membership, we might have been able to negotiate quite a good unilateral deal that might not have contained any security guarantees, but it might have permitted political integration. In the meantime, the "Partnership for Peace" proposal is all that we are being invited to. NATO is addressing these mainly rhetorical proposals of cooperation to all the countries of the former Soviet bloc, suggesting to them that NATO might eventually turn into something more concrete. As far as the "partnership" proposal is concerned, it means that NATO will care for the security of independent Poland as much as it will care for the independence of Kyrgyzstan. If I were from Kyrgyzstan, I might be pleased to hear it. By hastily playing for high stakes, we have risked losing. Henceforth, we can only expect a part of the kitty -- association with the Western European Union. Most probably, all that awaits us is the "Partnership for Peace" proposal -- in other words, the community of consolation prize winners.
