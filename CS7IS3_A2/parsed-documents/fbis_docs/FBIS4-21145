What must be done to dispel all doubts is to update all laws dealing with this matter. [Begin Gonzalez recording] Panama has done an excellent job. Customs, the PTJ [Technical Judicial Police], and the National Police have confiscated large amounts of drugs. A number of narcotraffickers have been captured, the country has cooperated with the U.S. Government, and the DEA works unimpeded here, which I think is all right. We must admit, however, that we have lagged a little regarding money laundering. We have experienced trouble with money laundering because of our banking center and the Colon Free Zone. [end recording] The Legislative Assembly is making every effort to approve the new drug bill as soon as possible. Gonzalez said it is urgent to pass money laundering legislation as soon as possible. [Begin Gonzalez recording] The only weak link in our legislation has to do with money laundering, for which we will have to pass special legislation. Yet we are moving in that direction. This fight against drug trafficking will not end overnight. The important thing is that we are taking firm steps to solve this problem. [end recording]
