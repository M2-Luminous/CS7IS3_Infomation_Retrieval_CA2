Esteemed Mr. President, your visit to Croatia in June last year paved the way and laid the bases for friendship and cooperation between democratic Croatia and Romania. We in Croatia attach particular importance to developing many- sided relations with Romania, because Romania is the biggest state in South-East Europe and plays an important role in the international order on European soil. As early as your visit to Zagreb, we signed accords. We will finalize accords at the economic, scientific-technical level, and our friendship accord in Bucharest today and tomorrow. Our countries have experienced the same circumstances with the disintegration of communist socialism in the past four years. This has given birth to similar problems in other areas as well. In exchange, we in Croatia are facing problems linked to the disintegration of communist Yugoslavia, because we have not been able to overcome the crisis peacefully; and we have also experienced the war and we are still concerned with the war in Bosnia- Herzegovina. We would like this crisis in former Yugoslavia, which emerged together with Tito's disappearance from the scene of history, to be solved in a peaceful way. You probably know that Tito was able to renew Yugoslavia, which was dismantled in World War Two, due to domestic ethnic contradictions, for Yugoslavia was not made up only of peoples with differing ethnic individualities, but also of people who belong to different civilizations. Tito succeeded in renewing Yugoslavia through setting up a federation that ensured full equality for its peoples. This lasted as long as he lived. After he died, there was a tendency to create a centralized state in which hegemonic tendencies would have been repeated, something that gave birth to a crisis and separatist demands. We wanted to solve this crisis in a peaceful way by proposing that Yugoslavia be reorganized on the basis of a confederation. Unfortunately, this was not accepted. Slovenia, Croatia, and Macedonia proclaimed their independence. Bosnia-Herzegovina followed suit. Then Serb aggression against Croatia and against Bosnia-Herzegovina followed. The Yugo-communist army occupied one third of Croatia's territory and now one fourth of Croatia's territory is under the protection of UN peacekeeping forces, but, in fact, the power is under Serbian occupation. The whole world, the international community, the European Union, the United Nations, and the Security Council have recognized through their resolutions that these territories belong to Croatia. We want to return these territories to Croatia in a political, peaceful, and democratic fashion. For this purpose, we have signed an accord on normalizing relations with the Yugoslav Government. We hope that all our efforts, with the help of the international community and your help, will yield results. The crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina is one of the most complicated throughout the world, not only in South-East Europe. We must not forget that World War I began in Sarajevo. Now a European, a world war, and war between civilizations could also be triggered if we do not contain this situation. There are volunteers on both sides, on the Serb side and the Muslim one. The crisis in Bosnia has been prolonged because the international community, Europe, and the United States, as well as the United Nations, did not share the same viewpoints on how to solve the crisis and to halt the war. For the first time in history, the great forces of Europe were on the same side. They agreed to give an ultimatum to the Serbs who are besieging the city of Sarajevo. We hope that the Serbs will agree to withdraw, that they will accept a political solution, and that the Muslims will follow suit. Croatia has favored and continues to favor an end to this war, and a political solution. I want to stress with satisfaction that during the talks with President Iliescu and the Romanian delegation we arrived at the conclusion that we have to make joint efforts to bring about this peace. The war and sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia harm not only the countries in former Yugoslavia and Yugoslavia itself, but also neighboring countries, and thus Romania, and this is reason enough to seek a peaceful solution. The war and crisis in Bosnia have reached their climax. They may even expand. Through joint efforts, however, we would be able to solve this situation. I am convinced that the visit paid to friendly Romania and our talks will contribute to expanding bilateral relations. I want to conclude by toasting your health, Mr. President Iliescu, the prosperity of the Romania people, and peace.
