The party's co-chairman, Aurel Talmatskiy, told INTERFAX that the roll will be submitted to the Central Election Commission within the next few days. Among party foremen, the roll includes most current republican leaders such as Parliamentary Speaker Petr Luchinskiy, Prime Minister Andrei Sangeli, Vice Prime Ministers Nikolay Oleynik and Valentin Kunev, and other ministers. Talmatskiy said most state officials included in the roll will go on vacations and resign starting January 10. "We have to do that in order to prevent our political opponents from accusing us of abuse of power," he pointed out. According to Talmatskiy, the agrarians do not intend to bloc with any other political forces. However, he was quoted as saying that "such blocs might be created in the parliament." "A union with the republican and social democratic parties which stand up for Moldova's stronger statehood and independence is the most likely," he noted. At the same time, Talmatskiy pointed out that both open and disguised supporters of unification with Romania such as the Christian Democratic Front of Moldova will be his party's main opponents. "I mean the Congress of Intelligentsia and some other political parties which emerged from the Popular Front," he explained. Local political scientists believe that the ADPM has the best chances of winning the parliamentary elections.
