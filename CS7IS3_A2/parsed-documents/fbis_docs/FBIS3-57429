The first question is on Gaydar's present title and position, to which Yegor Gaydar says: "First, I am a deputy and the head, the chairman, of the Russia's Choice faction. I resigned from all kinds of state duties and I am heading on a voluntary basis the scientific work at the institute of economic policy, [word indistinct], it is called the Institute of Economic Problems of the Transitional Period." He recalls that the institute was set up in 1991. Asked why the government in general and Gaydar in particular were so unwilling to explain to the people where Russia was going and what was happening, Gaydar acknowledges that it had been "a serious fault." He goes on to say: "Our work was very hectic in 1992 . The state had practically collapsed and one had a permanent feeling that if one were to stop working for just five minutes, things would simply slip through one's hands." He continues: "The main problem of 1992 and 1993 was that we failed to convince, failed to explain some simple things, thus giving opportunities and freedom of action to demagogues and liars." Asked to assess the state of the Russian economy at the time when Gaydar "fled," as the correspondent put it, Gaydar says "I did not flee anywhere, I left to do my own things." He continues: "The funny thing is that those who spent two years seeking my resignation are now speaking of the harm my resignation did." He further says: "There were many questions on the reasons for my resignation. I understand that some people have no shame at all. They are prepared to implement any policy and they are not ashamed of any decisions. I simply cannot understand how one can retain one's human dignity and at the same time justify a policy which allows no money for resolving the problem of nuclear waste -- which we are dumping in the world ocean -- but which allows 20 times as much money for the construction of a major administrative building given that two parliaments, two governments, the union and the republican government and party bodies have ceased to exist in Moscow." "Well, I cannot be held responsible for a policy such as this," says Gaydar, adding that what Russia needs is "a cost-conscious, inexpensive state with few officials whose rights should be restricted." He says that instead of arbitrarily handing out grants, licenses, and subsidies, they should elaborate rules to be adhered to in all cases and control their observance. He says that there are those who think Russia needs a large state which actively interferes in the economy, with a large army of officials and in times of trouble Russia has often reacted in this manner. He says that it sometimes yielded results, but it often led Russian into a historical blind alley from which it was extremely difficult to extricate itself. "It is my deep conviction that the time has now come for us to extricate ourselves from this blind alley we are in and to proceed along a path which has actually ensured success for a majority of civilized states, where society is dominant over the state, rather than the other way around." Acknowledging that this was a problem for Russia, Gaydar said it must be tackled. "An army of corrupt officials, in cahoots with a part of the new bourgeoisie that is interested in receiving handouts from them represents the factor that is capable of paralyzing through and through any potential for development, simultaneously exacerbating constantly the most acute social problems, inequality, and dissatisfaction", he said. Asked about the current situation, Gaydar said he is "deeply convinced that despite all the tremendous difficulties we are now coming up against, despite the whole seriousness of the current situation, the situation is, of course, much better than at the end of 1991." He says that at the end of 1991, Russia had enough grain to last until February and Russia was completely dependent on imports. This year Russia has major grain reserves, although there are various marketing difficulties. Continuing his comparison, Gaydar says that "hard currency reserves as at the end of 1991 were nil; there were no hard currency reserves at all, while as at the end of 1993 they amounted to $4.5 billion" and these "modest" reserves ensured that we could pay for up to two months of imports. "We have a major trade surplus and for the first time Russia ceased to depend on many imports," Gaydar says, adding that this created preconditions for further stabilization. He further says: "We left the country in a situation in which wages are $100 per month. This is not an indicator of greater prosperity and it would not be correct to regard it as such, because wages measured in dollars, of course, fail to reflect greater prosperity, but it is indicative of the stabilization of our domestic currency and of the extent to which the country's economy has become a part of the world market." Hyperinflation causes wages to fall to around $10 per month as is currently the case in the former Yugoslavia and in Ukraine and as was the case in Russia at the end of 1991 "when wages amounted to seven dollars per month." "In December inflation amounted to 12 percent, a record low," Gaydar adds. Defense orders used to play a tremendous role in the country's economy which has now adapted itself to a much lower level of these orders and is geared much more towards consumer needs which will improve in quality as they have to compete with high quality foreign consumer goods. This process of economic restructuring is only in its inception, but it is a promising trend, Gaydar claims. Gaydar then states that demilitarization of the economy altered supply and demand and what is now needed is to finance investments in the economy. He feels this can be done through increased taxation and that the state "is currently taking a lot of taxpayers' money for itself, because we have a huge defense expenditure, reduced a bit, but you can not reduce it all in one go; one must realize this quite clearly. We continue to have serious expenditure to finance an ineffective agriculture and we have a whole lot of serious structural problems in the economy and it is not possible to cope with all this in one go and in conditions such as these to finance an ambitious and large-scale program of economic restructuring into the bargain is simply tantamount to making taxes prohibitive and such taxation does not exist." But economic investments can also be financed through voluntary contributions from the population, as is the case in Japan, where the state's investments in the economy are minimal, but where people save a lot and their money, through the banking system, is invested in the economy, Gaydar explains. Gaydar continues: "If I was asked when will the Russian economy begin to grow, my answer would be, quite simply, that this process will start when voluntary savings of the population begin to increase substantially in our country." This would not be possible if inflation devalued savings by 20 percent a month. "So, when we say that we need to stop price increases, it is not because we are some kind of blinkered idealists, but because we simply do know how development of production is financed, as distinct, perhaps, from our opponents," Gaydar says. Inflation endangers production growth, but Gaydar says he is not overly inclined to believe that an economic disaster was looming, because the market mechanisms are in place and, he states, "I do not believe that the current Government will start making one silly and fatal error after another." Gaydar says he does not believe that the government would cause hyperinflation in the country, nor does he believe that the dollar would reach 20,000 rubles. Asked about his forecasts, Gaydar says: "I think that the new government's policy will, to a large extent, be a policy of vacillation. The government will endeavor to hold inflation in check and, at the same time, overcome by a passionate desire to increase production, before pre-conditions have been created for this to happen, the government will throw all its resources towards supporting individual industries, especially when it finds itself under powerful lobby pressure. It will hand out promises of financial support and will subsequently come up against tremendous difficulties, unable to fulfill its promises. It will vacillate between a sharp increase in protectionism and the necessity of ensuring that consumers' elementary interests are met. In short, it seems to me that this policy will be very difficult to form, subject to powerful pressures and that it will, to a large extent, be a contradictory policy". This policy can preserve the present status quo in which inflation is not high enough to destroy the fiscal system and bring market mechanisms to a standstill and nor is it sufficiently low to stimulate growth through savings being invested in the national economy. He says that against this backdrop some officials can be in cahoots with a part of the new bourgeoisie, interested in the emergence of a protectionist, paternalistic state. He concludes by saying that Russia is facing a choice between the all-powerful state endeavoring to solve the problem of economic development and breaking out of the "vicious circle of our history," making the state serve society and creating an open and competitive economy.
