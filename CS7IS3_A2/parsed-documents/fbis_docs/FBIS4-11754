Hence, I believe that none of these measures will lead to a solution as long as the settlers stay in the heart of Hebron. [Isma'il] There were some reports today that the Palestinian police will start to arrive in Gaza and Jericho early next week, before the anticipated Israeli withdrawal. Does this mean that agreement on the details of self-government is only a matter of time? [Al-Husayni] If by the arrival of the Palestinian police you mean the arrival of some administrators to prepare for the arrival of the Palestinian police and if this is done before the complete Israeli withdrawal, then this might be reasonable. But if Palestinian policemen enter areas that are still under Israeli control, I believe it will not have positive results. What is needed is to have the Palestinian police enter the areas from which the Israeli forces withdraw and exercise full authority there. Otherwise, there will be new eruptions.
