Ruus was quoting the head of the Nordic mission of the International Migration Organization, Oystein Optal, who had announced the assistance package at a meeting on refugee issues at the Estonian Interior Ministry today. The 1.5 million dollar program includes assistance to Russian-speakers in the Baltics who want to re-emigrate to Russia, but also for those who want to move to Latin America or other regions, Ruus explained. The first 0.5-million tranche of the aid line is to be made available for the Baltics and Belarus from July 1, Ruus said. The U.N. Refugee Commission's new representative to the Nordic region and the Baltics, Hans Thoolen, is expected to arrive in Estonia for an acquaintance mission on June 20. Ruus said his department's data shows there are currently about 180 illegal immigrants in Estonia.
