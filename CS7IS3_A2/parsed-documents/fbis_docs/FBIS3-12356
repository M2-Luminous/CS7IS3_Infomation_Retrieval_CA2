We are all one people, one hand. Whatever pains one area pains another area. God willing, we will transcend this ordeal and open our eyes so that no one will deceive us. [Reporter] [Question indistinct]? [Al-Hariri] It is clear [words indistinct] a Christian area in Kasrawan to cause sectarian strife. However, it is clear this will not affect the Lebanese. The Lebanese, Muslims and Christians, are one hand. [Reporter] [Question indistinct]? [Al-Hariri] The churches and mosques have their sanctity. During the worst days of the Lebanese war, no such thing happened. So it is clear that whoever did this thing wanted to inflict a deep wound. However, the Lebanese with their willpower and their faith in God and their homeland will not be dragged into such plans.
