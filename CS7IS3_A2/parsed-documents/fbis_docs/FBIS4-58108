[passage omitted] The bloc noticed that Ambassador Hambley's actions with respect to official quarters and his conveying to them of warnings and threatening messages under the guise of calming the situation and self-restraint aim "to undermine our people's steadfastness and their valiant resistance, which alone shoulders the responsibility for liberation and the honor of confronting the enemy's designs." The bloc said "we believe these suspicious moves by this U.S. diplomat constitute unacceptable defiance of our people's feelings and impermissible intervention in the country's domestic affairs. It is the misfortune of our time that the government is in a comatose state regarding the U.S. ambassador's provocations. It is natural that this ambassador not be allowed to hurt the people's feelings and insult their dignity." [passage omitted]
