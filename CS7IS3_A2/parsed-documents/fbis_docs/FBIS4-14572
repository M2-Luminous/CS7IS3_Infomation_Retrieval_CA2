Mr. Kokoshin and Mr. Morel discussed the military-political cooperation of France and Russia under the agreements signed by both countries' defense ministers. Commenting for SEGODNYA on the range of problems discussed, Andrey Kokoshin said that Russia advocates a strengthening of European security systems and views with great interest the "Balladur Plan" suggested by France, aimed at greater stability in Europe. This plan, according to experts, represents an autonomous program that does not rely on NATO structures and is based on bilateral agreements outside the U.S. sphere of control. Russia, incidentally, has stepped up its bilateral contacts with leading countries of Western Europe, especially with France and Germany, as well as with Great Britain and others. Mr. Kokoshin, however, remarked that "alongside this" Russia also seeks to interact constructively with NATO, including participation in the "Partnership for Peace" program. Russia is trying to create a counterbalance of sorts to NATO's possible expansion through the accession of former Soviet satellites to it. The possibility of proposing to the European community a security system not based on a military bloc where the United States plays the leading role, but one based on bilateral accords, especially with France -- a country that traditionally keeps aloof from NATO and is unwilling to follow in the wake of American foreign policy -- appears very appealing. According to SEGODNYA's lights, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev will put before Western European countries a Russian concept of European security late in April.
