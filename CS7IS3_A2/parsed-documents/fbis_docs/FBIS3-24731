Addressing several thousand delegates at the Inkatha Freedom Party's [IFP] special general conference in Ulundi on Saturday [29 January], Mr Felgate said the latest proposals were "a total insult to our intelligence". The proposals were tabled on Thursday and observers believed they may go some way to addressing the constitutional demands of the Freedom Alliance, which includes the IFP. They are due to come under discussion at extended bilateral talks in Pretoria on Monday. But, Mr Felagate was emphatic: "Negotiations will deliver nothing to the IFP." He said while the latest ANC proposals went some way in addressing a few IFP demands, they, however, "put us in a worse position than we were the previous week". He did not elaborate. Ongoing negotiations with the government and ANC would not deliver, said Mr Felgate, adding that should the IFP contest elections, it would do so on an unfair footing. He came out strongly aginst elections under the interim constitution and urged delegates to take a final decision on the IFP's stance on the April poll at the conference. Earlier, while voicing his rejection of the April elections, IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi said the conference could also decide to mandate the IFP Central Committee to take a final decision later. Mr Felgate, however, said it would be a "fateful error if the conference doesn't come to a conclusion simply because there will be more 'bullshit' talked in Pretoria on Monday". The IFP's position on the April poll is expected to become clearer on Sunday after debate during a closed session on Saturday afternoon.
