It also decided to abrogate seven tax codes: "Provisions for Trial Implementation Regarding Fair Trade Taxes," "Interim Regulations on Livestock Trade Taxes," "Provisions for Trial Implementation on Collecting Special Fuel Taxes," "Interim Provisions on Bonus Taxes on State-Run Enterprises," "Interim Provisions on Wage Regulatory Taxes on State-Run Enterprises," "Interim Provisions on Bonus Taxes on Collective Enterprises," and "Interim Provisions on Bonus Taxes on Institutions." Meanwhile, it delegated power regarding the management of animal slaughter and banquet taxes, allowing provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal people's governments to decide on their own whether to continue to levy or stop collecting such taxes in light of local economic development.
