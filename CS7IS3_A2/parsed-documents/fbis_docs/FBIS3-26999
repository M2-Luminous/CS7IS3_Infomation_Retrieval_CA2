Jiangxi saw the greatest number of Taiwan residents paying hometown visits there last year, totalling some 40,000, since the Taiwan authorities relaxed restriction on hometown visits to the Mainland. They were all pleased with the economic build-up which was underway and made up their minds to make contributions to social undertakings, including the opening of schools, construction of bridges and village roads, improvements of the power supply, the funding of a home for the elderly and the planting of trees. A Taiwan compatriot originating from Leping, a place in Jiangxi, donated to a fund for the construction of a primary school in his village because of its backwardness in education when compared with the economic development there. A total of 45 Taiwan compatriots witnessing the building of a bridge over the Ganjiang River during their home visits donated a total of RMB 300,000 to fund the construction. Ganzhou Prefecture saw total donations valued at RMB 1.86 million made by 183 Taiwan compatriots last year to fund 91 social undertakings. Various levels of local governments in Jiangxi expressed their gratitude to these Taiwan compatriots and presented them with certificates praising their generosity. Items funded by donations by Taiwan residents were carried out in keeping with the willingness of these donors.
