At this complex moment in history, the document states, in spite of your different political convictions, we hope that your civic consciousness and responsibility for the country's fate will not allow the country to fall into the abyss of legal chaos and economic collapse. This is exactly what foes of the independent Ukraine hope for. Their main goal is to disturb Ukraine's political stability and destroy its governing structures. This might result in a complete halt to reform, rampaging separatism, and a continued drop in production and the population's standard of living. In addition to this kind of social backdrop, the antigovernment forces still need the election of a new president with vague powers and several hundred unruly regional administration heads to aggravate legal chaos in the state and eventually, provoke social conflict. The Democratic Party believes that the 26 June elections, so eagerly pressed for by enemies of our state, must not take place, because this would put us on the brink of the abyss. This election is irrelevant in terms of timing, the condition of society, etc. Here are some other reasons: The new constitution and a law on power have not yet been adopted; the former Supreme Council limited the president's term in office to less than three years. So, this election is unconstitutional in nature. As was the Supreme Council, the president was elected by a popular vote, and only the people can replace him with an early referendum. Aware of the danger looming over Ukraine, the Democratic Party calls for the Supreme Council and society to put an end to political games and postpone the elections until after necessary legal documents are adopted -- a constitution, first of all -- so that one could in a peaceful atmosphere resolve state problems, reforming the economy and thereby improving the people's well-being. As a party of moderate politicians and people with common sense, the Democratic Party of Ukraine assumes full responsibility for declaring the following: the 26 June elections are a path to death, not the creation of a young state. [Signed] On 21 April in Kiev.
