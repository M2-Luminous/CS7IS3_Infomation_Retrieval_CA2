The police said that Lautaro Group leader Guillermo Ossandon is ``trapped and alone'' because he has lost most of his leaders and contacts. [passage omitted] Nelson Mery asserted that following the arrest of Rosa Ester Vargas it can be asserted that, from the organizational viewpoint, the Lautaro group is experiencing a crisis. Mery added: ``Proof of this is that Negra Ester has been occupying political or leadership posts within the movement although she is merely trained to carry out operations.'' [passage omitted] Police sources in Santiago disclosed that Lautaro leader Guillermo Ossandon (aka Diego Carvajal) has spent these past few months in Osorno, ``depressed and shaken after seeing his accomplices arrested, one by one.'' It was stated that ``Ossandon is trapped and alone. He has experienced critical moments these past few days following the arrest of his main aides.'' Ossandon had allegedly withdrawn to undergo psychological treatment. Moreover, police spokesman Luis Cariz said there is no proof about the rumors within the Lautaro group that Guillermo Ossandon wants to become a politician. [passage omitted]
