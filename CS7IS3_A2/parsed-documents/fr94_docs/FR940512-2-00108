FR940512-2-00108 FR940512-2-00055 4. The applicant now proposes the following transactions. Initially, the Plan desires to swap (the Swap) the Clinch Property, currently appraised at $425,000, for a certain condominium (the Condominium), projected to have a fair market value of $750,000, once it is completed. 8 The Condominium is Unit 501 in the Professional Office Building III located at 501 Nineteenth Street, Knoxville, Tennessee. Neither the Clinch Property nor the Condominium are encumbered by debt. The Swap will be an even exchange and will not involve any cash payments or other consideration by the involved parties. The Condominium will represent approximately 20% of the Plan's total assets. 8 In this regard, it is represented that all interior construction and remodeling of the Condominium will be done by the Employer as the lessee, and will be in accordance with the Lease and the Condominium documents. The applicant further represents that the Condominium documents provide a certain allowance for this purpose, and that any overhead will be paid for by the Employer. 5. The Plan will be acquiring the Condominium from Fort Sanders Medical Center (the Center), formerly known as Fort Sanders Presbyterian Hospital (the Hospital). The applicant represented that the Center is not a related party with respect to the Plan and the Employer. 9 It is represented that the Center is desirous of proceeding with the Swap primarily because it owns all the properties surrounding it with the exception of the Clinch Property. It is further represented that the Clinch Property is more valuable to the Center for its raw land than to another party as a free standing building. 9 In this regard, the applicant stated that Dr. Hugh C. Hyatt, one of the owners of the Employer, was Chief of Staff at the Hospital in 1990, and that the doctors of the Employer also have staff privileges at the Center. Otherwise, there is no relationship between the Employer and the Center, which is the developer of the Condominium. 6. The Clinch Property and the Condominium were appraised by Richard E. Wallace, MAI, SRA (Mr. Wallace), an independent qualified appraiser. The Clinch Property was appraised by Mr. Wallace (the Appraisal) on November 4, 1991, at a fair market value of $425,000. The Clinch Property is located at the northeast corner of Clinch Avenue and 19th Street in Knoxville, Tennessee. The Clinch Property is a one story masonry office building with a finished basement. Mr. Wallace maintains that properties similar to the Clinch Property are most often bought and sold based on their income producing ability, and, as such, he gives the income approach the most emphasis. The income approach as it is utilized herein is based on market derived income and expense estimates as well as general investor demands for this type of an investment. On June 30, 1993, in an update to the Appraisal, Mr. Wallace restated his opinion that the Clinch Property has a fair market value of $425,000. 7. On July 2, 1992, Mr. Wallace also determined the fair market value of the Condominium. Because the Condominium office space was unfinished, Mr. Wallace prepared a consultation report (the Report), rather than an appraisal. Mr. Wallace represents that a fully documented appraisal would yield the same value as a consultation report that was prepared. In determining the fair market value of the Condominium, Mr. Wallace considered sales of other medical condominiums in Knoxville. In the Report, Mr. Wallace determined that as of July 2, 1992, the fair market value of the Condominium, which consists of 6,000 square feet, was $125 per square foot for finished space. On June 30, 1993, in an update to the Report, Mr. Wallace estimated the fair market value of the Condominium to be $750,000. In establishing the fair rental value of the Condominium, Mr. Wallace examined rentals of medical facilities in the Knoxville area, and determined that as of July 2, 1992, the fair market rental rate for the Condominium is estimated at $12.50 per square foot for a triple net lease, increasing at 3% annually. 8. Once the Plan acquires the Condominium from the Center, it is proposed that the Plan lease (the Lease) the Condominium to the Employer. The Lease will be a triple net lease and will be net of maintenance, repairs, insurance, taxes, utilities and condominium fees. The Lease will have a term of three years, with two renewal options (Renewal) of three years each. Renewals will occur upon the Employer, as the Lessee, notifying the Plan, as the Lessor, in writing at least 60 days before the end of the expiring term. The rental rate will be determined by an independent qualified appraiser at each Renewal. In this regard, Mr. Wallace determined the rental rate for the Condominium as of July 2, 1992, to be $12.50 per square foot. The rental rate will be $75,000 per year for the first year, payable in equal monthly installments of $6,250 per month. For the second year, the rental rate will be $77,250 per year payable at the rate of $6,437.50 per month, and for the third year the rental rate will be $79,567.50 per year, payable at the rate of $6,630.63 per month. The Employer will obtain a fire and hazard/casualty insurance policy for the Condominium. The Plan as the Lessee will be the beneficiary and loss payee with respect to the hazard and liability insurance on the Condominium. 9. The Employer has also represented that if the Condominium is sold during the initial term of the Lease plus the two Renewal terms for less than $425,000 (the fair market value of the Clinch Property), the Employer will indemnify the Plan for the difference between the price received by the Plan and $425,000 (the Indemnity Agreement), in cash within six months after notice and verification of sale. It is represented that if it is contemplated that the Condominium be sold to a party in interest with respect to the Plan, as defined by section 3(14) of the Act, the applicant will seek exemptive relief from the Department prior to the consummation of the sale.
