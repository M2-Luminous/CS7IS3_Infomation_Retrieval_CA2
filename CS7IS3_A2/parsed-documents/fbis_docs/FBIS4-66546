Despite attaining a clear majority in the Lok Sabha and having a marginal victory in the vidhan sabha elections, central minister Arjun Singh's rebel attitude against Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's policies and leadership has not changed. The latest proof of this attitude is Mr. Singh's opposition to the government policies related to GATT and refusing to speak in the defense of the government on this subject in the Parliament. After the division of the Janata Dal and the results of the Lok Sabha elections, Mr. Rao's supporters have been saying for the last 3-4 months that Mr. Arjun Singh had met with Mr. Rao and yielded to him politically. Mr. Singh's group getting an important victory in Madhya Pradesh and agreement of the two leaders over several public programs are also being considered as good signs. However, Mr. Singh has once again given the impression of his going in an opposing direction to the Congress Party now that the Narasimha Rao government is once again on trial like in 1992. Interestingly, the leadership of the five-member cabinet sub-committee formed according to the prime minister's wishes to respond to the political attacks on GATT by the opposition was given to Arjun Singh. However, instead of protecting it, he ``drove a nail in the bosom of the strong government.'' In addition to Mr. Singh, Finance Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh, Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji, Agriculture Minister Balram Jakhad, and Science Minister Ramlakahn Singh Yadav are members of this sub-committee. Mr. Singh started to touch on the sensitive issues related to the GATT agreement in the first two meetings of the sub-committee and created new problems for Dr. Manmohan Singh and Pranab Mukherji. Mr. Singh showed his agreement with the views of the opposition and expressed the fear that by signing the new GATT agreement we were mortgaging our freedom. "This decision is like inviting the East India Company again," he said. We cannot play the role of the last ruler before the British empire began. Pranab Mukherji and Dr. Manmohan Singh tried to explain each issue and said that the government has not ignored India's interests. Every step is being taken very carefully. However, Mr. Singh was not satisfied. As the result of this, the other four ministers started to kold separate discussions. During that time, on the prime minister's advice, Parliamentary Minister Vidyacharan Shukla, while acting as the leader of the Congress Parliamentary group, asked Arjun Singh, Pranab Mukherji, Dr. Manmohan Singh, and Balram Jakhad to write a letter in defense of GATT. The remaining three ministers kept the order of the party leadership in mind and tried their best to defend the government's stand. However, Mr. Singh sent an oral message saying that he was not ready to defend the government on this subject. The political circles consider this action of ignoring the responsibilities as a member of the central cabinet and disregarding party leadership's directive very significant. Arjun Singh's supporters claim that Mr. Singh took this step after a lot of thought. In December 1992, Mr. Singh had expressed open disagreement with the central cabinet's policies before the disputed structure was torn down and had left for Ayodhya. Now, by staying out of the GATT agreement, Mr. Singh can determine a new political equation.
