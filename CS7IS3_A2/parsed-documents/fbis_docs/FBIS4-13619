FBIS4-13619 "drnes078__a94013" FBIS-NES-94-078-A Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 ANNEX Israel Poll Shows Netanyahu Favored Over Rabin in 2-Way Race Poll Shows Netanyahu Favored Over Rabin in 2-Way Race TA1504100994 Jerusalem THE JERUSALEM POST in English 15 Apr 94 p A2 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY TA1504100994 Jerusalem THE JERUSALEM POST English BFN [Text] If the election for prime minister were held today, Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu would get 44 percent of the vote to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's 38 percent, according to Gallup-Israel. Eighteen percent of the respondents were undecided. This is the first time since Netanyahu's election as Likud party chairman that he topped Rabin. However, in a three-way race, in which Tzomet leader Refa'el Eytan would also be a candidate, Rabin would receive the largest number of votes -- 34 percent, to Netanyahu's 29 percent and Eytan's 18 percent. The poll, taken in regular intervals since January, shows a steady decline in Rabin's popularity, from a peak of 44 percent in a three-way race on January 31st, and 49 percent against Netanyahu's 34 percent in a two-way match on that date. The sample is country-wide, representing 500-600 Hebrew speaking adults. The margin of error is 4 percent.
