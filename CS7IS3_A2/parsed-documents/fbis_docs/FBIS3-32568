Ortega Recognizes Clinton for Lifting Vietnam Embargo PA0902161694 Managua Canal Cuatro Television in Spanish 0300 GMT 8 Feb 94 PA0902161694 Managua Canal Cuatro Television Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [From the "Extravision" newscast] [Text] Former President Daniel Ortega recognized the decision of U.S. President Bill Clinton to suspend the trade embargo on Vietnam that had been in effect since 1975 and called on the U.S. President to follow suit with the people of Cuba. [Begin Ortega recording] What has happened? Despite the embargo and the blockade, Vietnam continued to grow and develop. Finally, in an intelligent and courageous measure -- we must recognize this -- U.S. President Bill Clinton decided to lift the trade embargo on Vietnam. We are now sending a message to President Clinton telling him that we recognize his courageous action of bringing justice to the Vietnam case because U.S. policy was unfair as long as the embargo and blockade were maintained. We recognize President Clinton's courageous act because there are extremists in the United States who are already criticizing him for lifting the embargo against Vietnam. We also tell President Clinton that just as he was brave enough to lift the embargo on Vietnam, he must have the courage to lift the embargo on Cuba, because that is a real disgrace to the policy of U.S. leaders. [applause] [end recording] The United States imposed the trade embargo on Vietnam in 1975, when U.S. troops were defeated by the Vietnamese people.
