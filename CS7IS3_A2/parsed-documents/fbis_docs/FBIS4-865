That violence erupted following the death of President Habyarimana was itself not surprising. Gross human rights violations have marked the whole of the post- independence period. Indeed thousands, perhaps tens of thousands of lives, have perished in Rwanda over the past few years. International human rights organizations such as Africa Watch, Amnesty International, and others have accurately documented the atrocities which President Habyarimana, the Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development, his party, and associates have committed in recent times. [passage omitted] Dr. Casimir Bizimungu, the health minister, is in Kinshasa. Many others are already in Europe. The world cannot and should not forget the genocide which is being perpetrated in Rwanda today by the surviving associates and allies of the late President Habyarimana. No effort should be spared in ensuring that the perpetrators of these heinous crimes are all brought to justice. The leaders of the evil forces which are carrying out the genocide who are escaping or may in the coming days escape from the country, should not be permitted by the Rwandan people to get away. Neither should foreign countries grant them asylum. Our criminals who are directly and personally responsible for causing the death of tens of thousands of their fellow citizens, they should be promptly apprehended in the countries to which they may flee so that arrangements can be made to bring them to justice. We call upon the international community, especially governments, the United Nations, the OAU, and international human rights organizations to spare no effort in helping to highlight the extent of the current genocide and to assist in bringing the war criminals in question to book. We also call upon all Rwandan people, diplomatic personnel, nongovernmental organizations, and other well-wishers who have been witnesses of the atrocities which have been committed in Rwanda over the past week, to render every assistance possible towards exposing the culprits so that they may be ostracized, isolated, and adequately punished for their war crimes. The complete apprehension, incarceration, and punishment of every one of the war criminals involved in the atrocities which are being committed would be a prerequisite for the restoration of peace, law and order, and in the long-term democracy in our country. Last but not least, we call upon the community of nations to come to the assistance of the surviving victims of the genocide and to assist the RPF in its efforts to liberate our country from the grip of the murderous regime responsible for the genocide.
