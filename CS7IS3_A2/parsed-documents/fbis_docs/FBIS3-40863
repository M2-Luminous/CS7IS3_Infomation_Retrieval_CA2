Based on the same report, in the first six months of the current year [21 March-23 September 1993] 338,000 tons of ores valued at $22 million and various types of concentrated metals valued at $320 million have been exported. In the same interview Golestaneh added that the number of exploitable mines in the country increased from 800 at the beginning of the First Five-Year Plan to 1,400 mines at the present time. In this interview Mr. Golestaneh did not announce what mines were transferred to the nongovernment sector. In recent years it has been the policy of the Islamic Republic to auction the nation's mines without proper planning to make real use of the nation's natural resources, which are considered the wealth of our people.
