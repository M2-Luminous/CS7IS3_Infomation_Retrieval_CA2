The Senate Has To Put Up With It So Far"] [Text] Sergey Dubinin, acting finance minister, who presented the Law on Financing the Federal Budget Expenditures in the Second Quarter of 1994 to the parliament's upper chamber yesterday, said that the 9.4 trillion rubles [R] in Central Bank credits "have already been kind of allocated," and that the government still sees the established R10.6 trillion as the "upper ceiling." The government plans to hold all talks with the regions "within the limits of the established volume of the budget;" that is, Mr. Dubinin assured, "if someone asks for more money, one should understand that we will thus cut someone else's funding." The government "still insists," he said, that the regions may keep 22 percent of tax revenues -- not 35 percent, as local authorities demand. At the same time, the acting finance minister emphasized, territorial authorities have been given the right to impose any taxes "without limitation even on the part of the federal parliament." In addition, local authorities will be exempt from the obligation to report to the center about regional budgets' expenditures. As for "government debts toward last year's credits," Sergey Dubinin pointed out that, "legally speaking, nothing but obligations under bilateral treaties can be recognized as debts." Such include, for instance, the treaty on government orders with the Defense Ministry, agreements with workers' collectives on the payment of wages, and government agreements with coal miners, he said. The government has estimated last year's debts of this kind at R4 trillion, of which R3 trillion have already been repaid, Dubinin said. The remaining R1 trillion is expected to be repaid by issuing securities, a measure on which an agreement with the Central Bank has already been reached, Mr. Dubinin said. During the discussion on the draft law the acting minister told the senators that if they fail to adopt the document, which was earlier passed by the lower chamber, this would "create an extremely difficult situation, because only a lawyer will be able to figure out in light of the current Constitution whether the government may undertake any financing at all." A bit later Sergey Dubinin remarked, however, that if "an extreme situation" like that occurs, then "even a decision by the State Duma alone may be considered fully sufficient for maintaining the country's viability."
