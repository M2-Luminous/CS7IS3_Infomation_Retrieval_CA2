The visitors from Denmark saw for themselves how the storing and utilization of nuclear weapons and propulsion plants in the army and the navy is done by experienced specialists with the aid of the most up-to-date technical monitoring equipment. Owing, however, to considerable cuts in nuclear arms and redeployment of missile units there is a lack of ecology specialists. The Europarliament deputies voiced readiness for cooperation in jointly training them.
