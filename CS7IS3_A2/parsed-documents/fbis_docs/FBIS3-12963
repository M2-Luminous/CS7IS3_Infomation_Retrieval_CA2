They said the blockade is considered a means to intervene in Iraqi internal affairs and runs contrary to all international charters and agreements, heavenly laws, and human rights. In a joint communique, signed for the Ba'th Party by the director of the Iraq Command's Foreign Relations Bureau and for the Bulgarian Liberal Democratic Party by party leader Veslin Koshev, the two parties call for the lifting of the unjust blockade, which has been imposed on Iraq for more than three years, for respecting Iraqi sovereignty and independence, and for respecting its people's free will. The communique noted the need to improve the ties of cooperation between the two parties through the exchange of delegations, visits, publications, and circulars to serve the common interests of the two friendly peoples and strengthen ties between them in all fields. The communique further urges the need for coordination and cooperation between the two parties in national, regional, and international conferences to expose the allegations and claims of the world media and the tendentious propaganda; to reject all forms of aggression, hegemony, exploitation, and the double standards policy in addressing world problems; to serve the principles of progress, freedom, and social justice; to realize security and peace among nations; and to ensure respect for international law.
