The vote counting was to be accelerated by entering the total number of votes recorded at counting stations as the basis for accumulating national and provincial tallies. This would replace the old system, which involved the entry into the count of batches of 2-3000 votes from the counting stations as the figures came in. "This changeover will take place during the course of the night and results will continue to flow during the course of the morning," the IEC statement said. The commission stressed it had not stopped counting votes.
