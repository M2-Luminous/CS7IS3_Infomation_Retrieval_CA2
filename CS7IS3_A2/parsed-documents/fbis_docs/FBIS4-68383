Arkadiy Kramarev, the chief of the St. Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast city administration of internal affairs, told the deputies that so far there has been no success in halting the rising crime. In the general opinion of the top officials of the city's law enforcement organs, the scale of organized crime in St. Petersburg is quite substantial. According to Arkadiy Kramarev, criminal structures may indirectly influence decisions of the city authorities. In order to preclude the possibility of criminal elements interfering with the process of city administration, deputy Sergey Andreyev proposed that by the time the city assembly begins its work all heads of law enforcement organs submit a list of priority normative acts, whose adoption will make it possible to improve the crime situation in St. Petersburg. Also yesterday a group of deputies petitioned Russian Minister of Internal Affairs V. Yerin to postpone the question of relieving A. Kramarev from his job--the rumors of his replacement have been circulating in St. Petersburg--until the city assembly begins its work.
