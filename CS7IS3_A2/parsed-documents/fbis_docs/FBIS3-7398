Security Council to issue a statement rather than adopt a resolution on North Korea's nuclear problem, saying it could be more effective. On his way to Beijing to join President Kim Yong-sam on a China visit, Han said China cannot but go along with a future U.N. resolution if North Korea does not come forward even after the council statement. "I believe it's advisable to start with a council president's statement so that a resolution can be adopted unanimously," Han said at an airport press conference. "Even to induce North Korea to negotiations, it would be more effective to start low, like a president's statement, than to start high with sanctions," he said. China's opposition to a resolution is pulling back what has been a swift movement at the Security Council to deal with North Korea who earlier this month refused access to suspected nuclear facilities to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections. "China's stance is to emphasize dialogue a little more before adopting a resolution," Han said. The foreign minister heads to Beijing to join the president who is to arrive in Beijing later in the afternoon for a state visit. He then goes on a separate trip to the United States from March 29 to fly between Washington and the United Nations to coordinate future measures on North Korean nuclear issue. He stops by Tokyo on March 3-4 before returning to Seoul.
