The governmental decree "On Delegation of the Powers of the Government of the Russian Federation With Respect to the Management and Disposal of Federal Property Facilities," which was officially distributed yesterday, grants to sectorial ministries the right to determine personnel and production policy. It is obvious that by this decision the government not only seeks to re-establish the manageability of the state sector but also to constrict the influence on it of the State Committee on the Administration of State Property, which is to be restricted now to the monitoring of the use of state property. The new governmental decision has the object of "improving the management of the state sector of the economy." The sector people lost their managerial functions already in the time of the "romantic" period of the reforms, after the liberalization of the economic activity of state enterprises. According to the document adopted, management of the state sector is shared between the sectorial ministries and the State Committee on the Administration of State Property. The sectorial ministries have now been granted the right to conclude contracts with the managers of enterprises and to approve their charters while the State Committee on the Administration of State Property is to regulate, correspondingly, the specific-purpose use of state property. The document also permits the sectorial ministries to monitor the dimensions of the state sector. The point is that not only the creation of an enterprise but also its liquidation will require coordination with the sector people. In this connection the possibility of denationalizing enterprises through bankruptcy that is incorporated in the State Privatization Program is to be constricted. That is why the forecasts of the experts who thought that introduction of the institution of bankruptcy would neutralize the victory of the sector people, which involved the removal of enterprises from under denationalization (in the course of the months-long discussion of the State Program the restrictive list of enterprises not subject to privatization was increased from 30 percent to 36 percent), are not justified. However, the consent of the sector people alone will be insufficient for the bankruptcy of an enterprise since it will be further necessary to obtain the "all right" of the local organs of executive power of the subjects of the federation. The clear pro-sectorial direction of the document is obvious. Moreover, the unwarranted change in the powers of the State Committee on the Administration of State Property--their reduction to monitoring the use of an enterprise's property (minus management)--exceeds the limits of the existing normative base. That is why the Prime Minister has proposed that the State Committee on the Administration of State Property "adjust" its powers and submit the draft of a statute on the Russian Federation State Committee on the Administration of State Property to the government within a month. If the State Committee on the Administration of State Property consents to the new distribution of functions, its status (now defined by law) as well as the influence of its leadership on economic policy will be substantially reduced. Distribution of Powers Between the Sectorial Ministries and the State Committee on the Administration of State Property - The sectorial ministries are granted the right to approve the charters of federal enterprises, to appoint and to dismiss the managers of federal enterprises, and to conclude, change and cancel contracts with these managers. The ministries also act as legal successors with respect to contracts previously concluded with the managers of federal enterprises by the organs of state administration of Russia, the former USSR and RSFSR, as well as by concerns, associations and other amalgamations of enterprises in the period when they were granted the corresponding powers. - The jurisdiction of the State Committee on the Administration of State Property entails the transfer of state property to full economic management and operational control, as well as to leasing and the right to use, by legal persons, and the monitoring of the specific-purpose utilization of state property.
