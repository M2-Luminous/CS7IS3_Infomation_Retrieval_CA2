We interviewed some participants of the talks on the results of the meeting and on the situation of the various Hungarian national communities. Andras Agoston, chairman of the Democratic Union of Vojvodina Hungarians [VMDK]: We Want Autonomy! [Botlik] What were the results of the Budapest meeting for you? [Agoston] I raised two issues at the meeting, one in connection with the Balladur plan. I explained that, if any of the region's governments signed it in its current form, the political goals set out by the organizations of the Hungarian national communities over the border would in fact become impossible to achieve. We insist that an agreement like this also has to contain the autonomy concept that we drew up. The issue of aid was the other topic. In recent years, the government of the mother country has also given significant financial support to the Hungarian national communities over the border. I asked the prime minister -- as help given to the national minorities is internationally legitimate -- to help maintain our institutional system, and to support our efforts aimed at implementing our autonomy concept. This would be very important because, certain phenomena in connection with the financial aid we have received did not help this. [Botlik] The psycho-terror against the some 400,000 Hungarians and the forceful military mobilizations seem recently to have eased off. Does the dialogue that began between the VMDK and the Serbian government have a role in this? [Agoston] We formulated our autonomy concept two years ago, at a time when the war was in full swing and the forceful mobilizations were daily events, and we had to suffer a tough war propaganda. We started from the premise that it is also in the interest of the Serbian state -- including its parties -- that the now open and unresolved situation of the Vojvodina Hungarians is settled. We were certain that sooner or later, international circumstances will change to benefit our efforts. In recent months, I also put my talks with Serbian President Milosevic into this context. As a matter of fact, the meeting was requested by Milosevic. I raised the personal autonomy of the Hungarians and that the establishment of an administrative district with Hungarian majority should begin to be set up in north Backa or the northern part of the Banat. We would like to achieve all this gradually. If the Serbian government backs down from the agreement then we will inform the Hungarian and the international public about this. [Botlik] What does personal autonomy mean? [Agoston] We intend to make progress in three areas. In education, we would like to establish a Hungarian schooling system, in culture, we would like to take over the leadership of institutions and associations and their assets (mainly buildings), and we would like to establish an independent Hungarian information system (press, radio, television). All these would be directed by the personal autonomy's council that will be established on a multi- party basis. We will probably initiate elections for this in October. If the promises received during the talks with President Milosevic come true then we will be able to set up the Vojvodina Hungarian press and publishing house and the editorial group of the independent Hungarian television and radio. We can start setting up the Hungarian schooling system, and the council of the personal autonomy can take over certain functions in the area of culture. [Botlik] At the December elections, five representatives of the VMDK were elected into the Serbian Parliament. From the results it seems that they might be the decisive factors.... [Agoston] Unfortunately, this is the situation in Parliament where the socialists have 123 of the 250 seats and the opposition has the rest. The opposition is a rather mixed political group because the VMDK and Seselj's radical party are together in it although they are not at all in the same camp in reality. The opposition is divided, therefore, the socialists have to prepare for an unstable government and they will again have to call elections after some time. In this situation, our view is that the VMDK's representatives will not vote for any such parliamentary decision which would make them clash with half of the Serbian political palette. Arpad Pasza, Chairman of the Democratic Community of Hungarians in Croatia [HMDK]: We Pay Attention to the Scattered Hungarian Groups [Botlik] Out of the organizations of Hungarians over the border, the HMDK is the youngest, it is barely two years old. A large section of the areas inhabited by Hungarians -- the Dravaszog [Drava river area] and Slavonia -- is under Serbian occupation at the moment and a significant proportion of the population has escaped from these places. How can you organize yourselves in this situation? [Pasza] We consider the organization of the Hungarians living in scattered areas as our main task. For example, there is a significant diaspora -- mainly intelligentsia -- in the Croatian capital Zagreb which can still be stopped from being assimilated. A kindergarten group will be started for their children in March. Some 1,200 Hungarians are living in the Tengermellek, they speak their mother tongue but, unfortunately, their children can only speak Croatian. At the beginning of the year, 164 people formed the HMDK's local organizations in the former Hungarian spa Abbazia now Opatija. They have grand plans and they are also expecting a cultural performance from Hungary. We will next form organizations in the area of Belovar and then along the Sava River in Slavon-Brod. Bela Marko, Chairman of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania: We Also Want To Become Economically Strong [Marko] Contrary to certain media reactions, we also considered this meeting natural because it has to be openly and consistently admitted that the Hungarian organizations operating in various countries of the Carpathian basin regularly exchange their experiences. All Hungarian national communities over the border are living in special situations but their problems are often similar and, most certainly, this why we came to almost identical conclusions as to the solutions. In our view, the introduction of various forms of autonomy leads to the reassuring settlement of the situation of Hungarian national communities over the border. As we consider ourselves as organic part of the Hungarian nation, we expect the Hungarian Government's political support in our endeavors and that care for the Hungarians living outside the country's boundaries will remain an organic and inseparable part of its foreign policy. [Botlik] In the past years in Europe, a number of proposals have been made to set up international norms which -- it seems -- will reassuringly settle the situation of national minority and ethnic communities.... [Marko] The Balladur plan that is now called the European Stability Agreement is one of these proposals that apply to the East European region or a section of it. Its original version contained several positive elements for national minorities but most of these were removed from the draft through the amendments in 1993. This plan would only offer good solutions if, in the process of settlement, the affected national communities and governments also held talks and the views of the national communities were taken into consideration. The latter was emphasized by the ethnic Hungarian leaders at the Budapest meeting. Our links with the Hungarian government are not only of a political nature. We have already received considerable budget support for rebuilding our educational and cultural institutional system. The mother country will continue to be completely open about doing this in the future, too. [Botlik] What are the most important tasks in improving the situation of the more than 2 million strong Hungarian national community in Romania and Transylvania? [Marko] The priorities we laid down four years ago are still valid. Unfortunately, the Hungarian Bolyai University of Sciences still has not been able to restart its operation, therefore, our education system continues to be incomplete. We are trying to substitute this with civic social institutions, foundations, associations, unions, and folk high schools, and there are also very remarkable church initiatives. We are trying to use all legal frameworks and expand the possibilities of Hungarian education to overcome the difficulties and the acute shortage of teachers. As we often said it in our statements, the economy is just as important for us, and we think that we have to do much more than we have done in the past to help the Hungarian national community strengthen financially. Through this, people's serious subsistence problems can be eased, emigration can be reduced, and the general mood can be improved. This is especially important because an economically strong national community is less exposed to the state power. We have to act with more determination in the future because an anti-Hungarian discriminative process can also be seen in the privatizations.
