Aleksandr Mikhaylov, chief of the FCS Public Relations Center, would not give any details, pointing out that doing so before an indictment is handed down would be premature. Ironically, soon before it caught the BND agent, the Russian counterintelligence service had exposed a spy who worked for the British MI6 service; at the time it immediately revealed some details about him -- for instance, that he was an employee of a Russian military-industrial company. This fact has suggested that the German spy caught in the FCS net is more important than the British one. This theory was also confirmed by report, which was made public a bit later, about a telephone conversation between Horst Schmidtbauer, state minister at the FRG federal chancellor's office, and Anatoliy Safonov, FCS deputy director, to discuss matters concerning the arrest of the German intelligence service's agent. According to INTERFAX, the FCS representative said that the arrest of the German agent does not have any political bottom-line. But why has the German side raised the question about the possible political bottom-line of a basically run-of-the-mill spy drama? Information received by NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA from competent sources suggests that it was forced to do so. It turned out that the press reported about the BND agent's arrest at a time when BND President Konrad Porzner was in Moscow. Mr. Porzner was invited to the Russian capital by FCS chiefs to discuss matters regarding the cooperation between the two countries' special services in areas where their interests coincide: the struggle against organized crime, international terrorism, activity in crisis areas. As soon as the news about the exposed German spy was made public, Mr. Porzner was forced to suspend the talks and immediately leave for home -- to clarify the situation. To all appearances, it is this embarrassing situation that has forced the Germans to make "additional references." The incident was not discussed by the chiefs of the FCS and the BND. Officials at the Russian special service hope, however, that the emergency will not thwart the already established and fairly fruitful cooperation of the two special services, a cooperation that nonetheless does not rule out classical intelligence activity against each other. The arrest of a BND agent against the backdrop of the German special service chief's visit to Moscow may have occurred by chance. On the other hand, the FCS presumably had information about the spy long enough to expose him some time earlier. In this event, the goings-on have reminded us once again that intelligence and counterintelligence services have always maintained a special relationship that could scarcely be called a friendly one.
