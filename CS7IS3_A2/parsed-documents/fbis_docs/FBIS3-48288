The lower house Committee on Rules and Administration will discuss how to deal with the LDP-submitted motions at a board of directors meeting on 24 January. As reasons for the no-confidence motions against them, the LDP cited the following: Foreign Minister Hata "neglected to take part in the negotiations on his own initiative and to brief the Diet on progress in the negotiations; as a result he ruined the Diet resolutions." Agriculture Minister Hata "lied to the people in replying to Diet interpellations."
