The comment came in a Foreign Ministry statement after Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic arrived here Monday for talks with Russian officials hours after NATO aircraft shot down four military planes believed to belong to the Bosnian Serb forces. "Whatever party (Serb, Moslem or Croat) flew over Bosnia in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions, it must carry the full responsibility for what happened," the statement said. The Ministry said it continued to analyse the situation, implying that the downing could be criticized at a later date. A high-ranking Russian diplomat earlier told the INTERFAX news agency that the Ministry had asked the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia to explain the shooting down of the four Galeb planes by US F-16 fighter jets in a pre-dawn strike Monday. He added that if UNPROFOR information proves to be true, "the Bosnian Serbs have violated one of the UN Security Council resolutions banning any miltary flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina." The resolution, adopted last year and backed by Russia, has repeatedly been violated by Bosnia's three warring factions -- Serbs, Moslems and Croats, the diplomat said.
