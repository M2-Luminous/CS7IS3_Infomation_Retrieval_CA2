Without this promise, our inspectors would not have gone to North Korea in March," David Kyd, spokesman of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), told DER STANDARD on Tuesday [5 April]. These samples are absolutely necessary since the seal has been broken and the checking devices installed by the IAEA have expired. On the issue of using satellite photos, Kyd said that after the Gulf War, the IAEA Council of Governors adopted a written resolution saying that the IAEA shall be given access to all "additional information," which includes satellite photos, intelligence reports, and information by nuclear experts. After all, the experience with Iraq has shown that the declaration of nuclear installations by individual states is not sufficient. The Council of Governors' resolution applies to all states that have signed an inspection agreement with the IAEA, and this includes North Korea. "South Africa did not oppose satellite photos," Kyd said. "But North Korea is annoyed because the photos come from the United States." On the two mysterious installations in Yongbyon, Kyd said: "Satellite photos have shown that these installations were suddenly covered with soil and plants so they would be camouflaged before our first inspection in 1992. If they really are just military installations, then why are they not showing them to us?"
