They will take their proposals to the government in April. The movement will be entitled "Cry of the Earth." The movement is being organized by the National Rural Workers Confederation [Confederacao Nacional dos Trabalhadores na Agricultura], the CUT [Sole Workers Center], and the Landless Farmers Movement, as well as other entities that plan to join the action in favor of citizens and struggle for jobs movement. This new movement has five main objectives: agrarian reform, labor rights, social security and health, and policies for the environment and energy fields. Those who are promoting this movement plan to begin negotiating these objectives with the government next month. Landless farmers representative Gilberto Fortes has asserted that more than 16,000 families must be settled in the rural area. He said this problem could be solved by expropriating land where marijuana plantations are found, as the Constitution establishes. Representatives of this movement also want to fight to ensure the expansion of the program to feed workers and the rural workers' right to severance payments.
