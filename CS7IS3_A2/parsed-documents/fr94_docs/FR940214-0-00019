FR940214-0-00019 FR940214-0-00004 FmHA response: FmHA feels that excess land is adequately defined in this section and in ยง1944.215(a)(6). We do not agree that this section conflicts with ยง1944.215(a)(6). Section 1944.215(a)(6) states that local zoning ordinances and, in extreme cases, the site size, shape, or condition will be the determining factors in arriving at site density. 9. Section 1944.212(d) Comment: There were a number of suggestions concerning the establishment of a range of costs for offsite facilities. One respondent recommended that all offsite costs be eliminated from the loan. It was pointed out by several respondents that States have not approved any off-site facility costs. It was also suggested that each situation is unique and should be judged on its own merits and not be compared with past performance. One respondent felt this would place an undue burden on FmHA and that establishing a range would not prove anything since the bottom line must be the actual ``as developed'' value of the site. FmHA response: FmHA agrees that every situation has to be judged on its own merit and that it would be impractical to try to establish a range of costs for offsite facilities. The language has been changed to delete this requirement. 10. Section 1944.212(g) Comment: There was generally an expression of agreement with the addition of blinds as an eligible loan purpose. One respondent, however, suggested that we also include shades with this provision. One respondent wanted to know if individual washer/dryer hookups could be interpreted to mean ``laundry facility.'' Another respondent voiced an opinion that washer/dryer hookups in addition to a central laundry facility increases marketability of rental units. FmHA response: FmHA has no objection to including shades in this provision and has amended the language accordingly. Laundry facilities are defined as the actual washers and dryers facilities available to all of the tenants and not just washer and dryer hookups. Washers and dryers owned by individual tenants are not available to all tenants and cannot be considered as ``laundry facilities.'' FmHA stands by its previous position regarding the prohibition of placing washers and dryers in individual units when a central laundry facility is provided unless it is customary for the area for the size of project and type of housing involved. Washer and dryer hookups are an additional expense to overall project costs and, in the majority of cases, are not used by the tenants. Additionally, there have been problems with the hookups leaking and causing water damage to the units. 11. Section 1944.212(i) Comment: There were numerous objections to disallowing certain fees when the borrowing entity will receive low income housing tax credits, primarily because the end result will be an increase in the borrower's contribution. Other respondents felt that if certain items were required by FmHA, then those items should be funded. One respondent suggested that FmHA automatically increase the equity requirement for low income housing tax credit projects to 5 percent rather than to eliminate certain fees and charges. One respondent suggested that the intent be clarified to mean the legal fees associated with closing the FmHA loan and not the interim lender loan. Another person suggested that all non-low income housing tax credit projects receive an additional 10 points in the rating criteria. One respondent felt that this provision would reduce loan costs and thereby maximize the State's funding allocation. FmHA response: The Community Development Act of 1992 increased the equity contribution to 5 percent for borrowers whose members will receive benefits from Low Income Housing Tax Credits. The regulation has already been changed to reflect this increase. The original language pertaining to related costs has been restored. Legal fees pertain to the costs associated with the FmHA loan closing only; clarification has been added to the section. FmHA does not agree with the suggestion to allow an additional 10 points for non-low income housing tax credit projects. The purpose of the priority points is to direct funding to the areas of greatest need and the lack of tax credits is not an indication of need. 12. Section 1944.212(j) Comment: There were several respondents who expressed opposition to allowing payment for assistance to nonprofit groups because of the inequity in handling profit vs. nonprofit applicants. FmHA response: FmHA published this section to correct a typographical error in the original section; however, the Agency feels that the payment for technical assistance is appropriate for nonprofits since they must rely on their own resources which, in some cases, are slim or nonexistent. 13. Section 1944.213(b)(1) Comment: One respondent understood this section to mean the nonprofit organization may provide the initial operating capital and/or relocation costs incurred and suggested that the section be revised to include relocation costs in the loan. FmHA response: This section states that the loan may provide for the development cost or the security value of each project, whichever is less, plus the 2 percent O&M and/or the relocation costs. This provision allows for the inclusion of relocation costs in the loan.
