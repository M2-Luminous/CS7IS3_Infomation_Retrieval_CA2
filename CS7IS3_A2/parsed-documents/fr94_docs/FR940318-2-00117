FR940318-2-00117 FR940318-2-00076 The projects must provide academic and community/clinical experiences for the targeted students designed not only to develop their interest in but to enhance the foundation required for their entry into the health professions. The projects must include: Academic enhancement initiatives in mathematics, science and communication skills appropriate to grade level to augment the targeted students' normal school offerings; exposure to peer counselors, health professions students, and health professionals as role models; student mentors; and experiences, appropriate to grade level, at community based health care settings. The projects must involve a formalized arrangement between the applicant and an institution of higher education that has Health Careers Opportunity Program (HCOP) grant funding through 1996. A listing of these HCOP institutions is appended. The HCOP institution must be located in sufficiently close proximity to the health center to allow for visits and other interaction between faculty, health center staff and students. The HCOP institution is expected to develop and/or expand current academic enrichment activities appropriate to the needs of the targeted population. Other activities which may be appropriate include presentations by health professions students serving as role models; personal, academic and career counseling; parental information sessions; campus visits to local undergraduate and health professions schools; etc. All of these activities could be offered in summer programs and/or during the school year. Linkages are also encouraged with a health professions school in the area to provide a continuum throughout the educational pathway. Applications from Health Centers with school based health clinics must include the clinics as a partner in the development and implementation of the project. All funded projects are expected to develop appropriate experiences and activities to expose students to community oriented primary health care. These experiences should be age-appropriate, and could focus on the development of healthy lifestyles, peer counseling, on-site observation of health care professionals, development of patient care skills, extensive summer internships at the facility, etc. Other health center activities which may be appropriate include outreach in local educational institutions and clinics to reach interested students; establishment of peer support groups; involvement of students in peer health education programs; guest speakers; presentations by health professionals; encouragement/facilitation of mentor/mentee relationships; tours of various health care facilities; shadowing experiences; volunteer activities in health care facilities; seminars; research projects on health care issues; etc. Grant funds are available to organize and execute all relevant activities related to: the provision of supervised age level appropriate community service projects and practicums at community primary health services settings; coordination of initiatives with active HCOP programs at linking institution(s) of higher education, including the development and delivery of academic enrichment programs; and provision of appropriate support and motivational activities. Varied levels of stipend support are also available, depending upon the program activity and grade level of the student. All programs are to involve faculty from participating students' schools, representatives from the grantee organization, and key staff of the HCOP programs at the linking institutions in the planning, development and execution of the program. Parental involvement is to be built in as appropriate. The federally-funded community or migrant health center, health care for the homeless program, or public housing primary care program would function as the lead entity, coordinating and providing oversight of all program initiatives.
