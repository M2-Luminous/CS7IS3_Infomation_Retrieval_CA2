FR941021-2-00140 FR941021-2-00089 The Commission realizes that Banking Industry Portfolio Notes are dependent upon the individual credit of the issuer, Lehman Brothers. To some extent this credit risk is minimized by the Exchange's continued listing standards which require issuers to maintain an aggregate market value of $1 million for its publicly-held shares. 24 In addition, the Exchange's hybrid listing standards further require that Banking Industry Portfolio Notes have at least $4 million in market value. 25 In any event, financial information regarding Lehman Brothers, in addition to the information on the issuers of the underlying securities comprising the Banking Industry Portfolio, will be publicly available. 26 24 See Amex Company Guide ยง1003(b). 25 See Amex Company Guide ยง107A. 26 The companies that comprise the Banking Industry Portfolio are reporting companies under the Act. The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change and Amendment No. 1 to the proposal prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the Federal Register . Specifically, the Commission believes that the proposal, as amended, does not raise any regulatory issues that were not addressed by the Amex in its proposal to list and trade Basic Industry Portfolio Notes. 27 Additionally, the Exchange's proposal to list and trade Basic Industry Portfolio Notes was noticed for the full comment period without any comments being received by the Commission. Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act to approve the proposed rule change and Amendment No. 1 thereto on an accelerated basis. 27 See Exchange Act Release No. 34820, supra note 19. Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submissions, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filings will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Amex. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;39 and should be submitted by November 14, 1994. It is Therefore Ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 28 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;39), as amended, is approved. 28 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 29 29 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
