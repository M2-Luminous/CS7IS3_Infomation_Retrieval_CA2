The SYDNEY MORNING HERALD, quoting intelligence sources, said the agency became concerned about its phone and computer systems nearly two years ago after a tip-off by the US Central Intelligence Agency about Russian spy activity. The newspaper said the decision to replace the phone and clean out the computer system in the Australian Security Intelligence Organsiation (ASIO) was linked the arrest in June 1993 of an ASIO agent and the secret expulsion of six Russian agents in the last half of 1993. The newspaper reported that the cost of replacing the systems would be absorbed within the extra eight million dollars which the ASIO received in its annual funding in the last Australian budget. ASIO got funding raised from 47 million Australian dollars (31 million US) to nearly 55 million dollars. No immediate comment could be obtained on the SYDNEY MORNING HERALD's report.
