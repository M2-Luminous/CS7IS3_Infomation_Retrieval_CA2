[Leveau] I do not think so. There was a suspicion that a secret dialogue has been going on for a long time in the secrecy of the El-Boulaida (formerly Blida) military prison. But negotiations are now openly being conducted between the army and the political elements of the Islamic movement. Moreover, we have learned that the officials of the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] at one point went directly from their cells to the conference table. That proves that they are recognized as real partners. I would even say that the army now seems to regard them as the only interlocutors on its level, to the detriment of the other political parties. Obviously, what we do not yet know is why those negotiations did not succeed. [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] After having fought the FIS, does this army not now have its back to the wall and have no choice but to roll out the red carpet for it? [Leveau] Many officers have probably reached the conclusion that it was no longer possible to get rid of the FIS and that it will be increasingly difficult for them to develop in a country which has been rendered hostile by repression. But from there to thinking that the Algerian army is preparing to capitulate in mid-campaign.... No, despite two years of a vicious circle of guerrilla warfare, terrorism, and repression, the military corps has not collapsed, as the Islamic movement may have hoped. It has remained completely coherent and united. Furthermore, there is a hard core of 25,000 to 30,000 men in the elite troops who will remain completely loyal to the general staff whatever happens. [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Are there not some soldiers who have been won over to the Islamic cause? [Leveau] There have in fact been a few desertions at a junior level. The army attributes them to mistakes made in the days of President Bendjedid, who encouraged the integration of students through lengthy periods of military service. But when this creeping Islamic fundamentalism led to the desertion of a few officers, the punishments were harsh. Military Security still exits, and reprisals are apparently taken against the families. The message had to be very clearly understood. [passage omitted] [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] In the framework of the dialogue with the FIS which you mentioned, what can these modernist officers have in common with the Islamic fundamentalists? [Leveau] If you make a quick sociological analysis of this group of young officers, you discover that they are mainly scientists with rational minds. When you look at their libraries, you realize that they read both history and science fiction. They are often married to teachers. But, at the same time, they are very austere people who do not drink alcohol and who observe their religion. Some have even gone on pilgrimage to Mecca. They are the same age, have followed the same educational careers: So their profile is not so far removed from that of the so-called second-generation FIS members. Furthermore, these officers share a number of nationalist values with the Islamic fundamentalists. When the Islamic fundamentalists refer to the FLN [National Liberation Front] of the war of independence, they adopt the nationalist statements of the past, so dear to the military. Moreover, in the future, the military and the Islamic fundamentalists may find that they have the same line with regard to the Sahara, which is likely to become a pretext for upping the stakes and launching a confrontation with Morocco with the aim of repairing Algerian national unity. [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Even if such a convergence took place, would the army's interests be reconcilable with the Islamic fundamentalists' political objectives? [Leveau] If it is guaranteed a pact on impunity with regard to the corruption scandals in which a number of general officers are implicated; if its resources are maintained; and, above all, if its administrative autonomy is not affected--the promotion scale, recruitment by military academies, housing, pensions--the army might ultimately agree to allow the FIS to run the country's affairs. This is the hypothesis of a change like the one which took place in Chile, in which the army abandoned power without giving up its privileges and in which, above all, the democratic government agreed not to put Pinochet on trial. In this spirit, it is even possible to imagine that the young officers I mentioned above might no longer feel complete solidarity with their elders and might agree to sacrifice some of them on the altar of morality. Provided, of course, the edifice of the army in general was not excessively undermined. Also provided that the Islamic fundamentalists, for their part, were prepared to neutralize their most radical elements. Another, possibly more plausible hypothesis is that of an army which played a greater part in a pluralist political system. In that case, it would have the position of arbiter between the FIS, the moderate Islamic movement, the Republicans, the Berbers, and civilian society. That would presuppose the FIS agreeing to be limited to a popular role--that of the defense of the poor and disinherited. But, in both hypotheses, the army would do all it could to maintain its autonomy.
