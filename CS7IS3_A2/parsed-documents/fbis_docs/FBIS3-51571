This morning, there was violence in the small city of Ocumare del Tuy, 70 km to the south, and Villa de Cura, 100 km to the west. Last night there were riots in the streets of Caracas. There also were riots in the industrial city of Valencia, which is 80 km to the west of Caracas; in the twin cities of Barcelona and Puerto La Cruz, 220 km to the east; and in Punto Fijo, 368 km to the northwest. Vehicles were set on fire in these cities, and there was looting in some cities in the interior. In Barcelona, an 85-year-old woman was shot dead, six people were injured, three stores were looted, and one grocery distribution truck was robbed. Calm was restored in Barcelona and Maturin on Thursday, but the regional authorities ordered that both cities be placed under military control. Army troops and militarized national guardsmen were posted in the streets. In Punto Fijo, some 20 stores were looted, other shops were attacked with stones, and there was general panic. The disturbances began last week over a hike in transportation rates and a sales tax that was suspended, which ultimately led to speculation that prices would rise by as much as 300 percent. The riots first started in Barcelona and Puerto la Cruz, and from there they spread on Tuesday to Cumana and Maturin.
