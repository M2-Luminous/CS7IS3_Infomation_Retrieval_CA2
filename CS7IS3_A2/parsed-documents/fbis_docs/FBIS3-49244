Jaroslav Ortman, deputy chairman of the party, said the following: [Begin Ortman recording] The changed situation in Europe, we are convinced, should lead toward seeking new paths to solving questions of security and not toward using [word indistinct] patterns. It is obvious that the policy of the U.S. Government and the United States, presented by the "Partnership for Peace" plan, is in the incipient stage. The path of the Left Bloc does not lead via the expansion of NATO. We have registered the words of Prime Minister Klaus saying that membership of the Czech Republic in NATO is not topical. No one wants us there anyway at the moment. We see a solution in the system of collective security and not in the existence of a military pact of a part of Europe, whether big or small. We are convinced that, particularly in the sphere of seeking paths of collective security, Czech foreign policy should be much more active. [end recording]
