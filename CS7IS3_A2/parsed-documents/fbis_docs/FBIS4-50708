According to the latest statistics, the city now has about 10,000 private enterprises with a registered capital of 2.6 billion yuan, increases of 14 percent and 50 percent, respectively, over 1993. China's private economy disappeared in the 1950's, but resumed and burgeoned after 1979, when China began its national reform and opening to the outside world. To help the private economy develop healthily, the municipal government has worked out a package of policies in favor of private businesses. Encouraged by the municipal government, more and more scientists have left their research institutions to set up non-governmental enterprises specializing in spreading research findings, and Chinese scholars studying abroad are retuning to Shanghai to set up businesses.
