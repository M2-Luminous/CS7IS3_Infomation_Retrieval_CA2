In a raid Sunday on the Gaza Strip's Khan Yunus refugee camp, they arrested Farid al-Qaysi, 21, and 'Ala Abu-Sita, 20, on charges of killing alleged drug dealers Hayim Weizmann, 34, and David Bublil, 41, near Tel Aviv last Friday. The two were reportedly seen writing on the main Khan Yunus mosque that "the Ahmad Abu-Rish group carried out the murder of the two Zionist dogs at al-Ramlah to avenge the army's killing of Ahmad Abu-Rish." Al-Qaysi, Abu-Sita and two other Palestinians who were at large had shown camp residents four ears they said they had cut from their victims, Palestinians said. Undercover Israeli troops shot dead Ahmad Khalid Abu-Rish, a 20-year-old member of the Fatah Hawks, on November 28, shortly after he had been set free from prison. The Hawks vowed afterwards to resume their armed attacks which they had abandoned on Arafat's orders following the September 13 autonomy accord. The army also arrested Muhammad Abu-Rish, a former member of the Islamic Jihad movement who had been pardoned at the same time as his brother Ahmad. Soldiers also raided the al-Burayj camp and arrested Yasir Taha, 20, a member of the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qasim, the armed wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas).
