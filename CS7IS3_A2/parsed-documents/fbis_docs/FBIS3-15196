This would agree with Russia's plans and tactical and strategical goals, he added. Ukraine cannot afford financing the construction of the ship alone. Meanwhile, the Varyag is blocking the embankment, creating problems and incurring new expenses. The project has already cost the budget a pretty penny and it would be absurd to scrap the ship. Shipyard officials are now in Kiev to discuss the future of the ship.
