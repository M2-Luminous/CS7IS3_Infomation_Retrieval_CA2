The writing has been on the wall for the prime minister for so long that it would be easy to dismiss the latest crisis as just another setback. But the events of the past week are not merely more of the same. The prime minister's stock has plunged to such a low that the question which now dominates discussion among senior Tories is no longer if Mr Major will be forced to resign, but when. It is not just his enemies on the right who believe he will have to go; the solid centre of the Tory party is rapidly coming to the same conclusion. Even those he can still count as friends and allies admit as much in private, whatever their protestations of loyalty in public. It is, of course, impossible to predict the manner and exact timing of his demise. But that he will go seems now to be as likely as anything can be in the uncertain world of politics, and probably before the year is out. Mr Major has been written off before, though his position has never been as dire as it is now. His remarkable resilience in adversity and his steely determination to claw his way back from hopeless positions may yet confound his critics. But we now know enough about Mr Major's strengths and weaknesses to make two safe conclusions: he and those around him are incapable of mounting a credible strategy for a sustained recovery in his political fortunes; and, even when things are looking up a bit for him, he has the unerring knack of digging a hole for himself and jumping into it. Taken together, they suggest his plight is terminal. Mr Major has made repeated attempts to relaunch himself, usually through set-piece speeches to the Tory faithful; none has got beyond the starting blocks, partly because rousing speeches are not his forte. More fundamentally, he cannot bring himself to draw a line under past mistakes and start again. This has been seen above all in the crucial area of economic policy. The chance to go for economic growth and jobs after White Wednesday, the defining disaster of his administration from which he has never really recovered when the pound was ignominiously ejected from the European exchange-rate mechanism (ERM), has been largely botched because Mr Major could not bring himself to admit that his previous economic strategy was in ruins and it was time for a fresh start. The price of his desire to depict consistency and business as usual, when all around him was erumbling, has been a stuttering, half-hearted recovery which has left voters in a mood too curmudgeonly, after a long, painful recession, to give the government any credit for what economic growth there has been. Mr Major's inability to shake off his past mistakes is compounded by his facility for making new ones. When this newspaper wrote that if he saw a banana skin on the other side of the street he would cross over to slip on it, his supporters said that was harsh and exaggerated. After the debacle over European voting rights last week, when Mr Major created a drama and then turned it into a crisis, all to no purpose, nobody can now doubt its essential accuracy. But it was only the latest in an impressive track record of finding banana skins to slip on that a more astute politician would have easily avoided: from pit closures to Europe to back-to- basics to the ERM to promising tax cuts then imposing the biggest tax hike in British history, Mr Major's habit has been to stake out untenable positions, then retreat from them, leaving chaos and disillusion in his wake. It is an unedifying, sometimes ludicrous, sight. There are enough senior Tories concluding that it cannot continue to make his days numbered. A fair number of Tory MPs still believe their party would be signing a suicide note if it changed leaders in mid-term for the second time in four years. They have a point. The election of a new leader would not necessarily transform the political scene overnight. There would be no sudden revival of Tory fortunes in the opinion polls, of the sort that occurred when Margaret Thatcher was deposed. But a majority of Tory MPs, especially those in marginal seats facing political oblivion, are coming round to the view that changing horses might be the lesser of two evils. A new leader would at least give them a fighting chance of holding on to their seats, when at present they have none. The contest for the next Tory leader is, in effect, already under way. It will not reach its climax before midsummer at the earliest. Nobody wants to succeed Mr Major this side of the local and European elections in May and June. Of course, his prospects would be transformed if the Tories were to do unexpectedly well; on present evidence that is the least likely outcome. Mr Major must brace himself for renewed calls for his departure in the wake of Tory electoral disasters. He insists he will not be driven out, no matter how bad the results. He could hardly say otherwise. But if he does dig in he faces a challenge from a stalking horse which he would win, but probably so humiliatingly that he would be a lame-duck leader. It might not come to that: by late summer/early autumn, the weight of party opinion urging him to go could prove irresistible. Mr Major says the "men in suits" will not force him. But Richard Nixon thought he could hang on, even though Watergate had crippled his presidency, until a crucial meeting with Barry Goldwater forced him to conclude the game was up. We do not yet know the name of the British Tory Goldwater; but as the year goes on there is likely to be no shortage of volunteers. The emergence of Michael Heseltine as clear frontrunner to succeed Mr Major in our poll of 100 Tory MPs is nothing short of remarkable, though it was anticipated in this column several weeks ago. His only problem is of peaking too soon. He has to continue to look and sound prime ministerial without appearing disloyal to his present boss. He is astute enough to walk that tightrope. On Europe, where the right distrust him most, he has to sound increasingly Gaullist: pro-European but a staunch defender of Britain's national interests. He would capture more of the right if he made it clear at some stage that Michael Portillo would be chancellor in a Heseltine administration. When Mr Heseltine mulled over his challenge to Mrs Thatcher in 1990 he used to say that, when it came to the Tory leadership, he had only one bullet in his gun; if he missed he would never get another chance. Well, he did miss and he was wrong. As much to his surprise as anybody's, it turns out there is another bullet in the chamber.
