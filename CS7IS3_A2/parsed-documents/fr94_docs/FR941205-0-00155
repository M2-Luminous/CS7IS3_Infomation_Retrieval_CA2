FR941205-0-00155 FR941205-0-00029 Risk apportionment: The percentage of loss assumed by HUD and the HFA (risk apportionment) must be specified in the risk-sharing agreement between HUD and the HFA. HUD intends to execute a single agreement with each HFA, but the agreement will recognize that the risk apportionment may vary among project loans that are originated by a single HFA. The loan loss percentage for a particular project will be reflected in that project's underlying loan documentation and in an addendum to the risk-sharing agreement. Reimbursement capacity: The application for participation in this program must demonstrate that the HFA has the financial capacity to fulfill its reimbursement obligations. Underwriting standards: A qualified HFA that agrees to accept 50 percent or more of the risk of loss on a loan may employ its own underwriting standards, loan terms and conditions. However, where HUD retains more than 50 percent of the risk, it may impose additional underwriting standards, and loan terms and conditions. Other requirements: Section 542(c) also requires HUD to establish a schedule for mortgage insurance premiums that reflects the risk apportionment for the loan. Lower or nominal premiums will apply to HFAs that assume a greater share of the risk of loss. In addition, HUD is prohibited from applying ``identity of interest'' provisions in risk-sharing agreements (section 542(c)(5)); and GNMA is prohibited from issuing securities for loans insured under the program (section 542(c)(6)). Finally, HUD may issue commitments for mortgages that, in the aggregate, do not exceed 30,000 units between now and September 30, 1995 (section 542(c)(4)). The Congress may expand the program after that date, but no determination will be made until the Secretary has submitted reports (including any recommendations for legislation) to the Congress, as required under section 542(d)(3). ( See, section 542(c)(4).) III. The Regulation The legislation authorizing this program prescribes certain requirements in relation to eligibility and risk apportionment. As a matter of policy, in its formulation of this regulation, HUD has decided to afford qualified HFAs very broad responsibility for the administration of the program, although HUD will monitor HFAs' activities. In addition to underwriting and processing loans, HFAs will service loans, provide management oversight of the projects, and dispose of properties subject to mortgages that fall into default. The regulation provides for sanctions in the event that an HFA is found to be in noncompliance with the requirements of the regulation. It is to be noted that for this program the Congress, in section 542(c)(2)(E) of the 1992 Act, has assigned to qualified HFAs the responsibility for using their own ``underwriting standards and loan terms and conditions for purposes of loans to be insured under this subsection'' without further review by the Secretary, except that the Secretary may impose ``additional underwriting criteria and loan terms and conditions'' in cases where the Secretary retains more than 50 percent of the risk of loss. Further, Congress has authorized HUD through section 542(c)(8) to issue such regulations as may be necessary to carry out this risk-sharing program. In cases involving ``insurance upon completion,'' HUD will be responsible for final endorsement of the mortgage note for insurance. In cases involving ``insurance of advances,'' HUD will be responsible for the initial and final endorsement of the mortgage note for insurance in a maximum amount set forth on the note. The amount of the insurance, however, will be only to the extent of advances approved during the construction process. The Department has decided to delegate to HFAs the responsibilities for the insurance of advances and cost certification functions. These functions are relevant to the insurance process and are carried out by HUD in full insurance programs under the National Housing Act.
