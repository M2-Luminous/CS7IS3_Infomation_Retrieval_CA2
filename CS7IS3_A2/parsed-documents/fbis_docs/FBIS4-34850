"No one will ever obtain authorization to emigrate through violence and the violation of Cuban and international laws," the newspaper, mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, reiterated. This Friday, the official newspaper reported the "unconditional" departure of eight persons who entered the Chilean Consulate on 15 June and demanded permission to leave the island. The eight occupants, six men, one woman, and a 12-year-old boy, left the mission at 1730 (2130 GMT) on Thursday in two official Chilean Consulate vehicles, a source at the mission stated. A Chilean consulate source explained that none of the people occupying the South American mission in Havana had ever been charged with any criminal offense, and their stay in the mission took place without incident. GRANMA also pointed out that 53 of the Cubans who decided to enter the residence of Belgian Ambassador Paul Vermeirsch on 28 May had changed their minds about "their illegal and irresponsible conduct" and have "returned to their daily lives." An official spokesman said that "21 persons who occupied the German Embassy on 13 June remain inside, while 72 Cubans remain inside the Belgian mission." Ambassador Vermiersch's home and the German mission are two blocks from each other and are located in the diplomatic district of Miramar, as is the Chilean Consulate. The streets leading to the two diplomatic missions remain closed to vehicles and pedestrians, except for neighbors. Dozens of uniformed police officers and state security agents dressed in civilian clothes provide permanent security throughout the area. GRANMA also said that the Cuban Government has given "every assurance to representatives of the parties involved to solve the problem." "We reiterate: Future incidents of this type can be prevented only with energy, intelligence, and serenity," the official daily concludes.
