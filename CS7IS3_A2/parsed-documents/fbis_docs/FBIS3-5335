"This was something we expected (North Korea to do)," Chang Chae-yong, director-general of American Affairs at the Foreign Ministry, said in reaction. "We don't feel the need to say anything about it. We have to wait and see," Chang said. North Korean first Vice Foreign Minister Kang Sok-chu said the envoy exchange is not part of the agreed preconditions for the high-level talks, slated for March 21 in Geneva. Seoul, Pyongyang and Washington announced a set of joint measures this week after North Korea allowed entry by a team of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors. But Washington made a separate announcement that while the date for the high-level negotiations has been set, successful IAEA inspections and an inter-Korean presidential envoy exchange are two prerequisites. "North Korea agreed that Washington would make this separate announcement," Chang said.
