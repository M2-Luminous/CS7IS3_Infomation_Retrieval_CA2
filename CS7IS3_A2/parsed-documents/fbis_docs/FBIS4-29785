The negotiations in Pyongyang and Phnom Penh have failed, and therefore, national reconciliation have not materialized. Both sides will continue to wage a war. The government side will try to suppress and seize the Khmer Rouge-held territory, while the Khmer Rouge will try to keep what it has. The situation after the latest round of negotiation appears to be increasingly tense, as the Cambodian Government ordered the closure of the Khmer Rouge liaison office in Phnom Penh and eviction of the office personnel. The government said the safety of the personnel is at risk from possible attacks by indignant Cambodians. The Khmer Rouge's Khieu Samphan was once physically attacked by an angry mob in Phnom Penh. The fact is that a majority of the Cambodian people despise the Khmer Rouge for the murders it committed and troubles it caused them during its 1975-1979 rule. The Khmer Rouge and its foreign allies must accept this fact and understand the feelings of the Cambodian people. It is not unusual that a majority of the international community have determinedly refused to accept the Khmer Rouge apology. Moreover, the U.S. support is a factor that contributes to the Cambodian Government's increasingly aggressive position toward the Khmer Rouge. The United States has sent military advisers to train Cambodian Government soldiers. Certainly, military hardware is also given to the Phnom Penh government. The U.S. assistance has strengthened the Phnom Penh government's military position. In the meantime, the Khmer Rouge's military position is likely to weaken as time passes due to the absence of support of the majority of the population. In such a situation, the tendency is that there will be intense fighting as the Phnom Penh government steps up its drastic suppression of the Khmer Rouge to seize its territory with the aid of the United States and its Western allies. For Thailand, there will be repercussions from the war in the forms of stray shells and influx of fleeing Cambodians. The Thai Government will have to formulate measures to prevent suspicion of the international community about its support of the Khmer Rouge. There are people who continue to refuse to understand Thailand, as evidenced by the imagination of the former U.S. ambassador to Thailand regarding Thai support of the Khmer Rouge.
