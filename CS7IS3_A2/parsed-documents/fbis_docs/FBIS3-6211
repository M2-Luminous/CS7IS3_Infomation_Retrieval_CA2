The investigation is focusing on how their real estate holdings have changed since the last property registration early last year, committee officials said. To carry out its work, the committee obtained real estate registers from the Home and Construction Ministries and the National Tax Administration. The committee has also asked banks and other financial institutions to provide financial data related to 120 to 130 civil servants who registered no change in their financial assets, though they are considered to have made asset changes. Examination of the financial data will start early next month when the committee obtains the data, an official said. The investigation will be completed toward the end of May, and those civil servants found to have falsely registered propertychanges will face punishment including dismissal and fines of up to 20 million won.
