FBIS4-37125 "drnes117_n_94004" FBIS-NES-94-117 Daily Report 16 Jun 1994 LEBANON Cabinet Briefed on U.S., Syrian Stands Cabinet Briefed on U.S., Syrian Stands NC1606142694 Cairo MENA in Arabic 1345 GMT 16 Jun 94 NC1606142694 Cairo MENA Arabic BFN [Text] Beirut, 16 Jun (MENA)--Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz revealed that the United States has conveyed to Lebanon the U.S. "clarifications" about what is happening on the Jordanian-Israeli track in which it stressed that Washington does not regard this action as a deviation from Madrid's Middle East peace conference mechanism but sees it as an aspect of it. He said that these clarifications emphasized that no agreement has been signed between the Jordanian and Israeli sides. In a report he submitted to the Lebanese cabinet last night, Buwayz said that U.S. Ambassador in Lebanon Mark Hambley brought him these clarifications yesterday to have them conveyed to the Lebanese Government. The Lebanese foreign minister expressed his belief that the Jordanians' objective from this action is to lift the U.S. siege on the Gulf of al-'Aqabah and to obtain an economic and financial share in the economic agreement between the PLO and Israel which is required by the Gaza-Jericho agreement on Palestinian self-rule. President Ilyas al-Hirawi briefed the cabinet last night on the outcome of the Lebanese-Syrian summit talks that he held with President Hafiz al-Asad in Damascus the day before yesterday. Informed sources said that al-Hirawi unveiled a Syrian-Lebanese agreement to draw up a joint action plan to face the U.S. pressure that the two countries are expecting to be exerted on them in the next few weeks following the recent developments in the Jordanian-Israeli track. The sources added that al-Hirawi conveyed to al-Asad Lebanon's fears following reports that Syria and Israel might reach an agreement, leaving Lebanon to face Israel's political, security, and military pressures alone. They said that the Syrian president stressed to al-Hirawi that his country would not agree to peace and to withdrawal from the Golan before the fate of Lebanon's south and western al-Biqa' are decided. Al-Hirawi also told the cabinet that al-Asad stressed to him Syria's readiness to approve the mechanism for the Israeli withdrawal from the Golan within a period not to exceed six months after security and peace are achieved.
