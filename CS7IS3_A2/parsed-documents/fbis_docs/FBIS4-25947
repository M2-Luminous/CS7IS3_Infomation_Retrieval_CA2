The money had been paid to the author by a publishing company in Shandong to compensate for the loss of royalties resulting from copyright infringement of the book My Father Deng Xiaoping. Xu Yongguang, secretary general of the China Youth Fund, expressed his thanks to Xiao Rong, saying: When we put on a benefit performance in January this year, we made a point of fetching some children from Bose, who had received aid from Comrade Xiaoping, to report their study achievements at the Great Hall of the People to grandpa Deng Xiaoping. Xiao Rong said: The aided children in Bose wrote a letter to father in 1992, and he was very pleased to read it. Out of curiosity, she asked how the fund had determined that the donation had come from her father because it was made clear at the time of the donation that no name should be given and that it should be given in the name of "an old communist party member." Xiao asked with humor whether it was the comrades who presented the money who had "divulged the secret." Xu explained that they had been tightlipped and that the matter had been clarified only through inquiries in many quarters. Xiao Rong laughed and said: All of our family members are concerned about the Hope Project. Mother has made many donations to the Hope Project. At the beginning of this year, she received over 4,000 yuan in back pay, which she contributed to the Hope Project without disclosing her real name. At the dinner table, mother also frequently calls on other family members to contribute money to the Hope Project. When I made a donation this time, she repeatedly said "fine" and encouraged me to make more donations if there was such an opportunity. Xiao Rong praised the method of "one helping one" in the Hope Project, saying that it was so easy to supervise and so highly transparent that donors could set their minds at rest. Everybody is very much concerned about Comrade Xiaoping. Xiao Rong said: Father is 90 years old this year but he is not suffering from any illness [dan mei you bing 0141 3093 2589 4016] and he is in very good health.
