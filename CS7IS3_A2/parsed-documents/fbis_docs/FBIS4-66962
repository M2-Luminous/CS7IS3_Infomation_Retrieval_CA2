FBIS4-66962 "jptdd019__l94024" JPRS-TDD-94-019-L JPRS Narcotics 25 April 1994 LATIN AMERICA HAITI Police Chief Denies Allegations of Drug Ties Police Chief Denies Allegations of Drug Ties FL2504232394 Port-au-Prince Radio Metropole in French 1600 GMT 25 Apr 94 FL2504232394 Port-au-Prince Radio Metropole French BFN [Text] We talked about the testimony of a former drug dealer who had been questioned by the U.S. Senate, and who had implicated members of Haiti's military in the drug trafficking, including the chief of Police. Following is a defense from Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Michel Francois to those accusations. We read: On 28 October 1993, I publicly challenged Father Aristide or any of his supporters, foreign or national, to bring just one proof of the existence of any link between myself and illicit drug traffic. The allegations of drug dealer Gabriel Taboada, in prison for five years now and a witness in the service of U.S. agencies, reveal only two things: a blatant lack of imagination from the silent partners to this accususation which is, according to Beaumarchais, the last resort of cowards. Second point: the unbearable thoughtlessness with which the Haitian case is being treated in the United States. So far as I am concerned, the challenge remains complete. This was a note from Lt. Col. Michel Francois in reaction to accusations of drug trafficking.
