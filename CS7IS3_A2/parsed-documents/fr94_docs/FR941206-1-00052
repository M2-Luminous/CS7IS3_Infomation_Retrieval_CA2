FR941206-1-00052 FR941206-1-00007 If the exceedance cannot be attributed to any of the above explanations, the owner or operator must confer with the permitting authority to discuss the reasons for the increase in usage and to determine if there are practical and reasonable technology-based solutions for reducing the usage. If there are solutions, the owner or operator shall develop a plan to reduce usage of the pollutant to the extent feasible. If it is determined that there are no practical and reasonable solutions, the facility would take no further action. If, after November 1998, a facility uses a VHAP of potential concern for which a baseline level of usage has not been previously established, than the baseline level would be equivalent to the de minimus level, based on 70 year exposure levels and data provided in the proposed rulemaking pursuant to section 112(g) of the Clean Air Act, for that pollutant. As described in Table 4, the Work Practice Implementation Plan, including the I&M program, operator training program, solvent accounting system, and formulation assessment plan, must be written by the owner or operator and maintained onsite. C. Compliance and Monitoring Requirements 1. Compliance Dates The compliance date for existing sources subject to this rule that emit 45.4 Mg (50 tons) or more of HAP per year is November 21, 1997. The compliance date for existing sources subject to this rule that emit less than 45.4 Mg (50 tons) of HAP per year is 3 years after the effective date of the rule. Existing area sources that become major sources are required to comply within 1 year after becoming a major source. Once an area source becomes a major source and thus subject to the regulation, a subsequent decrease in emissions does not allow the source to be exempt from the standards (even if emissions are decreased to below the major source criteria cutoff). New area sources that become major sources are subject to new source MACT immediately upon becoming a major source. Owners or operators of new sources that commence construction after the standards are proposed but before the standards are promulgated will have to comply immediately upon startup, unless the promulgated regulation is more stringent than the proposed regulation. In accordance with section 112(i)(2) of the Act, if the promulgated standards are more stringent than the proposed standards, the compliance date for sources that commence construction after proposal but before promulgation will be 3 years after the promulgation date, provided the owner or operator complies with the standards as proposed until the compliance date. All other new sources will have to comply with the proposed standards immediately upon startup. 2. Compliance Methods Sources must demonstrate compliance with the emission limits identified in Table 3 and the work practice standards in Table 4. A source must first demonstrate initial compliance and then continuous compliance with the standards. A summary of both the initial and continuous compliance methods is provided in Table 5. Compliance provisions are specified for the emission limits and for the work practice standards. For all sources, the results of the initial compliance are reported with the initial compliance report required by ยง63.9(h) and ยง63.807(b). Sources using compliant materials to comply with the proposed rule document their continuous compliance status through semiannual reports required by ยง63.807(c). Sources using control devices to comply with the proposed rule document their continuous compliance status through semiannual reports required by ยง63.10(e). Other reporting and recordkeeping requirements are summarized in section III.D. Section 114(a)(3) of the amended CAA requires enhanced monitoring and compliance certifications of all major stationary sources. The annual compliance certifications certify whether compliance has been continuous or intermittent. Enhanced monitoring shall be capable of detecting deviations from each applicable emission limitation or standard with sufficient representativeness, accuracy, precision, reliability, frequency and timeliness to determine if compliance is continuous during a reporting period. The monitoring in this regulation satisfies the requirements of enhanced monitoring.
