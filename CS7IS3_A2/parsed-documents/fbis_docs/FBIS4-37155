FBIS4-37155 "drnes117dd_94007" FBIS-NES-94-117 Daily Report 16 Jun 1994 Palestinian Affairs Sha'th on Released Detainees, Economic Projects Sha'th on Released Detainees, Economic Projects NC1606200794 Jerusalem AL-QUDS in Arabic 16 Jun 94 pp 1, 23 NC1606200794 Jerusalem AL-QUDS Arabic BFN [Text] Gaza, from Jamal al-Halabi and Nidal al-Mughrabi--Dr. Nabil Sha'th has stated that the detainees have the right to be fully liberated, regardless of their places of residence or their political affiliations. He stressed that the basic conditions we have accepted are: 1. That the prisoner abide by the PLO commitments. 2. That those convicted of civil crimes be handed over to the Palestinian authority so as to continue their imprisonment or to keep them under the Palestinian authority's supervision. He added: Anything other than this would be an Israeli violation of the agreement and we will struggle to rectify it. Reacting to reports about the formation of a new security liaison committee and the changing of the security liaison committee that signed the Gaza agreement on the detainees, Dr. Sha'th said: Major General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya will head the Palestinian side in the higher "Palestinian-Israeli" security committee because he had the same job in the Gaza-Jericho negotiations and knows all the agreement's details. Brig. Gen. Ziyad al-Atrash is a Palestinian military and security asset and we need him in all the security positions. He added: There is a problem with the Israeli side on whether the West Bank prisoners will go to their houses or will be confined within the Palestinian authority's areas after their liberation. We do not want hundreds of people to feel that they are in Jericho which cannot provide houses. We refuse to deprive the released detainees from returning to their families. We are struggling to solve this problem. Dr. Nabil Sha'th said: Anyone who carries the Gaza-Jericho identity card has the right to enter the West Bank. Any person who carries the West Bank identity card has the right to enter Gaza and Jericho. Banning any person from doing so would be an Israeli security violation of the spirit of the agreement. Israel has the right to grant its citizens entry visas to the Palestinian authority's areas and we have the right to grant entry visas to Israel and the West Bank. The Palestinian official went on to say that programs for the infrastructure and public utilities have been drawn up and that around half of the international aid will be allocated to housing. There are plans for tourist, agricultural, and industrial projects. Palestinian investors will be the source of Palestinian economic growth. They will bring tourist and commercial projects that will earn profits but will also benefit the homeland. Our role is to provide the necessary facilities for them. He added: There is talk about a comprehensive project for cleaning Gaza after one month and that will employ around 15,000 workers for three months. All the aftereffects of the occupation and the piles of garbage will be removed during that period. I am seeking to collect aid to finance this project, which will be similar to the one in Rafah which is financed by the EC. He said: An international airport will be built. The first flights from it are agreed on and will not need permits: Gaza-Jericho and Gaza-Cairo. Other routes need permits. Dr. Sha'th denied reports that the Palestinian president will be coming today. He said that the Palestinian authority will be informed of his date of arrival at least three days before that date.
