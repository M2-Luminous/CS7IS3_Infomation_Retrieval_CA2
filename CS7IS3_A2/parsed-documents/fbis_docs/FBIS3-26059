So-called becoming very mean and operating in a barbaric way refers to the situation in which some foreign businessmen do not care about China's laws and regulations, do not respect workers, and do not go through formalities when hiring workers; they beat and swear at workers, treat them badly, embezzle their wages and own them remuneration, and let them work in poor working conditions. Recently, a Taiwan-funded footwear company with limited liability in Songgang, Baoan District, Shenzhen, has been sanctioned for violation of the relevant regulations in China. According to information, each month, the company deducted from every worker 20 yuan of deposit money, and 11 yuan of management fee, but it did not refund the money to the workers 16 months after the agreed upon time. The average overtime work of a worker is 150 hours every month, but the overtime pay is only 1 yuan per hour. What is particularly mean is that workers are not allowed to go out of the door of the factory during daytime, or to visit one another; they are not allowed to talk when eating meals, and those who break the rule will be fined 30-50 yuan. When they come to work or leave the workplace, or when they enter and leave their dormitories, or when they go to the canteen, there are fixed routes for them to walk, and once they trespass over the line, they will be fined or asked to stand for a period. The incidents of beating and swearing at workers have often happened. An electric worker whose name is Zhou was suspected of stealing by a responsible person of the company, and although no evidence against him has not found, Zhou has been beaten and his head bled. After an investigation, the Shenzhen City's Labor Bureau and the trade union have sanctioned the company. In January this year, in just 10 days or so, Shenzhen City's Labor Bureau received over 160 complaint letters sent by workers, and met 370 people who came to complain. The complaints mainly involved wages and project remunerations not paid by bosses to workers, resignation allowances not paid to workers after they resigned, security deposits the workers paid at the time they were hired by factories were not paid back to them, barbaric management, maltreatment of workers, and so on. Among all these phenomena, the phenomenon of outstanding payments to temporary workers is very serious. According to the statistics provided by Luowu District Labor Disputes Arbitration Office, in the district alone, the outstanding wages amount to more than 100,000 yuan.
