[Begin Ben-Eli'ezer recording] With all the problems that we had with Egypt, once President al-Sadat came to the parliament of Israel and made his declaration -- once he stated: No more war. -- I think he did 70 percent out of the problem [as heard]. He had convinced the Israeli people. If President al-Asad will do the same, maybe. He might be surprised and get maybe the same thing. [end recording] [passage omitted]
