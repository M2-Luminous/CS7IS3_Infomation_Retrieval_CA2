Meeting with his Spanish counterpart, Golhan said Turkey has been fighting against PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] activities for the past 10 years. He also noted that this party causes damage in Europe by carrying out arms and narcotics trade, and said: "Germany and France have banned the activities of this organization." The Turkish minister added: "We expect similar behavior from other countries. However, this is not done by certain neighbors, such as Greece. We have learned, through confessions by members of this organization, that certain people are trained in that country." Referring to the Cyprus issue, he stressed that Turkey supports a solution that would appease both sides.
