In this letter, he calls on Butrus-Ghali to increase and strengthen cooperation in the campaign against the threat of terrorism on the national, regional, and international levels on the basis of General Assembly Resolution 48/122 dated 28 August 1993. As a result of the terroristic action against innocent civilians by the Monafeqin grouplet on Monday, 20 June, when its members planted a bomb in a holy Islamic place on a day that was sacred, 26 pilgrims including many women, children, and old people were martyred and 170 were wounded. The reports and investigations by the experts and the documentary evidence on this heinous atrocity confirm that this act was part of a calculated program by the Monafeqin grouplet. The letter from Dr. Velayati to Butrus-Ghali stresses that it is the responsibility of all countries to fulfull their international commitments in a joint international effort to eradicate terrorism. They should not only condemn this inhuman and dastardly act, but should also explore the possibility that their official institutions, citizens, or their territories are being used by this terrorist organization for planning, financing, inciting, or supporting such crimes and should take effective and appropriate measures to prevent this. It is worth mentioning that unfortunately the adoption of a two-faced stance by some of the ostensible supporters of the political and international antiterrorist propaganda--with regard to the activities of the terroristic groups of the Monafeqin in their own countries--is considered responsible for creating conditions favorable for this grouplet's premeditated crimes. In addition, such countries do not honor their commitments to combat international threats and merely mouth these commitments for domestic consumption The bloody incident in Mashhad has undoubtedly proved to the whole world that, in order to attain its shameful and prurient objectives, the terroristic Monafeqin group has trampled on all ethical and international norms and does not have the slightest regard for divine or human values. The Muslim nation of Iran--by once again standing firm against such dastardly catastrophes--has proved that the cohesiveness of the Iranian nation can never be undermined and, that, with the awareness of the Iranian people, all the cursed plots of the foreigners and their mercenary agents will be neutralized.
