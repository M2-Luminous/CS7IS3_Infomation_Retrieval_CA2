This came during a meeting he held today with a delegation from the International Committee of the Athens International Conference on Solidarity With Iraq. The conference was held in Athens on 6-7 November 1993. His excellency added: What we should do as people -- as well as officials who are aware of their nation's objectives regarding human relations -- is to work as hard as we can to reach a sound level in terms of human ties and relations among nations. Addressing the chairman and members of the committee, his excellency, may God preserve him, said: The work you are undertaking is considered great by almighty God and by the people of the world, because you are truly democratic and because you want to see others enjoying what you yourselves are enjoying. He added: Meanwhile, the others -- those who speak about democracy and human rights -- kill and slaughter people and then continue to kill people by starving them.
