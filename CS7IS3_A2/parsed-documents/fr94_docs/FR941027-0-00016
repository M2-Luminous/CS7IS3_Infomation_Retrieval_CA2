FR941027-0-00016 FR941027-0-00008 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 672 [Docket No. 931199&hyph;4042; I.D. 102494A] Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is closing the directed fishery for Pacific ocean perch in the Eastern Regulatory Area of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the Pacific ocean perch total allowable catch (TAC) in this area. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), October 24, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, 907&hyph;586-7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672. In accordance with §672.20(c)(1)(ii)(B), the Pacific ocean perch TAC for the Eastern Regulatory Area was established by the final 1994 specifications of groundfish (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994) as 1,265 metric tons (mt). The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), established in accordance with §672.20(c)(2)(ii) a directed fishing allowance for Pacific ocean perch of 1,165 mt, with consideration that 100 mt would be taken as incidental catch in directed fishing for other species in this area. The Regional Director has determined that this directed fishing allowance has been reached. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Pacific ocean perch in the Eastern Regulatory Area effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., October 24, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at §672.20(g). Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR 672.20 and is exempt from review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: October 24, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
