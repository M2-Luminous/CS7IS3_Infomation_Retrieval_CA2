According to officials from the World Health Organization (WHO), the province, home to 26 nationalities, has reached the level of moderately developed countries in the field. Since Yunnan is located at an average sea-level of above 2,000 meters, the diversity in climate and natural environment resulted in spread of many epidemic disease like snail fever, malaria, leprosy and goiter. In 1930s, a plague hit Simao region, killing tens of thousands of people at this important material port in Southeast Asia. Thanks to undertakings to improve medical and health conditions after New China was founded, epidemic diseases have been so far brought under strict control. The Ministry of Public Health reported that infectious incidence rate has seen a dramatic drop in the past 12 years. Only four out of 10,000 catch such diseases as goiter, malaria and leprosy in some prefectures. Among the country's border provinces, Yunnan has become the first with 85 percent of the population meeting vaccination requirements set by WHO. More than half of its rural population of 32 million, including a large proportion who are ethnic people, now have access to clean water. So far, the province has 6,500 hospitals, over 130,000 medical professionals and practitioners and 82,000 hospital beds, respectively 67-fold, 135-fold and 134-fold more than in 1950. And a medical network throughout its 127 counties helps the province keep an eye on epidemic diseases. Despite the great progress, it is not easy for the province to achieve the goal of every resident enjoying health care at the end of this century, as medical education is difficult to reach its mountainous areas because of poor transportation.
