Presidents of Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia met in Litomysl, East Bohemia, on April 15-17. The Czech Republic's image abroad is not helped when the invitation to take part in a meeting like that is turned down by Premier Vaclav Klaus and Parliament Chairman Milan Uhde, and the Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec is not present, Holub said. Klaus excused himself on account of preparations for his trip to Latin America, Uhde said he was going to a meeting with members of the public in Velka Bites, South Moravia, which he said he had agreed on seven weeks before, and Zieleniec was leaving for Vietnam. Holub said the Realistic Bloc (including the Czech Social Democratic Party -- CSSD, the LSU, the Christian Social Union -- KSU and the Czech Womens' Union) expert group's criticism of the government foreign policy was right. "Without the presence of opposition representatives, the Foreign Policy Council cannot play its role of coordinating foreign policy," Holub said, adding that he was going to ask the Presidential Office for an explanation regarding the Litomysl meeting circumstances including the presence, or absence, of political representatives.
