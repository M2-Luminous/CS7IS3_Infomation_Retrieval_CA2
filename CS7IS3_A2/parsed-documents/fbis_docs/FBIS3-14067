They protested the steps taken by Israel in the wake of the massacre at the Cave of the Patriarchs and called on 'Arafat to quit the peace talks immediately. [passage omitted] The Hebron massacre has unified all the political factions in Hebron in their demand to station an international protection force in the territories and to evacuate all the Jewish settlers from Hebron. [passage omitted] Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, the deputy chairman of the Palestinian delegation, said that despite the pain felt over the Hebron massacre, the Palestinians should continue the negotiations with Israel. 'Urayqat's remarks elicited a furious reaction from the audience. [passage omitted] The steps taken by Israel immediately after the Hebron massacre, such as the establishment of the Shamgar Commission, are seen here as a predetermined farce. The only way to resolve the crisis, the participants said, is to redefine the concept of security in the territories so that it will cease to be the exclusive monopoly of the Jews.
