[Sha'th] We are in the final days before the signing of an agreement and before the beginning of the withdrawal and entry of the Palestinian police force. In these final days, there is much and continuous work that should be done by all committees, and we are working seriously on this. We are aware that in these final days we should complete the work so that implementation can begin. In fact, implementation has actually begun. A withdrawal has begun and this is clear to all our people everywhere. Deportees are returning to shoulder specific responsibilities within the upcoming Palestinian administration. Preparations are being made for the entry of the vanguards of the Palestinian police. God willing, we will complete preparations for implementing this agreement as soon as possible. [Menashe] Final question. Do you believe that the deployment of the Palestinian forces in the first stage should guarantee security for the Palestinian people in the territories after the departure of the Israeli forces? [Sha'th] Undoubtedly. First, the Palestinian forces will enter before the withdrawal of the Israeli forces. The Israeli forces will then withdraw, and the Palestinian forces will become fully responsible for security. [Menashe] When will the Palestinian forces be armed? [Sha'th] The Palestinian forces will be armed upon their entry, but their security responsibility will begin when the Israeli forces withdraw. [Menashe] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, thank you very much.
