Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says the moves will drive the situation on the Korean peninsula to the extreme pitch of strain. This indicates that the United States intends to escalate threat to the DPRK and, furthermore, commit a military adventure, the analyst says, and continues: In staging the Rimpac manoeuvres with our Republic as the target of attack, the United States pursues the criminal scheme to facilitate the combat actions of the "multinational forces" against the DPRK in "case of emergency" on the Korean peninsula. It is intensifying the reactionary offensive to stifle our Republic with strength under the pretext of "nuclear suspicion against the North" and even openly crying for "a preemptive strike" at it. It is as clear as noonday that the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets have taken the criminal road of carrying into practice the already worked out "New Operation Plan 5027", a war scenario against the North. We are following with heightened vigilance the reckless moves of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets to unleash a nuclear war against our Republic at any cost. War is by no means what we want. If the South Korean puppets think they will get scot-free after provoking a nuclear war against fellow countrymen, in league with foreign forces, it is the height of folly.
