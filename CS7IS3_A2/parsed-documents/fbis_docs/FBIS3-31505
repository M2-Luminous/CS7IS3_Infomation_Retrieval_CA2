A special Sejm subcommittee has been working on the draft since December 1993. The penal chamber of the Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that parliamentary immunity relates not only to the operation of a deputy in the Sejm and its committees but also to his/her activity outside the chamber if it falls in line with parliamentary functions. The ruling may be essential for the final dropping of a trial of leader of Centre Alliance (PC) Jaroslaw Kaczynski charged with violating state secrets in 1992 while revealing an instruction of the State Protection Office (UOP).
