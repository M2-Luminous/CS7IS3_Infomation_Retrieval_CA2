His approach to the problem turned out to be somewhat nontraditional. Are We Poor? Or Perhaps Not So Poor? According to Professor Laird's calculations, with the average wage at the end of 1993 it was possible to buy 83 percent of what could have been acquired for similar wages in 1985. But in general at the end of last year Russians had about 90 percent of their 1985 income. But this overall, quite pleasant picture was significantly adjusted by the figures that characterize social stratification. The difference between the "average" and that 10 percent of the population who occupy the lower rung of the income ladder is growing. While in 1991 the latter had 52 percent of the average income, by the end of 1993 they were left with only 40 percent. At the same time, in Mr. Laird's opinion, this spread in the incomes is comparable to the degree of stratification that is observed in Great Britain. And another curious tendency: In 1993 we managed to reduce the proportion of Russians living in poverty. The Reasons for Inequality: Discovery Laird Style The London professor thinks that the reasons for the stratification in Russia are the difference in earnings and the nonpayment of wages. He categorically disagrees with the widespread opinion in Russia that the poor system of social protection of the underprivileged also contributes to this. Here are Mr. Laird's thoughts. The pension? But the ratio between the average pension and the average wage last year was the same as in 1985. And 12 percent higher than in 1992. Stipends for children? There is no doubt that this is the most important element in the system of social protection. Since there are more Russian children in poverty than Russian pensioners. But by the end of last year this indicator was higher than in 1985. True, the situation deteriorated this January. As a result of the indexation of the minimum wage conducted in December, the amounts of stipends relative to wages decreased. And now they are somewhere around the level of world standards. Unemployment compensation? It is indeed low. But it is quite comparable to our minimum wage. And it amounts to approximately 10 percent of the average wage. Undoubtedly it is less than the unemployment compensation in any other country of the world. But our level of unemployment is not high--1.4 percent of the entire work force. Incidentally, the professor categorically disagrees with the idea that the actual level of unemployment in Russia is much higher than the official one. According to his figures, we have an increase in the number of people employed in the financial sphere, the system of social protection, and trade. Moreover, last year many enterprises tried to avoid mass firing. They did this for two reasons. First, out of social considerations. Second, it was advantageous for the managers to keep many workers but pay them little. Since high taxes are imposed on high earnings. A Unique Way of Fighting Unemployment? Quite possibly, thinks Mr. Laird. This method consists in that the people do not lose their final connection with the enterprise until they have a new job. They go on unpaid or partially paid leave and work a partial work week. To be sure, the London professor does not agree with the assessments of this phenomenon made by certain Russian researchers. Here is what he says: "I decided to verify the following assertion: `During the past 10 months, 5 percent of the workers were on partially paid leave.' And what did I find out? This leave lasted an average of 23 days a year. But this means that a total of only 0.7 percent of the work force was on this kind of leave during the year. This figure is not very large." In the opinion of the Englishman, the Russian "humane"--as he christened it--means of fighting unemployment will be effective only when a personnel retraining system is in place. But up to now very little has been done in Russia to prepare people for new occupations. This is the circumstance that Richard Laird considers to be "the greatest failure of the reforms."
