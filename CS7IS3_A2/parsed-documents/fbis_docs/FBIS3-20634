This is the first contract for foreign cooperation in petroleum exploration and development in the Tarim Basin, and the first contract reached through open bidding for petroleum cooperation on the China mainland. Wang Tao, president of the China National Petroleum and Natural Gas Corporation, said the signing of the Tarim petroleum contract by China, the U.S. and Japan not only represents the new era for the input of foreign funds and technology into the exploration and development of petroleum in Tarim, but it also signals the arrival of a new era for the Chinese petroleum industry and of fully opening up to the outside world. State Council Vice Premier Zou Jiahua, and Tomur Dawamat, Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, attended the signing ceremony. Before the ceremony, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua and Vice Chairman Tomur Dawamat met with the three representatives who signed the contract. The area of the southwestern Tarim Basin scheduled for foreign cooperative development is located within the boundary of Qiemo County in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and covers an area of 14,475.4 square kilometers. This February, with the approval of the State Council, the southwestern part of the Tarim Basin was designated a new area for expanding foreign cooperation in petroleum development on the China mainland. Public bidding began on 1 March, and 68 corporations from 17 countries responded with bids, some of whom made on-site inspections of the subject area. By the end of October, the various bidding organizations had delivered their bids and planning documents to the China National Petroleum and Natural Gas Corporation. After careful consideration the U.S. corporation was the first organization invited for contract negotiations, and an agreement was reached after numerous discussions. It is understood that the form of the contract signed on 20 December is consistent with the terms used in all Chinese offshore and mainland cooperative endeavors. During the eight-year prospecting period, the foreign parties will bear all prospecting expenses and risks, and when oil and gas fields are found, both parties will jointly fund development and production, and will divide the crude oil produced in accordance with the stipulations of the contract. China will observe the international market price structure, and use U.S. dollars to buy the oil apportioned to the foreign participants that is taken from the Tarim area. This will dispel any misgivings the foreign interests may have about shipping crude oil out of that area.
