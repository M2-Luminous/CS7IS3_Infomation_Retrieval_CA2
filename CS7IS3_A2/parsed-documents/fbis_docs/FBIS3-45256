Deputy director Chang Hsiu-lien of the Finance Ministry's Bureau of Monetary Affairs said at a public hearing in the Legislative Yuan that the ban is in accordance with the initial stage of the Guidelines for National Unification. Chang, however, said that a written evaluation on the feasibility of allowing private banks to set up branches in a third country is expected to be finished at the end of the year. Chang made the remarks in response to growing demands by private bank officials to be allowed to set up on the mainland. The officials argue that increased cross-Taiwan Strait trade is making such service necessary. Chang also said there is growing resistance in Mainland China to the establishment of Taiwan banks there. He said the mainland authorities are worried the Taiwan banks are more competitive than their mainland counterparts. His statement was contradicted by a Friday report in the Hong Kong WEN WEI PO which said Beijing authorities in charge of Taiwan affairs have decided to allow the opening of Taiwan-invested banks in the mainland. The Beijing-backed paper reported that the Beijing officials also decided to hold a national conference this spring to review progress in economic and trade exchanges with Taiwan and are mulling the formation of a State Council task force to coordinate Taiwan economic and trade policy. The decision were reportedly made at a recent meeting attended by the heads of Beijing Central Government departments in charge of Taiwan affairs.
