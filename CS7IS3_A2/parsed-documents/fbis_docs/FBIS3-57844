Cetin also said that during the meetings he will have on 20 January with the British and German foreign ministers, he will ask for the release of European Union funds to Turkey, something that Greece has blocked in the past few years. Referring to the Cyprus issue, Cetin stressed that it is up to Greece to support and encourage the timetable for the negotiations. Replying to Cetin's remarks, Greek Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos stressed that the invasion of Cyprus by Turkish forces and the continuing occupation of 40 percent of the island's territory, the virtual disappearance of the Greek minority from Istanbul and the promotion of Turkish demands against Greece are neither imaginary nor a fantasy. They constitute historical experience, he said. The government spokesman concluded by saying that the Turkish leadership should realize that contact with Europe depends on respect for international law, human rights and the principles of the state of justice, which are basic elements of European civilization.
