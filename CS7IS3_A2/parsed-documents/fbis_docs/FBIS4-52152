Kanda told a news conference that the coalition government "cannot avoid discussing the Constitution...but I would rather say Japan should act in accordance with the current constitutional interpretation." Shortly after assuming the post of state minister for defense late last month, Kanda said Japan needs to apply a more flexible interpretation to the Constitution regarding the exercise of collective security arrangements. Political sources said Kanda might have withdrawn the earlier remark out of respect to the No. 2 opposition party, the Social Democratic Party, which quit the coalition last month and opposed Kanda's proposal to revise the constitutional interpretation.
