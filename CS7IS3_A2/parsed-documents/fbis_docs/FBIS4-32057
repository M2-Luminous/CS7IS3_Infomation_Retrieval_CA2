Nedzad Leko reports: [Leko] After three-hour-long talks, only Charles Redman addressed the journalists, and said the following: [Redman] "I took advantage of my visit to continue our consultations on a number of issues facing Bosnia today -- both political and economic -- and the reconstruction of Sarajevo and other parts of the country. This evening I am going to Zagreb where I will have a meeting with Mr. Akashi, President Tudjman, and members of the Croatian Government. I will spend several more days in Europe to continue consultations because we all believe that this is an important moment to continue working toward a more stable, and, we hope, lasting peace. The negotiations are very difficult, but we are working hard, and will continue to do that. You will probably see me here in Sarajevo again soon." [Leko] Asked whether the maps on which the contact group worked over the past two days in London were discussed at the meeting, Charles Redman said: [Redman] "I am not here in that capacity. These issues are obviously always very interesting and important. However, I am here for bilateral U.S.-Bosnian relations [as heard], and not in the context of the contact group."
