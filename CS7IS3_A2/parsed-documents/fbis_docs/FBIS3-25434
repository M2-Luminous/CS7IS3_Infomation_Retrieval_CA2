This is an interesting question. First, it believes that Frelimo is not interested in elections being held in October, as scheduled. The reasons for thinking so? Afonso Dhlakama replied that the Frelimo Party "is making time to try and change its Marxist image." In his interview, the Renamo leader also reexamined the stance he defended at one stage, that the electoral process should be organized with the troops being confined. He explains that his views were poorly understood at the time. This is an interview in which Afonso Dhlakama tried to make himself understood... In your opinion, Mr. Afonso Dhlakama, why is the troop confinement process lagging behind? Is it or is it not a political problem? [Dhlakama] I am going to make a serious accusation. I do not think that Frelimo would like to participate in the October elections. To them, that will be much too early. [Santos] Do you think that Frelimo is not ready? [Dhlakama] Yes, I think that they are not ready. They have been caught by surprise. Frelimo needs more time to try and improve its image. [Santos] What image is that? [Dhlakama] Its Marxist image. The party has to change from a Marxist to a democratic party with new ideas. The problem is that it has only a short time in which to do so. Concerning the troop confinement process, they too are aware that, in terms of what we have agreed, elections cannot be held with two armies still in place. Both the Mozambican people and the international community want only one unified army by the time elections are held... [Santos] But, Mr. Dhlakama, you once defended the view that elections should be held with the troops being confined.... [Dhlakama] I did not insist on that point. What happened was that I was misunderstood. What I said was: "given that Frelimo is complicating things and that Renamo wants elections by October, we could go to elections even with two armies." [Santos] And how would that leave the troops, in terms of command? [Dhlakama] Renamo has had and has now the capacity to tell its troops not to disturb the process. That was what I said and, because I am aware of the dangers, I never insisted on going to elections without the troops being confined. However, now I want to accuse Frelimo of resorting to tactics aimed at delaying the electoral process. They want to gain time. [Santos] Why would they want to do that? [Dhlakama] They know that there will be no elections in October unless the new army has been formed. And because there will be no elections in October, we will have to postpone. [sentence as published] Postpone to when? To November? The rains begin in November, so they will have to be moved to 1995. And when will they take place in 1995? In January? You still have rains then. It also rains in February, March, and April. Perhaps we will only have elections by May of next year. [Santos] So, Mr. Afonso Dhlakama, your opinion is that Frelimo only wants elections to be held next year? [Dhlakama] You can be sure about that. That is the way many Frelimo members want it, but that is extremely dangerous. Speaking as a Mozambican rather than as Renamo leader, I feel that that situation is extremely dangerous. [Santos] Why do you perceive it to be dangerous? [Dhlakama] We have already been warned by the international community that it will withdraw its observers because they cannot remain eternally involved in the UN Operations in Mozambique. What happens is that the money will run out. They have planned for everything to have been done by the end of October. By delaying things, they would have maximum certainty that the United Nations will pull out and there is bound to be confusion once there are no observers. I am afraid of such a situation and that is why I would like to call on my brethren in government to accelerate the confinement process. [Santos] And what about Renamo? [Dhlakama] I am ready. For instance, our General Mateus Ngonhamo will leave on Monday to inspect the assembly areas, to select 2,500 men for the new army and to see when the training of the 5,000 men will get under way. [Santos] That means, then, that Renamo already has men ready to join the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces, FADM? [Dhlakama] It has and that is no political propaganda, either. We are going to the assembly areas where more men have been confined. [Santos] Those men will be chosen to go to Nacala? [Dhlakama] I do not know where they will undergo their training. That is another problem. Frelimo is also delaying the rehabilitation of the training camps. Nothing has been done about that yet. Nothing, really nothing. That task has been turned over to the Mozambican Government. Immediately when we had signed the General Peace Accord, it became clear that the Mozambican Government would be responsible for rehabilitating the training centers. However, nothing has happened so far. We are going to apply pressure, the people are going to apply pressure, and the international community will also apply pressure because we do not want this to fail. For instance, we do not have the money to go to elections, but we have to go to elections. They are worth being held. [Santos] This trip (we were on the eve of his departure) you are about to make to South Africa, will it be to gather funds for the elections? [Dhlakama] No, absolutely not. This trip is part of routine visits to all neighboring countries. Last year, I went to Botswana and to Zambia. I am preparing visits to Namibia, Tanzania, and Swaziland. Now, this visit to South Africa is very important because it occurs shortly before that country is due to hold its first multiracial elections. [Santos] In concrete terms, what are you going to do in South Africa? [Dhlakama] I would like to hold talks with some opposition parties, with the most important party in South Africa -- that is the African National Congress, ANC -- so that the ANC gets to know Renamo better. In addition to that, I intend meeting South African businessmen. At this stage, there are many South African businessmen here, but they are only investing in favor of the government. As an opposition force, we do need to know who is investing in the country. So, I am going to hold talks with them to know what investments can be made in the future. So far, only the South African Government and Frelimo have participated in investment talks. This is why we want to come into the game now and learn what their policy is with regard to investments in our country. [Santos] Is that for them to invest in areas controlled by Renamo? [Dhlakama] Nothing like that. You must keep it mind that only a few months separate us from elections and that it would be pointless for the Renamo leader to be urging people to invest in Renamo-controlled areas now. The fact is that those areas are disappearing! [Santos] The advisers to the provincial governors have already been appointed. Will their appointments facilitate the administrative integration of Renamo-controlled areas? [Dhlakama] The famous list of provincial governor advisers has already been handed over, but they have not been sworn in yet. I think that as soon as President Chissano returns (the Mozambican head of state was in Switzerland, at the time), they will be sworn in and they will be able to start working with the governors, thereby making it easier for the provincial governors to get acquainted with statistics and with probems in their provinces. So, Renamo is no longer interested in asking for investments for its areas. Our interest is to talk with them, to learn how they plan to invest in the future, in a country that is already democratic. [Santos] Mr. Afonso Dhlakama: going back to the issue of elections, how much would your party have to participate in elections? [Dhlakama] I cannot say what the amount would be. I know that journalists complicate things a great deal.... The fact is, I cannot say how much, but it is not easy, nor is it good for Renamo to create the impression that we are begging for money. Renamo does not beg for money. In concrete terms, it asks for the means for the party to create its own infrastructure. By talking about money, we would be creating a poor image for ourselves. For instance, when I talk about the party's infrastructure, I mean I want houses, but if I have money, I can buy the keys and get houses. That is why either houses or money will do. Another example is that I would like the money to buy vehicles, but I cannot go about always asking for money. If a country makes available, for instance, 25 vehicles, 45 Land Rover vehicles, I shall say thank you very much, because that will be more than $1 million. What happens here is that we do not say so many millions of dollars, because then we would be confusing the international community and we would be creating a negative image for Renamo, which would then seem to be constantly begging for money. [Santos] That means, then, that Renamo is not asking for money? [Dhlakama] Renamo is not asking for money. Renamo is complaining about a lack of means to build infrastructure to allow the party to function. Now, someone could indeed give us money, somebody else could give us a typewriter, and somebody else could give us vehicles. [Santos] Could that be a reason for Renamo to delay the process: the lack of human and material means? In fact, a government official has said that Renamo is the one that is not ready and that it is looking for cadres. Is this true? [Dhlakama] How can Frelimo prove that, when I am stating here that I have more troops confined, even though my forces are facing terrible conditions? My soldiers have had to go 200, 150 km in terrible conditions, barefoot, through Mozambique's jungle, to reach their assembly areas. That fact is obvious proof that they want elections held this year. Who does not want the troops to be confined? It is the government! The government is confining its forces in villages. Its forces only have to move some 500 meters. It is near their barracks. When the government says that it does not have the means to take its troops to the assembly areas, any child promptly realizes that that is not a valid argument. It is nothing. If Frelimo wanted to do so, it could confine 30,000 men in their assembly areas in 24 hours. [Santos] Was nothing planned concerning the movement of Renamo troops to their assembly areas? [Dhlakama] No, that had not been planned or discussed before, but it was generally said that Unomoz would make transportation available -- but there you have it, our troops are going on foot. Nevertheless, the most important thing is that they are arriving at their assembly areas. I would like to touch again on that issue of Renamo drafting cadres. The fact is, there is nobody that is not looking for cadres. Frelimo itself is drafting cadres! We are seeing new faces in the Frelimo Party, they are being sworn in. Yet that should not be an impediment to elections. We were already drafting cadres when we were still in the bush. Frelimo itself may have been in power for 18 years, but it is still changing ministers and it grabbing people who complete their university studies. It is not just Renamo that is doing so. Everybody is doing it. [Santos] Does Renamo have enough cadres to fill the seats that it may eventually have in Parliament? [Dhlakama] Renamo has enough cadres at this stage to be candidates in the Assembly and, should Renamo win the upcoming elections, it has already organized people to participate in government.
