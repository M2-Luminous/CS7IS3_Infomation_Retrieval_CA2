The Accord for Russia opposition movement will hold a meeting of its National Council in Moscow on Saturday. Rutskoy stressed that the opposition should be careful not to let one more candidate from the present regime to take the highest post. That is why the opposition needs a single candidate. Rutskoy said that each of the party leaders believed that he must be elected the president. Rutskoy himself said that he does not especially seek the presidency and that any candidacy should be put forward taking into consideration the interests of the cause. Rutskoy suggested that a tough politician must take this post since the present situation in the country required rule with no compromise, consensus or games with the law. Rutskoy said nothing would be changed in the country as long as Boris Yeltsin remained in power. Neither a government of national confidence, nor a new composition of the parliament will change the situation. It must go through radical changes, Rutskoy affirmed. Rutskoy said he was ready to lead the united opposition.
