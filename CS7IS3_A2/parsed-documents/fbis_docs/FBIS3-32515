Deputy Monde called those who spread such information irresponsible and, according to him, do so for the purpose of sabotaging the parliament's current work. Frantz Robert Monde also explains to Radio Metropole that at this phase of the negotiations and discussions, it is a question of finding a modus operandi for obtaining suspension of the sanctions: [Begin recording] Personally, I denounced this irresponsible action from the person who stated during the CARENA conference that we went to Washington to choose Larosiliere. I think it is a low, cowardly, untimely blow, not coming from a responsible man. In this vein, I assure that lunatic that it is out of question to have Larosiliere or any other person as prime minister right now. We never discussed that. It comes only from his fertile imagination. "Our first objective is a truce that will allow parliament to vote for a prime minister without the sword of Damocles, the embargo, hanging over our heads. They give us the truce; then we take a position regarding the choice of a prime minister. It is not during this tour... [changes thought] We came to have our points of view heard, to demonstrate how the Haitian people are suffering from the embargo. We did not come to attack this person or that person, but we are asking that Haitians listen to us, understand us, so we may soon find a solution, not the solution of this person or that person, or my solution. Rather it will be a concerted solution from all the concerned elements, the protagonists, the Army -- we told them [not further identified] we are very close to the Army, there is nothing to hide." So far, it has been very constructive. We have had several meetings. First we met with the National Freedom Institute, which invited us. We met with Walter Fautroy. We were very touched by him. Walter Fautroy wept over the fate of Haiti and supported us on the idea of a truce, a temporary lifting of the embargo, a suspension of the sanctions to allow the interested sectors to formulate a concerted strategy. We met on 7 February at the State Department -- Pezzullo, Caputo, and some American technicians from the State Department working on the Haitian case. Until now, we have tried to emphasize our point of view as deputies. Normally, the choice of a prime minister would not be of interest to us right now, since he will probably meet the same fate as Malval, or even worse. What we are interested in is not to negotiate with a knife at our throat. It is out of question for me to meet with President Aristide or discuss the choice of a prime minister. We are adamant on that. I do not know where this information comes from. They are people who are showing off, who wish to be actors, who are playing roles. I am furious when I hear that while we are here making every effort, many sacrifices, to propose a solution, those men, in their little heads, vent their noxious minds. Those men have extreme reactions. They wish to sabotage our efforts. They are not serious. I think that the person who made that statement can now take his group, install someone in the National Palace, and make the decisions on the lifting of the embargo. [end recording]
