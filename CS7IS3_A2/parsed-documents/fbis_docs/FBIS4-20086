[passage omitted] After their meeting with Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Ozdem Sanberk, Clark said that mutual lack of trust remains the main problem in Cyprus. He pointed out that in the meeting, they discussed various points relating to the confidence-building measures [CBM's]. He said: One of the points was what specific advantages the Turkish Cypriot side can be given to balance the specific advantage the Greek Cypriots will get when they are allowed to resettle in Maras [Varosha]. Naturally, these advantages cannot be realized without an agreement. In turn, Sanberk said that they exchanged views on the CBM's. He pointed out that he explained to Clark that the amendments made to the original version of the CBM's -- the one to which the Turkish Cypriots had agreed in principle -- substantially changed the basic spirit and parameters of the package. Sanberk went on to say that Clark expressed his views and briefed the Turkish side on the contacts he has held on the issue.
