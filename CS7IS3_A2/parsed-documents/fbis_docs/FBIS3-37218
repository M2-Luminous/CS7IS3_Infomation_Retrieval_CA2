"I think this might inflict psychological damage to this diplomatic initiative," Kostikov told Interfax on Tuesday. "The concept of this program has not been explained or understood fully," he went on to say, "many may perceive air strikes on the Serb positions by the NATO forces, in which the U.S. plays the leading role, as the implementation of this project. Given this, the operation might be viewed as the false start of the American initiative." Kostikov also said that it was in the United States' and Russia's common interests to find a political solution to the Bosnia conflict.
