What we need are tax reforms and a channeling of all taxes through certain groups to prevent the country from going further into debt, Figueres said. He also said that the agriculture and livestock sector would be strengthened, and negotiations with Mexico on the free trade treaty would be analyzed. If the country's producers derive no advantage from the treaty it would not be signed. Let us listen to the statements made by Engineer Jose Maria Figueres, president-elect of our country. [Begin recording] [Figueres] It is a technical matter and it will be up to the economic team to define what specific actions will be carried out, but I can tell you we are interested in solving the fiscal deficit problem. A high fiscal deficit is not beneficial for the economy, the Costa Rican people, the productive sector, or any one else. Therefore, I think we will all be working on that task. This has to do a lot with [words indistinct] where we have to be more efficient in collecting taxes. This also deals with the expenditures; we have to be more austere, more careful in the appropriation of public resources. [Madrigal] On the subject of sales tax, the current administration increased it 3 percent even though it was always at 10 percent. Now it is again 10 percent as was normal. Do you think your administration will adjust that tax? [Figueres] I do not think the country needs a new tax package. I think the country certainly needs tax reforms in which we have four or five kinds of taxes instead of having more than 100 taxes. Also, those taxes should be easy to calculate, easy to collect, and they should be easily and efficiently controlled. Furthermore, those who have more should pay more, and those who have less should pay less. In that sense, we are interested in progressive taxes, rather than regressive taxes, because those who have more pay more taxes. Definitely, due to the current administration's a lack of a clear policy to encourage the agricultural and livestock sector, we have seen a considerable decline in cattle herds. Furthermore, the numbers indicate that Costa Rica is on the verge of going from being a meat exporting country to a meat importing country, but we will be working very closely with the country's cattle sector. The policies we will define to reactivate the cattle sector will be worked out with this country's cattlemen; and there will be policies to give priority to credit, productivity, and efficiency in the handling of cattle herds so this tendency may be reversed. [Madrigal] Regarding the free trade treaty with Mexico, Costa Rica carried out a negotiation but it closed the chapter on agricultural issues without really negotiating anything because no basic product was included. What would your position be if you were to take office and the treaty were still unsigned? Would you continue to give priority to the agricultural segment? Would you not sign that treaty with Mexico? [Figueres] Well, we have said that we are interested in continuing negotiations on the treaty with Mexico. We are interested because it would open new markets for our export products. However, we have also made it clear that those treaties must be negotiated, on the Costa Rican side, by a team that is made up of government people and people from the productive sector. If the production sector is not satisfied, does not agree with, or does not feel comfortable with the agreement, then it will not be useful to us. In that sense, if nothing has been signed with Mexico when we take office, we would continue to work hand in hand with the nation's producers, in the industrial as well as the agricultural fields, to see what kind of treaty we sign with Mexico. [end recording] The tour Jose Maria Figueres Olsen was scheduled to begin in a few days has been rescheduled, because issues such as the creation of the commission that will organize the transfer of power, as well as the creation of the Figueres administration cabinet that will be sworn in on 8 May, shall be analyzed this week.
