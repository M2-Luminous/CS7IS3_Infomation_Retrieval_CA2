FR940203-1-00031 FR940203-1-00005 3. In §11.6, the title, the introductory sentence of paragraph (a), and paragraph (i), are revised, and the cross-reference at the end of the section is removed, to read as follows: §11.6 Exemption of State and municipal licensees and exemptees. (a) Bases for exemption. A State or municipal licensee or exemptee may claim total or partial exemption from the assessment of annual charges upon one or more of the following grounds: * * * * * (i) Application for exemption. Applications for exemption from payment of annual charges shall be signed by an authorized executive officer or chief accounting officer of the licensee or exemptee and verified under oath. An original and three copies of such application shall be filed with the Commission within the time allowed (by §11.28) for the payment of the annual charges. If the licensee or exemptee, within the time allowed for the payment of the annual charges, files notice that it intends to file an application for exemption, an additional period of 30 days is allowed within which to complete and file the application for exemption. The filing of an application for exemption does not by itself alleviate the requirement to pay the annual charges, nor does it exonerate the licensee or exemptee from the assessment of penalties under §11.21. If a bill for annual charges becomes payable after an application for an exemption has been filed and while the application is still pending for decision, the bill may be paid under protest and subject to refund. 4. Section 11.20 is revised to read as follows: §11.20 Time for payment. Annual charges must be paid no later than 30 days after rendition of a bill by the Commission. If the licensee or exemptee believes that the bill is incorrect, no later than 30 days after its rendition the licensee or exemptee may file an appeal of the bill with the Chief Financial Officer. No later than 30 days after the date of issuance of the Chief Financial Officer's decision on the appeal, the licensee or exemptee may file a request for rehearing of that decision pursuant to §385.713 of this chapter. In the event that a timely appeal to the Chief Financial Officer or a timely request to the Commission for rehearing is filed, the payment of the bill may be made under protest, and subject to refund pending the outcome of the appeal or rehearing. PART 381_FEES 5. The authority citation for Part 381 continues to read as follows: Authority: 15 U.S.C. 717&hyph;717w; 16 U.S.C. 791&hyph;828c, 2601&hyph;2645; 31 U.S.C. 9701; 42 U.S.C. 7101&hyph;7352; and 49 U.S.C. 1&hyph;27. §381.601 [Removed] 6. Section 381.601 is removed, and subpart F is reserved. Appendix A Note: This Appendix will not be published in the Code of Federal Regulations. The table in Appendix A shows illustrative annual charges for representative municipal and non-municipal licensees and exemptees. It is based on the regulatory scheme described in the Alternative A regulatory text at the end of the NOPR. Thus, the table is based on allocation of all of the annual charges among a single class of licensees and exemptees, including all major and minor municipal and non-municipal licensees and all exemptees. The allocation is based solely on the respective capacity of each hydropower project as measured in kilowatts, with a minimum charge of $100 and a maximum charge of two percent of the total of all charges. Assessments would not commence prior to the commencement of project construction. Finally, the table reflects the charges as they would become due over a three-year phase-in period.
