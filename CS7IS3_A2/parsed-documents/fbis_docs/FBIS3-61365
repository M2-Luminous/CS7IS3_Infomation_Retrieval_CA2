[Oliynyk] Mr. Stoyan, could you tell us how the branches of government reacted to the recent protest actions by the trade unions? [Stoyan] Let me remind you that these protest actions lasted for an entire week. They took the form of meetings, picketing the state administrative offices of the presidential representatives in various localities, and collecting signatures in opposition to the government's anti-social policy. At the same time, we were endeavoring to find a compromise with the government side. And such a meeting did take place. The government delegation was headed up by Acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, while our side was led by members of the Federation of Trade Unions Presidium and by leaders of those trade-union associations which do not belong to our Federation. We set forth 11 specific demands. After a lengthy and difficult discussion during the ensuing week, the Cabinet of Ministers issued several responses. One of them proposed that a joint investigation be made--together with the trade unions--as to who had actually raised the prices. For the state had announced a two- or three-fold price hike, whereas, in fact, they rose three-, five- and even eight-fold. Working groups were also created. In addition to this, the government sent commissions to 10 Ukrainian cities; thanks to their work, prices were lowered by 20-25 percent in some oblasts. We pushed our demands with regard to stabilizing production. One of the demands, which we had not succeeded in implementing for an entire year--and which consisted of revoking the penalty fines for overdrawing the consumption fund--was likewise met. In parallel fashion we worked with deputies of the Supreme Council. In the first place, we found a common language with them. Whereas measures regarding stabilization of the socioeconomic situation in Ukraine were listened to attentively, a certain person proposed that this information be taken into account and the session continued. However, most of the deputies listened closely to the telegram from the FPU [Federation of Ukrainian Trade Unions] concerning our decisive actions, along with telegrams from the localities which had been sent by the trade-union organizations. And under such pressure the Supreme Council set up and approved a commission. Because of the week's summaries of this commission's work and under pressure from the grass roots, the Supreme Council adopted the Decree "On Measures To Stabilize the Socioeconomic Situation in Ukraine." [Oliynyk] As far as we know, this December decree by the Supreme Council encompassed all the demands made by the FPU. If that is so, is this the first serious victory by the FPU or--to put it more precisely--for those who are at or below the poverty level? [Stoyan] Inasmuch as the Supreme Council's Decree is a law for the Cabinet of Ministers, the latter must now carry out its obligations in this regard. Among other things, such obligations include the following: exempt enterprises and other institutions from the need to pay penalty fines for exceeding the consumption fund; revoke the telegram sent by the Cabinet of Ministers with regard to prohibiting banks from issuing any kinds of credits; work out a mechanism for aiding citizens in straitened circumstances. The matter of the government--together with the trade unions and the state administrations in the localities--introducing normative distribution of foodstuffs for the most harshly affected levels of the population is being looked into. Therefore, it can be said that the protests by the FPU and other trade unions have, for the first time, brought about a victory with regard to people's social protection. [Oliynyk] Mr. Stoyan, what is your prognosis with regard to the strike activities at Ukrainian enterprises? [Stoyan] The FPU is not calling for a strike. We are proceeding along a different path, a path of pressure, talks, and negotiations--a path of working together with all levels of the state power structure. A strike is being called for by the Ukrainian Free Trade Unions. But everybody understands that their demands are unrealistic. Judge for yourselves: They are demanding wages which would raise the standard of living, but they do not want to think about where the money is to come from. They are threatening to stir up the people to strike on 18 January! Moreover, they are making the following political demands: resignation of the government, a new prime minister, and even resignation of the president. I don't know whether they will be able to rouse people by such slogans. People are already fed up with politics; what they really want is a real piece of bread. Therefore, I am quite convinced that this is just one more bluff on the part of those trade unions which pay no attention to reality, but merely call for strikes. [Oliynyk] Let's imagine that this "bluff"--as you call it--does indeed take place. Would the percentage of strikers be large? [Stoyan] In my opinion, this percentage would be very small. Well now, there could be a certain number of miners; there could also be some transport workers and airline dispatchers. That is to say, such strikers would include those workers who belong to the Ukrainian Free Trade Unions. This would be quite a small percentage of the total. But I would not want even such a strike to take place because it is no longer our goal to tear down the state. We would do better to think about cooperating with it. Incidentally, our demands were not for the purpose of tearing down the state, but instead we were working to improve production. Nor were we striving to extract subsidies--of which there are no longer any sources in any case. Even if such a strike were to take place, it would not have any influence. It could be only a political type of strike, a political game on the eve of the upcoming elections.
