Jose Cresencio Diaz, a 54-year old Salvadoran who worked as a security guard for U.S. Major Ismael Lopez, was killed on 21 January and Lopez was involved in the crime. Melara Granillo said the U.S. diplomatic mission hid the weapons reportedly used by Lopez, who, according to reports from the prosecutor's office, was transferred to one of the U.S. bases in Panama. The U.S. Embassy argued Lopez had diplomatic immunity in order to refuse delivering the evidence to Salvadoran authorities, and therefore he was transferred from the country without having to go through the legal Salvadoran immigration procedures. The attorney general noted: "The right thing to do would have been for the embassy to notify local authorities of this and to have held him in custody according to the law." Meanwhile, National Civilian Police Director Jose Maria Monterrey said the diplomats want to misconstrue immunity with impunity. Salvadoran authorities did not rule out the possibility of requesting the U.S. military officer's extradition through the Salvadoran Foreign Ministry.
