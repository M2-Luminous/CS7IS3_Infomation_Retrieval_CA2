Republic President Sherig-ool Oorzhak said this on Tuesday during the festive ceremony of the signing of the Public Accord Treaty. This document was signed by representatives of all authorities, political parties--including the Communist Party--all public associations, and all religious persuasions. The president addressed the fact that certain forces in the republic--first of all the nationalists--are still disputing the lawfulness of this decision made 50 years ago on the pretext that it was made by a narrow circle of leaders. Having voted at the December 1993 referendum in favor of the republic's Constitution-- which regards the republic as an integral part of Russia--Tuva's multiethnic people thus legitimized the 1944 decision. In the president's view, the Public Accord Treaty plays a similar role today.
