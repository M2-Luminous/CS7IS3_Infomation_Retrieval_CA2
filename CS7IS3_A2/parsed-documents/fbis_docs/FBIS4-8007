Last night they reached the river Drina near Vitkovici, 4 kilometers south of Gorazde. According to a statement of the command of the united Serb forces, the last Muslim units are being driven out of the Oglecevo area, which consists of a dozen villages, and it is only a question of time before the area is completely liberated. "The continuing operation in the Cajnice-Foca-Gorazde triangle is of immense importance for the people in that area because it creates conditions for the Serbs to achieve their centuries-old right to live on the river Drina," Colonel Nikola Segrt, member of the command of the united Serb forces, said this morning. Following a brief lull last night, fierce infantry and artillery battles resumed today in almost all sections of the Gorazde front. In the fighting yesterday, one Herzegovina corps fighter, Miodrag Budjen from Trebinje, was killed and four members of the Serb forces were wounded. According to the command of the joint Serb units, over 50 members of the forces loyal to Alija Izetbegovic were killed in the battles yesterday; 12 bodies were found in the vicinity of Uhotica Brdo alone. According to Serb fighters, cries of women and children were heard overnight from Vitkovici. It is believed that the Muslims are in the process of liquidating the remaining Serbs from Gorzade or are forcing them to serve as a shield in their onslaughts on the Herzegovina corps positions.
