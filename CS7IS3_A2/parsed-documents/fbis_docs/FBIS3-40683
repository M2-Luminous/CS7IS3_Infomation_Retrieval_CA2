The 400-page document that has emerged is the most comprehensive, and easily the most controversial, that has ever been negotiated under the aegis of GATT. On the surface, the negotiations were about the seemingly simple issue of reducing barriers to international trade and stimulating global economic growth through greater trade. But in practice, they were about a frantic scramble for new markets by the world's leading economies. The United States, Europe and lately Japan, mired in their worst recession for a decade, needed a new round of tariff cuts and opening up of export markets to stimulate their economies. The Uruguay Round was the instrument through which this was to be achieved. Throughout the session, the virtues of free trade and the all-round stimulus to growth that would result from trade liberalisation were stressed repeatedly. The rich and the poor, the developed and the developing, would all benefit from the liberalisation of world trade, everyone from the GATT Director-General down repeatedly insisted. Studies by organisations such as the World Bank and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that showed a $217-230 billion increase in global income as a result of the Uruguay Round were widely publicised. But there was a big gap between the negotiating strategies of the big powers and their devotion to free trade. Both the United States and the European Community (E.C.) fought like alley cats for most of the seven-year period to preserve their own markets while opening up the other's. While the theory of comparative advantage was meant to provide the economic rationale for the benefits that would flow from trade liberalisation, in practice the behaviour of the United States and the E.C. was based more on mercantilist principles. Both sides did their best to keep their own markets closed in areas where they felt they were weak, while trying hard to open up the other's markets in areas were they felt they were strong. In other words, they were extremely keen on exporting more, but reluctant to import more. The question of trade in agriculture, which bedevilled the negotiations until the very end, proved a case in point. The United States, which is a comparatively more efficient agricultural producer than the E.C., was determined to open up the protected European market for agricultural products, and also ensure reductions in the E.C.'s subsidised farm exports. This would ensure U.S. farmers a greater market share in both the E.C. and in third countries where a cut in E.C. export subsidies would give U.S. products an advantage. The E.C., fearing that thousands of its farmers would be forced to leave the land, fought back. Eventually, the Europeans were forced to yield despite significant opposition from France. However, the U.S. behaviour in the area of textiles was quite different. Here, under pressure from its powerful textile lobby, the United States did whatever it could to keep its market as protected as possible. India was one of the prominent victims of the tough U.S. line. The U.S. and the E.C. members had campaigned to preserve the Multi-Fibre Agreement (MFA) which sets quotas on developing country textile exports to these countries. The Uruguay Round agreement sets a 10-year transition period at the end of which the MFA is to be wound up and the trade in textiles freed from quota restrictions. The United States had threatened to try and extend the MFA phase-out period to 15 years, while India was trying to get the speed at which quota restrictions would be lifted quickened. Textiles form a quarter of India's manufactured exports, and perhaps the only tangible benefit from the round will be an eventual unfettered access to developed country markets for Indian textiles. The showdown between India and the United States occurred on December 14, the day before the Uruguay Round was completed. The U.S. Trade Representative, Mickey Kantor, met the Indian Ambassador to GATT, B.K. Zutshi, and demanded that India open up its textile market to U.S. imports, failing which the United States would put in an amendment to the Uruguay Round draft slowing the speed at which Indian textiles would be able to enter the U.S. market. This was a blatantly unfair demand which went against a basic GATT principle of not bargaining for concessions within the same sector. Thus, in return for opening up its markets to Indian textiles, the United States was justified in asking India to open up its markets in some other area, such as machine tools or electronics. But asking for concessions within the same sector is not done, since among other things it goes against the basic principle of trade based on comparative advantage. To its credit, the Government of India stood firm. Pakistan was the only other country targeted by the United States, and both countries presented a united front to the United States and the E.C. in a night-long bargaining session that ended at 3 a.m. Both India and Pakistan refused to accept any slowing down of the speed at which MFA restrictions are lifted. The United States finally backed down, perhaps one of the few occasions in these negotiations when it did so. As the negotiations came to a close, the developed countries made it clear they had got a worse deal than the developing countries. In return for vast concessions in areas such as services and intellectual property, they felt they had not got enough in terms of access for their products into Western markets. But it was also clear that the U.S. juggernaut had been unstoppable, and that once the United States and the E.C. patched up their differences and acted together, there was little the rest of the world could do. The long-term impact of the Uruguay Round will take a long time to be felt and judged. Many of its provisions will only come into effect in five to 10 years' time and it is only then that one would really be able to tell what its effect on the global economy will be. However, it is useful to have an understanding of the main provisions: Reduction of industrial tariffs: Participants have agreed on an average cut of between 30 and 40 per cent in tariffs or the import duties they levy on goods. The world's main trading countries have also agreed to scrap import duties in a number of areas such as pharmaceuticals, construction equipment, furniture, beer, wood, paper and toys. Indian exporters of these products to the E.C. and the United States should benefit. India has offered a trade-weighted average cut of around 50 per cent on its tariffs on raw materials, intermediates and capital goods, but no changes in the area of consumer goods imports. Services: The Uruguay Round has included services for the first time in GATT trade negotiations. It provides for the basic GATT principles of most-favoured-nation (MFN) treatment, though it also allows exceptions to this rule. Though the basic rules of trade in services have been set out, concrete market-opening negotiations have met with little success. Thus, in areas such as financial services, telecommunications, maritime services and the movement of personnel, negotiations will continue to determine the level of access to foreign markets. In other areas such as construction and tourism there has been a fair deal of progress. India is primarily interested in getting a good agreement on the movement of personnel, which will allow Indian professionals to travel freely to the developed world to provide services on a short-term basis. India has made offers in the area of construction and value-added telecommunications. An offer on financial services was withdrawn after the United States decided it was going to adopt a "two-tier approach" on financial services. The West was interested in getting access to the Indian insurance market, but this has not been granted. Agriculture: This is a major area of controversy between the United States, the E.C. and several agriculture-exporting countries such as Australia and Argentina. The agreement is intended to reduce the level of subsidies the United States and the E.C. pay to their farmers and also cut back on subsidised food exports. The aim is to benefit more efficient agriculture producers, including several in the developing countries. Under the agreement, certain types of farm subsidies are to be reduced by 20 per cent over six years, while export subsidies are to be cut by 36 per cent over the same period. It also calls for the opening up of a minimum of 3 per cent of the domestic market to imports. As for India, its level of subsidies is below the 10 per cent cut-off level. As far as the import commitment is concerned, the Government plans to take recourse to GATT provisions that allow countries with balance of payments problems to impose import restrictions. There were also potential problems in the text relating to Indian stockpiles of food for the public distribution system which have apparently been resolved. Intellectual property: For India, this has been the most controversial aspect of the Uruguay Round. Intellectual property was bulldozed into it by the United States where there has been a large outcry about the "piracy of intellectual property." Until 1989, India refused to discuss the issue and then abruptly changed its stance. Under the current agreement, the Indian Patent Act of 1970 will have to be amended to introduce product patents for food, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. This will involve changes in the way certain sections of the Indian pharmaceutical industry operate. Under the current patent regime, Indian manufacturers have been free to produce drugs patented abroad by using a different process. This will change now, and a rise in the prices of certain drugs are predicted. It is, however, also useful to note that with this change, the Indian patent system reverts to its pre-1970 status, where products and processes were patented. The Uruguay Round agreement will also oblige India to provide intellectual property protection to new plant varieties and will make microorganisms patentable, two areas which have justifiably aroused a great deal of passion. However, the rights of farmers and breeders to use and re-use patented seed material is not threatened, since governments too have the power the build in adequate safeguards.[sentence as printed] Creation of a new trade organisation: A World Trade Organisation (WTO) has been created to replace the existing GATT Secretariat in Geneva and administer the Uruguay Round agreements. In many ways, this is more than 40 years overdue. When GATT was signed in 1947, it was intended that an International Trade Organisation (ITO) would be created. A charter was drawn up, but due to U.S. opposition it never got off the ground. The United States finally gave assent to the creation of a new organisation. Stronger multilateral trade rules and better dispute settlement: One of the gains to countries like India from a stronger multilateral organisation could be that unilateral trade action by the United States and other giants of world trade will be curbed. While Section 301 will remain in the United States statute books, it cannot be used in areas which come under the Uruguay Round. Any dispute under the Uruguay Round agreements will have to go through the multilateral dispute settlement procedures. Textiles: Textile and clothing exports into the developed countries are restricted by quotas set under the MFA. Textile exporters such as India have struggled to get the MFA restrictions removed as quickly as possible, but have run into stiff opposition from the United States and European textile lobbies. The MFA will be wound up in 10 years' time from 1995. Its quotas will gradually be lifted over this period, but the lifting will be so gradual that its impact will only be felt at the end of the 10-year period.
