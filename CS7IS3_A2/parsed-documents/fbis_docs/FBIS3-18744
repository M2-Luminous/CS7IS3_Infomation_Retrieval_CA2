The Academy Will Get Money To Pay Top Experts Studying Reindustrialization"] [Text] The supplementary budget bill presented by the government on Friday [4 February] is intended to speed up public investments mainly. For the most part they are transportation projects. Employment promotion and research appropriations are added. There is only a small portion in this supplementary budget for measures to speed up private investments. They are intended to accelerate primarily through tax relief and investment assistance that have not yet been budgeted. The idea is that the relief will be received this year, in particular by the projects starting at the beginning of the year. The final amount of the supplementary budget is over 1.7 billion markkas, but paying for it will require only a little over 700 million in new loans. The remainder will be collected as additional income from business establishments, among other things. The supplementary budget will raise the expenditures budgeted for the current year to 195.2 billion markkas and the new borrowing requirement to 69 billion markkas. Almost a Billion for Transportation Routes The government is proposing 455 million markkas for road work. With the money, work will begin on a freeway between Hameenlinna and Iitala, road work between Jyvaskyla-Etu-Palokka and Imatra-Kaukopaa, as well as the Iisalmi bypass, the Raippaluoto bridge, and the Miukki interchange in Tornio. In addition road work between Paimio-Turku, Oulu-Ii, Benbole-Vanhakartano, and Matinkyla-Helsinki will be speeded up. About 20 smaller maintenance sites will be started in various parts of the country. Railroad improvements will be speeded up by 400 million markkas including the sectors between Helsinki and Turku and Helsinki and Seinajoki. Railroad yards will be repaired in Niirala, Vainikkala, and Kouvola. The Board of Navigation will receive 40 million markkas for repairing the Rauma channel. Construction of the Vaasa courthouse will be speeded up, and the Glosholm coast guard station, the Kajaani barracks of the border guard, the Mikkeli technical institute, and the Joensuu forestry center will receive additional repair money. Since the highway and rail work map did not satisfy the Center Party ministers in particular, it was decided to propose money also for investments in areas with the worst unemployment. The Labor Ministry will receive 310 million markkas and substantially more authority to grant government assistance for local government investments that improve the prerequisites for industry as well as the state's own employment-creating projects. Top Researchers for the Academy The government proposes 55 million markkas more as assistance for renewable energy investments and energy conservation. Appropriations this year will be 175 million markkas. Additional money is also proposed for establishment costs for the local governments' social and health services. The Board of the Finnish Academy proposes an appropriation of 60 million markkas for reindustrialization and research on it. The money is intended to be used to hire 30 top researchers and their assistants for a period of two years to do research in the interests of reindustrialization. The institutions of higher learning will be given money for hiring 300 recent graduates as research assistants. It is proposed that 22 million markkas be allocated for publicizing the European Union question. Of this amount 10 million will be distributed to organizations for promoting publicity and the remainder to the Foreign Ministry's Europe information office.
