FR940825-0-00050 FR940825-0-00013 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Patent and Trademark Office 37 CFR Part 1 [Docket No. 940415&hyph;4212] RIN 0651&hyph;AA68 Revision of Patent Fees AGENCY: Patent and Trademark Office, Commerce. ACTION: Notice of final rulemaking and lifting of suspension. SUMMARY: The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) is amending the rules of practice in patent cases, Part 1 of title 37, Code of Federal Regulations, to adjust certain patent fee amounts to reflect fluctuations in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and to recover costs of operation. The PTO also is providing notice that, beginning on October 1, 1994, the suspension of the fee for access to the Automated Patent System's Full Text Search capability (APS-Text) at a Patent and Trademark Depository Library (PTDL) will be lifted. However, the PTO is rescinding this hourly fee, which was established by 37 CFR 1.21(p), and in its place assessing an annual subscription fee on PTDLs providing such service. On October 1, 1994, the PTO also will begin collecting a fee for access to the Automated Patent System's Classified Search and Image Retrieval capability (APS&hyph;CSIR) from the search facilities in Arlington, Virginia. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert Kopson by telephone at (703) 305&hyph;8510, fax at (703) 305&hyph;8525, or by mail marked to his attention and addressed to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, Washington, DC 20231. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This rule change is designed to adjust the PTO fees in accordance with the applicable provisions of title 35, United States Code, and section 10101 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;508), all as amended by the Patent and Trademark Office Authorization Act of 1991 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;204). There are two objectives of this final rule package. The first objective is to adjust certain patent fee amounts to reflect fluctuations in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and to recover costs of operation. The second objective is to provide notice that PTO is lifting the suspension on the fee for access to APS-Text at a Patent and Trademark Library (PTDL). This fee was established by rule on October 1, 1992 (published in the Federal Register on August 21, 1992 at 57 FR 38190). Collection of the fee was immediately suspended by the Commissioner to provide additional time for the PTO to solicit input from the private sector on alternative collection methods, and other options for accessing patent search and retrieval in the Libraries. In response to public comments, the PTO will rescind the fee established by 37 CFR 1.21(p), and assess a subscription fee under 37 CFR 1.21(k) on each PTDL that provides its patrons with access to APS-Text. The basis for the subscription amount is less than the fee amount that was established in 37 CFR 1.21(p). Each participating library will be responsible for establishing policies for providing access to their patrons. The PTO also will begin charging a fee for on-line access to APS&hyph;CSIR at the Patent Search and Image Retrieval Facility (PSIRF) in Arlington, Virginia. Free access to APS&hyph;CSIR has been offered at the PSIRF since July 12, 1993. The PTO now will begin recovering the cost of providing this on-line access in accordance with 37 CFR 1.21(k). The PTO will make any necessary adjustments to these automated system fees based upon actual fiscal year 1995 usage. Future adjustments will be made based upon deviations in system costs and/or public usage.
