This failure became clear at the conclusion of the fourth meeting of European and Latin American foreign ministers held this week in Sao Paulo. This may have been a test for the new world economic order outlined two weeks ago in Marrakech, Morocco -- after eight years of negotiations -- through a new global agreement on tariffs and the creation of a powerful institution called the World Trade Organization. Latin American diplomats came out of the Sao Paulo meeting less optimistic than before. It became clear to them, for instance, that trade between the EU and Latin America is bound to become increasingly dependent on each government's interpretation of the GATT agreements. It has resulted in greater uncertainty about the future of Latin American trade with Europe, which is its main trading partner after the United States. European imports of Latin American products have dropped nearly 40 percent since 1965 as protectionism continues to progress. Under Brazil's guidance, Latin American governments found out at the Sao Paulo meeting that the only thing they could do was lodge another protest against the growing social, environmental, and labor conditions some European countries are beginning to impose on purchases of Latin American products. The rich countries are in fact reaffirming their protectionist pressures, which are decisively contributing to undoing the optimistic scenario (for the poor) that was built around the new GATT agreement. In theory, the new GATT agreement is supposed to increase world trade by $270 billion annually from 1995 to 2005 and bring substantial benefits to Latin American countries, especially to Brazil. Reality is, however, distorting these expectations. Another hope was lost this week in Sao Paulo; that is, it would not be feasible in the short term for Latin American governments to exact commitments and broad guarantees from Europe that the inflow of investments in the region will increase. The idea of making Latin America gradually become a priority on the agenda of EU public investment policies was stimulated by the inflow of capital registered last year, when one-third of Europe's overall investments was made in the region. The Latin American diplomatic offensive in Sao Paulo was designed to obtain "major commitments" from the Europeans that they would increase their investments in the region in the short term and thus prevent the growing interest of investors in and the inflow of capital toward Africa, Asia, and East Europe. The Latin Americans have lost once again. They have made no major achievements. It is a crucial question to determine which direction the expansion of capitalism will take in the next few decades within the framework of a globalized economy. Asia remains a priority. Despite its tribal conflicts, Africa continues to be attractive because it remains highly profitable. It is not by mere coincidence that 90 South African companies are trading their stocks in London's stock exchange, 23 of them are trading in Paris, 16 of them are trading in Brussels, 12 in Frankfurt, and nine in Switzerland. East Europe is the area where the second stage of the EU's integration will take place. This does not mean that things will continue to be as they are now. It will be incumbent upon the skill of the Latin American governments to bring about changes in their relations with the EU. They have a promising market and can count on Europe's competitor -- the United States -- which is a potential ally in trade disputes with the European bloc. This poses a challenge to the political ability of foreign ministries such as that of Brazil.
