The official disclosed that Pyongyang has not taken part in any international athletic meetings this year. "Almost 10 international sports events have been held this year and it should have participated in at least seven, but it did not send any team," he said. He went on to say that North Korea did not send a team to the Winter Olympics held last February in Lillehammer, Norway. "North Korea applied for entry to the 11th Asia-Pacific Junior Ice Hockey Tournament held in Beijing last March, but it gave notification that it would not attend at the last minute, he said. "The deepening food and foreign currency shortages in North Korea are believed to be major reasons not to send its representative teams to athletic events overseas," he said. Last year, North Korea dispatched teams to more than 30 international events including the 16th Winter Universiad held in Poland, he added.
