Their children are dying by the hundreds, dozens of others are fleeing to Zaire, and secondary schools are engulfed in violence. The president is calling on everyone to return to reason, and Burundian Catholic bishops are appealing to the Christian conscience of their followers. But first of all, here is the head of state's address to the nation: [Begin Ntaryamira recording] Dear compatriots, it is almost unnecessary to remind you that the security problem has become a real headache for our government, and that the future of this country depends on solving it. As you know, the insecurity prevailing in our country since [words indistinct] assassination of the late President Ndadaye is being demonstrated by the mass destruction of property, houses, and human beings. Just as we thought that tragedy had ended, our dear country is once again experiencing a deadly folly, especially in Bujumbura, in the case of which the relevant departments have not yet informed us of the sinister death toll, the number of those mutilated and injured, or the amount of the damages. Nevertheless, we already know that the toll is very heavy. [passage omitted] Given the prevailing situation, it is not hard to believe that certain actors are not play acting, that they are talking with forked tongues and adopting dishonest and duplicitious behavior, which is likely to shake the confidence vested in them by the nation. Thus, it is urgent that all those who have adopted such behavior return to reason and immediately put an end to this criminal strategy in order for the country to recover its true face and return to the proper path. To all those fishing in troubled waters masterminding the current tragedy, I say: Enough, that is enough, enough is enough, and let this be the last warning. I take this occasion to call solemnly on every citizen of this country to come out of this trance, and to involve himself or herself resolutely in national reconciliation and in the reconstruction of the country. [passage omitted] On my part, I reiterate my solemn commitment to do everything I can to act decisively to reconcile all the Burundians. In this regard, I will assume all my responsibilities decisively to help our country return to the path of peace, unity, democracy, and development. I thank you. [end recording]
