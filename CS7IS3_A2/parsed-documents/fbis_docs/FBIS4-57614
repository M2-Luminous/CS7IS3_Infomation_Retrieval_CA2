Police sources reported today, Saturday, that the children were found in a home owned by U.S. citizen Sara Matzar in Pabnjachel in the northwestern department of Solola. The residence was searched following the issuing of a judicial order, and a woman identified as Martina Matzar Sapin, who was caring for the children and is related to Sara, was arrested. The children were identified as twins Joaquin and Rigoberto, five; Marcela Mercedes, three; and Eva Noelia Peron, five. Martina Matzar said the four children are Sara's adopted children. She is being held in a prison in the Guatemalan capital, accused of alleged drug trafficking. Her extradition has been requested by the U.S. Embassy. Police are investigating to determine the origin of the four children who, according to Martina Matzar, are from Santa Catarina Palopo, Solola. There have been two incidents in 1994 involving two U.S. citizens accused by Guatemalan residents of being child snatchers, although the charges turned out to be false. The U.S. Embassy has denied that its citizens are involved in the kidnapping of children.
