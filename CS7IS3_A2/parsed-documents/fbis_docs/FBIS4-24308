FBIS4-24308 "drafr125_e_94006" FBIS-AFR-94-125 Daily Report 28 Jun 1994 WEST AFRICA Senegal Police Ban Opposition Demonstration, Arrest 20 Police Ban Opposition Demonstration, Arrest 20 AB2806221094 London BBC World Service in English 1705 GMT 28 Jun 94 AB2806221094 London BBC World Service English BFN [From the "Focus on Africa" program] [Text] The Senegalese opposition are continuing to agitate for the release of party leaders Abdoulaye Wade and Landing Savane. Pressure has been building up since last week when two of Wade's colleagues, Mody Sy and Samuel Saar, went on hunger strike. They were detained in connection with the murder of the vice chairman of the Senegalese constitutional court, in the wake of last year's general elections which, Wade's party claims, were rigged. And today, there was trouble in Dakar when opposition supporters were banned from holding a rally. On the line, Chris Green asked Odile Bueret when happened: [Begin recording] [Bueret] You see, early this morning, armored vehicles took place at strategic crossroads of the Senegalese capital. Although Dakar police headquarters had forbidden Abdoulaye Wade's party to demonstrate as planned, the Senegalese authorities are really traumatized by the bloody events on 16 February when six policemen were killed by demonstrators, so they decided to have the police forces positioned throughout Dakar. According to the Senegalese Democratic Party [PDS]'s spokesman, Ousmane Ngom, since the demonstration had not been authorized, the PDS sent several MP's at the party's headquarters to tell militants that the demonstration had been called off. In the meantime, says Ousmane Ngom, 20 people were arrested including three MP's and several people were hurt. [Green] So, the MP's who were arrested had actually gone to try and stop the demonstration? [Bueret] That is right. [Green] Have you any information as to how the people got hurt. Was there fighting between the police and the demonstrators? [Bueret] I do not think they actually fought with the police, it's just, you know, there were so many people to be arrested that things happened. [Green] Do you know what happened to those who were arrested? [Bueret] Not yet. It is very difficult to get information and I think the PDS party is likely to give a press conference in a few hours, so we will know more in a few hours time. [Green] So, following today's events, what is the atmosphere like in Dakar tonight? [Bueret] Everything is very calm, you know. You can see [words indistinct], you can see armored vehicles all around Dakar, not many but just at strategic points of the capital. The only thing is the whole opposition is planning a demonstration on Friday [1 July] and it wants to join with the students, the unions, and it could be a big demonstration. Probably, again, this demonstration will be forbidden by the authorities but as you can see, all of people in the Senegal are now ready to demonstrate against what is happening in Dakar and the political situation with the main opposition leaders being incarcerated for four to five months without being judged for what they have been arrested.
