ACTION: Notice of Intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement on a mining Plan of Operations for Newmont Gold Company in Eureka and Elko Counties, Nevada; and notice of scoping period and public meetings. SUMMARY: Pursuant to section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and 43 CFR Part 3809, the Bureau of Land Management will be directing the preparation of an EIS to be prepared by a third-party contractor on the impacts of a proposed Plan of Operations for gold mining by Newmont Gold Company, in Eureka and Elko Counties, Nevada. The Bureau invites comments on the scope of the analysis. DATES: Scoping meetings will be held December 7, 1994, at the Bureau of Land Management, Elko District Office, 3900 E. Idaho, Elko Nevada, and on December 8, 1994, at the Holiday Inn, 1000 E. 6th St., Reno, Nevada, to identify issues and concerns to be addressed in the EIS. Both meetings are scheduled from 7:00&hyph;9:00 pm. Representatives of Newmont Gold Company will be available to answer questions about the Plan of Operations. Additional scoping meetings may be held as appropriate. Written comments on the Plan of Operations and the scope of the EIS will be accepted until January 3, 1995. A Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) is expected to be completed by the summer of 1995, and made available for public review and comment. At that time a Notice of Availability of the DEIS will be published in the Federal Register . The comment period on the DEIS will be 60 days from the date the Notice of Availability is published. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Scoping comments may be sent to: District Manager, Bureau of Land Management, P.O. Box 831, Elko, Nevada 89803. ATTN: Bootstrap EIS Coordinator. For additional information, write to the above address or call Deb McFarlane at (702) 753&hyph;0200. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Newmont Gold Company of Carlin, Nevada, has submitted a Plan of Operations to re-open their Bootstrap open pit mine and initiate mining at the Tara open pit mine, located 1,500 feet south of Bootstrap. The proposed mines and associated facilities are located in portions of Sections 2, 3, 10, 11, 14, and 15 of Township 36 North, Range 49 East, MDM; approximately 30 air miles northwest of Carlin, Nevada. Newmont developed the Bootstrap open pit mine in 1974, and the heap leach facility in 1977. Operations were conducted through 1984. Newmont performed closure and reclamation procedures on the leach facility during 1987 and 1988. The proposal is to re-open the Bootstrap pit and develop the new Tara pit, create two new waste dumps, develop a new heap leach facility, and reroute and upgrade the existing access and haulage roads. Following public notice and comment, Newmont acquired a permit from the Army Corp of Engineers to divert Boulder Creek around the planned mining activities. Diversion construction has commenced on private land and is expected to be completed in early 1995. Previous surface disturbance was to 121 acres of public land and 153 acres of private land. Part of the proposed operation would be confined to previously disturbed areas. Additional surface disturbance is anticipated on approximately 802 acres of public land and 288 acres of private land. The issues expected to be analyzed in the EIS include potential impacts to cultural resources, wildlife, pit water quality, air quality, soils, vegetation, hazardous materials, paleontology, and social and economic values. Cumulative impacts will also be addressed. In addition, the following resources will be analyzed: recreation and wilderness, geology, range management, lands and realty, visual resources, and land use planning. The analysis will be conducted by an interdisciplinary team. A range of alternatives (including but not limited to alternative reclamation measures and the no-action alternative) will be developed to address the issues. Mitigating measures will be considered to minimize environmental impacts and to assure that the proposed action does not result in undue or unnecessary degradation of public lands. Federal, state and local agencies and other individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the Bureau's decision on the Plan of Operations are invited to participate in the scoping process with respect to this environmental impact analysis. These entities and individuals are also invited to submit comments on the DEIS. It is important that those interested in the Plan of Operations participate in the scoping and commenting process. Comments should be as specific as possible. The tentative project schedule is as follows: Begin Public Comment Period_December 1994 Issuance of Draft Environmental Impact Statement_Summer of 1995 File Final Environmental Impact Statement_Winter of 1995/1996 Record of Decision_Winter of 1995/1996 Begin Construction of Operation_Spring of 1996 The Bureau of Land Management's scoping process for the EIS will include: (1) Identification of issues to be addressed; (2) Identification of viable alternatives; (3) Notification of interested groups, individuals and agencies so that additional information concerning these issues, or other additional issues, can be obtained.
