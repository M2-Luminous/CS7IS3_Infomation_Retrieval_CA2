The ideas that have emerged from the Telecommunications 2001 Berlin-Brandenburg land-level initiative have also been incorporated into the project, which is initially scheduled for conclusion at the end of 1997. It entails investments amounting to 8.1 billion German marks [DM], already budgeted in DBP Telekom's Eastern Expansion program. DBP Telekom has already invested DM6.6 billion in the greater Berlin area. Prestige Project for Germany's Capital Much has already been done in Berlin with a view to normalizing telecommunications, but a comparison with other world capitals still reveals a considerable shortfall. This is particularly so in view of the future telecommunications demands that will arise out of Berlin's pivotal position in central Europe, where it acts as a hinge between east and west, and out of its new role as Germany's capital and seat of parliament and government. Even now, greater Berlin, with its population of about 4.3 million, including 3.6 million in the immediate urban area, is already by far the greatest conurbation in Germany, larger than the Munich, Frankfurt, and Stuttgart districts. In view of this, DBP Telekom has decided to top up its "normal" Eastern Expansion program with an extra project going by the name of "Metropole Berlin-Brandenburg" to accelerate the expansion of telecommunications in the federal capital. Gerd Tenzer, a DBP Telekom board member, heads the board committee running the project. DBP Telekom wants to demonstrate its love of innovation and its efficiency first and foremost in Berlin. The conditions are all in its favor. It has about 15,000 employees in the city. In addition to operational units (directorates and telecommunications exchanges), Berlin is home to major sections of DBP Telekom's inhouse Research and Technology Center (FTZ), a data processing development center, a DBP Telekom technical training college, a management development center for managerial staff, and a number of subsidiaries -- e.g., DeTe Berkom, the German Trunk Cable Corporation (DFKG), and divisions of German Telepost Consulting (DeTeCon). DBP Telekom considers that the additional DM8.1 billion that it will invest up to the end of 1997 will be sufficient to implement the Metropole Berlin-Brandenburg project. Boom in Berlin and Brandenburg The economic structure of the Berlin-Brandenburg area will undergo profound changes in the near future: Manufacturing companies will increasingly tend to relocate to the outskirts, while service industries and administrations will concentrate to an even greater extent in the city center. The Berlin city planning authority expects about 200,000 new jobs to be created within the city boundaries alone. Berlin's status as capital city and seat of government and the new importance that this will bestow on the city as an economic center will also boost its population. The planning authorities in Berlin and Brandenburg expect a 1-million population increase over the next 10 to 15 years. This will bring the population of the Berlin-Brandenburg metropolis up to over 5 million and make it one of the largest conurbations in Europe and the world. A well-developed infrastructure is essential for a metropolis of this size, and, now more than ever before, this also means the telecommunications infrastructure. Berlin's should stand comparison with those of world-rank cities, such as Paris, London, or New York, i.e., meet international standards. The Metropole Berlin- Brandenburg project sets out to create just such an infrastructure in greater Berlin within the shortest possible time. This massive task cannot be performed using standard network tools. Berlin and Brandenburg are merging to form a single economic area. New telecommunications services are opening up considerable development potential for product quality, quantity, and cost- effectiveness in many branches of industry. New applications based on metropolitan area networks (MAN's), broadband communications, intelligent services, and mobile radio are providing opportunities for raising efficiency. Future investors in the Berlin-Brandenburg metropolis, be they the Federal Government, multinationals, or even small craft enterprises, will have access to a telecommunications infrastructure commensurate with their requirements. The Berlin- Brandenburg conurbation is on the way to becoming the German telecommunications industry's worldwide advertising poster. Digital Technology for Customer-Oriented Network Expansion Over the next few months, work on the project will focus on analyzing demand in the Berlin-Brandenburg metropolis as closely as possible. An initial assessment of potential for Berlin and the surrounding areas indicates that, over and above normal requirement projections, approximately 1 million extra telephone lines are likely to be required up to the turn of the century and as many as 1.4 million more by the end of the year 2010. Nowadays, one of the main parameters for evaluating the efficiency of a telecommunications network is its degree of digitization. In addition to accommodating new services, network digitization makes for efficient operation with low operating costs. Berlin is lagging way behind other conurbations in terms of digitization, so one of the keys to the success of the Metropole Berlin-Brandenburg project lies in speeding up the digitization process. New technologies such as Opal [optical line] (optical fiber systems in the subscriber line sphere), IN (intelligent networks), SDH (synchronous digital hierarchy), and ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) will also help minimize costs. The medium-term goal is to set up a broadband ISDN [integrated services digital network] with optical fiber cables and ATM switching systems for voice, data, and image transmission at high data rates. The introduction of multimedia applications means that broadband communication is acquiring increasing importance. Multimedia will substantially modify the forms in which business and system customers communicate. The relocation of the Federal Government to Berlin and the arrival in the area of branches of a multitude of major German and foreign companies will further raise requirements and demand in this field. Status of "Telecom 2000" Program Since German unification, 2 million telephone lines and over 35,000 data lines have been installed in the new federal laender. Investments to date, which amount to about DM25 billion, have secured 100,000 jobs in eastern Germany. Of this sum, DM6.6 billion went to greater Berlin, including DM4 billion for the city of Berlin itself. Overall, DBP Telekom intends to invest about DM60 billion under its Expansion East campaign by the end of 1997. A new telecommunications network has been created, for which the digital overlay network forms the skeleton and which is being fleshed out exclusively with the most advanced optical fiber technology. Approximately 4,500 km of optical fiber cables have been laid to date, making a total of 140,000 km of fibers. Over 35,000 data transmission lines have been provided specially for trade and industry. The service provided in the new federal laender will be sufficient to meet demand by the end of the current year. In the meantime, there are 92 telephones per 100 households in eastern Berlin. The density in the original federal laender averages out at 112 telephones per 100 households, whereas the average in the new laender is 57. DBP Telekom intends to invest heavily in expanding the telecommunications infrastructure in future years as well: According to the recently drawn-up medium-term budget for 1994-1998, about DM10 billion will be invested this year too, DM1.5 billion in Berlin and DM810 million in the surrounding area. Plans to the end of 1997 include the provision of about 3.5 million more telephone lines, just under 70,000 data lines, and about 2 million cable lines. The overall telecommunications service supply in eastern Germany will then be commensurate with demand. Broadband Communications Between Berlin and Bonn The Berkom [Berlin Communications] Bravo project, which centers on telecommunications for the parallel conduct of government business in Berlin and Bonn, has now reached the trial stage, under which broadband communication between the rivers Spree and Rhine is being tried out. The participants in this major multimedia field trial are the Federal Chancellery and the Federal Press Office, the ministries of Finance (BMF), Posts and Telecommunications (BMPT), and the Family and Senior Citizens (BMFuS), and the Trust Agency. The multimedia workstations installed in these agencies in Bonn and Berlin make it possible, for instance, to conduct videoconferences between one desk and another or to draft the same document together. This type of communication saves time and is effective. Especially since the decision to keep sections of the ministries and other bodies in Bonn even after the planned move to Berlin, an efficient information link between the two cities takes on crucial importance for the future. Based on Bravo, DBP Telekom has drawn up a comprehensive service strategy for a link of this type and submitted an offer to the Federal Minister of the Interior accordingly: The "Federal Agencies Network 2000" (BBN 2000). It fulfills two main requirements -- the distributed organizational units of the federal agencies must be united by telepresence and telecooperation facilities, and the agencies' employees must be accessible at any time from both inside and outside the BBN, if possible via a central phone number, regardless of their location. It is thus planned to bring the uppermost federal authorities in Berlin and Bonn together under a single, nationwide "area" code, thus creating a Federal Government local network. BBN 2000 is a corporate network tailored to the requirements of the Federal Government as "client.'' The service provides much more than an advanced optical fiber infrastructure between federal agencies in Berlin and Bonn: In addition to the network itself, the concept also incorporates the tele- and value- added services required for the information link and intelligent network features and services. Special network solutions of this type will acquire increasing importance in a metropolis like Berlin- Brandenburg.
