The government has expressed its support for privatizing Colombian Coal (CARBOCOL) and selling off its stock in the Cerromatoso nickel mine. According to Mines and Energy Minister Guido Nule Aming, as a result of the government reform of a year ago that led to the creation of the Colombian Coal Enterprise (ECOCARBON), CARBOCOL was left managing no more than Colombia's share of El Cerrejon. Furthermore, since it was capitalized, it is now on a sound footing. Nonetheless, the minister said that the enterprise is no more profitable because prices on the international coal market are far below initial projections. The government is therefore weighing the possibility of reorganizing the enterprise, hoping to bring in the private sector. "We have ordered a number of studies that are measuring all these possibilities on a national and world level. In my opinion, it would be very useful for us to privatize CARBOCOL totally. It is essentially a marketing activity in which the government has no reason to be involved." Concerning Cerromatoso, in which the Industrial Development Institute has an important interest, the minister said there is no justification for the involvement of the latter organization either. Nule presided over a meeting of the Urra, Inc. board of directors in Barranquilla that passed a budget totaling 48 billion pesos for 1994. The figure does not include any of the loans granted, the first of which would go to the Electric Corporation of the Atlantic Coast (CORELCA). Urra Manager Jose Camilo Manzur said this year's first goal involves social programs, the purchase of nationally owned lands, and the relocation of people, without neglecting other matters such as the signing of loan contracts and progress on civil engineering projects already under way. The government is bent on promoting the program to privatize several entities. The list will include such banks as the Bank of Colombia, the National Bank, and the People's Bank, and power plants such as the Betania Hydroelectric Plant. The Executive Branch believes it should allow the participation of the private sector in the activities in which it engages.
