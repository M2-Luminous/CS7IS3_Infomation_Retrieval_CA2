After two days of meetings, at 1230 yesterday, Paraguayan Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner, Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar Quiroga, and Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu Bonilla signed a joint declaration at the Foreign Ministry in Asuncion. The ministers asked that the Agreement for River Transportation through the Paraguay-Parana Waterway be ratified by all member countries as a way to strengthen physical integration. Argentina and Brazil have yet to ratify the document. Paraguay, Bolivia, and Uruguay have already ratified it. In the joint declaration, the foreign ministers express the need for a more significant participation of companies from the three Urupabol member countries in the implementation of the various Paraguay-Parana Waterway projects. The ministers agree that NAFTA is an important step forward for the creation of a broadened economic space in the hemisphere. Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu Bonilla stressed that the relaunching of Urupabol -- which disappeared in 1982 -- does not seek to upset the influence of Argentina and Brazil, the two powerful Mercosur [Common Market of the South] member countries. The idea is to complement and compare interests, Abreu said. The Paraguayan and Bolivian foreign ministers said they were pleased with the Uruguayan offer to use Uruguayan port facilities to take their products to the Atlantic Ocean.
