FR941125-1-00048 FR941125-1-00010 All comments received in response to the proposed rule published on September 24, 1993, supported the designation of Coccoloba rugosa as threatened. Nevertheless, on June 21, 1994, the Service received a letter from Vinson & Elkins, attorneys for the Palmas del Mar Properties, Inc., that provided additional information on both the distribution and abundance of Coccoloba rugosa. The Service is currently conducting field verification of this new information, which indicates there are at least 19 additional sites containing at least 4,000 individuals. Section 4(b)(6) of the Act requires the Service to take one of three alternative actions within 1 year of a listing proposal: (1) Publish a final regulation listing the species; (2) Publish a notice that the listing proposal is being withdrawn, or (3) Publish a notice that the 1-year time period is being extended under section 4(b)(6). That section as implemented by regulations at 50 CFR 424.17(a)(1)(iv), provides that the Service may extend the 1-year period for up to 6 months upon finding that ``there is a substantial disagreement among scientists knowledgeable about the species concerned'' on whether to list the species. The Act provides in section 4(b)(1)(A) that a determination to list a species shall be made on the best available scientific and commercial information. The Act's information standard requires that the best available information must support a conclusion that a species meets the Act's definition for threatened or endangered status after consideration of the five factors discussed in Section 4(a)(1). The Service finds there is substantial disagreement with regard to the population status of Coccoloba rugosa, and, therefore, extends until March 31, 1995, the period within which to make a final listing determination on this species. The Service solicits additional data on the status of Coccoloba rugosa until January 24, 1995. References Cited Little, E.L., R.O. Woodbury, and F.H. Wadsworth. 1974.
