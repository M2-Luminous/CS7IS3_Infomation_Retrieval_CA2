Sorokina: ``Conflict That Could Not Be: ``For the Sake of Order'' Officials Transformed Unique Treatment Into Regular Polyclinic Only To Again Make It a Center''] [Text] And the story began as follows. At the end of last year, the Main Medical Administration in Moscow decided to bring order to the capital's medical institutions. Those institutions that had previously had the status of all-union institutions became the stumbling block. The Russian Ministry of Health sheltered some of them. It was proposed that the others become Moscow polyclinics. The unique Center for the Rehabilitation of Invalids and Patients With Spinal Trauma, which is headed by living legend Valentin Dikul and which is the only one of its kind not only in Russia but in the entire former USSR as well, fell among these ``others.'' The ``Retsept'' wrote about it in detail in the past once. I will therefore recall just one fact: For its well-known services, Dikul's center was listed in the World Register of Medical Institutions. Moscow's central medical board dealt with this unique institution as follows: It decided to reshape it into an ordinary Moscow polyclinic with its associates given a rank 5 salary. What did this mean? First, specialists who knew a rare method incurred a big salary loss. Second, the polyclinic had to accept primarily Moscow residents and had to refuse to help patients from other regions. And third, the center's director V. Dikul found himself thrown overboard: The polyclinic's staff roster did not contain the post of director, and a medical education was required for the chief physician (Dikul never finished his). The stand-off between the center and Moscow's medical board continued for more than half a year. The public sided with Dikul and his associates. Such prestigious individuals as Yu. Nikulin, M. Zakharov, Y. Yevtushenko, and many others wrote to Moscow's mayoralty and the federal government. The stand-off could not but affect the rehabilitation center's activity: It had to cut back the number of Russian patients accepted to only the most critical, and even those Moscow patients who did not fit the center's profile -- those with radiculitis, osteochondrosis, etc., had to be accepted. The public was not pressured, and the mayoralty to whom it appealed and medical officials made concessions. They proposed that Dikul write a letter in which he would ask to be under the ``wing'' of the central medical board but as the Moscow rehabilitation center. In other words, the version that Dikulev's supporters proposed half a year ago was revived. Who needed all this idle fuss? I cannot document it, but perhaps something will clarify this curious information. ``Buyers'' who are not hiding their intentions came to the rehabilitation center. While examining the ``goods'' (the building), they said that they find it entirely suitable as a commercial health improvement center: Luckily, there is a pool and rooms for training equipment, and a magnificent park with an athletic field in the neighborhood. To the question of their ``aims,'' the ``buyers'' answered significantly: The land, they say, is full of rumors... This time the public, with the help of the capital's mayoralty, uncovered the source of the rumors. This time. But there is no guarantee that a similar situation will not be repeated with other commercial-type medical institutions. To sell is not to build.
