The 1992/93 drug report, presented on Friday [20 May], points out that, above all, an increasing number of young people die from overdoses of drugs. The youngest person to die from drugs was 14. A total of 10 young people under age died of drug consumption. At 37 deaths, the development is also alarming among the 20- to 24-year-olds. A new "record" is expected for this year because 57 drug-related deaths have been reported so far. "Drug-related deaths are no yardstick for a good or bad drug policy," Sepp Rieder, the city councillor responsible for health, stated, referring to the report. The opposition criticized his lack of action and the absence of efficient preventive measures.
