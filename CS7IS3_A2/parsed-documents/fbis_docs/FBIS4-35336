We wish to categorically confirm the following: In the YSP there are no unionists or separatists. All are unionists led by Brother President 'Ali Salim al-Bid who worked for unity and voluntarily signed the union agreement. The issue of contacts with any quarter whatsoever could only be legitimate if they are made with the official state establishments of the Democratic Republic of Yemen. The Sanaa regime has not made any such contacts with any state establishments of the Democratic Republic of Yemen. The YSP Political Bureau clarified this issue in an official statement issued on 28 April. These allegations by the Sanaa regime are intended to cause confusion since that regime has failed militarily and politically to achieve its dreams of hegemony, domination, and occupation. We are not advocates of war but advocates of peace and shall defend the Democratic Republic of Yemen and the lives, possessions, and honor of its men and women, its people. We are able, God permitting, to do all this. We support a permanent cease-fire to save our country and our brothers from destruction and bloodletting. This can be followed by negotiations between the Democratic Republic of Yemen and the Sanaa regime to define future relations between the two states. We are advocates of unity but not on the basis of the former unity. When a regime emerges in Sanaa believing in justice, equal citizenship, human rights and all the ideals we cherish and contained in the pledge and accord document, we shall then discuss the issue of unity with that regime.
