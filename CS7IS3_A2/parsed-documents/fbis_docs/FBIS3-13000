The English-language daily TEHRAN TIMES argued: "If relations are indeed re-established, the US stands to gain a lot more than Iran, therefore it should be prepared to make greater concessions." Iran and the United States have not had diplomatic ties since 1980, one year after the Islamic revolution which toppled the pro-American shah, whose regime was a major US ally in the Middle East. But last week President Bill Clinton's adviser Anthony Lake, and Under Secretary of State for the Middle East Robert Pelletreau reported that Washington was ready to start talks with Iran. The Iranian Government has so far not reacted officially to the US statements, but has indirectly welcomed the moves via favourable press reports, while restating its conditions for opening Iran-US talks. The TEHRAN TIMES said: "Iran has left open the possibility of reconciliation with the US provided that America releases Iran's assets which are frozen in American banks and refrains from covert and overt operations aimed at destabilizing the Islamic Republic." Iranian officials estimate more than 10 billion dollars are currently frozen in the United States. The daily said the United States "is finally trying to come to terms with the political realities of the Islamic Republic, after 14 years of efforts to undermine its legitimacy." It attributed the recent US gesture to a refusal by European countries to take part in the US bid to isolate Tehran, and also to the "failure of the US imposed Middle East peace talks." This has prompted "Washington to consider using Tehran's spiritual influence in the Islamic world to revive the peace accord," the TEHRAN TIMES added. Last week the KAYHAN INTERNATIONAL, a daily close to Islamic hardliners traditionally opposed to the United States, spoke in favor of "a negotiated solution" to "bring an end to the hostility" between the countries.
