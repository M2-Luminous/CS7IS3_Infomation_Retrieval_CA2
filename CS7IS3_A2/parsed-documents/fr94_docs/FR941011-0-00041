FR941011-0-00041 FR941011-0-00011 (ii) On May 27, 1997, Z sells its entire manufacturing plant in Ohio to an unrelated party. The sales proceeds allocated to each of the three machines at the Ohio plant is $5,000. Because this transaction is a qualifying disposition under paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(B)( 3 ) of this section, Z chooses to apply paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section. (iii) For Z 's 1997 return, the depreciation allowance for the account is computed as follows. As of December 31, 1996, the depreciation allowed or allowable for the three machines at the Ohio plant is $23,400. Thus, as of January 1, 1997, the unadjusted depreciable basis of the account is reduced from $180,000 to $135,000 ($180,000 less the unadjusted depreciable basis of $45,000 for the three machines), and the depreciation reserve of the account is decreased from $93,600 to $70,200 ($93,600 less the depreciation allowed or allowable of $23,400 for the three machines as of December 31, 1996). Consequently, the depreciation allowance for the account in 1997 is $25,920 (($135,000 ^ $70,200) × 40%). (iv) For Z 's 1997 return, gain or loss for each of the three machines at the Ohio plant is determined as follows. The depreciation allowed or allowable in 1997 for each machine is $1,440 [(($15,000 ^ $7,800) × 40%) / 2]. Thus, the adjusted basis of each machine under section 1011 is $5,760 (the adjusted depreciable basis of $7,200 removed from the account less the depreciation allowed or allowable of $1,440 in 1997). As a result, the loss recognized in 1997 for each machine is $760 ($5,000 ^ $5,760), which is subject to section 1231. (iv) Transactions subject to section 168(i)(7). If an asset in a general asset account is transferred in a transaction described in section 168(i)(7)(B) (pertaining to treatment of transferees in certain nonrecognition transactions), the transferor must remove the transferred asset from the general asset account as of the first day of the taxable year in which the transaction occurs. In addition, the adjustments to the general asset account described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(C)( 2 ) through ( 4 ) of this section must be made. The transferee is bound by the transferor's election under paragraph (k) of this section with respect to so much of the asset's basis in the hands of the transferee as does not exceed the asset's adjusted basis in the hands of the transferor. If all of the assets, or the last asset, in a general asset account are transferred, the transferee's basis in the assets or asset transferred is equal to the adjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account as of the beginning of the transferor's taxable year in which the transaction occurs, decreased by the amount of depreciation allocable to the transferor for the year of the transfer. (v) Anti-abuse rule _(A) In general. If an asset in a general asset account is disposed of by a taxpayer in a transaction described in paragraph (e)(3)(v)(B) of this section, general asset account treatment for the asset terminates as of the first day of the taxable year in which the disposition occurs. Consequently, the taxpayer must determine the amount of gain, loss, or other deduction attributable to the disposition in the manner described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(A) of this section (notwithstanding that paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(A) of this section is an optional rule) and must make the adjustments to the general asset account described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(C)( 1 ) through ( 4 ) of this section. (B) Abusive transactions. A transaction is described in this paragraph (e)(3)(v)(B) if the transaction is not described in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section and the transaction is entered into, or made, with a principal purpose of achieving a tax benefit or result that would not be available absent an election under this section. Examples of these types of transactions include_ ( 1 ) A transaction entered into with a principal purpose of shifting income or deductions among taxpayers in a manner that would not be possible absent an election under this section in order to take advantage of differing effective tax rates among the taxpayers; or ( 2 ) An election made under this section with a principal purpose of disposing of an asset from a general asset account in order to utilize an expiring net operating loss or credit. The fact that a taxpayer with a net operating loss carryover or a credit carryover transfers an asset to a related person or transfers an asset pursuant to an arrangement where the asset continues to be used (or is available for use) by the taxpayer pursuant to a lease (or otherwise) indicates, absent strong evidence to the contrary, that the transaction is described in this paragraph (e)(3)(v)(B).
