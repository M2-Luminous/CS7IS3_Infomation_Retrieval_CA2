The essence of this phenomenon lies in the fact that the average voter is far from understanding not only the nuances, but even the concept of political life as a whole; nor has he come to understand the purpose of the elections themselves. Behind the endeavors of the candidates to become deputies the average person has been unable to perceive what this has to do with him as a citizen, a family man, or a businessman (if, indeed, he has achieved this last-named status). The voter has become alienated from the thought that he will be choosing a leader for himself--a leader of the state in which he will somehow have to go on living, raising his children, and earning his daily bread. When and if the citizens' nerves give out, they forget the following sacramental saying: "Each nation gets the rulers it deserves." And, therefore, they likewise forget their own responsibility for the choice that is made. The fact that this bond of "responsibility" is understood and even a common cliche for a certain politically engaged portion of Ukrainians certainly does not mean that it is also obvious for all other citizens. It is one thing to elect someone who speaks eloquently or who has a very attractive appearance; but it is quite another thing to take the trouble to analyze and understand well which of the candidates would move the history of our state in which direction. It is one thing to indulge one's esthetic "ego" and make a game of filling out the election ballot by casually running down the list of names with one's finger; but it is something quite different to make a conscious and well-informed choice--to show yourself to be a thinking being and a citizen. This has become incomparably complicated, of course, by the fact that nowadays the background of philosophical thoughts is an exacerbated, impoverished society. And within this society there is not yet any noticeable educational-type, pre-election work for the purpose of informing each persons about the importance of his individual choice, or--for example--creating a unique methodology for making this choice. The first month of the election campaign is drawing to a close, but it is only the politicians themselves who know this. Television and radio are virtually silent about the upcoming elections; they are waiting for advertisements to come in so that they can sell air time. It is said that a certain well-endowed businessman attempted to buy up virtually all the air time of one non-state television channel. The channel in question was not averse to doing so, but the businessman had a foreign business; and so the channel did not sell him the air time--at least, not all of it. But this situation is not expected to last very long, and it is quite easy to foresee that the candidates will very quickly be divided into the following two camps: those who will have television air time solely within the limits set by the state and those who will have it on an unrestricted basis. Incidentally, baffled by the results of their elections, the Russians have calculated that during the election campaign Zhirinovskiy--the leader of the Liberal-Democratic Party--utilized the services of Ostankino, RTV [Russian TV], and Saint Petersburg TV more than any other candidate. Those of our candidates who are not duplicating this effort can--at least--be consoled by the fact that virtually nobody watches UT [Ukrainian TV] in Ukraine. Well then, those candidates who have the money will find us everywhere, and I am sure that they will do just that. However, let's turn our attention now to an amazing phenomenon--the start of the election campaign passed practically unnoticed. There was very little news and information about this. Not primarily because of any feebleness or weakness of the process, but because of the tacit taboo imposed by the directors of the state mass media on mentioning the principal deeds, offices, or names of the candidates. In this connection, things have gotten to the point of such absurdity whereby--for example--a well-known politician decided to triumphantly comment on Clinton's arrival in Kiev; and this could be allowed on the air, but if this very same politician were to be the first one to officially register his candidacy in Ukraine, this "shameful" fact could in no way be broadcast. Thus, we might very soon arrive at such a situation as the following: The airwaves will be filled with quotations--for example--from the head of a certain party, but a timid silence is to be maintained concerning the fact that he is a candidate for the office of deputy. It is as if they were saying: Figure it out for yourselves, and--at the same time--figure out what the upcoming elections will be like.... In addition to such a semi-conspiratorial start, the beginning of the election struggle was marked by quite a serious scandal in the noble family of Rukh. Upon becoming a party, Rukh--of course--acquired such a necessary feature as party discipline, a discipline which was boasted about so extraordinarily by the old Rukh staffers, as well as by the romantic young ones. The obsolescence of such devoted fidelity to party discipline was demonstrated quite recently by the people's deputy, Serhiy Holovatyy, who is not merely a member of Rukh, but also a member of the Rukh leadership. As we know, the democratic-type parties have created and organized a unique bloc--one whose basic task is to hopefully diminish the competition among democratic deputies in any one election district, and--ideally speaking--to support just one deputy with all their joint, unified authority. And, in spite of the above-mentioned "domestic agreement" and party discipline, Serhiy Holovatyy undertook to register his own candidacy in "someone else's" district. Such an action has quite seriously undermined the reputation of Rukh discipline and engendered doubts with regard to the monolithic nature of the party benches. By way of punishing this "rebel," the democratic forces decided upon the following, unprecedented step: to deprive this member of the Rukh leadership of their support in the elections.
