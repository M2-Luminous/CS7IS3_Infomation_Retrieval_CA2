XINHUA, the official China news agency, yesterday announced the publication of the white paper-just two weeks ahead of a United States deadline, after which China faces a Special 301 investigation and possible trade sanctions. The Business Software Alliance (BSA) fears the white paper is merely propaganda and has urged the U.S. to go ahead with its Special 301 action. The white paper concentrates on underlining the measures Beijing has already taken to protect copyright on the mainland. It also admits that education is needed because "some portions of the population, have a rather incomplete understanding of intellectual property rights". The paper also said mainland authorities were encouraging "invention and other forms of creation" to alleviate the need to pirate goods. However, the BSA and an official from the Hong Kong government's Intellectual Property Department both said yesterday the mainland authorities were slow to take up offers of advice on how to implement the laws or educate the population. Vice-president of the BSA Stephanie Mitchell, said the Chinese were insincere in their attempts to stamp out piracy, and that the BSA had offered Chinese officials and judges training, in how to recognise and deal with copyright infringement. There was also a BSA offer of technical assistance on how to prove, for example, a software program is pirated, she said. The offers were first made some months ago and have been repeated on an "on going basis". As yet there had been no response from the Chinese side, Ms Mitchell said. There had been no tangible progress in cutting piracy on the mainland despite the passing of the new Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), Ms Mitchell said. Recent raids on shops selling counterfeit goods were orchestrated by the propaganda division of the Chinese Communist Party, she claimed. It was "disheartening" that the judiciary and government IPR departments were still failing to deal with the problem, Ms Mitchell said. Beijing had also failed to come up with any prosecutions for any of the cases filed by the BSA with the state Intellectual Property Tribunal, she said: "They have been terribly slow in processing the cases. We have seen no practical results." The number of cases of copyright infringement continues unabated despite high profile raids on some shops.
