SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Secretary is proposing to revise 34 CFR part 682 to implement changes made to the HEA by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;325), enacted July 23, 1992, as well as certain changes added by Public Law 103&hyph;208, enacted December 20, 1993. These regulations seek to improve the efficiency of federal student aid programs, and, by so doing, to improve their capacity to enhance opportunities for postsecondary education. Summary of Comments From Regional Meetings In compliance with section 492(a) of the HEA, the Secretary convened regional meetings during September 1992 to obtain public involvement in the development of proposed regulations. The purpose of the meetings was to ``provide for a comprehensive discussion and exchange of information concerning the implementation'' of certain parts of Public Law 102&hyph;325. In addition, attendees at the regional meetings were asked to nominate individuals to act as negotiators in the negotiated rulemaking process required by section 492(b) of the HEA. The regional meetings were conducted for two days each in San Francisco, California; New York, New York; Atlanta, Georgia; and Kansas City, Missouri. Each participant at the regional meetings was assigned to one of six groups which were asked to discuss particular issue areas identified by the Department. Each group at the regional meetings prepared a report of its discussion and recommendations and those reports were presented to the Department for consideration during the preparation of the proposed regulations. The issues addressed in this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking were discussed by one of the groups at each regional meeting. The specific recommendations made at those meetings are addressed below. The Secretary considered these comments in preparing draft proposed regulations. 1. Loan Discharge for Borrowers Attending Schools That Close Public Law 102&hyph;325 added section 437(c) to the HEA to provide that loans will be canceled for student borrowers who are unable to complete their program of study because the school closed. The specific issues described below were discussed in connection with this section.
