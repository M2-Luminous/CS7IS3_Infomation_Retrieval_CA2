The visas were denied to representatives from the Swedish Helsinki Committee, the International Commission of Lawyers, and the Association of Swedish Authors and Writers. The three wanted to do research on human rights in Kosovo and a follow-up report on Albanians who have been denied asylum in Sweden and sent back to Kosovo. Meanwhile, 60 Swedish aid workers scheduled to transport food and help build emergency housing in Bosnia are still waiting for visas from Serb authorities. The Swedes were to relieve a group of Swedish convoy workers who returned from Bosnia last week.
