FBIS4-30162 "dreas122_c_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-122 Daily Report 21 Jun 1994 North Korea Lumbermen Interviewed on Being `Kidnapped' Lumbermen Interviewed on Being `Kidnapped' SK2206002694 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1518 GMT 21 Jun 94 SK2206002694 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, June 21 (KCNA) -- Kim Kyong-hun, 32, and Kim Yun-il, 28, who had been kidnapped by South Korean puppets while engaging in felling in the far eastern region of Russia and escaped, met with reporters here on Monday and threw a revealing light on the truth behind the despicable kidnapping campaign of the South Korean puppets against lumbermen of the DPRK. They were working at the forestry station No. 2 under the first complex of the Far Eastern Forestry Mission in Elga, Khabarovsk. They first explained how they were kidnapped by agents of the South Korean "Security Planning Board [SPB]", On May 8, 1992, they went shopping to the Birobidzhan market and got on a train after a Russian merchant who promised them to buy things they needed in Novosibirsk. When they were ended up in embarrassment, having lost money and goods while traveling in the train, a man dressed like a Chinese volunteered to help them as a compatriot and led them to Moscow. Upon arriving in Moscow, they got on a taxi, which took them directly to the South Korean "embassy". The Russian merchant and Korean who kidnapped them were members of the "Association of Koreans" in Moscow. The "Association of Koreans" was an anti-DPRK plot-breeding group on the payroll of the South Korean puppet embassy. South Korean "SPB" men including Choe Chon-yop, first secretary of the "embassy", tried to force them to admit that they came to the South Korean "embassy" of their own accord, branding them as "criminals" who intruded into the "land of South Korea". Later, they were held in detention in the office of Ho Chin, chairman of the "Association of Koreans" and general director of the newspaper LENIN KICHI, for one week before being taken to Yi Vadim, vice-chairman of the Rostov chapter of the "Association of Koreans". In Rostov they underwent brainwashing under the watch of gangsters who tried to force them to write articles against the DPRK. The rogues also tried to make them write a letter to Yeltsin saying they could not live in North Korea and requesting him to grant them political asylum so they might live as citizens of Russia. But they refused to do such things against the DPRK. When those lumbermen refused to comply with their demand, the "SPB" operatives and their underlings threatened them in every way. One day in August, they threatened to kill the lumbermen, saying they would not be allowed to leave there alive. The lumbermen, unafraid of death, pounced upon them with a kitchen knife and an axe. The villains who had been in a killing mood just moments before were struck with terror and ran away. The lumbermen fled and took shelter in the house of a man sympathetic with them. Later they escaped from the grip of the enemy with his help. Kim Kyong-hun exposed the relations between the South Korean "embassy" and Ho Chin's "Association of Koreans" in Moscow and their kidnapping methods. Choe Chon-yop, acting in the guise of a first secretary of the South Korean "embassy", is an operative of the "SPB" who directly wirepulls the "Association of Koreans". He personally questions kidnapped lumberjacks and decides on their fate. He disguises those who are to be taken to South Korea as "political exiles" or "refugees" and sends those who are to be left in Russia back to the "Association of Koreans" and manipulates it to brainwash them and use them in anti-DPRK intrigues. Kim Kyong-hun told reporters that through his own experience he learned that the "Security Planning Board" section in the South Korean "embassy" is a den of kidnappers of DPRK lumbermen in Russia, and the members of the kidnapping gang including the "Association of Koreans" are servants paid by the "SPB" for their criminal doings. According to him, the South Korean "embassy" in Moscow does the dirty job in Europe and the "consulate-general" in Vladivostok in the far east. A certain Pak, deputy consul of the "consulate-general," is a high-ranking operative of the "SPB" under whose baton the chairman of the "Association of Koreans" in Nakhodka supervises operations of alluring and kidnapping DPRK lumbermen. Kim Yun-il told reporters about the purpose sought by the "Association of Koreans" in trying to force him to write a letter to President Yeltsin. In this, the "SPB" of South Korea and the reactionaries of the "Association of Koreans" intended to disguise their illegal organisation as a "charity" organisation, he said. Kim Kyong-hun and Kim Yun-il said if the South Korean puppets continued to frame plots against DPRK lumbermen in the far eastern region of Russia, distorting facts, they will eventually drink a bitter cup. They urged the Russian authorities never to allow the South Korean puppets' kidnapping of DPRK lumbermen in the far eastern region, because it harms the traditional friendship between the Korean and Russian peoples and it is an international crime creating instability in the Russian territory.
