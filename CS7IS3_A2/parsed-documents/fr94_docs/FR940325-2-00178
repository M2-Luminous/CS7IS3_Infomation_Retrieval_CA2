FR940325-2-00178 FR940325-2-00084 The penetration included in the licensee's schedular exemption request represents only 6.4 percent of the total ``as left'' leakage at the beginning of the current operating cycle. The total ``as left'' minimum path leakage for all penetrations was only 0.073 La and the total ``as left'' minimum path leakage for the penetration addressed in the proposed exemption was only 0.0046 La. The replacement of both isolation valves with valves of improved design provides added confidence that excessive leakage will not be experienced. The inboard valve 10MOV&hyph;18 was replaced during the 1985 refueling outage and has successfully passed three out of four Type C tests performed during refueling outages since its replacement. The outboard isolation valve 10MOV&hyph;17 was replaced with a similarly designed new valve during the last refueling outage (1992). The limited number of valve strokes these valves are subject to over any one operating cycle minimizes valve degradation due to wear. This provides reasonable assurance that the requested surveillance interval expansion will not result in the Types B and C leakage rate total exceeding the 0.6 La limit of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix J. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed schedular exemption. The 2-year interval requirement for Type C testing is intended to be often enough to preclude significant deterioration between tests and long enough to permit the tests to be performed during routine plant outages. Leak rate testing of containment isolation valves during plant shutdown is preferable because of the lower radiation exposures to plant personnel. Furthermore, some containment isolation valves cannot be tested at power. For those valves that cannot be tested during power operation, or for which testing at power would yield unnecessary radiation exposure of personnel, the NRC staff believes the increase in confidence of containment integrity following a successful test is not significant enough to justify the hardships and costs associated with performing the tests within the 2-year time period. V The Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a)(1), this exemption is authorized by law, will not present undue risk to the public health and safety, and is consistent with the common defense and security. The Commission further determines that special circumstances, as provided in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), are present justifying the exemption; namely that application of the regulation in the particular circumstance is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule. The underlying purpose of Section III.D.3 of Appendix J to 10 CFR part 50 is to provide an interval short enough to prevent serious deterioration from occurring between tests and long enough to permit testing to be performed during regular plant outages. For containment isolation valves that cannot be tested at power, or for containment isolation valves where testing involves unreasonable risk to personnel and equipment, the increased confidence in containment integrity following successful testing is not significant enough to justify the hardships associated with performing the test within the 2-year interval. Specifically, any potential incremental benefit of performing the tests within the 2-year requirement would not be sufficient to offset the increased occupational radiation exposure associated with testing, the risk to plant safety associated with removing the primary method of decay heat removal from service, and the undue financial burden of placing the plant in the refueling configuration and significantly extending the length of the spring 1994 maintenance/surveillance outage. The licensee has presented information accepted by the Commission, which gives a high degree of confidence that the components affected by this exemption will not degrade to an unacceptable extent. Acceptable leakage limits are defined in sections III.B.3(a) and III.C.3 of Appendix J to 10 CFR part 50. Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that granting the above exemption will have no significant impact on the quality of the human environment (March 16, 1994, 59 FR 12382). This Exemption is effective upon issuance and shall expire prior to restart following the next FitzPatrick refueling outage which is currently scheduled to commence in November 1994. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 18th day of March 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Frederick J.
