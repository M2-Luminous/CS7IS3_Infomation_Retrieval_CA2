Speaking on the first day of his visit after talks with New Zealand's prime minister, Jim Bolger, in Wellington, Mr. Wingti said that reports of a PNG blockade were not correct. He said there was no blockade, the problem is of getting services and reconstruction programs moving on Bougainville. The Bougainville Revolutionary Army [BRA] has been fighting a five-year campaign for independence. Mr. Wingti said the number of rebels on Bougainville had diminished, and the people there and in the rest of PNG were now getting to the situation where they wanted normal lives to be restored. He said PNG was one nation and to give independence to Bougainville would divide that nation, so it was not an issue.
