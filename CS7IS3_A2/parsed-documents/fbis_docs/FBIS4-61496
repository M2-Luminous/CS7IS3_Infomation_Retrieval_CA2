A top Russian Space Agency official disclosed to INTERFAX that the agency's General Director Yuriy Koptev is to meet with Kazakhstan's Deputy Premier Galym Abilsiitov in Almaty to discuss possible solutions to the issue. The treaty must tally with the interstate agreement "On the basic principles and terms of using the Baykonur space center," signed by the presidents Boris Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev in Moscow on March 28. The latter accord legally entitles Russia to use Baykonur and the adjacent town of Leninsk during 20 years and prolong the lease, if it wishes, for yet another 10 years. Russia's annual pay for the use of these facilities is set at 115 million dollars. As INTERFAX has learned, pending his trip to Almaty, Koptev met on Wednesday with the Russian Aero-Space Forces' Vladimir Ivanov to coordinate a single position on the status of Russian servicemen at Baykonur. The Aero-Space Forces are responsible for launching all spacecraft and boosters from Baykonur.
