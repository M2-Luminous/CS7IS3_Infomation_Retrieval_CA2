Endara indicated that if the Electoral Tribunal members "do not make the corrections quickly, I believe the bill (with the constitutional reforms) is in danger of failing." Endara's remarks come after the Supreme Court announced its opposition to the constitutional reforms that permit the Electoral Tribunal to interpret the Constitution on electoral issues. The Supreme Court considers the reforms "inadvisable" for the administration of justice. "I know the court's opinion, and I personally agree with it," added Endara. [passage omitted] The executive branch presented to the Legislative Assembly two constitutional reforms to grant autonomy to the Electoral Tribunal and to eliminate the possibility of an army existing in the country. Nevertheless, according to Supreme Court President Arturo Hoyos, the justices unanimously agree that the first reform is inadvisable. "In the way it has been proposed, this reform might be a source of constant conflict between the Electoral Tribunal and the Supreme Court of Justice," Hoyos added.
