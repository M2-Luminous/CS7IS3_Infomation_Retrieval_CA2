Today in Juanchaco on the Pacific Coast, one of the gringo Marines who arrived to build a little school said in a statement for the "TV Today" newscast that this territory in Malaga Bay belongs to them; in other words, that it is U.S. territory. The 150 U.S. Southern Command soldiers are supposedly here to build a little school and a health center. Today, whatever the reason for their arrival, it is not the most important issue. Now the presence of the gringos has prompted various serious opinions that have divided island residents. Some strongly reject it, while others believe they should be given the opportunity to show their generous, unselfish intentions so people can trust them. Still others defend them by saying that at last good luck has come to Juanchaco to bring progress to the island. [Begin recording] [Ruiz] Are you happy with the arrival of the gringo soldiers? [Unidentified woman] Yes, I am happy, because they are here to help the people. [Ruiz] How do they treat you? [Woman] Very well. [end recording] While area residents are trying to decide their position and focus on the benefits the gringos will bring for the children in education and health, the U.S. Marines know very well what they are doing. As sure of themselves as Peter in his own house, they transported a large amount of material by trucks down bumpy Juanchaco roads and began working. In addition, today they decided that they definitely need an area in Colombian territory that belongs to them. The only requirement that could be added to the existing restrictions upon entering that territory would be asking Colombians to show a passport in their own country. [Begin unidentified Colombian soldier recording] The area over there is not ours, it is their camp [words indistinct]. [end recording] This spot where a Colombian Infantry marine is posted marks the limits between Colombia and U.S. territory that have been traced, limiting access to the media.
