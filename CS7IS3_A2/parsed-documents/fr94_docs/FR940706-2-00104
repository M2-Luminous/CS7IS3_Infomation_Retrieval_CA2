These measures are described in Section 4.0 of the FEIS. (4) A wetland mitigation plan providing in-kind and on-site replacement for unavoidable adverse impacts to existing wetlands has been developed and will be implemented, resulting in no net loss of wetland habitat values over time. Specific details regarding the mitigation plan have been developed through the Section 404 permit process. (5) No state or federally listed endangered or threatened species or their critical habitats are known to be adversely affected by the project. (6) No historic properties listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places are known to be adversely affected by the project. (7) Statutory authority for the Service to fund and implement, and for the USCOE to permit, the project exists. (8) The requirements of NEPA and the implementing regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500&hyph;1508) have been satisfied. The ROD serves as the written facts and conclusions relied upon in reaching this decision. A complete copy of the ROD is filed at the Refuge together with the other NEPA documents.
