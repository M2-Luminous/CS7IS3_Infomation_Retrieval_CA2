The poll carried a 2.3 percent margin of error. Results showed that the Socialist Party (PS) improved its score from last December, going from 34.83 percent to 37.7 percent. It thus narrowed the gap with the Social Democratic Party (PSD), whose score dropped from 48.91 percent in December to 45.9 percent. While the PSD still maintains a "comfortable" lead of 8 percentage points over the PS, Trigo de Negreiros points out that a month ago, the gap between the two parties was nearly 14 percent. The scores of the Communist Party (PCP) remained practically unchanged (9.99 percent in December to the present 10.2 percent), as did those of the Social Democratic Center Party (CDS) (3.59 percent to 4.2 percent).
