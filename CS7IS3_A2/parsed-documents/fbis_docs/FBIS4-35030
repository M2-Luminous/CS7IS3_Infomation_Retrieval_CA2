The United Workers Front (FUT), which called the strike in solidarity with Indian organizations, said "conditions are not right" for the strike. FUT President Raul Andrago said the workers' unions held an extraordinary meeting this afternoon and evening and agreed to suspend the strike that was scheduled to begin at 0600 on Tuesday (1100 GMT). The leader of the main union in this country of 11 million people clarified that the general strike has not been indefinitely suspended and announced that it will be held in mid-July, according to the circumstances. FUT had called a 24-hour "preventive" strike for Tuesday to reject the economic policies of Conservative president Sixto Duran Ballen. The strike was also a show of support for the peasant and Indian movement headed by the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador (Conaie). That organization is demanding that the government repeal the new agrarian law, which Conaie considers unconstitutional. [passage omitted]
