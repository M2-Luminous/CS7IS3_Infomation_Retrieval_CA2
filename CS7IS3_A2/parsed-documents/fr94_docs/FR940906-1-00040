FR940906-1-00040 FR940906-1-00017 The Service has based its present tentative negotiating positions mainly on the review of information presented in the proposals submitted by proponents and in terms of criteria adopted at previous meetings of the Conference of the Parties of CITES. Some of the proposals will have to be translated into English from Spanish (English translation available) or French (also official languages under terms of the Convention). Because information provided in some of the proposals or otherwise available to the Service is too incomplete to allow a thorough review of their merits, several of the tentative negotiating positions presented may be revised as additional biological and trade data are obtained. Final guidance for the delegation is to be based on the best available biological and trade information, including comments received in response to this notice. Proposals In accordance with the provisions of Article XV, paragraph 1(a) of the Convention the following CITES Parties have submitted proposals for changes to Appendices I and II of the Convention: Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, Benin, Chile, Denmark, Ecuador, Egypt, France, Germany, Ghana, India, Italy, Kenya, Madagascar, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Philippines, South Africa, Sudan, Switzerland, Thailand, Tanzania, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Uruguay, and Vietnam. Proposals submitted by the United States will be discussed in a subsequent Federal Register notice. A total of 92 proposals on both plant and animal species were submitted by countries other than the United States, including 10 proposals that were submitted based on the ``Ten Year Review'' concept first adopted at the 1981 Conference of the Parties in New Delhi, India. The Ten Year Review process seeks to correct or clarify the inclusion of species listed at the Plenipotentiary and COPI before listing criteria were adopted. Some of the proposals submitted by Switzerland under this process recommend the deletion from the appendices of those species that have not been reported in trade, unless the species should be included in Appendix II because of similarity in appearance to related taxa that do appear in trade. It is the U.S. position (and has been at earlier COPs) that the lack of reported trade for some species should not be the sole basis for their deletion from the appendices. The lack of reported trade for some species proposed for deletion from the appendices may be due to (1) their rarity, (2) the possibility that their listing in the appendices has appropriately inhibited trade, (3) effective limits on trade by range States for the benefit of the species in that the range States may determine that trade would be detrimental to the survival of the species, or (4) the lack of proper documentation on the reporting of trade. Consequently, the Service does not believe that lack of appearance in trade is, by itself, a sufficient reason to warrant the removal of a taxon from the appendices. In establishing a tentative negotiating position on these ``Ten Year Review'' delisting proposals, the Service considered the degree of vulnerability of the species and the likelihood of it entering trade, and the net conservation effect of delisting. In addition to the regular listing, delisting, and transfer proposals, Switzerland, in carrying out its responsibility as the CITES Depository Government, submitted proposals to transfer some populations from Appendix II to Appendix I (as required by earlier COPs). These proposals provide the basis for Parties to act on their previously stated intentions to return species to Appendix I if range countries do not submit, or Parties do not adopt, appropriate amendments to retain designated populations of certain species on Appendix II under provisions of Conf. 3.15 on ranching, Conf. 7.14 on export quotas, or Conf. 8.22 on ranching for crocodilians. Such is the case for some populations of crocodiles presently on Appendix II under special provisions. However, for those populations for which ranching proposals or export proposals have been submitted, and if adopted by the Parties, Switzerland intends to withdraw its proposed amendment to transfer these populations to Appendix I. Proposals submitted by Parties other than the United States are listed in the following table. Tentative negotiating positions and the basis for making them also are indicated. These positions were taken largely on the basis of the information contained in the proposals unless the Service has information on the species in its files, particularly from earlier COPs or meetings of permanent CITES committees. If insufficient population and/or trade information was provided, the Service's position is usually to oppose the proposal, pending the receipt of further information and a review of the relevant scientific literature. The complete text of each proposal received is available for public inspection at the Service's Office of Scientific Authority (see addresses above). The text of any referenced resolution from previous meetings of the Conference of the Parties is available from the Service's Office of Scientific Authority or Office of Management Authority. Proposed amendments and the Service's tentative position are as follows:
