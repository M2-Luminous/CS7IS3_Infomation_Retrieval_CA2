"Cooperation is a two-way street," Woerner told a group of journalists ahead of next week's North Atlantic Treaty Organisation summit expected to define the alliance's relations with its former Soviet bloc foes. Woerner reiterated that NATO, which has agreed to bolster military ties with Russia, was trying to support the democratic and economic reform efforts of President Boris Yeltsin. "He knows that, of course, cooperation with the West requires full respect for not only human rights domestically but also the sovereignty and independence of neighbouring states," the NATO chief said. Concern about Russia's direction has heightened since the suprisingly strong showing by ultra-nationalists in last months' parliamentary elections. But NATO analysts said there were worrying signs even before. They cited Moscow's insistence on protecting Russian-speaking minorities abroad, its slowness in withdrawing troops from the Baltic states and its drive to become the main peacekeeper in the former Soviet republics. Woerner said that while NATO wanted to cooperate with Moscow, its policy "to a certain extent is influenced by what happens in Russia, by the substance and also by the language of those who are responsible for policymaking." The summit is expected to adopt a U.S. proposal that would offer limited military cooperation with NATO's former Cold War enemies but not the automatic promise of alliance membership. Russia is strongly opposed to its one-time satellites joining NATO. Woerner reiterated that while Moscow would have no veto over the alliance's decisions, its interests would have to be considered. "We have to satisfy the security needs of the countries of Central and East Europe and we have to build a Euro-Atlantic Community which does not exclude, but includes Russia," he said. "This can be done in a carefully measured evolution over time."
