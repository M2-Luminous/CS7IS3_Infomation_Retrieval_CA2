An extensive pattern of opening up to the outside world in economic relations and trade has initially taken shape. In 1993, our region continued to implement the strategic principles of opening up to the outside world in all directions, paying special attention to areas in the west, importing from abroad and cooperating with units in the interior, and establishing economic ties with regions in the east and distributing products to those in the west, thereby achieving fairly satisfactory results in foreign economic relations and trade. Total export and import volume amounted to $912 million, an increase of 30 percent over 1992. Of this, local border trade continued to grow rapidly; total local border trade volume reached $570 million in 1993, an increase of 80 percent over 1992 or 68.3 percent of the region's total foreign trade volume. Abulaidi Amudurexiti, deputy secretary of the autonomous regional party committee and acting chairman of the autonomous regional government, spoke at an autonomous regional work conference on foreign economic relations and trade that was held yesterday. He said: The year 1994 is one in which the autonomous region will develop its economy rapidly on the basis of high efficiency, and will advance reform of the foreign trade system. We should seize the current favorable situation in international markets, do a good job of earning foreign exchange from exports, and steadily develop local border trade while incessantly improving economic returns. We should improve the investment environment, and expand the scale of utilizing foreign capital and economic and technological cooperation. Regional leaders Wang Lequan, Keyum Bawudun, Aisihaiti Kelimubai, and Li Donghui attended yesterday's conference.
