Mr. Weckx said on Tuesday [10 May] he expects VTM to apply for a licence to set up a second channel and this could open the door for other commercial stations to make their appearance on the Flemish cable network. And there's no lack of candidates. [passage omitted] [Unidentified correspondent] The statement of Minister for Culture Hugo Weckx is a reaction to the deal concluded last week between the Belgian Football Association and the Flemish commercial television station VTM. At a cost of around three million dollars a year, VTM secured the rights of televised football matches over a period of four years. The BRTN felt cheated and spoke openly of a breach of promise by the Belgian Football Association and VTM. The public broadcaster had expected to reach an agreement between the three parties to share the costs of the television rights for soccer games. According to Minister Weckx, the VTM commercial station can impossibly [as heard] meet its obligations toward the football association without a second channel. And that is precisely what the station wants, because there are other candidates who are more than eager to get their share of the cake. And that cake is worth more than seven billion francs in commercials a year, around 200 million U.S. dollars. A Swedish broadcasting concern has shown great interest to get on the cable in Flanders. SBS, which stands for Scandinavian Broadcasting System, wants to appear in the Flemish households before the summer of next year, and that news has led to mild forms of panic in VTM, BRTN, and Flemish political circles. [passage omitted] The general feeling in Flemish media circles is that SBS will not easily conquer the market over here. In Scandinavia the station's top programmes are U.S. soap series like The Cosby Show and the Oprah Winfrey talk show, and the rights of many of these programs are already in the hands of VTM or BRTN. For the Flemish media specialists, it's a certainty that the advertising monopoly of VTM will be abolished sooner or later, whether by SBS or another candidate. [passage omitted]
