[Alvear] What happened in the past few hours? Apparently no agreement was reached with the Arnulfist Party? [Ramirez] We failed to reach an agreement with other groups, but we did reach an agreement with the person who is now our presidential candidate, Professor Carles. [Alvear] Mr. Ramirez, do you think you will win with Professor Carles? [Ramirez] Yes, or we would not have chosen him. If we did not consider him a trump card, we would not have chosen him. [Alvear] What about the alliances? [Ramirez] We will be allied with the parties that are already supporting Carles and other parties that I am sure will also support his candidacy.
