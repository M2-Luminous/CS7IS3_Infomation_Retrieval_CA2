Addressing about 20,000 people at a rally to commemorate International Women's Day at the Pietersburg Stadium on Sunday [6 March], he said there would be no peace if some political players remained outside the transitional process. "I am still prepared to talk to those who refuse to register. I have said I am prepared to go down on my knees to ensure peace in the country," he said. Mr Mandela said he would urge the ANC, its allies and the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] to accept his proposal that there should be no deadlines regarding registration for the elections. "Even after Friday night, absolute patience and the ability to understand the fears of others." Earlier Mr Mandela said there were people who were prepared to contribute to building a new South Africa, but whose efforts had been rebuffed. "These are temporary setbacks to such men of integrity and vision and they should not be discouraged. The future does not belong to a minority that wants to cling to outdated policies, but belongs to those who have vision and courage." Thousands of people from all over the Northern Transvaal packed the stadium to hear the ANC leader's address. Mr Mandela was applauded wildly when he arrived at the stadium on the back of a bakkie [pickup] and briefly walked along the stands waving and smiling at the crowd. Later on Sunday he will travel to Magoebaskloof where he is scheduled to meet Chief Samuel Nxumalo of Gazankulu's Ximoko People's Progressive Party.
