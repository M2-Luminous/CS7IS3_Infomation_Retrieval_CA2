In order to lower operational costs and compete for greater market share, Japanese manufacturing enterprises have been increasing their overseas investments, and Hong Kong is a key point for such investment because of its proximity to China. According to Hong Kong government statistics, by the end of 1992, cumulative investment from Japan amounted to HK$124.45 billion, and Japanese companies fixed assets in Hong Kong totalled HK$85.16 billion, exceeding that of U.S. corporations, who ranked second.

According to a study by property consultancy Brooke Hillier Parker, Hong Kong's retail rents are already 130 percent those of Tokyo at HK$545 per square foot (psf), while office and housing costs are rising continuously. The average office rent in Hong Kong is currently HK$62 psf, compared to HK$84 in Tokyo. However, a projected 30-percent rise in the territory's average office rent this year, combined with a 10 percent drop in Japan, could cause the two cities to change places in 1994. Housing costs, which are expected to rise by 25 to 30 percent this year, are also approaching parity with Tokyo. (Hong Kong THE STANDARD in English 12 Jan 94 p 21)
