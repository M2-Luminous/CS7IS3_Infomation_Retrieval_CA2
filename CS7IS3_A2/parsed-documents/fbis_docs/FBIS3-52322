On a statement to reporters on arrival, the Qatari minister said: [Begin recording] [Al Thani] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. I am grateful for the warm reception by the brothers in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Of course, the visit comes within the framework of the long-standing fraternal bilateral relations. Today's visit aims to bolster this position, and if there is any misunderstanding or anything else to place things in a sound framework--a framework of brotherhood and cooperation, and within the framework of realizing Arab solidarity [sentence incomplete as heard]. [Reporter] Your Excellency the Minister, what is the State of Qatar's view on Arab solidarity? [Al Thani] We have stated several times that Arab solidarity is a necessity. If there is something to be discussed, in my view we can discuss it face to face as Arabs, and there is no need for estrangement. We should speak face to face and put things on the right track. [Reporter] Are you carrying a message to his majesty the king from his highness the amir? [Al Thani] Of course, I will convey the greetings of his highness the amir and his highness the heir apparent to his majesty the king and His Highness Prince Hasan. At the same time, I will convey a verbal message. [Reporter] Your Excellency, would you sum up Qatar's position on the peace process, especially concerning holy Jerusalem? [Al Thani] Since the very beginning of this problem with the Israeli occupation of Palestine, the State of Qatar has been adopting a clear position. Qatar supports the brothers, whether in Palestine or other Arab countries that were harmed by the [Israeli] occupation in 1967. We support the Palestinian people's peace understanding which they reached with Israel. It is a Palestinian affair, and we only support the brothers, whether in peace or in other conditions--we support them with the capabilities available to us. [Reporter] What about holy Jerusalem? [Al Thani] Of course, this is the first of the two qiblas, and it is important to us as Muslims. We do not want to see Jerusalem remain in non-Islamic or non-Arab hands. [end recording] For his part, Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state for foreign affairs, said: [Begin al-Hasan recording] I would like to point out the good and fraternal relations between Jordan and Qatar. These relations are long-standing and are developing, praise be to God. His Majesty King Husayn and his brother His Highness Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani have been eager to bolster these relations in various fields and on various levels. Undoubtedly, the visit of my brother and friend Qatari Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamad Al Thani to his country and kinsfolk in Jordan will bolster and develop these relations. The visit will surely lead to a qualitative shift concerning the implementation of all agreements and protocols annexed to them, which undoubtedly will foster fraternal relations. This is not restricted to the bilateral field. The visit of his excellency the minister will constitute a shift toward bolstering Arab ranks and Arab solidarity, which we hope to be in its best shape, God willing. [end recording]
