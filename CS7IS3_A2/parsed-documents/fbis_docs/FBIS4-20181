The political parties represented at the TGNA issued a joint communique on the Cyprus issue and addressed to the nations of the world. The communique read by the TGNA deputy speaker Yasin Hatipoglu confirms that the TGNA endorses the Turkish Cypriot people's 30-year-old just and legal struggle for their basic sovereignty, security, and equality. The statement points out that a just, realistic, and permanent solution to the Cyprus issue can only be achieved by the free will of the two people on the island. The statement notes that a return to the pre-1974 conditions is inconceivable and stresses that a solution unacceptable to the Turkish Cypriot people will not be approved by the Turkish nation. The statement notes: The TGNA announces that Turkey is determined to fulfill its duties and responsibilities as stipulated by agreements -- that of a guarantor. The communique notes that the negotiations can continue under the basic condition that there are two equal communities with equal rights in Cyprus. The statement indicates that a solution to the Cyprus issue can be achieved if the issue is discussed in all its entirety, by holding free negotiations between representatives of the two communities, and without any external intervention. The statement further notes that an agreement attained by means of negotiations can be valid only after both communities give their approval. The statement further expresses appreciation of President Rauf Denktas' efforts toward peace. The conclusion of the communique expresses the following views: [Begin Hatipoglu recording] The TGNA announces that Turkey endorses the Turkish Cypriot cause with determination and that it will extend assistance to the TRNC in all areas.
