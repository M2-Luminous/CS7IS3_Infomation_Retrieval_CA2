FBIS4-59497 "drnes094_n_94001" FBIS-NES-94-094 Daily Report 15 May 1994 LEBANON Christopher Tour Faces `Risks and Difficulties' Christopher Tour Faces `Risks and Difficulties' NC1505182894 Beirut Radio Lebanon in Arabic 1530 GMT 15 May 94 NC1505182894 Beirut Radio Lebanon Arabic BFN [Unattributed commentary] [Excerpts] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher arrived in Damascus this evening on a new shuttle tour aimed at advancing the peace process, which is being obstructed because of Israel's intransigent positions. On his previous visit, the U.S. secretary left Damascus with queries about the Israeli proposals that he had conveyed to Syria. The proposals, which called for gradual Israeli withdrawal at long intervals, were rejected by Syria, which stressed the need for a full and comprehensive withdrawal to achieve a just and lasting peace. The chief of U.S. diplomacy knows that his current tour will not be any better than his previous ones if he fails to bring new Israeli ideas or acceptance of full withdrawal from the Golan and south Lebanon. U.S. State Department Spokesman Michael McCurry stressed prior to his chief's tour that Washington expects the peace process to be tough, suggesting that Christopher will find it difficult to push ahead the Syrian-Israeli track as long as negotiations continue to move in a vicious circle. It is clear that if Israel wants to apply the Gaza-Jericho model to the other tracks, then it will not be able to infiltrate the Syrian track, which is totally different from the others, especially the Palestinian one. Informed sources point out that Christopher's tour of the region is surrounded by risks and difficulties and will not achieve its objectives as long as the U.S. Administration does not pressure Israel into accepting full withdrawal in exchange for full peace. If Christopher ends his visit to Damascus stressing that his country will play an effective role in advancing the peaceful settlement--and this is exactly what Damascus is expecting from him--then Syrian officials will not say more than they did the last time: that they are awaiting his answers. If Christopher's tour fails this time, and doubts about its results came through the U.S. State Department spokesman who said that Christopher does not expect a major achievement from any of his upcoming tours, then this will shake the bases on which the Madrid peace conference was launched and that the Geneva summit between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton emphasized, namely, adopting international resolutions to implement the Israeli withdrawal. [passage omitted] Meanwhile, a Syrian media source stressed today that any peace not based on comprehensive peace will be doomed to failure. The source said Syria is not the PLO and is not interested in peace outside the framework of international resolutions and the U.S. initiative, which is based on the principle of exchanging land for peace. The Syrian source said Syria is expecting the American partner to play a responsible role, put things on the right track, and help Tel Aviv rulers decide to withdraw, dismantle settlements, and implement UN Security Council resolutions.
