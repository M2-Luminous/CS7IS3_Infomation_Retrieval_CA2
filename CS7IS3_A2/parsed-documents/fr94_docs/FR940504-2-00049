ACTION: Notice; reopening of comment period. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is reopening until June 3, 1994 the comment period for a notice that appeared in the Federal Register of January 14, 1994 (59 FR 2413). The document announced a public workshop on possible improvements in the drug master file (DMF) system. This action is based on a request for an extension of the comment period. DATES: Written comments by June 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit written comments regarding the workshop to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. Transcripts and summaries of the workshop are available from the Freedom of Information Office (HFI&hyph;35), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Eric P. Duffy, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (HFD&hyph;635), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;0360. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of January 14, 1994 (59 FR 2413), FDA announced that on January 31, 1994, the agency would be holding a public workshop on possible improvements in the DMF system, especially Type II DMF's, which concern drug substances, drug substance intermediates, and materials used in their preparation, or drug products. The workshop focused on alternative ways for the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) to review Type II DMF's for drug substances and intermediates. The agency announced that it would accept data, information, or views on this subject until March 14, 1994. The International Pharmaceutical Excipients Council (IPEC) requested that FDA extend the comment period for an additional 60 days. IPEC explained that several of its members could not attend the public workshop because of a scheduling conflict with the U.S. Pharmacopeia's Second Open Conference on Excipient Harmonization and that the members are reviewing the transcript and summary of the workshop. The purpose of reopening the comment period is to provide an opportunity for interested persons to submit comments for review by CDER in considering possible improvements in the DMF system. FDA believes that reopening the comment period until June 3, 1994, provides sufficient opportunity to comment on the workshop transcript and summary. Interested persons may, on or before June 3, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments regarding this notice. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Dated: April 26, 1994. Michael R. Taylor, Deputy Commissioner for Policy.
