It also urged the U.S. Administration to change the Israeli position in the peace negotiations. Syrian sources said that Ross' renewal of the Washington administration's commitment to achieving progress in the peace process is "positive, encouraging, reinforces the credibility of the U.S. role, and reflects Washington's wish to shoulder its moral and political responsibilities and to fulfill the promises and pledges it has made in the past to establish a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East." The Syrian sources, which reflect an official view, added that "logic says that compelling Israel to adhere to the foundations of the peace process is the only way to guarantee the achievement of the desired progress and to help to secure factors ensuring success for the peace process and to avert failure." The sources pointed out that Syria will respond to Washington's new obligations to establish a "lasting" peace. If this peace does not come, the situation will be like a temporary truce that could collapse at any moment and with the first shock. The sources stressed that Syria's eagerness to respond to the U.S. Administration's commitment to making the peace process in the region a success "stems from eagerness to recover the Arab land and rights in full.... Just as Syria is committed to these principles, it is also committed to the peace process as a historic opportunity that is supposed to eventually lead to the establishment of a real and strong peace based on the principles of right and justice." The sources pointed out that anyone who wants to advance the peace process "is urged to persuade the rulers of Tel Aviv...to recognize the principle of complete withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories."
