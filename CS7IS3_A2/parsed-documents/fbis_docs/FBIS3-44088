He told Radio Transkei he had not been told about his suspension, nor had he received any correspondence on the matter. The PAC on Saturday suspended three members -- Mr Toboti, Central Transkei Regional Secretary Mfanelo Skwatsha and Azanian National Youth League member Chargin Mabaso -- with immediate effect for violating procedures by raising party issues with the media. Mr Toboti Said: "It is very easy to start chaos and difficult to stop it. I don't want to participate in the death of the PAC. If they suspend me then 'die poppe sal dans' ('the sparks will fly')". He said he had been tried and convicted by PAC Secretary General Benny Alexander on the advice of "thugs". The PAC said it would comment later on Tuesday.
