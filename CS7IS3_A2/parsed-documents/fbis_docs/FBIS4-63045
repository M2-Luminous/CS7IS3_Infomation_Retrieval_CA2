The promise is made in a joint communique following the Moscow talks between the Russian government and company representatives. At the moment under the agreement Russia is exporting 95 percent of its diamonds through the central marketing organization of De Beers. However, during the past two years the South African side has been criticizing Russia for the appearance of small quantities of unregistered Russian diamonds in the world market. The Russian delegation to the talks was headed by the acting Minister of Finance Sergey Dubinin and the South African by the head of the De Beers central marketing organization Nicholas Oppenheimer. The communique says both sides remain loyal to the stability of the international diamond market and recognize their responsibility for its future. Participants hoped that the talks that should continue in the nearest future will lead to the restoration of a stable foundation for the continuation of bilateral cooperation.
