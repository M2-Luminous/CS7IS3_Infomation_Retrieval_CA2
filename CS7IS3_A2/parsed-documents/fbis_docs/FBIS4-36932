In this same connection, Robert Pelletreau, the American assistant Secretary of State, said while visiting the southern Persian Gulf nations: "We believe Iran intends to arm itself with modern weapons in the shortest time possible." Speaking with reporters before departing from Bahrain for Kuwait, he added: "We have consulted and exchanged views with our friends in the region concerning the threat from Iran to the Arab emirates." Pelletreau spoke of the threat from Iran and this country's becoming equipped with advanced weaponry at a time when the Islamic Republic of Iran's military budget is insignificant compared to the budgets of many of the countries in the region, including the emirates in the south Persian Gulf. It is worth mentioning that one of the ways Western companies, including American companies, sell chemical weapons to the Arab nations, is to claim that Iran is a threat to the security of the aforementioned countries, and that if the Arab nations of the Persian Gulf do not become equipped with advanced weaponry, they might be attacked by the Islamic Republic of Iran. In his press conference he claimed that Iran continues to threaten the oil-rich Arab nations of the Persian Gulf. America is now holding talks and negotiations with the Arabs to increase their defense and deterrent capability. It is to be noted that Iran has repeatedly opposed American opportunism in the region and the White House goal of strengthening its domination of the Persian Gulf. Iranian officials have emphasized that establishing security depends on cooperation among the Persian Gulf nations and removing foreigners from this region.
