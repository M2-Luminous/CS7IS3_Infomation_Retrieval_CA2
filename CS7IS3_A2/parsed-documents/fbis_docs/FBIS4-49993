FBIS4-49993 "drchi092_k_94011" FBIS-CHI-94-092 Daily Report 12 May 1994 NATIONAL AFFAIRS Political & Social Dissident Yu Haocheng Reportedly To Visit New York Dissident Yu Haocheng Reportedly To Visit New York HK1205014794 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST in English 12 May 94 p 1 HK1205014794 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST English BFN [By John Kohut in Beijing and Daniel Kwan] [Text] In another apparent concession to the United States to win renewal of most favoured nation (MFN) trading status, China is allowing a dissident scholar to visit New York after a two-year battle. Yu Haocheng -- who was officially accused of "plotting and instigating the counter-revolutionary rebellion" in 1989 -- said the authorities issued him with a passport this week and all he needed was a U.S. visa. He expected to depart at the end of the month. "I'm very happy, of course. I've been applying for permission for the past two or three years. I want to go out and learn new ideas," Mr Yu said yesterday. He will accept an invitation from Columbia University to spend up to a year there as a visiting scholar researching law, his field of expertise. He said he was not sure what role the MFN debate had played in his new-found freedom but observers said the permission was an attempt to prove that China was making the "significant progress" in human rights required by U.S. President Bill Clinton for extension of the special trade status. A diplomat in Washington said Mr Yu's case was one of the major "blocked-passport cases" that U.S. officials had discussed with Beijing. A dissident in Beijing said the development might be part of efforts to kick dissident leaders out of the country. Hong Kong-based lobbyist John Kamm yesterday welcomed the news, saying Mr Yu's had been "the most important case the US has been pressing" with China in the past few years. Mr Yu, 68, was arrested soon after the June 4, 1989, Beijing massacre, and held under round-the-clock guard at a school run by the paramilitary People's Armed Police for 18 months. He was eventually released with no charges being laid. A former director of the China Legal System and Social Development Research Institute, he incurred political hardliners' wrath after appealing in May 1989 for the student movement to be declared "patriotic." Shortly afterwards, the Chinese Government included him on a list of 40 "anti-party coalition" supporters of ousted Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang. Mr Yu, a member of the New York-based Human Rights in China group, said he was likely to meet Chinese human rights advocates in the U.S. But he said he believed it would be best for China, the U.S. and human rights advocates in China for MFN to be extended. Sources said a brother and a sister of former Tiananmen Square student leader Chai Ling were also likely to be given passports to leave the country.
