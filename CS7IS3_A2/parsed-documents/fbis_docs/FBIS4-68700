One of the weighty arguments of the Atlanticists, who advocate preservation of the alliance under U.S. leadership in the postcommunist era, is the need to preserve the West as a kind of unified whole. The fact that, in the opinion of many American experts, Turkey recently has been distancing itself from NATO and claiming leadership in the Islamic world, confirms once again the Western nature of this alliance. Many counties of Eastern Europe and the Baltic are literally bursting to get into NATO today, trying to return to the West--undoubtedly their ancient historical, cultural, and geopolitical bosom--as quickly as possible. If we stand on the ground of historical objectivity, we must recognize that, unlike many Eastern European countries, Russia was never a part of the West. Even if we disregard the adoption of Orthodoxy in the 10th Century, it is well-known that approximately from the time of Peter the Great, that is roughly from the first quarter of the 18th Century, Russia was one of the Great European powers and an inseparable component in maintaining the European balance of powers, but it did not become part of Europe. Despite the significant Europeanization of the ruling dynasty and dominant class, Russia was seen in Europe as an alien, expansionist, and Asiatic power. One of the primary reasons for this was the different manners of joint historical existence of the different peoples and ethnic groups. Whereas in the European empires the dominant, privileged nation stood out clearly, arrogantly classifying subordinate peoples as inferiors, trying to assimilate them by force and upholding imperial unity by force on the grounds that this nation itself was the representative of the Christian world, true civilization, and so on, and whereas in the later period the monoethnic nation states of Europe were formed by force and at the cost of great bloodshed and numerous wars among them to establish "natural" borders, on the other hand the formation of the Russian Empire differed fundamentally from this European model. The governing strata of the peoples who joined or were conquered were not annihilated, destroyed, nor deprived of their privileges; rather they were immediately taken into the ruling classes in Russia. What was demanded of them above all was devoted service to the empire. They and their peoples usually kept their unique religious, ethnic, and cultural features. Despite the periodic attempts of tsarist authorities at forced russification, the Russians who colonized the vast spaces of Eurasia did not become an imperial nation and did not act as the master people in relation to the ethnic groups who were conquered or annexed; assimilation was generally peaceful and painless. That is exactly why many peoples who were threatened with extinction as ethnic groups by more powerful neighbors joined Russia voluntarily, even though their leaders today prefer not to talk about this. It can be said without exaggeration that this difference between Russia and the West is a difference between civilizations. In other words, the Western model of the attitude toward different civilizations, ethnic groups, and cultures begins from an ideology of Eurocentrism according to which the entire world is a backward province of the West and must be civilized; this justifies their assimilation and Westernization, by force in the past and by other methods today, for their own good. In other words, it takes for granted the establishment of a universal pro-Western uniformity. The Russian model, by contrast, begins from exactly the opposite idea, that preservation of the diversity of spiritual worlds, ethnic groups, and cultures is the natural form of their mutual existence. Put differently, neither the Russian Empire nor the USSR was an empire in the classical, European sense of this word. One of the main reasons for the conflicts that have occurred and may occur on the periphery of the former USSR is exactly the fact that the leadership of a number of former Union republics, measuring everything by Western standards, are trying to create monoethnic nation states despite the artificiality of their borders. And this does not work for them because the small, separate ethnic groups and territories of these new states prefer the Russian model, which guarantees preservation of their unique ethnic and cultural features. In the European version there is a high probability that they would be lost. So whereas the West has reasons for a guarded attitude toward Russia because it is in fact a different civilization, the Russians have just as good grounds for the same attitude toward the West. After all, armed aggression from the West has come on the Russian land more than once, bringing a multitude of misfortunes, and it took great exertion of forces to defend our national independence. The historical memory of a nation is a reality which is formed by the centuries, and its action today manifests itself in an extremely guarded attitude toward possible enlargement of NATO and its drawing closer to Russia's borders. This is even more so when it appears that the West today, while renouncing forceful methods, has not changed its intentions regarding Russia. And they basically amount to the same civilizing mission, to assimilation of Russia, spiritually, ideologically, and culturally first of all, and later politically and economically. Through the "Partnership for Peace" program, the proposal of possible NATO membership, and on the defense level. If the West is able to get its way their will be a high probability of gradual establishment of pro-Western uniformity all across the planet, but before that there will be a global standoff on a North-South line and in this case the non-European peoples will naturally resist furiously. If Russia preserves and consolidates itself as an independent civilization and a unique political nation, then the natural form of human existence as a great diversity of civilizations, ethnic groups, and cultures will also be preserved. Russia does not need to walk always on a Western leash; it must come forward with a counter initiative which is linked to possibly joining the "Partnership" program. It can be proposed to NATO to form a joint, permanent headquarters for conducting peacekeeping operations in Europe, where an equal number of NATO and Russian officers would be working, headed alternately by NATO and Russian generals, who would be given special military units from both the Alliance countries and from Russia. They would be rapidly deployed under his command in the case of a crisis situation. This headquarters should be subordinate not to NATO, but to the U.N. Security Council, where Russian has a veto. The CSCE is still an amorphous forum, not even an international organization, and so it is not suitable for rapid response to a crisis. Such a headquarters can act as a regional or European branch of the U.N. military staff committee, which is permitted by the Charter of this organization. This version of Russia-NATO partnership would put an end to the deeply-rooted historical distrust of Russians for Western military activity, even under the U.N. flag, and the possible engagement of mixed forces close to Russian borders would not arouse fears. On the other hand, a serious step would be taken in the direction of creating a multipolar, and therefore more stable, postcommunist world order. For their part, the United States and NATO would get a weighty, truly peace-oriented, and not just Western but all-European substantiation for extending the existence of the bloc, which they have been trying so hard to find since the end of the cold war. It should also be stated that Russia does not intend to join NATO, even if it joins the "Partnership" program. Such membership is unacceptable for Russia because of its Eurasian location and the possibility of serious complications of relations, primarily with China. As for the East Europeans, Russia has no power to stop their return to the West, but it is possible to try to direct this process into a course that is more acceptable. It can be suggested that for a start they join the Western European alliance, the EC defense structure, toward which Russia does not have the negative attitude that it has toward NATO.
