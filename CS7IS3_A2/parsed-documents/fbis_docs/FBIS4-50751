He made the suggestion while on tour of the north China port city of Tianjin from May 15-18. Qiao, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, visited a number of factories, a duck farm and a TV transmission tower in Tianjin. During his tour he said that the expansion of township-run enterprises and the construction of small cities will change the face of China's countryside and absorb surplus labor effectively as well. He told local officials that as long as Tianjin tries to deepen reforms and open wider to the rest of the world, it will certainly achieve greater development and promote opening up and economic growth in the whole of north China. Qiao, who is also a standing committee member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, praised the Tianjin municipal leaders for paying close attention to intensifying enterprise restructuring. The invigoration of major state-owned enterprise makes it imperative to guide them in orienting themselves with the market and improve their economic returns, he noted. These enterprises should be encouraged to import sophisticated technology and managerial expertise so as to improve their production processes, the quality of their products and their management, he said. Moreover, it is necessary to promote vocational training in various forms among workers, and relieve enterprises' financial burdens by introducing a social security system in order to create a good environment for these enterprises to develop, he added.
