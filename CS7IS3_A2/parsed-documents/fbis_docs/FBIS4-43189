Are you satisfied with the actions being taken by the United Nations Secretary General and his staff or do you think it would be better if some mechanism could be found for the Greek and the Turkish Cypriot sides to talk together without being compelled or threatened? [Denktas] "Frustration" I think is the word!.. We had worked hard with the representative of the Secretary-General until 23.00 hours on 31 May 1994 and gave our views to him in writing. We had said "yes" to almost everything and yet, next day, in spite of the seven hours' difference between New York and Cyprus, the effort of 31 May was not even referred to by the Secretary-General, whose report was dated 30 May. He did not think it necessary to put a new paragraph in his report and thus inform the Security Council of the latest developments. We have now requested the Secretary-General to make a second report and give the Security Council a full picture of the latest position. (Yesterday the Secretary-General announced that he would submit a supplementary report to the Security Council which outlines the further progress made towards a settlement to the Cyprus problem.) The report has created great uproar amongst the Turkish people, both in Turkey and in the TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]. This is not helpful for the negotiations. Loss of confidence between the parties to the conflict and the secretariat should be avoided. The Secretary General has proposed that a new way be found for tackling the problem. I would say that what we need is a new diagnosis of the problem. The problem arose in 1963 when the Greek Cypriot partner in the Partnership Republic tried to convert a bicommunal republic into a Greek Cypriot Republic. The problem became utterly intractable when the Security Council, in its wisdom, treated the wrongdoer as the legitimate government of Cyprus. The problem has not been solved for 30 years because Greek Cypriot preference is to keep the title of "the government of Cyprus" and reap the political and monetary benefits which go with this title... As the Turkish Cypriot partner refuses to recognize the Greek Cypriot pretence to be the government of Cyprus the problem drags on... Under the 1960 Agreements and the Constitution of the island one community cannot rule the other nor can any one community claim to be the government of the whole island... but for the recognition afforded to the Greek Cypriot regime by the Security Council, the pretenders to power in Cyprus, would by now be facing charges for offenses against humanity before an international Court of Justice. I have asked for direct talks with Mr. Kliridhis but he refuses to meet me, saying that if he meets me his status will be lowered or mine be elevated to his status... Fear of losing what he knows is not his prevents him from talking to me face to face. [TURKISH DAILY NEWS] You have been quoted in the Turkish press within the last two weeks as saying that: you believe it is time to consider some form of union with Turkey; it might be a good idea to sign an agreement with the Greek Cypriots pledging not to attack each other; and you are willing to continue talking about the Confidence Building Measures including those aspects which were agreed upon during the Vienna meetings. Would you comment on these please? [Denktas] The Greek Cypriot application for admission to the European Union (EU) as "Cyprus" is an unacceptable, legally void act... By this act the Greek Cypriot side is trying to integrate with Greece via the EU! This is contrary to the Treaty of Establishment. This act is contrary to the principles of modern democracy. In Cyprus, even under the 1960 Constitution the two communities elected their representatives separately. Legitimacy in the Executive and in Parliament arose when the democratically elected representatives of the two communities took up office jointly! In his December 1963 coup, Makarios aimed to destroy the democratic institutions of the Turkish Cypriot partner but failed to do so. Turkish Cypriots continued to rule themselves through their democratically elected representatives even after the destruction of the 1960 Republic... That is why the Greek Cypriot leaders cannot represent the whole population of the island... The Secretary-General, fully aware of this situation, ruled that any application for EU membership should be through separate referenda of the two communities. In spite of all this, the EU is encouraging the Greek Cypriots to believe that their acceptance "as Cyprus" to EU membership is a matter of months. If this process continues and we see a real danger that it will materialize then we have to make a counter move in order to avoid one sided integration with Greece... We have to find ways and means of integrating with Turkey. "What is good for the goose should be good for the gander" is a good saying!... Look at what the Greek Cypriots are doing vis-a-vis Greece. Defense agreements; giving sea and air bases to Greece; agreement to speak with one voice on Cyprus; social, educational economic agreements with Greece. All these are between the Greek Cypriots and Greece... and all, for the advancement of the national "cause." All these in complete disregard of the views, feelings and rights of Turkish Cypriot side!... If we do not plan a counter action we shall be wiped off the map of Cyprus like the Cretan Turks in the 1900s!... We have to take counter action in self-defense... We shall integrate with Turkey in line with Greek Cypriot integration with Greece... There is no other way. We do not want to be colonized by Greece and the Greek Cypriots have no right to pull us into the EU when economically and politically we are not ready for it!... We have our democratic institutions able to express the political will of our people on such matters. But we have not even been asked our views by the so-called Government of Cyprus. If the EU wants a settlement in Cyprus it should tell the Greek Cypriot leaders that they have no right to apply for EU membership in the absence of a separate mandate from the Turkish side!... I have repeatedly invited the Greek Cypriot leaders to sign a non-aggression agreement with us so that people on both sides relax and peace initiatives are given a better chance... I invited Kiprianou, Vasiliou and now Kliridhis... Each time their answer has been the same: if they sign such an agreement with us, this will be tantamount to recognition!... But my initiatives are on a communal basis. I say let us sign these agreements as community leaders and let us put a clear clause with them that such agreements in no way mean recognition for either party... Their answer is the same... The fear of losing the "title" of the government of Cyprus is too deep in their hearts... They know that they have no legitimate right to present themselves as "the Government of Cyprus" and they fear that the smallest mistake may cause this false title to slide away from them!... The Vienna accord has to be part and parcel of the 21 March paper... If so, we are ready to start negotiating on this paper... [TURKISH DAILY NEWS] The Greek Cypriots have been arming themselves ever further and a Jane's Defense Weekly article has just appeared in which it is written that they spent over 500 million dollars this past year on arms which included offensive weapons. Would you comment on this? What about the report over the weekend in Turkey that the Greek Cypriots and the Greeks have, at least for the time being, abandoned the idea of signing a mutual defense pact? [Denktas] The purchase of arms is in its fourth year. Countries which are permanent members of the Security Council keep on selling arms to what they consider to be "the Government of Cyprus" while the Security Council calls upon the two sides not to do anything which might exacerbate the situation!... Each day Greek Cypriot leaders tell us why they are arming! They will carry the Greek flag to the north! How can anyone talk of a new partnership government with these people when such war cries go on. If the Security Council does not review the facts of Cyprus and does not have a look at the Rule of Law, this dangerous trend will continue and the Greek Cypriot attempt to convert Cyprus into a Greek island will not stop... That has to stop if the two sides are to be good neighbors in the future. The news item that the Greek Cypriots and Greece have abandoned the idea of signing an initial defense pact for the time being is no comfort to us. Greek generals come and go to south Cyprus for the implementation of this agreement. Greece is clandestinely sending 90 renovated tanks to Cyprus under this agreement. Search and preparation for air and sea bases continue unhindered... Are all these compatible with what the Secretary-General is trying to do in Cyprus? Of course not!... But the "good Greeks" are never censured for these misdeeds. [TURKISH DAILY NEWS] There have been two shooting incidents at Lefka in which shots were fired at Turkish positions from the Greek Cypriot side. At the same time two Turks who were in southern Cyprus were killed last week. Has any explanation of either incident been forthcoming from the Greek Cypriots (as opposed to what has been written in their newspapers)? Do you think these were ill-considered attempts to provoke the northern side into reaction? [Denktas] Hardly 300 Turkish Cypriots live in the south. Twenty-two of them have recently been severely beaten and forced to walk over to the north under threats of being shot. A few days ago, masked Greek Cypriots brutally killed two Turkish Cypriots living with them in the south.. And border disturbances, firing shots at random are becoming more and more "popular pastimes" on the Greek Cypriot side... "The best Turk is a dead Turk" is a popular saying amongst Greek Cypriot youth!.. [TURKISH DAILY NEWS] Is there anything NATO can do to bring about a just settlement to the Cyprus problem? Or would it be better if that organization didn't become involved at all? [Denktas] This is the shape of things... and these are the difficulties which confront us and perfectly frustrate the Secretary-General... But I am adamant in my view that what prevents a settlement is the treatment of the Greek Cypriot side as the legitimate government of Cyprus. Some authority has to tell the Greek Cypriot side that this title does not given them any authority over the Turkish Cypriot partner of the defunct State who now live in the North under their own democratic regime... The way to a settlement is to talk face to face and seek a solution which will be just, viable and permanent. Mr. Hugo Gobbi, the former Special Representative of the Secretary- General in Cyprus, has just written a pamphlet under the eye-opening title of "Rethinking Cyprus." Mr. Gobbi loves Cyprus and has good friends in North and South. He writes passionately from his experience and points out the way to peace. His recipe is short and sound. "Land for recognition and cooperation as good neighbors" is what he says. The rest should be left to time, to evolution.
