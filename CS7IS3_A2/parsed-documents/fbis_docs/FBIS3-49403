[Granic] Good evening. [Correspondent] Minister, what is most interesting is the 17.5 percent [of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina] that Croatia is asking for the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, and here I can see some towns that would be included in the territorial division of that republic. [Granic] During the latest negotiations in Brussels, the European Union accepted that the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna should have 17.5 percent of the territory. Croatia today put forward not only a contractual agreement on the settlement, a cease-fire, and the overall regulation of Croat-Muslim relations within the three-republic union, but also said that should the union disintegrate, an alliance of states between the Bosnian Muslim and the Croatian states will be created. As you can see, this map is a Croatian proposal for the settlement. You can also see that the Croatian side has made no concessions on Neum and that a very important economic and ethnic part of the Croat-populated area has been encompassed. [Correspondent] Minister, please tell us whether negotiations are continuing, or are we now waiting for something to happen by 15 January. [Granic] The Muslim side accepted this proposal with a great deal of interest. Mr. Alija Izetbegovic himself said he will support this proposal. What we discussed most was how to halt all offensive actions, particularly those carried out by Bosnian Muslim forces against central Bosnia. It should be also said that no agreement has been reached regarding a settlement in central Bosnia. Talks on Mostar are to continue in Medjugorje on Thursday. Talks on the final economic access to the sea are also continuing. [Correspondent] Minister, please tell us the most interesting thing: An urgent cease-fire for central Bosnia has been agreed. How is this going to be done? [Granic] In agreement with Mr. Akashi, Mr. Stoltenberg has already organized a meeting between the military commanders, Generals Roso and Delic. President Izetbegovic is to issue an order to General Delic to halt all offensive actions. The Croat side will strictly observe the cease-fire. [Correspondent] Thank you very much, Minister.
