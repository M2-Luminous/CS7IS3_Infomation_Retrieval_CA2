According to Coexistence representatives, the present government should sign the European charters on local self-administration and regional languages by September. According to Duray, if the government fails to sign the two documents, Coexistence will consider whether it wants to continue supporting the government. We have asked representatives of the coalition parties whether the agreement between the coalition and the Hungarian parties is being fulfilled and whether the commitment to sign the two aforementioned European charters forms part of the agreement. Vojtech Bugar, chairman of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement: It is true that we would be glad if the two charters were signed, and it does not matter whether this happens in September or October. However, this issue is not part of the agreements between the coalition and us. In other words, we cannot demand that the government sign the documents. The eight points of the agreement that we discussed during the government's formation are being successively fulfilled. They could be fulfilled quicker, in our opinion, but claiming that the government is not fulfilling our demands is too strong a statement. The passage of the law on [birth, marriage, and death] registers and the prepared law on bilingual signs furnish clear evidence of the fulfillment of mutual agreements. Even a blind person must see that. Therefore, I cannot agree with Mr. Duray's view published in the press. Ultimately, his words will be abused by the opposition and the mass media, which is unfortunate. This will complicate our efforts to prove that the ethnic Hungarian parties are capable of effective cooperation with the Slovak Government. We do not have the moral right to link the support of Jozef Moravcik's government to the signing of the aforementioned European charters because such an agreement simply does not exist. Jozef Moravcik, chairman of Democratic Union: During the formation of the government, we held talks with the Hungarian parties and explained to them the government's coarse of action in matters that are of interest to them. The result of these talks was that everything on which we agree would be contained in the government's policy statement, which is what happened. There exists no other document, apart from the policy statement, in which we would commit ourselves to something. I see no reason for the Hungarian side to arrive at the conclusion that was suggested by Mr. Duray--that is, to stop supporting this government. Jan Carnogursky, chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement: The present government coalition's promise to the Hungarian parties was that we would meet the Council of Europe recommendations--that is, we would resolve the problem of Christian and family names and the problem of bilingual signs. We also agreed that we would not deal before the elections with the issue of alternative education and the territorial and administrative arrangement. At the same time, we have not abandoned these ideas. There exists no written document about all of this. The coalition did not undertake to sign the European charters on local self-administration and regional languages. It is true that the Coexistence Movement had proposed this in the initial phase of talks, but we did not come to an agreement on this issue. Ludovit Cernak, chairman of the National Democratic Party-New Alternative: I was present at all talks that preceded the formation of the present coalition and declare that there exists neither an agreement with the Hungarian parties nor a relevant supplement to the original coalition agreement. Everything that had been agreed upon at these talks and that was approved by all of the coalition partners is being complied with and honored. Likewise, I do not know anything about a commitment adopted by the coalition to sign the charters on local self-administration and regional languages by September. [passage omitted]
