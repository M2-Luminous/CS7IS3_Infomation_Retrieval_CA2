Roderick] [Text] Mmabatho March 11 SAPA -- Bophuthatswana President Lucas Mangope announced on Friday [11 March] he would recommend to a special sitting of the Bophuthatswana Parliament on Tuesday next week that the homeland participate in the April elections. In the statement issued by the President's Office he said he had disclosed this in advance because of the urgency and gravity of the current political situation, "and in the hope that this would make a positive contribution to resolving tension and uncertainty in the region". He said the North-Western Christian Democratic Party had been registered with the Independent Electoral Committee which he intended to "vigorously lead in the elections to demonstrate where the sympathies of the people of the North-West Province lie". Mr Mangope said this announcement should "de-legitimise" all reason for strikes and other actions because it addressed the major concerns that have been raised. He voiced his support for continuing mediation on outstanding constitutional issues and would participate in negotiations to that end.
