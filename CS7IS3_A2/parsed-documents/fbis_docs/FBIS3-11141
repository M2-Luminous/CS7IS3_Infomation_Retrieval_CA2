These changes are not well understood abroad, but the government continues implementing them because we are fully convinced that we will overcome the current difficulties. The changes, which also have an important influence on foreign relations and seek to meet the needs of the new times, began in 1990. They are part of a reorganization process aimed at making governmental actions meet the dynamic international changes that have had a dramatic impact on the lives of Cubans. These comments were made by Luis Suarez, a Cuban expert on international matters who heads the Cuban Center for Latin American Studies. Suarez was specially invited for President Frei's installation and has held several talks on the Cuban situation with Chilean Government experts and Chilean Foreign Ministry officials. In Suarez' opinion, the current Cuban process cannot be called a transition process because these changes began 35 years ago. Considering the U.S. policy regarding Cuba, which is translated into an economic blockade, he does not believe the Cuban situation is critical: [Begin Suarez recording] A country that is only 90 miles away from the United States, a country that has had its national identity attacked by a power as huge as that of the United States -- which lies hardly 90 miles from its borders -- finds the task of building a national and popular democracy very hard, complex, and arduous. Such a task cannot be achieved overnight. Therefore, when people talk to me about a Cuban transition, I tell them that the Cuban transition began 35 years ago when Fulgencio Batista's brutal military dictatorship was ousted and Cuba began to build this superior sort of democracy that all peoples in the world should yearn to have. [end recording] Suarez' option for the type of government being enforced in his country did not prevent him from seeing the difficulties faced by the Cuban Government. He said the economic blockade is a powerful obstacle to any sort of change and has a dramatic impact on the people. Paradoxically, he admitted that if the blockade were suspended, it would have a conflictive impact on his country. Suarez believes that a society that is blocked and besieged develops a culture appropriate to that type of harassment. In his opinion, however, it is important to count on active and concrete international solidarity. He pointed out that this solidarity was translated into $50 million last year and it has prevented the island from being ideologically isolated.
