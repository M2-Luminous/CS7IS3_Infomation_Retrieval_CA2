EIB announced yesterday that the drachma issue is "timed to coincide with the move of the Greek capital market toward full liberalisation." This is the first ever Greek-drachma denominated bond issued by a non-resident issuer, as well as the first-term debt drachma security carrying a fixed interest rate. The bond, underwritten by some 20 Greek and foreign banks, is co-financed by Hellenic Industrial Development Bank (ETVA). Underwriting banks include ABN-AMRO, Paribas, Barclays, Bayerische, BNP, Citibank, Dresdner, Natwest, and Midland. The issue is for a five-year term, due on 8 March 1999, and carries a coupon of 17.5 percent. Bonds will be issued in bearer form in denominations of one million, five million, 10 million and 50 million drachmas. Applications will be made to list the titles on the Athens and Luxembourg stock exchanges. Luxembourg-based EIB notes that it will henceforth "be better placed to continue developing its lending in Greece, by matching closer the funding needs of Greek project promoters."
