FR941122-2-00114 FR941122-2-00083 Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee; Production Certification Working Group AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of task amendment for the Production Certification Working Group. SUMMARY: This notice informs the public of an amendment to the original task assigned to the Production Certification Working Group of the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Daniel P. Salvano, Aircraft Certification Service (AIR&hyph;3), 800 Independence avenue S.W., Washington, D.C. 20591, Telephone: (202) 267&hyph;9554; FAX (202) 267&hyph;5364. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has established the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) (56 FR 2190; January 22, 1991, and 58 FR 9230; February 19, 1993). One issue being addressed by ARAC is aircraft certification procedures. This issue involves the procedures for aircraft certification found in parts 21, 39, and 183 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), and Special Federal Aviation Regulation No. 36 (SFAR 36), which are the responsibility of the FAA Director, Aircraft Certification Service. On March 19, 1993, the Production Certification Working Group was established, and notice of establishment was published in the Federal Register on March 29, 1993 (58 FR 16574). This Working Group was charged with making recommendations to the ARAC concerning the modernization of requirements applicable to production approval holders in subparts, F, G, H, J, K, and O of FAR Part 21. After the task was assigned, it became apparent that subpart L of FAR Part 21 and subparts A and B of FAR Part 45 should have been included in the review; therefore, the Production Certification Working Group task statement is amended to include subpart L of FAR Part 21 and subparts A and B of FAR Part 45. Task: The task statement assigned to the Production Certification Working Group is, therefore, amended to read as follows: The Production Certification Working Group is charged with making recommendations to the ARAC concerning the modernization of requirements applicable to production approval holders in subparts F, G, H, J, K, L, and O of FAR Part 21 and subparts A and B of Part 45. These recommendations involve streamlining the rules to establish a more modern, standardized set of production approval requirements more responsive to current industry production practices. The Production Certification Working Group will submit recommendations to the ARAC, which will determine whether to forward them to the FAA. Issued in Washington, DC, on October 21, 1994. Daniel P. Salvano, Assistant Executive Director ARAC on Aircraft Certification Procedures. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;28726 Filed 11&hyph;21&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;13&hyph;M
