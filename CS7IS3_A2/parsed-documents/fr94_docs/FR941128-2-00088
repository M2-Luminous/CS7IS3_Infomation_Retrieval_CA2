FR941128-2-00088 FR941128-2-00046 The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed Order, and it is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed Order or to modify in any way their terms. Donald S. Clark, Secretary. Concurring Statement of Commissioner Mary L. Azcuenaga In American Home Products Corp., File No. 941&hyph;0116 Today, the Commission accepts for public comment a consent agreement settling charges that American Home Products' proposed acquisition of American Cyanamid Company is likely substantially to lessen competition in the markets for three existing diphtheria and tetanus vaccines and substantially to lessen competition to develop a new rotavirus vaccine and to develop and produce cytokines. This appears to be a strong antitrust case, but I seriously question whether the remedy is sufficient. Under the order, the divestiture of tetanus and diphtheria vaccine assets is limited to certain intellectual property, including formulations, patents, trade secrets, technology, and know-how. The divestiture is structured so that, as a practical matter, the only firms that could acquire the assets in question are firms that in my opinion already would satisfy the tests under the law for potential entrants. In short, the order will not restore the competition lost as a result of the acquisition. Instead, the Commission should require the divestiture of a viable business unit, even if that business unit produces and sells products other than the vaccines in question.
