FR940826-2-00182 FR940826-2-00099 Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 165␣/␣Friday, August 26, 1994␣/␣Notices DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing [Docket No. N&hyph;94&hyph;3720; FR&hyph;3617&hyph;N&hyph;03] Amendment to NOFA for Fiscal Year 1994 for Indian Applicants Under the HOME Program AGENCY: Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, HUD. ACTION: Notice of amendment to Fiscal Year (FY) 1994 Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) for Indian HOME Program. SUMMARY: This notice modifies the Fiscal Year (FY) 1994 Indian HOME NOFA to reflect statutory changes regarding environmental review requirements, as amended in the Multifamily Housing Property Disposition Reform Act of 1994. This notice also includes a modification to Appendix 1. List of Local Offices of Native American Programs, specifically pertaining to the Denver Office and clarifies the process for addressing computational errors in the rating and ranking of applications. DATES: The application due date is not affected by this notice. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dom Nessi, Director, Office of Native American Programs, Room 4140, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410, telephone (202) 708&hyph;1015. A telecommunications device for speech and/or hearing impaired persons (TDD) is available at (202) 708&hyph;0850. (These are not toll-free telephone numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This notice amends the FY 94 NOFA for Indian Applicants under the HOME Program (59 FR 11424; March 10, 1994) at section I.(e)(4)(iii)(C), which deals with the selection criteria pertaining to environmental review. The amendment is made to reflect changes resulting from The Multifamily Housing Property Disposition Reform Act of 1994 (MHPDR ACT) (Pub. L. 102&hyph;233, approved April 11, 1994). The changes involve removing the requirement that after rating and ranking but before selection for award, HUD Field ONAPs will perform an environmental review of applications in accordance with 24 CFR part 50, and that applications may be reranked or disqualified on the basis of the environmental review. These provisions are replaced with the provision that after rating and ranking, applicants with the highest scores will be selected and offered awards. The grantee must assume responsibility for completing the environmental review of the project under 24 CFR part 58. In accordance with 24 CFR part 58, until the grantee completes its environmental review and obtains a release of funds from HUD, the grantee may not commit HOME funds to activities (unless the activities are exempt from review under 24 CFR part 58), or expend any other funds for activities unless they are exempt or would not have an adverse environmental impact or limit the choice of reasonable alternatives. However, a grantee may expend HOME or other funds on environmental reviews, exempt under 24 CFR part 58, before obtaining a release of funds to be used for non-exempt purposes from HUD. This notice adds a new paragraph I.(e)(4)(iii)(E) which clarifies that unsuccessful applicants may notify the ONAP, within 90 days of being informed of their score, of computational errors in the rating and ranking. This paragraph provides for the correction of such errors in rating and ranking and, if the error denied funding of the applicant, provides for funding the application in subsequent funding cycles. This notice also amends Appendix 1 of the FY 1994 Indian Home Program NOFA by including a new address for the Denver Office of Native American Programs. Accordingly, the following modifications are made in FR Doc. 94&hyph;5535 to the NOFA titled, ``NOFA For Fiscal Year 1994 For Indian Applicants Under The HOME Program'', published on March 10, 1994 (59 FR 11424): 1. On page 11429, paragraph I.(e)(4)(iii)(C), which appears in the first column, is revised to read as follows: (C) Selection. The ranking process will produce an ordered list of projects that may receive funding. The order is established by the number of points the project received in the rating process. The eligibility requirement for further consideration will be 50 out of 100 points. Project applications scoring lower than 50 points will be set aside as non-responsive and ineligible. After rating and ranking, applicants with the highest scores will be selected and offered awards. The grantee must assume responsibility for completing the environmental review of the project under 24 CFR part 58. In accordance with 24 CFR part 58, until the grantee completes its environmental review and obtains a release of funds from HUD, the grantee may not commit HOME funds to activities (unless the activities are exempt from review under 24 CFR part 58), or expend any other funds for activities unless they are exempt or would not have an adverse environmental impact or limit the choice of reasonable alternatives. Environmental studies are exempt under 24 CFR part 58 and therefore a grantee may expend HOME or other funds on environmental reviews before obtaining a release of funds to be used for non-exempt purposes from HUD. For the purposes of geographic diversity, HUD may award at least one grant to each of the areas covered by the Offices of Indian Programs listed in Appendix 1. 2. On page 11429, a new paragraph I.(e)(4)(iii)(E) is added to read as follows: (E) Errors in rating and ranking. Applicants may bring computational errors in the rating and ranking of applications to the attention of ONAP within 90 days of being informed of their score. If an ONAP review determines that there was a computational error that denied funding to the applicant, the applicant will be funded out of remaining funds in the challenged round of funding, or out of the next available round of funding. 3. On page 11430, in Appendix 1., which appears in the first column, the address for the Denver Office of Native American Programs is revised to read as follows: Region VIII_Denver, Office of Native American Programs, First Interstate Tower North, 633 17th Street, Denver, Colorado 80202&hyph;3607, 303&hyph;672&hyph;5467, TDD Number: 303672&hyph;5259.
