He stressed: "The issue should be settled between the parties concerned. The international community should not expect too much from China." In this way he indicated that there is certain limitation to China's role. The ambassador made it clear that China's basic position that the Korean peninsula should be denuclearized and nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) should be carried out remains unchanged. But he added: "The issue should be settled through patient dialogue, and we do not agree to the idea of applying pressure, such as economic sanctions," thus holding a move toward imposing economic sanctions against North Korea in check.
