Since yesterday, Radio Rebelde, and particularly the Doing Radio program, has been reporting on the campaign of violence unleashed against the Cuban emigres who participated in the Nation and the Emigre Community conference. What is your opinion? [Robaina] I believe that to any Cuban who truly feels the process we are undergoing, and is particularly interested in and wishing to establish normal ties, such attitudes require nothing else but the most determined and timely rejection. I believe that this shows the political barbarism of the far right of that Cuban community. This demonstrates the behavior of those we have called hysterics. When we announced the conference and stated that hysteria was not invited, I believe that the hysteria, seeing itself not invited, refused to relinquish a forum and its forum continues to be hysteria. However, I am fully convinced that hysteria is challenged by valor, dignity, and courage. This is why I believe that people such as Magda [Montiel] and hundreds of others, who have yet to become the target of these attacks ....[pauses] I believe we have to realize that they act in this manner because we have touched a nerve. Anything promoting civilized reconciliation, a common path, and the kind of understanding that took place in the conference, hurts them. I do not believe that this requires comment. In my opinion what this requires is boldness, valor, and commitment. What I want to stress is that Cubans such as Magda, who acted and continue to act as they have done, will not lack the support, backing, understanding, and solidarity of those of us here.
