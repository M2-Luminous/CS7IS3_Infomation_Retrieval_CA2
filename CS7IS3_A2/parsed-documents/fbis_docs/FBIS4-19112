A majority of countries overruled objections from Britain, Denmark and the Netherlands that tighter controls were protectionist and unnecessary. The new regulations, due to come into effect on May 15, provide that the fish from foreign boats can be off-loaded only at designated ports where they can be subjected to EU health and veterinary controls. The imported fish will also have to be sold at prices which do not under-cut minimum levels set each year by the EU or by producer organisations at the port of entry. The new rules do not apply to fish imports for processing plants.
