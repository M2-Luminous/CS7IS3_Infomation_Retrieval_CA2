The sources said an additional $260,000 will be granted for various training programs and donation of equipment to the self-rule government of Palestinians this year. The financial support will be studied with the PLO side when a legitimate recipient body is set up in the autonomous region, the sources said. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) agreed early this month in Jerusalem to provide $25 million to the Palestinian Housing Council to build houses for poor families in the village of Jabalia in the Gaza Strip. The sources said the government will consult with the PLO over which projects the fund will be financed when the Palestinian outlet is formed in the autonomous territory. The $10 million will come from the Economic Development and Cooperation Fund (EDCF) which is managed by the government to help developing nations. The other $260,000 in aid will be used to train 10 Palestinians in the manufacturing field here, and to send two Korean experts and construction equipment there this year. The sources said that set-up of a legitimate body to receive the financial support will be speeded up as Israel and the PLO signed an agreement in Cairo last Wednesday on security issues, including who will monitor the Palestinian border crossing. The Korean embassy in Jordan has been instructed to closely watch the development of Palestinian autonomy in connection with the aid program, the sources said. The embassy in Jordan handles affairs to the PLO with which Korea has no diplomatic relations.
