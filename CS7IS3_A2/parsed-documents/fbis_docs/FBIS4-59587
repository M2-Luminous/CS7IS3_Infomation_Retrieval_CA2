In a statement, the party called on the honorable Kurds--the descendants of Salah-al-Din--to close their ranks, escalate their daily struggle, and to trigger the spark of a major, comprehensive popular uprising in Kurdistan against the murderous agents of foreigners and to liberate Kurdistan from their filth. The party called for putting an end to those reckless, criminal murderers' encroachments against the Kurds' rights, property, and souls and to evict them from the cities to the mountains and valleys, where they can fight each other like hungry wolves and settle scores any way they want. The lives of innocent children, women, and elderly people, whose only fault is that they live under the control of those gangs, should be maintained. The party appealed for evicting those beasts to the mountains and valleys.
