Nowhere have I ever spoken of any scenarios of political events in Slovenia and for this reason such an explanation is not possible. In light of the debate at the 28 March extraordinary session of the State Chamber, I presume that these were my statements made at the deputies' evening in Nova Gorica, which was on 23 February. Your conclusion, that is to say, demand allows me to use my constitutional right and duty to tell this high house, and through it the wider public, how I view the situation in Slovenia, that is to say, how I viewed it in Nova Gorica. I decided to appear in person because I feel firmly bound by my constitutional responsibility and the moral obligations that I have as a president of the state to draw attention to the issues concerning the observation of constitutionality and legality, the protection of human rights, and internal political stability and security of the state. I believe it is not sufficient for me to send my opinions, warnings, initiatives, and proposals only to the incumbent ministers, the government, and the State Chamber, but find it necessary and warranted to address the public, too, and warn it about the tendencies and the occurrences that are, in my opinion, deeply harmful for the interests of the citizens of our state, its stability and future, and its position and reputation in the world. I have no direct authority to resolve these issues. However, with a public word I wish to assist in a creative release of social tensions attached to the fundamental questions of the state and in the resolution of the existential problems of the Slovene citizens, especially the problems of their social and legal security. [passage omitted] Even though I have explained the contents, the meaning, and the aims of this appearance [in Nova Gorica] in the media on several occasions I shall do this once again in front of the State Chamber. However, I do not understand why my appearance in Nova Gorica was not presented adequately in the media, if it really gave rise to so many doubts, questions, and also manipulations and misinterpretations. It is interesting to note that even those who concerned themselves the most with this message have failed to do so. Had this been the case, the Slovene citizens would have learned, as is their right, what the president of the republic actually said. They would form their own judgment about what was said, without middlemen and interpreters, especially those who can merely think in terms of dark scenarios and major conspiracies. This is a matter of conscience and responsibility of those people who are building their political work on deliberate falsification and disrespect for authenticity. If anyone recognizes his own pattern of thinking and behavior in my critical warning that a highly disturbing belief that objectives justify the means is gaining prominence in our political practice, then this is a matter of his conscience and also a matter of his responsibility for the damage done to society. This is a responsibility for deliberate falsification and violation of the authenticity of the spoken word, or to say it directly, some people have obviously taken lies for proofs. My assessments and warnings put forward in Nova Gorica referring to cases of unlawful behavior and social anomalies and tendencies in political life were not the first of their kind. I have spoken similarly on several occasions before. However, because of the thoroughness and credibility of the information which was published publicly there were no manipulations, fabrications, and speculations with my words then. My speeches in the papers are accessible to anyone. In none of these speeches or writings is there any basis for the claims that I was announcing any sort of scenarios of events and liquidations and favored the use of all means to defeat a political opponent. Such interpretation of my words means perversion and deliberate imputation of what I have explicitly rejected. Quite the opposite is the truth. I demand that the politicians act as a cohesive factor, seek consensus of as many as possible segments of the society, and create the conditions for a peaceful and creative life of the people. I am opposed to politicians currently deepening the existing divisions or causing new divisions among the people. I am convinced that this is disastrous for the survival and the future of the Slovene nation. Esteemed deputies! I have handed you an exact transcript of what I said in Nova Gorica. From it you will easily conclude that the message of my speech consisted of three essential parts. In the first part I, as the president of the state, again explained my political project. I strive for parallel coexistence of various beliefs, pluralism, and reconciliation. I understand reconciliation as an inevitable coexistence of various convictions about the truth, as a resistance against the repression of only one truth in the name of which it would be allowed to attack all other truths and liquidate their champions. Here I am also referring to the tragic experiences from World War II and the period directly after it. In the second part I expressed my regret because the Slovene political scene has became so pronouncedly divided while confrontation and uncooperativeness have become the basic principles of the life on it. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the principle that he who is not with us is against us is winning a right of domicile on this scene. This logic transforms an opponent into an enemy and permits all means to defeat the enemy, even those that are absolutely contrary to the fundamental principles of democracy, therefore, disqualifications and liquidations, if necessary even physical. This is the merciless logic of this principle and it should be borne in mind. I, therefore, spoke of a political method that is striving to assert itself in Slovenia. I opposed it, and I warned where this method could lead. [passage omitted] I would like to stress particularly that for almost a year I have been warning about the damaging processes that have cut deeply into the working environments, communities, and even families and have already had their fateful effect on the nation as a whole, dividing it. I believe that you can see this for yourselves. This is no longer about identification with one political leader and rejection of other political leaders, this is about undermining of credibility and trust in the legitimate institutions of the system, including the parliament, the government, and the legislation. Therefore, I did not announce any individual events but merely warned about the political circumstances that could lead toward incidents and political instability. The State Chamber does not ask me directly about my alleged involvement in the Smolnikar affair. However, this question has been raised in public constantly by forces who would, in my opinion, like to shed their responsibility for it. With full responsibility I assure you that I am not connected with this affair nor are the people from my cabinet. This also applies to all other unlawful actions. For this reason I am furthermore interested in an expert and quick investigation. It would be most unusual if the fact that this constituted the biggest violation of human rights would finally become completely irrelevant. In the third part I advocated that the standards of expertise and excellence should apply to professional performance of duties connected with the running of the state. In place of efforts to give prominence to a positive, that is to say, expert selection of cadres in the life of our state, we are constantly witnessing the attempts of self-praise and self-justification with the references to the so-called old structures, conspiracies, powerful secret organizations, icebergs, and so forth. It is primarily those who are incapable of forming a positive program of social changes themselves that talk about this, even though such positive changes are badly needed and the citizens demand them with full justification. [passage omitted] Esteemed deputies! From the media and the events in Slovene society you and I could both learn about and ponder over the events of which I spoke in Nova Gorica, which testify of the violation of the principles of a law-governed and a democratic state. I spoke of a group calling itself the Civilian Initiative and its anonymous circulars, of constant threats with dossiers, of old and new mafias, and of illegal groups that function as para-intelligence services, illegally gathering information and tailing state and political officials, journalists, and public persons. Let me remind you that I warned last summer that our state was not sufficiently protected in the area of counterintelligence and that it would be sensible to form the National Security Council within the government, which would steer, coordinate, and supervise the work of our intelligence services in the parliament. The prime minister's political collegium also partially concluded so when it decided in March that as a matter of rule the prime minister will establish the necessary coordination between the departments, that is to say, services through the political collegium. I remain firmly convinced that we must immediately set up all legal and institutional bases and frameworks that would facilitate effective functioning of the supervisory mechanisms over the repressive apparatus of the state as a whole. It must be shielded from the temptation to accomplish goals and tasks with prohibited means. We must prevent that individuals or groups would misuse it for political purposes or even to morally disqualify political adversaries and different-minded people in general. [passage omitted] I expect that the sensitivity of the public and the state offices toward any sort of arbitrary violation of human rights will increase. Namely, if we do not resist immediately any cases of unlawful bugging and surveillance of the post today, this will happen to somebody else tomorrow, and to all of us the day after. You know what Murphy's law says: If you are a paranoiac it does not necessary mean that you are not being followed. There will always be plenty of the so-called higher interests with which to justify such behavior. For this reason I believe that the prime minister's resoluteness in not tolerating any unlawful activities regardless of their perpetrators deserves the full support of the parliament and the public. I expect that everybody will act in this way. Esteemed deputies! The State Chamber holds a report by the Slovene Government about the problems in cooperation between the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Defense Ministry, and the conclusions of the March political collegium with the prime minister. I did not have this information until the end of last week when I again explicitly requested it. I have based my assessments on official verbal explanations of the incumbent officials of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and their findings in the investigation about the Civilian Initiative, which I had proposed myself. I also based my assessments on other publicly recorded events and also numerous opinions and warnings put forward in the parliamentary debates. It would be irresponsible of me to be unconcerned by these occurrences and to remain indifferent. I expected an appropriate reaction from the incumbent state offices and the State Chamber commissions here. At the same time this was also a reason to invite the prime minister and the State Chamber chairman to discuss the political and security situation in the country and my public assessments of these circumstances. I believe that the cases of unlawful activity should be pointed out immediately, before they become daily practice. It is much easier to form an assessment about the security situation in the country on the basis of the government report, especially regarding the observation of constitutionality, legality, and protection of human rights. I expect that the government will inform you of all the findings that it has uncovered or will uncover in the investigation of all events that have justifiably caused concern among the public for quite some time. This also applies to the arms with which Slovenia, also in the interest of its own security, helped Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as the arms intended for the Slovene Army. The State Chamber and the public must get a thorough report about all this to clear all rumors about irregularities or even personal acquisitions and possible war profiteering. If this has happened, then the culprits must answer for it before a court of law. I stick to my constitutional authorities. I do not interfere with the official procedures and actions of the state services, ministries, government, or the parliament except in the cases and in the spheres explicitly determined by the Constitution and the law. A duty to protect the constitutional order has compelled me to send numerous written warnings and proposals to the Slovene government. To illustrate, let me quote some of the issues to which the warnings referred and which, in my judgment, constituted a breach of the law and arbitrariness on the part of the state offices and their officials. In my opinion on the proposal of the Defense Law, which I sent to you at the request of the State Chamber on 3 December 1993, I pointed out the controversial nature both of the government decree on ranks and promotion in the Defense Ministry, as of the government's agreeing to the proposal for the dismissal of the commander of the Republican Headquarters of the Territorial Defense and the appointment of a new commander, the questionable awarding of honors and medals in the Defense Ministry, the intolerable interference of military personnel in the political sphere, failure to inform the president of the republic as the supreme commander about the actual situation in the defense forces and their combat-readiness, at the need to form a National Security Council of the government to steer, coordinate, and supervise the work of the entire security-intelligence and counterintelligence activity of the state and to safeguard the State Chamber's supervision over this activity and the entire defense sphere. I warned of the unlawful and arbitrary deployment of the guard of honor of the Territorial Defense and the unlawful usurping of the authority to discharge soldiers, where the minister even quoted consultations with the Constitutional Court. The essence of my warnings was that until the new laws are passed we must observe the prevailing ones and at the same time hurry up with the preparation and adoption of an overall, new Defense Law that will be harmonized with the Constitution. [passage omitted] One should not overlook the fact that the government is responsible for the implementation of laws, for the management and direction of the state administration through ministers, and for the supervision of their work. Regarding the anonymous writing of the so-called Civilian Initiative and its links with the foreign intelligence services, as it professes itself, regarding the supposed bugging in the Bank of Slovenia, and regarding the discovery of the arms on Maribor airport, I have urged, in writing and in personal contacts with the prime minister, the interior minister, and the chief of the Slovene Intelligence Security Agency, that matters be investigated thoroughly, that the interests of the state be protected, the safety of citizens safeguarded, and the domestic and international public informed about the conclusions. Let me here state also my opinion about the way in which the president of the republic is being informed -- not Milan Kucan, but the institution of the president of this country. Because of his constitutional duties, obligations in country's political life, and appearances on the international scene, it is definitely in the interest of all citizens and all institutions that shape and implement country's internal and external policy that the president of the state be promptly and thoroughly informed about all affairs that are important for the effective functioning of the state. My everyday experiences convince me that the present manner in which the president is informed does not perform up to this standard. I believe that in finalizing our legislation and its harmonization with the Constitution, it would pay to consider a suitable legal solution for these relations. The lack of a defined means of informing the president of the republic, who is elected directly, is a poor testimony for this country, the government, and the State Chamber. It is odd, to say the least, to wonder where the president of the state gets his information from, and not why the president of the state is not informed. Countries with parliamentary tradition have these relations defined by law. [passage omitted] Esteemed deputies! Despite all the unquestioned and encouraging achievements and successes of the last two and a half, that is, almost three years of Slovenia's independent life, I still believe that the basic premises and goals of the plebiscite are as topical as they were at the time of their adoption. I believe and hope that this project will remain a common concern of the parliamentary and all other parties, all state offices and the institutions of the civic society, just as its demanding the first step -- the gaining of Slovenia's independence -- was a common concern. [passage omitted] As in all countries, especially those that have broken off with their real socialist past, there are social anomalies here, too, that hurt the citizens in a material, political, and moral way and for which there is often no excuse. Here I refer to the state's being too expensive, the slow pace of property transformation and the accompanying abuses as well as the abuses pointed out in the debate about public debt that affect the workers who, having invested their efforts and labor in the companies for decades, are many of them now unemployed and concerned for their job, salaries, and survival. Also, I refer to the cases of corruption, inexplicable foot-dragging over denationalization, and the uncompensated injustices against those hurt by the old political regime, even perfectly simple ones, such as compensation for the time spent in prison, for suffering, the right to have a grave and be remembered, and so forth, which is all a matter of legislation and thus also a matter of this parliament. I am also convinced that the regulation of relations between the state and the church is also not running as one would wish and as well as possible. The criticisms of the slow systematic replacement of old laws and their harmonization with the legal standards of the European Union and the Council of Europe, and the ability of the social institutions, especially the judiciary and the prosecutors' offices, to prevent breaches of the law more efficiently and promptly than so far, are justified. I have warned about this in my public appearances. It is my judgment that I must do so on this occasion in the State Chamber, which is a legislative organ. I again stress the need to resolve these questions faster because their remaining unresolved only exacerbates the often justified protests of dissatisfied citizens who will eventually try to achieve justice by themselves. I am convinced of this also by a great number of letters that I receive daily. The people's potential for protest and justified grief and hard feelings should not be an object of political misuse. A timely detection of the potential protest demands quick, timely, and convincing responses. For this reason I again urge the observation of the principles of a law-governed state, legality, and constitutionality, which are the bases of democracy, the safety of citizens, the basis of respect for their dignity and the protection of their rights. I also urge effective action against social anomalies and moral injury. [passage omitted]
