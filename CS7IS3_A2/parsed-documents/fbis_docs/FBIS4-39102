Security Council resolves to impose sanctions on North Korea for its suspected nuclear safeguards violations, a ranking South Korean official accompanying President Kim Yong-sam on his tour of Uzbekistan said Sunday. South Korea and related countries stand firmly for effective international sanctions against North Korea, he said, adding negotiations on the sanctions are under way among permanent U.N. Security Council member countries and related nations. But full-dress negotiations on a draft U.N. Security Council resolution on the North Korean nuclear issue will start after President Kim returns to Seoul Tuesday, he said. Senior presidential foreign affairs and security aide Chong Chong-uk said the government is maintaining close contact with the U.S. Government, while consulting with friendly nations about a number of measures to cope with the tension over North Korea's nuclear standoff. The situation now is not worsening and there is no special development of the situation on the Korean peninsula, he added. President Kim, receiving reports on the movements in Seoul and the United Nations in relation to the North Korean nuclear issue from Chong before his departure for Samarkand, told him to stay in Tashkent and have a thorough grasp of developments of the nuclear issue. Chong was to accompany Kim on his visit to the old Uzbek capital city. While in Moscow and Tashkent, Kim was briefed by his aides on what was discussed in the Unification and Security Policy Coordination Council in Seoul and nuclear ambassador Kim Sam-hon's activities in Washington, Chong said.
