Lithuania assesses the Partnership for Peace initiative favorably. At the same time, we hope that the NATO summit on 10-11 January will open the doors of this organization to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, and that a way will be found for partnership to gradually grow into membership. We are fully aware that with the present statement, Lithuania is embarking on a new, complex, and responsible stage in rapprochement with the European Union and NATO, which will call for determination, new solutions, and large material resources. I believe that much will be clarified following my visit to Brussels scheduled for 27 January of this year. The position of Lithuania regarding NATO membership is not directed against neighboring states or any other European country; all of them should find a place in the new security structures of our continent. Just as before, we come out in favor of close cooperation among Baltic countries in all areas, including the area of defense, and in favor of reinforcing security and stability in the entire Baltic Sea region. Vilnius, 4 January 1994
