One group of Japanese firms and individuals is preparing to set up the Japan-Israel Business Club on February 16 to exchange information about the climate for investment and trade in the Jewish nation, industry sources said. However, a major trading firm, which is said to have initiated the club's formation, was nervous about being identified and refused to comment. Other trading houses seem to be unaware about the organization or undecided about joining. The club will serve as a "saloon" for individual members, who effectively represent their respective firms, the sources said. Many Japanese companies have avoided taking conspicuous action to boost trade with Israel, apparently still fearful of the Arab League's boycott, which means the loss of Arab markets and oil supplies. "The peace agreement would not have substantial impact on our business because there remains the Arab boycott, though it is somewhat becoming a mere shell," said a spokesman for Itochu Corp. Itochu has never been involved with setting up the club, another spokesman said. Arab states have boycotted the Jewish society in three stages -- primarily by cutting economic relations with Israel, rejecting business with companies that have economic relations with Israel, and boycotting firms connected with those that do business with the nation. Although Kuwait announced last June that it was ready to stop blacklisting companies doing business with Israel, the effective date is uncertain since the Arab League's previously planned plenary session on the issue was indefinitely postponed, said an official of the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO). "We are in a stage of watching developments there," Hiroshi Nozu, Middle East and Africa section general manager of the international corporate planning department of Marubeni Corp., said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE. Nezu said Marubeni will seek business with Israel at a "slow and steady" pace because political uncertainty in the region remains despite the accord, which he called an "agreement for agreement." Because Israel has advanced technology in such areas as agriculture, biology, telecommunications and aviation, Marubeni believes future ties are promising, Nozu said. Nozu denied having heard of the Japan-Israel Business Club. The Itochu spokesman said that in terms of population, only Egypt and Turkey are the region's large markets. Itochu business with the two, mainly in crude oil, vehicles and plant equipment, will continue as before, he said. Currently, Itochu does not plan to open a representative office in Israel, and no immediate impact on Itochu is expected as a result of the Israel-PLO agreement, the spokesman said. "We cannot help being cautious about business with Israel because of psychological factors," said Masami Naruse, assistant manager of corporate communications division of Mitsui and Co. "It all depends on what will become of the Arab boycott," Naruse said, "because we have close relations with Arab nations such as the UAE (United Arab Emirates) and Kuwait." He said his company has yet to decide whether to participate in the Japan-Israel Business Club. According to government statistics, Japan's trade with Middle East nations has gradually expanded, from 29.04 billion dollars in 1988 to 44.46 billion dollars in 1992. The figures include trade with North African states and exclude Turkey. For the January-November period in 1993, however, trade with these countries decreased by 7.8 percent from the same period in 1992. Meanwhile, bilateral trade between Japan and Israel increased by 3.2 percent for the first 11 months last year over the same period in 1992. It expanded from 1.1 billion dollars in 1988 to 1.7 billion dollars in 1992. Japan's exports to Israel, mainly automobiles, amounted to about 1 billion dollars in 1992, while imports from Israel, primarily diamonds, came to around 700 million dollars. Japan's vehicle exports to Israel totaled 66,792 units last year, following 82,249 in 1992 and 58,593 in 1991, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association. Among nine exporting automakers, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. ranked first with about 24,000 units for the January-November period of 1993, industry sources said. While Mitsubishi and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. have a long history in exporting autos to Israel, others were relative newcomers, the sources said. "The general business environment there is headed in a favorable direction," a Nissan Motor Co. spokeswoman said. However, because Israel's population of five million is not big, Nissan does not expect the peace accord to lead to a rapid increase in export volume, she said. "We'll just steadily market our products there" at the current pace of some 3,000 vehicles per year, she said. Despite uncertainty over the boycott, Japan and Israel will deepen bilateral ties from a long-term viewpoint, said Yoshihiro Otsuji, director of the Middle East-Africa office of the International Trade Policy Bureau at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). Inquiries concerning the boycott and other information on Israel have been increasing since last November and exchanges between MITI officials and Israeli counterparts have expanded, Otsuji said. The Japanese Government has officially called for an end to the trade refusal.
