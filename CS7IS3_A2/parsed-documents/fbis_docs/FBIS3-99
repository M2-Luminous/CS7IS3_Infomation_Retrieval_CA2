The president said in a democratic society people should be free to decide their own destiny and wondered why opposition politicians were intimidating voters in the run-up to the elections. He, however, assured wananchi that the government had enough security machinery to contain any situation that may arise from those threats. President Moi said KANU stood for peace, love, and unity and the government shall not condone any acts of violence in the country. President Moi was speaking at various centers on his way to Nzoia chief's camp in Lugari to address a campaign rally on behalf of the KANU candidate in the constituency by-elections, Mr. Apili Wawire. Among the centers he stopped at were Uasin Gishu Kakamega border, Nangili, Kongoni, Matunda, and Kona Mbaya. Thousands of jubilant wananchi, waving the popular one-finger KANU salute, assured the president that they will vote in the KANU candidate, Mr. Apili Wawire. President Moi told those wananchi that by voting for Mr. Wawire they will have voted for KANU, which stands for progress and stability. President Moi dismissed as cheap politics by a Forum for the Restoration of Democracy [FORD]-Kenya candidate, Burudi Nabwera, that part of Lugari constituency would be made part of Rift Valley Province. He said it was a pity that such an old man would stoop so low as to tell such lies only for the sake of wooing votes. President Moi, who is also the president of the ruling party, KANU, wondered why the opposition was against harambee [communal fund raising] and yet that spirit had contributed a lot to the development of this nation. The president said that KANU will always concern itself with development matters and the general welfare of all Kenyans without discriminating. The president reiterated that it was the opposition parties which started off the tribal clashes in parts of Rift Valley and Western province and they should not use the same against KANU. President Moi recalled how he had appointed Mr. Nabwera to head several parastatals, including appointing him a minister of state in his office and [word indistinct] why he was not grateful to the KANU government.
