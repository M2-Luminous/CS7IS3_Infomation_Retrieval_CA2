Belweder Sends Up Some Trial Balloons"; passage following the subhead attributed to "knysz" and "pw"] [Text] As we discovered yesterday from a politician running in Belweder circles, the president's camp is considering the possibility of Marek Borowski becoming deputy prime minister and finance minister for a second time. By using the mass media, Lech Walesa wants to investigate how the coalition looks on the idea. That is why Lech Falandysz, a minister in the President's Office, said rather casually yesterday, during the "Breakfast With Radio Zet" program: "Perhaps Borowski then?" "That is very interesting," said a surprised Aleksander Kwasniewski, a leader of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. "It is not nonsense," our source from the Belweder tried to convince us yesterday. "Borowski was a good finance minister." He also reminded us that the president already signed Borowski's nomination once in the past, and without any reservations. "So he can do it a second time," the source says. According to him, the reason the president signed Borowski's resignation so fast was that he thought Prime Minister Pawlak had a good candidate for the post. "But now we know that is not the case. So perhaps it could be Borowski after all?" This is the way the Belweder politician spoke about it. But he is also afraid that such a scenario would be a bitter pill for the coalition to swallow. "It would have to admit that it had let go of a competent minister too easily," the Belweder source speculates. "They would also have to officially give up Rosati's candidacy, and that is something they, for the moment at least, find extremely difficult to come to terms with." SLD Press Spokesman Zbigniew Siemiatkowski has said that the suggestion constitutes a clear message from the Belweder, but the SLD has yet to take a position on the issue. "At any rate, the concerned person [Borowski] is in Japan at the moment," the spokesman added. It is also not known how Prime Minister Pawlak will respond to the proposal. Not so long ago, cooperation between the prime minister and a former deputy prime minister [Borowski] proved impossible, which resulted in Borowski's resignation. Labor Minister Leszek Miller regards the whole thing as a joke by the Belweder: "It is indeed quite a perfidious kind of message to send, given the rush with which Lech Walesa signed Marek Borowski's resignation," Miller said. According to other SLD politicians, the rush was very strange. Some expert opinions compiled on the SLD's order say that the president should not accept a resignation until he is determined to sign the nomination of a new minister. The Small Constitution provides that the president "makes changes" in ministerial posts. Leszek Miller says that the SLD has a reserve candidate and that Borowski is not the one. "We will not reveal his name until the nomination is agreed upon within the prime minister-president-SLD triangle," Minister Miller adds. Where To Meet? The Belweder is gradually abandoning the idea it put forward on Thursday [7 April] that sessions of the National Defense Committee [KOK] be the only site for meetings between the president and the government chief. "These are two separate issues," Presidential Spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski explained to us yesterday. "The president wants KOK sessions to be a permanent place for debates on strategic issues by the country's most important people. Spur-of-the-moment meetings with the prime minister are quite another story." Let us recall that Drzycimski said on Thursday that a National Security Council (which has not yet been established) or KOK sessions should be where the coalition consults the president. The idea resulted in immediate protests by the coalition politicians, who perceived a speedy establishment of the council to be another precondition for talks with the head of state.
