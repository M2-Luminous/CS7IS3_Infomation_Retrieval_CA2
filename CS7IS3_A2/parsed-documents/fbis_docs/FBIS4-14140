The industry is now gearing itself to boosting exports still further. [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] India's textile output has gone up from 25,045 million square meters in 1992-93 to 25,942 million square meters in 1993-94. This is excluding the production in the khadi, wool, and silk sectors. The steep rise in production is mainly attributed to an increase in output by the handloom and power loom sectors which employs 140 lakhs of people specially in the rural sector. The capital [words indistinct] sector contributes only 10 percent of the total production and employs just about 10 lakh people. According to the annual report of the Textiles Ministry, textile exports constitute as much as 35 percent of India's total exports. Textiles have, thus, emerged as one of the highest foreign exchange earner for the country crossing the 19,000 crore rupee mark during 1993-94 -- an increase of 34 percent over 1992-93.
