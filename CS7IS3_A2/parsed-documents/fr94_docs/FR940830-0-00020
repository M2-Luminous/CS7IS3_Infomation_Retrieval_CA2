FR940830-0-00020 FR940830-0-00005 Amended §563.22(c) requires prior notice or application to the OTS in accordance with new §563.22(h)(2) for the following categories of transactions: (1) Purchases of assets by a savings association that do not require OTS approval under the BMA and §563.22(a); (2) Bulk sales of less than all or substantially all of the assets of a savings association; (3) Transactions in which a savings association transfers less than all or substantially all of its deposit liabilities to a bank or other depository institution; (4) Bulk assumptions or transfers of non-deposit liabilities by a savings association; and (5) Combinations involving savings associations and depository institutions other than insured depository institutions. The OTS believes that an abbreviated procedure is appropriate for these types of transactions, provided that the savings association is well capitalized, and otherwise qualifies for ``expedited treatment'' under part 516. Accordingly, under new §563.22(h)(2)(i), an expedited notice procedure is available for all five of the foregoing categories of transactions where all constituent savings associations meet the conditions for ``expedited treatment'' under 12 CFR 516.3(a). Notices under this provision of the rule would be deemed approved automatically 30 days after receipt, unless the OTS determines that an application is required. 21 21 As is the case with respect to any notice receiving expedited treatment under §516.3(a), the OTS may impose appropriate conditions in connection with acceptance of a notice under new §563.22(h)(2)(i). Under new §§563.22(h)(2)(ii) and 563.22(h)(2)(iii), a standard application procedure must be followed where any constituent savings association does not meet the criteria for ``expedited treatment'' under §516.3(a), or where a notice filed under §563.22(h)(2)(i) is incomplete or otherwise does not satisfy the notice requirements. These applications will be subject to the ``standard'' review periods set forth in part 516, with certain exceptions. As with other applications, the OTS is required to notify an applicant within 30 calendar days after proper submission of an application whether it is ``sufficient'' or ``complete,'' and what additional information is required, if any, in order to render the submission sufficient, or that the submission is materially deficient and will not be processed. 22 In addition, the 60-day period for review for an application under these provisions commences on the date the OTS determines the application to be sufficient. 23 22 12 CFR 516.2(c). 23 12 CFR 516.2(d).
