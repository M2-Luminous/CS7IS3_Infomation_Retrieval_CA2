FR940207-2-00057 FR940207-2-00028 Alternative Transmission Rates As stated in the Federal Register notice published on May 8, 1992 (57 FR 19904), Western proposed alternative P&hyph;DP rates for both firm and nonfirm transmission service. The proposed alternative rates would have set a single rate for the use of either or both the P&hyph;DP and the AC Intertie transmission systems. However, based on customers' requests, Western decided not to propose the alternative transmission service rates at this time. Replacement and Addition Activities The provisional P&hyph;DP rate adjustments are due largely to an increase in replacements and additions on P&hyph;DP. P&hyph;DP is undergoing a major replacement and refurbishment plan needed for environmental compliance, safety, and reliability. Western initially used data from the FY 1993 construction budget for replacement and addition activities during the CEP (1994&hyph;98). However, during the consultation and comment period, Western decided to reevaluate the replacement and addition activities because of the economic strain being placed on the P&hyph;DP customers and because of the unrealistic expectations that all replacement and addition activities would be completed during the CEP. Western compared the data from the FY 1993 construction budget documents with the most current construction data as stated in ``The Engineering Ten-Year Construction and Replacement Plan'' dated July 1992. The Engineering Ten-Year Plan showed the most current construction data Western had on replacement and addition activities over the next 10 years. Western made the decision to revise the Ratesetting PRS by incorporating the most current data from the Engineering Ten-Year Plan. All of the replacements and additions in the Ratesetting PRS are authorized power system facilities for which Congress has appropriated funds for FY 1993 construction, and which will be in service within the CEP. Thus, the Ratesetting PRS only incorporates the first 5 years of the Engineering Ten-Year Plan. These revisions, based on data from the Engineering Ten-Year Plan, will help maintain the lowest rate possible without jeopardizing the crucial need of a safe and reliable P&hyph;DP transmission system. A comparison of the initial ratesetting PRS using the FY 1993 construction budget to the Ratesetting PRS using the Engineering Ten-Year Plan follows:
