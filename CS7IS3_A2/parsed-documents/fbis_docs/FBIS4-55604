If the National Commission of Solidarity decides today to adopt the draft, Solidarity, in line with a new law on the proceedings for the preparation and adoption of a constitution, will have to collect 500,000 signatures under the draft before the trade union submits it to the National Assembly's Constitutional Commission. The draft puts emphasis on the country's democratic nature and on the chief position in the nation, which is the source of all power. The draft also stresses the role of work as the basis for the country's development, and also the role of the right of ownership and a right to inheritance, as well as the economy's free market nature. The draft envisages a division of power between three branches and says that exercising power takes place through representatives, a referendum, and a citizens' legislative initiative that would be supported by votes of at least 200,000 voters. The president would be the head of state and would perform the role of an umpire between the Sejm and the government. He would order parliamentary elections, and he would enjoy the right to veto laws that have been adopted. Such vetoes could be overruled by the Sejm with a three-fifths majority (according to the Small Constitution, the Sejm can overrule a presidential veto with a two-thirds majority.) The draft also says the president could be brought to justice by the Supreme Court performing the function of a Tribunal of State, based on a Sejm resolution adopted by a three-fifths qualified majority. (According to the Small Constitution, the president may be brought to justice by a resolution of the National Assembly adopted by a majority of at least two-thirds of votes of the total number of members of the National Assembly, on a motion of at least one-fourth of the total number of the total number of members of the Assembly). The trade union's constitutional draft guarantees the right to education to everyone, but only public schools are listed as free of charge. The draft also says everybody has a right to health protection, while the public authorities create the right conditions, making it possible to implement the right in practice.
