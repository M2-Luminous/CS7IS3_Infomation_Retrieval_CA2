The British Government said today that it gives its full backing to the British airlines which have decided to fly into Orly. [passage omitted] French Transport Minister Bernard Bosson said today that he finds it absolutely extraordinary that British Airways should try to force the hand of the French authorities. He was speaking to Alain Pagon: [Begin Bosson recording] We are in favor of competition, but we want it to be disciplined, loyal and healthy: We are not in favor of an economic jungle. The government took some simple decisions last October: It decided to open the Orly-London route this April; it decided the opening of the Orly-Marseille route to one company only in April 1995, and the opening of Orly-Toulouse to one company only in April 1996. The government's decisions will be respected. We have a certain delay on the opening of the Orly-London route. It is a matter of weeks now. We are moving toward that opening which we ourselves decided, but we will not accept any forcible action by whatever company on Monday [16 May] or on any other day. As concerns the Orly-Marseille and Orly-Toulouse routes, the European Commission has ordered us to open up these two routes within six months. We do not agree with the Commission's aims, because we feel that our measures are in conformity with commitments made in Brussels by previous French governments, and we have therefore appealed to the courts. It is all extremely simple. [end recording]
