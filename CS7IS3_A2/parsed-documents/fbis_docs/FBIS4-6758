Even a combination of the 13 commercial banks will make it smaller than the world's 23rd largest bank. Only 16 banks are listed on the Banker's Top 500 in July last year. The average capital of the five major Seoul-based banks is just a tenth of that of their Japanese counterparts. Even worse, profitability of Korean banks is quite low by international standards. A Korean bank employee generated a before-tax income of 9.7 million won in 1991, compared with 51.2 million won for his counterpart in Japan and 97.8 million won for an employee of the 52 foreign banks in Korea. This dismal picture made it inevitable for Korean banks to sharpen international competitive edge and a way of bolstering their global competitiveness is to increase their size or to become financial conglomerates. [sentence as published] An economy of scale or managerial efficiency will arise if banks, securities companies and insurance houses are merged to become financial conglomerates. But caution prevails over a hasty and arbitrary creation of financial conglomerates, many analysts said. Professor Yi Pil-sang and other critics contend that the government is plotting a scheme to control the financial market through the creation of big players. They said they agree in principle with the government's move to establish a few mega financial institutions which will deal in banking, securities and insurance services. They said financial conglomerates, if established, will sharpen international competitive edge of the Korean financial industry. As Korea recruited and intensively trained "elite sportsmen" to win gold medals in the Olympics, so Seoul now needs to foster a few "representative financial institutions" which can compete with Citibank, Bank of America and Japanese and European mega banks domestically and globally. But they warned that no people or businesses, except for industrial groups such as Samsung and Hyundai, have enough money to become financial conglomerates. About 300-500 billion won is necessary to take over a bank. Except for the government and industrial conglomerates, no one and or firm has such a huge amount of cash, many analysts said. Government officials said that the government will strictly separate industrial conglomerates from muscling into financial groups. But critics say even if the government legally bans the participation of Samsung, Hyundai and other industrial groups, they may provide money through tricky arrangements to their "henchman" to establish financial conglomerates. Ultimately, financial conglomerates will become a "private safe" for industrial giants, they warned. Furthermore, there is skepticism whether prospective financiers, if any, are ready to take over the commercial banks, which are saddled with a huge amount of nonperforming loans. Textbook theory alleges that the synergy effect will arise when financial conglomerates handling banking, securities and insurance emerge. But there is no proven evidence that the synergy effect has emerged. Many local banks have used their securities, insurance and other financial subsidiaries as "channels" for digesting layers of "good old boys." It is no coincidence that financial institutions of which parents are banks have been performing more poorly than those with no affiliation with banks. Another hindrance to the emergence of financial conglomerates is the rule that no one can control more than 8 percent of any Seoul- based commercial bank. This rule has made local bankers drift without real owners and left room for government intervention in their internal management although it committed itself not to meddle in their internal affairs. Pak Chae-yon, senior secretary for economic affairs to President Kim Yong-sam indicated that the government would loosen the maximum share-holding limit to foster the financial conglomerates. Risks on financial conglomerates are widespread. Trouble in a subsidiary will have a chain effect on the rest of the sister companies in financial conglomerates. Collusion may exist among these subsidiaries for regulating competition, forming a cartel on pricing and other unfair deals. They many exchange customer information, which may create a conflict of interest. Before the emergence of financial conglomerates, Korea needs to revamp the current regulatory system in which the three supervisory bodies do not have a coordinating function. Mindful of such negative effects, Finance Minister Hong Chae-hyong said the issue of fostering financial conglomerates is a long-term subject. The Ministry of Finance said at the current stage, the government has no official position on the issue although it has embarked on a full- scale study. Professor Yi of Korea University said that the government should first deregulate its internal control on financial institutions, help banks eliminate the huge amount of nonperforming loans before the idea of fostering financial conglomerates is considered. He and many critics said financial conglomerates should emerge naturally, not artificially by the government. Any artificial measure will invite a special favor legitimacy controversy of their birth as many industrial conglomerates have been constantly facing, they said. Daehan Kyoyuk Insurance announced that it would seek to become a financial conglomerate by taking over a bank and a merchant bank soon. It has taken over a securities subsidiary from the ailing Bank of Seoul. The other candidates frequently mentioned as candidates for financial conglomerates include Shinhan Bank, Coryo Securities Daishin Securities, Korea Life Insurance and Tongyang Securities. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Major Banks' Ownership Structure (Unit: , as of the end of 1992) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Cho Hung|CBK |Korea F-|BOS |Shinhan |KorAm |Hanil | | | | |irst | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Governm-|- |0.11 |- |- |- |- |- | |ent | | | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Gov't-I-|- |- |0.03 |- |- |- |- | |nvested | | | | | | | | |Cos. | | | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Banks |1.16 |78.37 |3.29 |5.04 |6.17 |1.29 |8.61 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Securit-|0.24 |0.07 |0.04 |6.05 |17.18 |10.69 |4.91 | |ies | | | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Insuran-|2.75 |2.45 |3.21 |11.47 |3.20 |2.20 |6.52 | |ce Firms| | | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Investm-|4.57 |8.50 |3.92 |4.73 |3.40 |5.73 |1.91 | |ent-Tru-| | | | | | | | |st Co. | | | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Short-t-|- |- |0.08 |0.44 |- |0.07 |0.74 | |erm | | | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Finance |- |- |- |0.13 |- |0.09 |- | |Cos.
