The SPOe will recommend that Austrians vote for Austria's entry into the European Union in the referendum on 12 June; 220 delegates from all provinces and prominent party members came to Innsbruck. They not only listened with rapt attention to SPOe Chairman and Chancellor Franz Vranitzky's pleading for Europe, but they also agreed unanimously to the Federal Party Council's declaration. In his speech of more than one hour, Vranitzky not only advocated entry into the European Union, but also the maintenance of neutrality. Both for security policy and economic reasons, it is absolutely necessary for Austria to participate in shaping and determining the European integration process. This cannot be done from the outside, but Austria has to actively shape things within the European Union. "This is also necessary because we have to take note of the fact that phenomena like nationalism, chauvinism, and fascism, which were believed to have been overcome long ago, are popping up again before our front door." In the first place, Austria's road to the European Union also has to be positively assessed in the field of economy. "Full participation in a single market of 350 million people enlarges the domestic market 50 times for our small country, which depends on foreign trade," Vranitzky stressed. Austria will benefit above average alone because of its Central European location. [passage omitted]
