Levits accentuated some so far unresolved or unclear issues, namely the right of countries involved in the stability pact to choose for themselves the themes for discussion at regional round-table talks, the need to determine that judicially existing borders are accepted, not generally existing borders, as well as to give clarity to the concept of minorities as it relates to the situation in the Baltic countries.
