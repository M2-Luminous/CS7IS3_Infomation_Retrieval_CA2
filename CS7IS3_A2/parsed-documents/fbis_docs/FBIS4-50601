The DPP's National Assembly Caucus submitted the proposal, which is also being supported by several nonpartisan and Kuomintang Assembly members, to the National Assembly Secretariat. National Assembly members are gathering in Yangmingshan in suburban Taipei for a three-month special meeting to consider constitutional changes and the nominations of grand justices and the head of the Judicial Yuan. Of the DPP's 31-article proposal, only the one that recommends election of the ROC president and vice president by popular vote is shared by the ruling Kuomintang. Other major points of the DPP proposal include allowing national referendums, abolishing existing nuclear power plants, judiciary reforms, and doing away with the quota for overseas Chinese parliamentary members. The KMT, which controls a majority of assembly seats, has decided to push ahead with its own version of constitutional changes, including the election of an assembly speaker and vice speaker, extension of legislators' tenure from three years to four, and granting overseas Chinese the right to vote in the presidential election.
