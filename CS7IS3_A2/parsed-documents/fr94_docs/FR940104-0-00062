FR940104-0-00062 FR940104-0-00015 A. Basis for the Determination Not To List as Hazardous Wastes From Wood Surface Protection Operations As discussed in the proposed rule, in making a hazardous waste listing determination, the Agency applies a ``weight-of-evidence'' approach. In doing this, the Agency examines the risks associated with all potential human health and environmental exposure pathways, analyzes trends in the current industry, researches past damage incidents, as well as other factors found in 40 CFR 261.11. Upon reviewing and responding to comments received on the proposed rule, the Agency has decided not to list as hazardous wastes from the use of chlorophenolic formulations in the wood surface protection industry for several reasons. First, chlorophenolic formulations are no longer being produced in the United States and the Agency believes it is very unlikely they will be produced in the future. The only remaining producer of chlorophenolics in the U.S., Chapman Chemicals, stopped production in January of 1992 and sometime later applied for voluntary cancellation of its FIFRA product registration. A notice describing this action was published in the Federal Register on June 3, 1992 (57 FR 23401), and a final cancellation order was sent to Chapman Chemicals with an effective date of September 14, 1992. This cancellation notice applies to the following products produced by Chapman Chemicals: Permatox 181, 10S, and 101, and Mitrol G-ST. Any manufacturer wishing to resume production of chlorophenolics would have to obtain a new FIFRA registration before these chemicals could be re-introduced and made available for use in wood surface protection. Currently, there remains only one known user of chlorophenolics in the U.S. out of an estimated 1000 previous users and the remaining plant's existing stock is believed to be very limited. A major element in the decision not to list as hazardous chlorophenolic wastes generated from the surface protection industry is the fact that use of chlorophenolic formulations has ceased. EPA believes it is highly unlikely that a manufacturer will seek reregistration for this product for many reasons, including the availability of effective substitute products and the potentially high financial and administrative burdens imposed by the FIFRA registration process. Additional justification to support non-future production is the fact that European countries do not want to accept dioxin-containing wood products which have affected large export mills who will not use chlorophenolic formulations in the future in part for this reason. Use of chlorophenolics for surface protection has declined steadily (even without the influence of RCRA) from over 1,000 users to one user over the past decade. Should a new registration of this product be sought, EPA will consider this surface protection risk analysis for full strength application when determining whether a new listing determination under RCRA should be initiated. Currently, the Agency is aware of nine available substitute products currently being used by surface protectors in place of chlorophenolics. The substitute products are for a large part satisfactory to their users (as mentioned on various site trips), and the Agency does not feel as though a switch back to chlorophenolics is likely. A second reason why the Agency has decided not to list these wastes is because the risk to human health and the environment from on-going operations which previously used chlorophenolics is shown to tail off quickly because chlorophenolic concentrations diminish to a near zero concentration within a short period of time following switchover to an alternate product. The Agency has determined that the use of full-strength chlorophenolic formulations generates wastes that result in unacceptable risk to human health and the environment. As before mentioned, should the use of chlorophenolics for surface protection applications resume, for any reason, the Agency will most likely re-evaluate its current position. However, dealing with the current situation, there remains only one known user of chlorophenolics with a limited supply remaining. Although the Agency believes the use of full-strength chlorophenolics will be phased out in the very near future, there was concern at the time of proposal that there may be unacceptable risks posed by the use of substitute products that become cross-contaminated from previous chlorophenolic use. Particularly, the proposal cited possible ground water risks of 2Ã—10 ^4 for individuals and a broad but very low potential exposure risk due to surface run-off contributing to dioxin levels in fish. The Agency received several comments addressing these potential impacts. In response to these comments, the Agency conducted additional ground-water modeling using new pulse assumptions developed from commenter-submitted information. The Agency developed what it believed to be better pulse assumptions in an effort to determine how long pentachlorophenate will be present in on-going operations which have switched over from its past use. This new data was obtained from performing mass balance iterations using typical tank volumes found at both large and small facilities. These mathematical calculations showed that cross-contamination from previous use of chlorophenolics will be present in a substitute products for only two to six years from the time a plant stops using chlorophenolics. The Agency found that the highest estimated risk to an individual from drinking ground water for nine years at peak concentrations in the two- or six-year pulse resulting from cross contamination, is significantly diminished and the broad effect on dioxin levels in fish is reduced by several orders of magnitude. This new analysis shows that the risks associated with cross-contamination do not justify a hazardous waste listing to capture cross-contaminated wastes. In the proposed rule, EPA addressed the fact that PCP is no longer in use at most facilities in its baseline risk estimates, which have been revised in the final rule to reflect source concentrations and pulse durations more representative of the cross-contamination, incremental-risk scenario. Chart 1 below compares the incremental risks from cross-contaminated wastes as calculated for the proposed rule to the values obtained using the new approach.
