FR940317-0-00013 FR940317-0-00005 Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. There are approximately 25 handlers of California raisins who are subject to regulation under the raisin marketing order, and approximately 5,000 producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. A majority of producers and a minority of handlers of California raisins may be classified as small entities. The order prescribes procedures for computing trade demands and preliminary and final percentages that establish the amount of raisins that can be marketed throughout the season. The regulations apply to all handlers of California raisins. Raisins in the free percentage category may be shipped immediately to any market, while reserve raisins must be held by handlers in a reserve pool for the account of the Committee, which is responsible for local administration of the order. Under the order, reserve raisins may be: Sold at a later date by the Committee to handlers for free use; used in diversion programs; exported to authorized countries; carried over as a hedge against a short crop the following year; or disposed of in other outlets noncompetitive with those for free tonnage raisins. While this rule may restrict the amount of Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins that enter domestic markets, final free and reserve percentages are intended to lessen the impact of the oversupply situation facing the industry and promote stronger marketing conditions, thus stabilizing prices and supplies and improving grower returns. In addition to the quantity of raisins released under the preliminary percentages and the final percentages, the order specifies methods to make available additional raisins to handlers by requiring sales of reserve pool raisins for use as free tonnage raisins under ``10 plus 10'' offers, and authorizing sales of reserve raisins under certain conditions. The Department's ``Guidelines for Fruit, Vegetable, and Specialty Crop Marketing Orders'' specifies that 110 percent of recent years' sales should be made available to primary markets each season before recommendations for volume regulation are approved. This goal is met by the establishment of a final percentage which releases 100 percent of the computed trade demand and the additional release of reserve raisins to handlers under ``10 plus 10'' offers. The ``10 plus 10'' offers are two simultaneous offers of reserve pool raisins which are made available to handlers each season. For each such offer, a quantity of raisins equal to 10 percent of the prior year's shipments is made available for free use. Pursuant to ยง989.54(a) of the order, the Committee which is responsible for local administration of the order, met on August 16, 1993, to review shipment and inventory data, and other matters relating to the supplies of raisins of all varietal types. The Committee computed a trade demand for each varietal type for which a free tonnage percentage might be recommended. The trade demand is 90 percent of the prior year's shipments of free tonnage and reserve tonnage raisins sold for free use for each varietal type into all market outlets, adjusted by subtracting the carryin of each varietal type on August 1 of the current crop year and by adding to the trade demand the desirable carryout for each varietal type at the end of that crop year. As specified in ยง989.154, the desirable carryout for each varietal type shall be equal to the shipments of free tonnage raisins of the prior crop year during the months of August, September, and one half of October. If the prior year's shipments are limited because of crop conditions, the total shipments during that period of time during one of the three years preceding the prior crop year may be used. In accordance with these provisions, the Committee computed and announced a 1993&hyph;94 trade demand of 282,909 tons for Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins.
