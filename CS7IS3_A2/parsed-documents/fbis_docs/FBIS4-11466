The IMF and the World Bank will lend the Vietnamese Government more than $10 billion to rebuild the country, and Brazil wants a share of the market that will be created with these funds. A Brazilian business mission -- the first in the history of relations between the two nations -- already has spent two days in Vietnam. On 23 April, the mission will travel to Malaysia, one of the most developed Southeast Asian nations. Vietnamese Vice Foreign Minister Le Mai visited Brazil in October 1993 and conveyed Vietnam's interest in improving commercial relations with Brazil. In 1993 Brazil had a trade deficit with Vietnam: It exported goods worth $4.2 million and imported Vietnamese products worth $30.3 million (mostly rice and chemical products). A Tiger The Brazilian Foreign Ministry Promotion Department has pinpointed several business opportunities for Brazilian firms in Vietnam. Oil looks like the most promising field. Vietnam has large unexploited oil and natural gas deposits in the Sea of China. Brazil also is interested in infrastructure projects such as highways, hydroelectric power plants, basic sanitation projects, civil construction, and low-income housing. Even before the U.S. commercial embargo on Vietnam collapsed two months ago, several U.S. companies had set up shop in Vietnam. "Vietnam is a cat that will become a tiger," according to a Brazilian Foreign Ministry official. Vietnam, which has a population of 60 million and a per-capita income of barely $200 per year, has established an economic system along the lines of the "Asian Tigers," and has been receiving investments from Japan, the United States, and European countries, mainly Germany.
