The decision was made during a regular cabinet meeting on the same day. The government also agreed to accept the Agriculture Ministry's current policy of continuing the ceiling of beef imports on an emergency basis at the current level of 680,000 tons annually, they said. The ceiling measures, agreed to by Japan and the United States, will allow the government to raise duties to 75 percent if beef imports surpass the level. In the Uruguay Round talks, held under auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Japan agreed that duties on beef imports will be reduced to 38.5 percent from 50 percent during the six years from 1995.
