Slovene Foreign Ministry adviser Ida Mocilnik and Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic also participated in the talks. Let us listen to a report by Nadja Pengov: [Begin recording] [Pengov] We established that the relations have been stagnating for a long period of time, President Kucan said in a statement for the public, and we had to ask ourselves whether this was in the vital interest of Slovenia and Croatia: [Kucan] We have established that this is not in our interest and does not suit the vital interests of any of the countries, and that we must thus find solutions, even if they prove to be demanding and difficult ones. Our discussion was very frank, fierce, and in some points also very hard, which means that these problems cannot be solved by silence, without a constant dialogue and capability for dialogue. [Pengov] We are convinced, President Kucan continued, that such an assessment will also be adopted by the incumbent offices of our states and agreed that unilateral and imposed solutions do not contribute toward the deepening of trust between the two countries. The international community also does not want members who cannot negotiate. Some international circumstances have changed, Kucan continued, while we have been receiving discouraging news from our western neighbor [Italy]. Also: [Kucan] Mr. President and I both concluded -- which makes me particularly happy -- that our statements and conclusions about the need for good relations alone are not sufficient if they are not followed up by concrete actions. [Pengov] Now to Croatian President Dr. Franjo Tudjman. There is a high degree of consensus in the views on essential issues despite open questions. There are no such problems in the relations between the countries that could not be resolved. [Tudjman, in Croatian fading into Slovenian translation] Numerous reasons exist for our governments to accelerate the resolution of open and controversial problems, President Tudjman said and especially emphasized the importance of refraining from exaggeration of problems in the public. He spoke in favor of the relations that will help both sides. In his statement he also warned of the neo-Fascists appetites for the Slovene and Croatian territories, even though he expressed hope that the new Italian Government will pursue its old policy in its relations with neighbors. He also warned of some tendencies for the formation of a sort of new Yugoslavia. Regarding the relations between the countries, he said the following: There are no territorial demands, he said. The issue of Trdinov Vrh [Sveta Gera], Piran Bay, and the Phyrn highway [Sentilj-Zagreb] need to be resolved as quickly as possible. The economic relations must be developed on the basis of a deeper cooperation and we are interested in taking a joint path toward European integration, he said. [end recording]
