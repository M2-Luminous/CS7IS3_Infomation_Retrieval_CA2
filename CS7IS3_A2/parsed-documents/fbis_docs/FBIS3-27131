At a press briefing this afternoon, the spokesman announced that Vice Premier Zhu Rongji will pay an official goodwill visit to Japan from 23 February to 3 March at the invitation of the Japanese Government. He said: The main objective of the visit is to exchange views with Japanese Government leaders and personages from various circles of life there on the development of bilateral relations. The visit aims to enhance mutual understanding, deepen friendship, and promote the further development of friendship and cooperation between the two countries in various fields. During his visit to Japan, China and Japan do not intend to sign any agreement. The spokesman also announced that Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei will visit Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Namibia at the invitation of these three countries' foreign ministries, and will visit South Africa as a guest of the Center for South Africa Studies of the Chinese Institute of International Studies in Pretoria from 20 February to 2 March. A reporter asked: The Foreign Relations Authorization Act of the U.S. State Department for fiscal year 1994 has asserted that on the issue of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, the Taiwan Relations Act should supersede the Sino-U.S. Joint Communique issued on 17 August 1982. What is your comment on this? The spokesman said: The essence of the revised Taiwan Relations Act of the United States is to attempt to overrule the 17 August joint communique between China and the United States and legalize U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. This is what the Chinese Government and people stand firmly opposed to. The 17 August joint communique is an international agreement reached between the two governments of China and the United States, which the U.S. Government is obligated to strictly abide by in the principle that international laws prevail over domestic laws, and to take necessary measures to prevent the U.S. Congress from making any remarks and taking any actions which are in violation of this principle with a view to the maintenance of Sino-U.S. relations. Another reporter asked: A Japanese magazine has asserted that China views Japan as a "major enemy in 20 years." Please comment on this. The spokesman said: This assertion is untenable and is designed by a very small number of people to sow discord. It is the common aspiration of the two peoples to carry on Sino-Japanese friendly and cooperative relations from generation to generation, and it is a basic policy of the Chinese Government to develop friendly relations and cooperation with Japan in a sustained and stable manner on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence. Long-standing friendship and cooperation between China and Japan will not only benefit the two countries, but also contribute to the stability and prosperity of the region and the world at large. A reporter asked the spokesman to comment on a report that the DPRK has agreed to inspection of its nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The spokesman said: "We welcome this development, which has again shown that dialogue is the only correct way for solving the DPRK's nuclear issue. We hope that the parties directly concerned will continue to adopt a positive and constructive attitude and seek an appropriate solution to this issue at an early date through dialogue and consultation." In response to a question about Li Denghui's visit to Thailand, the spokesman said: "The Chinese Foreign Ministry has made representations with Thailand and elucidated the solemn position of China on this matter."
