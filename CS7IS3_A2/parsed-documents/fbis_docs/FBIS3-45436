Most urban residents have been aware of the flood of foreign brands, from color televisions to motorcycles, from garments to cosmetics, and from drinks to small buttons. Economists here believe that with the drive of opening wider to the outside world and a hefty rise of foreign investments in the country, it is an inevitable outcome that more foreign manufacturers try to get into markets in China, and consumer goods must lead the way. But, they said, most of the foreign brands which entered Chinese markets were through the numerous joint ventures in the country, while the Chinese Government has lifted the margin for imports over the past years. Various kinds of foreign-made goods are now being sold in the large department stores and modernized shopping centers, and a few special shops have been set up to sell the foreign products. Take for instance the Quanyechang Market, a large retail sales center in Tianjin built 60 years ago. Among 350,000 kinds of goods on sale in the center in 1993, 8.4 percent were overseas-made, with a total turnover of 25 million yuan. Even in a small shop with only a dozen employees, reporters were told that about 50 percent of the goods sold were from foreign-funded companies. It is a common practice that most of the products of these joint ventures, sold with foreign trade marks on the domestic market, contain some parts imported from their parent firms abroad. The Tianjin No. 1 Light Industry Bureau has organized 96 such joint ventures with the aid of U.S. and German companies, whose annual turnover reached 1.2 billion yuan in 1993. An official of the industry bureau said that as long as these ventures can keep balance in their foreign exchange, there is no problem for their products to enter China's market. The lowered import duties and restructured foreign exchange system will encourage more foreign dealers to compete in the domestic market, he said. Also, he added, with a sturdy rise in their living standards, consumers in urban districts have begun to turn to high-quality products. To meet the increasing demand for foreign brands, a newly-built Quanyechang Market building here will be put into operation in September, mainly to sell imported goods or products made by joint ventures. When completed, its annual turnover is expected to reach one billion yuan.
