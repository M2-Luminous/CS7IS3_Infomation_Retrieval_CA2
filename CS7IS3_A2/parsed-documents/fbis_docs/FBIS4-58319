The newspapers AL-THAWRAH, AL-JUMHURIYAH, and BABIL emphasize that the White House policy on Iraq indicates a clear ignorance of the logic of events, of the pillars of relations, and of interests as well as a disregard of both the U.S. interests and the exits to the U.S. markets. In the "Standpoint" column, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH, which expresses the views of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, says: The picture at the Security Council is clear now. Only the United States opposes lifting the embargo when China, France, and Russia are making pressures to lift it. Britain acknowledged that Iraq is cooperating with the Security Council. AL-THAWRAH recalls what Washington imposed on its allies as well as the U.S. issuance, in the Security Council's name, of unfair resolutions against Iraq. The paper adds that after Ekeus acknowledged before the Security Council that Iraq is cooperating with it, the United States stood against the international community's will, refused to implement Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687, and called for maintaining the blockade on Iraq. The paper draws the U.S. Administration's attention to the fact that the international community is no longer capable of following the U.S. policy indefinitely. The world is aware that Iraq is a key player in the region and that it should be addressed with rationality, patience, and good intentions because any form of aggression or threats against Iraq are useless. The paper urges the United States to adopt a different policy toward Iraq; one that would take into account realities, peoples' interests, and the international community's will. The newspaper BABIL says that the U.S. position is becoming more intransigent against Iraq at a time when the international circles are witnessing increased cries and positions denouncing the continued unfair economic blockade on Iraq. The paper adds: Some influential members of the Security Council and the United Nations support both the international law and the Security Council resolutions which Iraq committed itself to implement. The Iraqi commitment was acknowledged by the Special Commission entrusted with international inspection. Thus, the only explanation of the U.S. position is what we, in Iraq, knew from the very beginning, that is, this position is a hostile and conspiratorial one. BABIL points out that with some signs appearing that many international community circles are stressing the need for the Security Council to fulfill its pledges to Iraq by issuing resolutions lifting the oil embargo on it, the U.S. Administration is no longer capable of using, as a pretext, the international laws and human rights. This administration has rancorously revealed its evil intentions about not fulfilling its obligations to Iraq. BABIL emphasizes that U.S. Secretary of State Christopher could not endure this new state of affairs, so he visited the region to meet with agents and with the afraid and shivering ones and reassure them that the United States would always stand against Iraq and its people. The paper points to Christopher's article published in THE NEW YORK TIMES which contained a host of lies that even the ordinary man in the street can no longer believe. BABIL explains that this criminal U.S. position can only receive further denunciation from the good ones and conscientious people in the world. The newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH describes the Clinton administration's policy on Iraq as resembling someone who fights his own kinsfolk and stands against his people's interests. Pointing out that the repercussions and damage resulting from the blockade have extended outside Iraq and affected the interests of Turkey, Jordan, and many European states such as Germany, France, Spain, and Britain, the paper says that the blockade inflicted grave damage on the Americans themselves after it closed the doors to a market that used to import one-fifth of the U.S. rice production in addition to large quantities of grains, animal fodder, and other goods. Discussing the large U.S. trade deficit with world states last year, which amounts to $115.8 billion, the paper says that the Clinton administration, under Zionist pressures and individual interests, deliberately closes the doors to Americans who wish to deal with Iraq, which has a tremendous ability to accommodate goods and services. Comparing the size of U.S. trade with Iraq and other states, AL-JUMHURIYAH says that U.S. trade figures show that the overall imports of U.S. goods by Syria, Bahrain, Oman, and Jordan did not reach $1.5 billion and that Iraqi imports, during the period of peak transactions with the United States, exceeded this figure. Indicating that Iraq's imports of U.S. grains exceeded $1 billion in 1989 and in the preceding year, the paper says that, thanks to its huge ability to accommodate goods, Iraq alone can import U.S. commodities worth more than one-half of the U.S. exports to all Arab countries. AL-JUMHURIYAH urges the Clinton administration to review its policy and deal with Iraq through a rational logic based on respecting sovereignty, abandoning both bigotry and hostility, and looking forward to balanced trade relations. The paper adds that there is still an opportunity for the White House administration if it is aware of both the regional situation and the U.S. interests in it.
