FR940526-1-00026 FR940526-1-00012 Definitions of Allowance Categories The following definitions of the allowance categories identified in the tables in this appendix shall be used to determine employee eligibility for the appropriate allowance rate: ␣ 1Allowance category 1Definition Local Retail This category includes those employees who purchase goods and services from private retail establishments. Commissary/Exchange This category includes those employees who shop at private retail establishments, but who, as a result of their Federal civilian employment, also have unlimited access to commissary and exchange facilities. This category is established only in those allowance areas that have these facilities. Note: Eligibility for access to military commissary and exchange facilities is determined by the appropriate military department. If an employee is furnished with these privileges for reasons associated with his or her Federal civilian employment, he or she will have an identification card that authorizes access to such facilities. Possession of such an identification card_i.e., one issued by reason of his or her Federal civilian employment_is sufficient evidence that the employee uses the facilities. 5.
