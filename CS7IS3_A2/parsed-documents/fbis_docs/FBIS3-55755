In his words, "the document, in particular guarantees of Ukraine's security, is being drafted." He added that if the document is not drafted before Friday, the Moscow meeting will be consultative." According to Sergeyev, the brief meeting of the U.S. and Ukrainian presidents in Kiev on January 12 will concentrate on the bilateral relations. "Ukraine and the United States want to have balanced relations which should emphasize the economic rather than the military and political sphere," he explained. Sergeyev also explained that all treaties and accords that the Ukrainian president would sign must be ratified by the country's parliament. The Ukrainian Supreme Soviet ratified START I with numerous reservations. The treaty provides for withdrawal of nearly 1500, or 16 percent, warheads and 176, or 42 percent, strategiic missiles from Ukraine. Numerous national democratic deputies of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet have criticized the president's intention to sign a nuclear disarmament treaty in Moscow.
