I. Litvin; UDC 681.32.06] [Abstract] The possibility is examined for using orthogonal Walsh and Fourier matrices for circular testing in linear discrete devices and in multiprocessor computer systems of the SIMD type. In order check that the logical and arithmetic operations are properly carried out, the task of mutual testing in a multiprocessor computer system with a distributed floating kernel is resolved. It was found that the use of orthogonal discrete Fourier and Walsh transforms made it simple and efficient to properly control the way logical and arithmetic operations are carried out in computers. 4 figures and 8 references.
