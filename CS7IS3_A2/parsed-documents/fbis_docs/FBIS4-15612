Poland's Defense Minister Mr. Kolodziejczyk is on an official visit to Kiev. He met Ukraine's defense minister, Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy. After the conversation, held in a businesslike manner, journalist Marat Pohorelov invited both leaders to the microphone. [Begin recording] [Pohorelov] Mr. Minister, if this is not a secret, what issues have you discussed with the Ukrainian defense minister, and what is your vision of the prospects for cooperation between Ukraine and Poland in the military sphere? [Kolodziejczyk in Polish with superimposed Ukrainian translation] Very serious issues were considered. We met to discuss bilateral cooperation between our neighboring states and our armies. We were discussing Partnership for Peace and exchange of experience between Poland and Ukraine in the field of the armed forces. Other issues were discussed during our meeting; for example, the political situation in Europe, security both on the continent and in our region. We also touched upon other issues that our experts will deal with in greater detail. This refers to joint exercises in the border areas, the antiaircraft defense system, relations between our general staffs, and many other issues. [Radetskyy] The meeting with the Polish defense minister was planned according to a preliminary agreement; the more so that the Polish defense minister has just been appointed. He is a (?former) militaryman; an admiral, he graduated from the Academy in Leningrad and the Academy of the General Staff. It is very easy to talk with him about the problems facing both the Polish Army and the Ukrainian Army today. Actually, they are similar. We agreed that our expert groups will work out issues of technical, logistical support, [words indistinct] in the military industrial complex. I briefed Poland's defense minister on the current state of affairs in Crimea and on how this problem is being tackled there. The problems facing Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet today are complicated. But they need to be solved, to be solved consistently. We favor this, but [words indistinct] on the side of Russia. [Pohorelov] On the same day, Mr. Kolodziejczyk laid flowers at the grave of the Unknown Soldier, met the leaders of Ukraine's military-industrial complex, and visited the museum of the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945.
