Kravchuk's tour of the Lvov Oblast is beginning today, two weeks before the election. Ukrainian political analysts are wondering why the nationalistic oblast, which only three years ago pledged its allegiance to Vyacheslav Chornovyl -- Kravchuk's opponent at the first presidential election -- is now supporting Kravchuk in the same way. Is this a desire to spite the eastern area, which wants close cooperation with its Russian neighbor or do they now see Kravchuk as a nationalist patriot number one? Significantly, as a part of his pre-election tour, Kravchuk today opened in Lvov city center a monument to Mikhail Grushevskiy, the first Ukrainian president of 1918, a historian and a politician who declared the country's independence. Thus the incumbent will raise his popularity even more. Local leaders believe that Galichina [historical name of the Lvov area] should again assume the historic role of the state's savior. Leonid Kravchuk is the one at the forefront here.
