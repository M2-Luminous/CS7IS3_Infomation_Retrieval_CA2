According to it, a delegation of the WFTU consisting of its Secretary General Alexandr Jarikov and Secretary Debkumar Ganguli paid a visit to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from April 12, 1994, at the invitation of the GFTUK. The secretary general of the WFTU, in the name of the delegation, congratulated Comrade Kim Il-song, the great leader of the Korean people and president of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, on his birthday and sincerely wished him good health and a long life. The GFTUK noted with high estimation that the WFTU has made a great contribution to the people's struggle against imperialist and neo-colonialist aggression and for freedom and sovereignty under the current international situation marked by a manifold crisis. The GFTUK also expressed satisfaction with the consistent efforts of the Asian and Pacific regional office of the WFTU to tighten the relations of friendship and cooperation among the trade unions in the Asian and Pacific region on the basis of independence. The WFTU delegation got deep impressions everywhere it went, witnessing Korean working people under the guidance of the Workers' Party of Korea and its leaders making strenuous efforts to further consolidate socialism, a society free from domination and subjugation, exploitation and oppression, poverty and unemployment, the age-old desire of mankind, fighting against the U.S. imperialists maneuvers. The WFTU delegation resolutely denounced the deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea, demanded that the U.S. authorities give up their intrigues, and urged the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency not to allow their names and authority to be abused. The WFTU delegation reaffirmed its unflinching support to the stand of the DPRK to turn the Korean peninsula into a nuclear-free, peace zone and achieve an independent and peaceful reunification of the country by founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo. The GFTUK and WFTU manifested their common stand that all the peace- and justice-loving anti-imperialist forces should firmly unite on the joint front against the ever-increasing imperialist and neo-colonialist aggressive policies in order to realize democratization of the international community and establish an equitable new international economic order. Both sides called upon the world's working class, the most active defender of justice and truth and the very one immediately responsible for the independent rights and demands of the laboring masses, to take the lead in this struggle. Both sides expressed sympathy with the view that the 13th WFTU congress would occasion a new turn in developing the WFTU into an organization capable of facing up to challenges of the changed situation.
