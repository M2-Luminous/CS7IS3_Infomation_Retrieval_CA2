According to a target worked out by the provincial government for export-oriented economy, the province will earn more than two billion U.S. dollars from exports this year. It will also approve the establishment of about 1,500 new foreign-funded enterprises, and the use of foreign investment is set at over one billion U.S. dollars. Output value and earnings from sales for existing operational foreign-funded enterprises in the province are fixed at over four billion yuan each. At a provincial economic working meeting held recently, Jia Zhijie, governor of the province, urged local officials from relevant departments to seize the current opportunity for developing the economy and to intensify the opening-up drive, in order to realize the target for the development of export-oriented economy in the province. At present, Wuhan, the provincial capital, Huangshi and Yichang cities, all on the Chang Jiang River, have been approved by the State Council to be open cities. An increasing number of international consortiums and transnational companies are investing in these open cities, as the implementation of the state's strategy for opening and developing areas along the Chang Jiang River and the preparatory work of the world's second largest dam at the Three Gorges continues. To meet the set target of this year, the governor also urged different localities to strengthen the construction of export- oriented industries and bases and bring the initiatives of all sides into play in developing export-oriented economy, ensuring quick and stable increases in exports. While drawing up regulations and policies to encourage development of export-oriented economic activities, different localities should also broaden the rational use of foreign funds and strive hard to help the local economy adapt to the international economy, said the governor. He also called for the establishment of an authorized leading group for the work of developing export-oriented economy and simplifying procedures of approval for overseas investors to set up businesses.
