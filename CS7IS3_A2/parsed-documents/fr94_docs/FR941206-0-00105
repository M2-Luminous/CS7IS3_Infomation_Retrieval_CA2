FR941206-0-00105 FR941206-0-00015 4. The Second Reconsideration Order generally affirms the rules adopted in the First Reconsideration Order, except that the Commission has decided to revise the national ownership rule with respect to minority and small business broadcasters. The Second Reconsideration Order increase the national limits for minority owners to 25 AM and 25 FM stations, and raises to five the number, in excess of the national limits, of minority or small business controlled AM or FM stations in which a non-minority broadcaster may hold a non-controlling interest. 5. In addition, because of concerns raised by a number of parties with respect to the effects of the revised rules on competition and diversity in radio markets, the Commission, on its own motion, reviews the radio ownership rules in light of relevant economic and antitrust principles. Pursuant to its analysis of these principles, the Commission concludes that the radio ownership rules are consistent with established principles of competitive analysis and at the present time provide adequate safeguards to ensure acceptable levels of diversity in the radio marketplace. Local Ownership Limits 6. The First Reconsideration Order revised ยง73.3555 to permit a single owner in a larger market to own up to two AM and two FM stations, subject to an audience share cap of 25 percent, and to permit an owner in a smaller market to own up to three stations, provided that no more than two are in the same service and that the stations represent fewer than half of the total number of stations in the area. A ``market'' is defined with respect to overlapping signal contours. For instance, the relevant market with respect to a combination of two stations in the same market would encompass those two stations as well as all other radio stations whose principal community contours overlap those of the two stations involved in the proposed transaction. 7. Urging reconsideration, LULAC argues that the new local rules disadvantage small stations, and reiterates its suggestion that, rather than change the local ownership rules, the Commission should allow greater consolidation for financially failing radio stations. NABOB/NBMC reiterate their previous argument that increased ownership limits will substantially reduce opportunities for increased minority ownership in broadcasting and will force minority broadcasters out of the radio industry. In opposition, NAB contends that adoption of LULAC's proposal would impede the positive effects of the new rules. 8. The Commission notes that it directly addressed LULAC's suggestion to adopt a failed station standard in the First Reconsideration Order. It concludes that LULAC's argument, that its ``failing'' station would permit a troubled station to obtain ownership relief well before it actually fails, does not adequately address the Commission's fundamental concern with the vitality of the industry generally. It therefore finds that LULAC has presented no new evidence or argument to revisit that review. The Commission also concludes that NABOB/NBMC likewise have not presented any new information that would persuade it to further modify the local limits. 9. While it does not modify its local ownership rules, the Commission does make a minor correction. A reference to ``the most recent published audience share data available at the time that the application is filed'' was deleted from ยง73.3555(a)(3)(iii) when that rule section was revised (and renumbered) pursuant to the First Reconsideration Order. That deletion was inadvertent, and the quoted provision was intended by the Commission to remain in the rules. Section 73.3555(a)(3)(iii) will be modified to reinsert that language, as set forth below. 10. In its petition for rule making. NAB suggests that when only one of the stations in a proposed combination has a principal community contour that would place the transaction in a market of 15 or more stations, the parties to the transaction should be permitted to elect whether to be governed by (1) the rules for small markets based on the number of stations overlapping the smaller facility's contour (thus avoiding the audience share limitation); or (2) the rules for large markets, but with the audience share calculated based on all counties receiving any one of the 15 or more stations counted as in the market pursuant to ยง73.3555(a)(3)(ii). 11. NAB also proposes that the local ownership rule be modified so that ownership of ``not greater than 50 percent'' of the stations in a market would be permitted rather than the current ``less than 50 percent'' rule. In addition, NAB contends that any single station or AM/FM combination licensee should be allowed in all situations to add one additional station to common ownership. 12. Finally, in the event the above changes are not adopted, NAB believes that a clear and liberal set of criteria should be established for requests for waiver of the local ownership rule in traditionally small markets. Among the critical elements of any waiver policy according to NAB, would be the effort to save a dark or failing station. 13. Duke Broadcasting, commenting on the NAB petition, raises similar concerns with the contour-based market definitions in the new rules when applied in small markets, but proposes a different solution. Duke suggests a delineation of two tiers of markets based on Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) ranking, with ``larger'' markets still subject to the combined audience share limitation of 25 percent, and ``smaller'' markets not subject to the combined audience share limitation in the absence of a showing that the particular combined share exceeding 25 percent creates an excessively high concentration of audience. Duke proposes that MSAs ranked above 150 would be placed in the larger market tier, while those ranked 150 and below, as well as non-MSA markets, would be placed in the smaller tier.
