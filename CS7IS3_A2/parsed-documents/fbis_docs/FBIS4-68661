Since the completion of work on the basic directions for the monetary and credit policy of the Bank of Russia coincided in time with a regular ARB congress, Viktor Gerashchenko devoted his report to outlining a fresh concept. This made it possible for the chairman of the Central Bank to avoid the direct, unprejudiced, and (judging by the experience of the previous ARB congress) generally nonsensical polemics with delegates to the congress while keeping his presentation topical and current. In the belief that attaining stability and manageability in the monetary system of the country is its main objective, the Central Bank considers "the absence of effective instruments of control over the money supply" to be a high-priority problem. In conjunction with this, the concept--in the opinion of Central Bank representatives an extremely harmful one--of reorganizing the banking system on the pattern of the American Federal Reserve System poses a major threat. The emergence of several emission centers, even if with limited powers, will bring about uncontrollable growth of the money supply and will very shortly create financial chaos in Russia, cautioned Viktor Gerashchenko. The generally standard methods of monetary regulation--a reserve requirement policy, the level of refinancing rates, the volume of credit outlays, at times interpreted in an extremely exotic manner, with the peculiarities of Russia taken into account--constituted the positive segment of the Central Bank program. The volume of mandatory reserve requirements is, first, the main technique for regulating the credit multiplier; second, it makes it possible to influence the composition of the holding portfolios of banks by stimulating their interest in certain securities. The current level of these requirements (20 percent for demand accounts and 15 percent for time deposits) is quite high, which is however justified given the current inflationary situation. It is another matter that any structure of the reserve funds at all has been lacking so far. Tied-up funds sit in accounts at the Central Bank. Besides, an atrocious settlement system deprived the banks of an opportunity for the current management of reserves. The Central Bank is now ready to allow the use of state securities for meeting reserve requirements. It is understood that this is primarily about one-year treasury bills issued by the Ministry of Finance to cover last year's debt of the state budget to enterprises. The profit margin on these securities was set at the level of 40 percent annually. Including the bills on the list of reserve assets is the only way to interest the commercial banks in them. Mr. Gerashchenko greatly upset the bankers by confirming the intention to extend reserve requirements to foreign exchange deposits. Apparently, the interests of the Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve System coincide in this instance. In recent years, the Federal Reserve System has been experiencing certain difficulties because of an increase in demand for cash dollars: the rate of cash emission has been above the index of inflation by one order of magnitude. The rapidly growing demand for dollars outside of the United States, primarily in Russia, is the main reason for this paradox. The Central Bank has now decided to support its American colleagues and will restrict the amount of dollars in Russia. This year the Central Bank intends to make major changes in the principles and instruments of refinancing. Viktor Gerashchenko finally directly acknowledged the ineffectiveness and even the outright unprofitability of the direct extension of credit to enterprises by the Central Bank. Moreover, the Central Bank intends to rectify the consequences of its own credit abuses and not only root out this vice in practice but wipe it out in the documents, sanitizing to this end the balance sheets of banks that have participated in the distribution of centralized credit. Viktor Gerashchenko believes that the defaulted debt of enterprises by virtue of centralized credit should be converted into public debt with state obligations being drawn up. This touching concern for banks, most of which have made good money off the centralized-credit windfall, runs into a number of obstacles. In particular, quite a few loans were not extended by decisions of the government. The Central Bank extended some on its own, too. It is not easy to understand what obligations on these loans have to do with the public debt. The quantitative planks for the volume of emission and the level of the refinancing rate have been set forth in a joint declaration of the government and the Central Bank. The Central Bank complied with them strictly in the first quarter. In the opinion of Viktor Gerashchenko, the planks are realistic. The chairman of the Central Bank commented on rumors concerning a prompt sharp reduction in the refinancing rate which were triggered by his presentation in the State Duma. Unlike ARB President Sergey Yegorov, who unambiguously evaluated the current interest rate policy of the Central bank of Russia as smothering not only production but also (!!!--Andrey Grigoryev) the banking system, Mr. Gerashchenko stated neatly that "the downward trend that has emerged in the credit market may render the refinancing rate unjustifiably high," and then the Central Bank will proceed to reduce it. The quotas of increment of financial aggregates (see BIZNES-SEGODNYA No. 28, 19 April) restrict the volume of credit to the banking system to 16-17 billion rubles [R]. For this reason "the Central Bank effects financing under strict conditions." The volume of credit distributed on an auction basis will expand. Although regulations on centralized credit auctions provide for an opportunity for directed credit to the "real sector of the economy," the Central Bank will not facilitate this by reducing the auction rate. The Central Bank considers a reduction in the segmentation of money markets to be an important task of credit policy; to this end the Central Bank intends to structure the distribution of resources taking into account the demand emerging in the course of the auctions. The Central Bank intends to compensate for the limited potential of refinancing by using new methods to sustain liquidity in the banking system. First, there is a transition to lombard credit. Having signed a contract of indefinite duration with a territorial main branch of the Central Bank, banks will be able to receive credit against the pledge of state securities and first-class bills of exchange. A list of these will be established by the Board of Directors of the Central bank. The interest on lombard credit will be higher than the refinancing rate. Second, if a debit balance is a threat, banks will be able to receive credit for up to seven days in an amount not to exceed 25 percent of the compulsory reserve fund against a pledge of first-class assets (foreign exchange, precious metals). The rate will be 20 percent higher than the refinancing rate. As we evaluate the generally progressive plans, we are just left wondering what stood in the way of the Central Bank carrying out at least some of the aforementioned undertakings last year at the latest? Besides, the chief of the Central Bank came out in favor of a major effort to reform the legislative foundation for banking. However, Mr. Gerashchenko emphasized primarily the legal problems of the Central Bank itself. In particular, two significant decisions that were incorporated in presidential edicts--the conversion of enterprise debt into bills of exchange and the indexation of deposits in the Savings Bank--were made without consultations with the Central Bank and were legally improper. As far as the issues of legislative regulation of the operation of commercial banks are concerned, they were substantively dealt with by Garegin Tosunyan, ARB deputy president and chairman of the Tekhnobank, who presented a draft of the banking legislation reform developed by the ARB. The first deputy prime minister of the government greatly spoiled the mood of participants in the ARB Congress. Starting by outlining well-known truths to the effect that structural changes in the economy are the foundation for Russia's prosperity, including that of its banking sector, Oleg Soskovets put into words the measures that in his opinion are necessary for the industrial crisis to be successfully overcome. Speaking before the bankers, Mr. Soskovets decided to cover plans for the search for money. Naturally this was about distribution or, more precisely, administrative redistribution. The funds to satisfy the lobbyists supporting the "industrial" deputy prime minister are not available in the budget; the Central Bank has begun to display firmness on this score, having grasped the ineffectiveness of direct centralized provision of credit to "producers." This has prompted the government to turn its gaze to the vaults of commercial banks (it is to be understood that official statements by the first deputy prime minister reflect the point of view of the cabinet). As a theoretical basis for the measures planned, Mr. Soskovets used the notion of the unlawfulness and fallaciousness of banking per se (which, incidentally, many of the speakers at the congress tried to refute, regardless of polemics with the deputy prime minister). In the soft wording of Oleg Soskovets, the notion was voiced as a thesis about the "unjustified nature of banks' profit from speculative transactions with foreign exchange and intermediary operations." In conjunction with this, the government considers it feasible to "allocate 50 percent of banks' profits from such operations as easy credit for retooling programs in industry and the agro-industrial complex." It is necessary to allocate one-third of the internal funds of commercial banks for the same purposes. Besides, Mr. Soskovets charged that the banks, having accumulated considerable funds, allocate them "to intermediary and commercial operations which do not bring about a growth of the stock of merchandise and are not associated with supporting state programs or investment activities." Soskovets' first thesis calls for taking money away from the banks, while the second affects both enterprises and the population. After all, it is precisely their funds that the banks accumulate. The activities generating the growth of the "stock of merchandise" which the deputy prime minister means will plainly bring about a reduction in the real volume of capital. If the crazy ideas outlined above are implemented, the holders of bank deposits will at best receive symbolic interest on them, and at worst, will receive "frozen" accounts. While we insist that the presentation of the first deputy prime minister should be viewed as the official position of the government, it is hard to seriously consider the government capable of such undertakings. Besides, Oleg Nikolayevich himself understands in retrospect that nobody will give him the windfall money to support state enterprises (some of which are becoming the property of Mr. Soskovets), and that the government is not in a position to "allocate" the capital of the banks anywhere without regard for the interests of shareholders and depositors. However, it is extremely lamentable that officials so highly placed allow themselves to engage in absolutely irresponsible and stupid twaddle, and then in premises as respectable as the Hall of Columns in the House of Unions.
