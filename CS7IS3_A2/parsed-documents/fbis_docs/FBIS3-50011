"I am satisfied that your visit is taking place so soon after the Prague summit. Europe is now seeking a new vision of its future. It is our task to add our concepts to this vision. Partnership is real only when we ourselves can settle its conditions. The world paid attention to our statements and arguments presented before the NATO summit in Brussels and the meeting in Prague. Without this pressure on Western public opinion we would get much less," the president said. Geza Jeszenszky stressed that it was mainly the Polish president who contributed to the positive results of this campaign. At the end of the meeting, Walesa said: "After `the Prague lesson' we must always remember that we cannot lose influence on developments in Eastern and Central Europe. No one will help us if we do not do this ourselves. That is why further cooperation within the Visegrad group is so significant. We are speaking the same language and we have common interests. If we build planes for better cooperation, others will join us. In this way we will enlarge the area of stability in our region. If we do not make use of the chance provided by the "Partnership for Peace" we will lose it. "We have to stay on the backs of the rich of the world," to present our arguments to them for only then facts will change into real security safeguards," the president said.
