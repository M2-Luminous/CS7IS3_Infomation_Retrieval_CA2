Governor Ernesto Ruffo Appel said that authorities are searching for Higuera Guerrero, a lieutenant of the Arellano Felix brothers, well-known drug trafficking bosses in the city of Tijuana, for his involvement in a shoot-out on 3 March in which four people were killed. The Baja California governor did not mention the amount of the reward, which will be discussed at the state's congress. The Attorney General's Office [PGR] said yesterday that the best U.S. and Mexican narcotics agents will be part of a special group to fight drug trafficking activities on the border between the countries, where tons of drugs circulate. Ruffo pointed out that Higuera is a key element in the shoot-out that took place between federal and state agents in a Tijuana shopping center, which resulted in four persons being killed, including Alejandro Castaneda, chief of the Federal Judicial Police [PJF]. Five agents were also injured in the incident. According to the PGR, the shoot-out occurred when state agents and a Lebanese gunman were providing protection to Ismael Higuera Guerrero, well-known drug trafficking boss from that border city. The PGR added that the incident took place when members of the State Judicial Police (PJE) were escorting Ismael Higuera Guerrero, alias El Mayel, in a vehicle. The PJF, which is investigating the activities of the Tijuana Cartel, initiated the pursuit of a vehicle in which El Mayel was allegedly traveling, which led the state judicial agents to shoot at the federal agents. The Lebanese gunman, an unidentified man, Castaneda, and a PJE member who was protecting the alleged drug trafficker, were killed in the shoot-out. The PGR said that the assistant state attorney general, Sergio Ortiz Lara, and the state prosecutor for special affairs were arrested by the federal authorities for their alleged responsibility in the incidents. According to the PGR, Ortiz ordered the federal agents to turn over to him one of the alleged drug traffickers, who was arrested following the shoot-out but was later released. Even though Ortiz claims he is innocent, the PGR has denounced the involvement of certain state judicial police members with the drug traffickers, which could explain why the Arellano Felix brothers have not been arrested yet. Governor Ruffo Appel said he believes Ortiz is innocent because he says he has known him since childhood and he had no reason to get involved in drug trafficking activities.
