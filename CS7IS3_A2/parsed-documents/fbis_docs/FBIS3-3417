In his latest government work report, Premier Li Peng again emphasized the needs for a sound legal system to guarantee the establishment and perfection of a socialist market economic system; and the necessity of governments at all levels to learn to use legal means to govern economic and social life. We may as well say that notable achievements have been made in improving the legal system, especially economic legislation, over the past more than a decade. However, we should also realize that law enforcement and awareness in the Chinese economic life leave much to be desired. Many NPC deputies and CPPCC members have deplored a pervasive weak sense of law enforcement and failure to observe laws, strictly enforce them, and punish lawbreakers in economic life. In reality, legislation is important, but law enforcement is even more important. Failure to enforce laws is tantamount to lawlessness. Only by paying equal attention to law enactment and enforcement can the legal system serve as a guarantee for economic development. Deputies and members said: At present, a considerable number of officials, including those directly engaged in economic work, often interpret market economy simply as free economy. As a result, lawbreakers are not aware of their violation of the law and, when confronted by law enforcement personnel, defend their actions with perfect assurance. There were even such strange occurrences of law violators adamantly filing law suits against baffled law observers. Apparently much remains to be done to enable the people to reach a consensus of identifying market economy with the economy ruled by laws. It is heartening that the Eighth NPC and its Standing Committee have, since their inauguration, given top priority to accelerating legislation, especially economic legislation. Of the laws currently in force, some 170 were promulgated between the PRC's founding and the end of 1992. However, during their tenure, the Eighth NPC and its Standing Committee have planned to enact 152 laws. So far, a number of important laws for developing the market economy, standardizing the norms for the market, keeping the market in order, and tightening macroeconomic regulation and control -- such as the Company Law, the Law Against Unfair Competition, and the Law for Protecting Consumers' Rights and Interests -- have been promulgated; and efforts are being stepped up to formulate the Securities Law. Last year is the year in which the largest number of laws and decisions on laws were examined and approved since the founding of the country. We are convinced that along with the continuous improvement of China's legislative work, the concept of law enforcement will surely strike a deeper root in the hearts of the people and their economic life, and that the goal of establishing a socialist market economy will certainly be smoothly realized with the guarantee of a sound legal system.
