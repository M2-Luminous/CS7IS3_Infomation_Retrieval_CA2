This means advancing militarily to tighten the siege on the capital of southern Yemen. Do you really intend to storm Aden and take it militarily? [Basindwah] We do not need to take Aden militarily. Our forces, the forces of legitimacy and unity, are in Aden itself. We believe that the rebels are now trying to take refuge behind the defenseless citizens. The recapturing of these parts of Aden did not take place following the cease-fire, but before it. I believe that those who want to save the citizens from this tribulation should bring new pressure to bear on the remaining rebels to give themselves up to the legitimate authorities or to leave the homeland for good. [Salamah] Mr. Muhammad Salim Basindwah, the new cease-fire agreement, like all previous agreements, did not hold today. Who is responsible for the cease-fire violation? [Basindwah] We invited the U.S. and the French military attaches and news agency correspondents to go, to look for themselves, and to determine which party did not abide by the cease-fire and continued to violate this decision. I believe that the U.S. and French friends have collected information that the forces of legitimacy abided by the cease-fire, which entered into force at 2400 last night and that the party that did not abide by the cease-fire is the rebel group or those who remain from this group and who are taking shelter behind the defenseless civilians. [Salamah] It is being said that if the fighting continues the UN Security Council will issue a new resolution, which was drafted by the United Kingdom with the assistance of Saudi Arabia, to impose cease-fire by force. What is the position of the leadership in Sanaa on the regional and international pressure to halt the war and encourage dialogue to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict? [Basindwah] We want a cease-fire not because we fear this or that party, or the United Nations. We want a cease-fire because we are more concerned than others over the lives of women, children, the elderly, and the sick. However, things must be spelled out. The party that has rejected the cease-fire must be specified as well as those who have interests in exacerbating the situation. Of course, those who benefit from the exchange of fire are the rebels, who believe their end is near. It would have been better for them had they surrendered to the legitimate authorities or left the homeland when the al-'Anad base fell, after they lost the battle. But, they do not want to spare the people further tribulation. [Salamah] Some reports published in the Gulf say that about 18 Arab and European countries are prepared to recognize the proclaimed state in south Yemen if the war does not stop. This means giving legitimacy to the new situation in the country. What is Sanaa's position on the recognition of the southern state? [Basindwah] For our part, we are committed to the cease-fire. I think the U.S. and French military attaches can reaffirm this. As for recognition that aims to fragment Yemen, this does not harm us at all because the recognition will be one on paper, but on the ground unity is an established fact that no one can harm or fragment through recognition. We heard in the past about governments-in-exile but we have not heard about states-in-exile. This, as I believe, will be the first time in human history that a state-in-exile is recognized while it has no presence on the Yemeni land because, God willing, Yemen will remain united. [Salamah] Muhammad Salim Basindwah, President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has dispatched several envoys to the Arab countries to explain the Yemeni position, and the same thing was done by the proclaimed government in the south. So far, the Arab efforts have failed to stop the war, arrange dialogue, or safeguard Yemeni unity. What are the reasons that led to this Arab failure, and how can this paralysis in the general Arab position on the Yemeni crisis be treated? [Basindwah] Of course, the problem in the Arab situation is not a new one. It is an old problem, and we all know its reasons. What is important is that Yemeni unity is safeguarded and the people who realized the unity on 22 May 1990 are able to preserve this unity. Of course, we want the Arab countries to help convince the rebels to refrain from bringing more suffering to the people and to surrender themselves or to leave the homeland. We are confident that it is merely a question of time, and the rebels are heading to their end sooner or later. I think that the next days will witness their end one after another. [Salamah] Muhammad Salim Basindwah, you are in Paris. Have you asked the French Government to play a role in expediting the resolution of the crisis in Yemen? [Basindwah] I am in Paris on a private visit. I did not meet with any officials, but I may return to Paris by the end of this week, which begins tomorrow, to meet with French officials. We greatly appreciate the just and honorable French position. We will continue to be grateful to France for this position, which really shows that France is a friendly country, and we will always remain keen on our friendship with France. [Salamah] The United States has warned the leadership in Sanaa against storming Aden and urged it to withdraw emplacements from around the city. Did you contact the U.S. Administration after the warning, or are you moving toward an open diplomatic confrontation of the United States following reports that it is escalating its position? [Basindwah] We are eager to avoid any diplomatic or nondiplomatic confrontation with the United States and any other party. But I would like to tell you that our eagerness not to storm Aden is not due to fear from that or this state. Rather, it is due to our concern about the bloodshed and property of the sons of our people inside the city of Aden. As you know, when the rebels lost the battle on the various battlefronts, they took refuge in the city of Aden and used the unarmed families as shields. Of course, we cannot expose the citizens to killing, but we pin great hope on the them that they will expel these rebels from their ranks and prevent them from using families as shields. There is no need to storm Aden militarily. We are completely confident that the citizens themselves will help the legitimate forces spread the state's authority over all the governorate of Aden and inside Aden quarters without resorting to armed force, God willing. [Salamah] So, the war will continue, and you still reject regional and international pressures and setting conditions for a dialogue with officials from the south. As a result, there is a suffocating crisis from which no hint of a solution in the country is seen. What are the available opportunities to achieve a political settlement in Yemen apart from this destructive war? [Basindwah] There is no problem at all in reaching a solution if only the world can be convinced that there is a group of rebels that wants to disrupt Yemen's unity and does not want to bow to order, law, and constitutional legitimacy. The other sides are required to persuade this rebellious, renegade group to hand itself over to the legitimate authority and have a fair trial or to leave the homeland and let people live in peace. You know that the government in Yemen is legitimate and derives its legitimacy from the free and fair elections held on 27 April of last year. The world recognized the results of these elections, and even the rebels themselves accepted them before declaring their rebellion. I can't see any government that came to power following fair and free elections allowing any of its citizens to foment a state of rebellion against it. It doesn't stand to reason that the international community should extend recognition to the rebels as a state or authority. We have not done anything wrong, nor perpetrated any crime. All that we want is for law and order to prevail throughout Yemen and for the rebels to bring their rebellion to a halt, then everything will be fine. [Salamah] Do you think this will open the road to dialogue and to a return to a harmonious relationship, without anyone standing trial? [Basindwah] I don't think it is right to be lenient toward those who have caused hundreds of civilians and soldiers to be martyred or wounded in the hostilities. Who is the culprit? The culprits must be held accountable for what they have done. It is not right just to let things pass without the guilty party being called to account. There are unionist elements within the [Yemeni] Socialist Party and these have had no hand in what has happened. We have nothing against them and they are welcome to resume their positions. All of us will reach out to them. [Salamah] Would you name names? [Basindwah] I know many of them, but I would rather not name names now, if only not to embarrass them. [Salamah] Thank you for being with us, Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah of Yemen. [Basindwah] I thank you and Radio Monte Carlo.
