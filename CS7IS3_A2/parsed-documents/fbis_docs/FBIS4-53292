In an interview with the Probe Team [GMA-7's weekly program], Lagman, alias Carlos Forte, said that the conditions of the conflict should be laid out. [Begin Lagman recording] If he [Sison] truly rejects the peaceful disengagement, then we will be obliged to speak out. Let us define now the terms of engagement. If you [Sison] do not want a peaceful breakup, let us clarify the terms of engagement. As what I have said, so that the military cannot sow bloody intrigues, let us clarify the target. If you want to target me, just say so publicly that it is Popoy [Lagman], and only Popoy. I will also declare openly that it is only him. So that if someone falls, it is the work of the military. [end recording] In this regard, Lagman also said that the Ramos administration scored anew against Joma Sison through the government's release of Tiamzon. [Begin Lagman recording] The Ramos regime really set up Joma for an intense wallop. The government will get the so-called high moral ground. If Joma continues his stubbornness, he will get an real intense wallop. As we said, the movement has to pursue the peace discussion on substantial questions, not to argue on venue, and about whatever demands. The talks should be started. That is the solution.
