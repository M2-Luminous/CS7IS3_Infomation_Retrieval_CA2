The reforms were agreed upon during the recent Forum for Economic and Social Consensus. It also approved the creation of a Higher Council of Labor and the prompt resumption of work at the Forum for Economic and Social Consensus to deal with several pending issues. Deputies of the Political and Labor and Social Welfare Commissions issued the surprise approvals, which were in turn approved by all political sectors represented at the Assembly. The reforms recognize the existence of trade, business, industrial, and independent contractor unions. The Ministry of Labor will aid in forming these organizations. The unions will be prohibited from denying nonunion workers the right to employment, [forcibly] enrolling such workers in unions, or refusing them the right to resign from unions. There will be penalties for those who violate the code's provisions. [San Salvador Radio Cadena YSU in Spanish at 1800 GMT on 22 April reports that the National Peasant-Worker Union, UNOC, expressed its disagreement with some of the reforms. UNOC leaders believe "the Legislative Assembly has taken a step that may not prove very positive for the working class in general." They added that some of the reforms "are detrimental to worker interests." The reforms, they say, were hastily approved to meet "a requirement of the foreign trade authorities of the United States."]
