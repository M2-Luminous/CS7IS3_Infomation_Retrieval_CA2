Eliasson has returned from Baku upon the completion of consultations in Yerevan and Stepanakert and met Azeri President Geydar Aliyev tonight. In his opinion, pulled efforts of the sides, the mediating missions of CSCE and Russia will help to elaborate a common concept of the problem solution. He said that cease-fire in the conflict zone has begun an important settlement stage and the settlement process should have the right direction. It is also important to prevent a new escalation of combat operations. That is why, the persons who are responsible for further developments should estimate their chance correctly and reach certain compromises in order to settle the conflict peacefully and through political negotiations, said Eliasson. The most correct way towards peace is gradual solution of problems that have piled up over the conflict years. Each stage should be connected with another in a single link, he noted. Such a constructive approach will ensure the withdrawal of Armenian troops from Azeri lands, return of refugees to places of their permanent residence and security guarantees for Karabakh Armenians, which is considered the most important in the settlement by each side, said Eliasson.
