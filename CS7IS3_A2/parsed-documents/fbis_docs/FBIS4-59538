The war raging there does not serve any of the Yemeni people's interests. Political differences should not have led to such a fierce war. This is hurting our people in Yemen and all their interests. We warned against this. And, refraining from violence or the use of force to deal with disputes was consecrated as a principle at the beginning of the political dialogue during the crisis. Therefore, the situation is difficult and tragic, and against the Yemeni people's interests, against their unity, against all the bonds of brotherhood, and against their economy. Therefore, we are trying by all means to stop this war and return to the voice of logic and to a dialogue of reason and conscience. [correspondent] What about the pledge and accord document signed in Amman? [Al-'Attas] One of the aims of the war, in my opinion, is to contain, circumvent, and renounce this document. It is very obvious that any military action to deal with the crisis will be intended to stop dialogue and sound treatment of the crisis, as stated in the pledge and accord document. [correspondent] What, Mr. Prime Minister, do you think of current Arab mediation efforts? [Al-'Attas] I think the Arab nation has a very large pan-Arab responsibility to adopt responsible positions to stop the bleeding in Yemen and to push all the parties toward responsible dialogue in order to address the current political problems in the country, which coincided with the establishment of Yemeni unity in May 1990. We pinned hopes, and we continue to pin hopes, on Arab efforts, particularly the Syrian and Egyptian efforts, as well as those of other Arab countries represented by the Arab League. [correspondent] What about the decisions taken by the leadership in the north to depose several officials? [Al-'Attas] These are illegitimate unconstitutional, and secessionist decisions. They cannot resolve the problem correctly and peacefully. All the decisions by the House of Representatives and other bodies mean nothing. They only underscore the desire of the warmongers and the continuation of this war in Yemen. Once again, I stress that war is against Yemeni interests and against the interests of the Yemeni homeland. Therefore, such decisions are meant to sever all ties and all economic channels. I would like to reiterate that they are illegitimate and meaningless. [correspondent] There is also a question abouit the future of Yemeni unity. What can you say about this unity? [Al-'Attas] No doubt, it is in danger. War means work against unity. We have repeatedly drawn attention to this. We said resorting to war would mean acting against unity and against the wishes of the Yemeni people. Unity cannot be achieved by war or by military victory. I hope the leadership of the Yemeni people will stop this bloodshed and return to the language of dialogue and logic and to the language of reason, not emotions and desires. This is the path that can guide all Yemenis to the best method to address the problem and the current political situation in Yemen and find practical solutions to them.
