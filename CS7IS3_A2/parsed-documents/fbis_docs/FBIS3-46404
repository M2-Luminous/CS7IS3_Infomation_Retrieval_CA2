Infrastructure Attracts Great Attention In October 1993, Hutchison-Whampoa, Ltd. of Hong Kong and the Shenzhen Dongpeng Industry Company, Ltd. jointly formed the Yantian International Container Terminal Company, Ltd. to build and manage the Yantian International Container Terminal. With a total investment estimated at greater than 5 billion yuan, the project is the largest joint venture in Shenzhen. On 5 October 1993, Premier Li Peng met with Li Ka-shing, the richest person in Hong Kong and the president of Hutchison-Whampoa Ltd. Li Ka-shing was attending a signing ceremony in Beijing for the project. Premier Li Peng said during the meeting: China faces an increasing demand for transportation as its economy develops further, its door opens wider, and its foreign economic and trade activities increase. The mainland's use of foreign funds has been expanded to include the area of infrastructure, including ports, railroads, airports, and power stations. Premier Li Peng's remarks have summed up from another angle the trend of Hong Kong businessmen's investment in the mainland. [passage omitted]
