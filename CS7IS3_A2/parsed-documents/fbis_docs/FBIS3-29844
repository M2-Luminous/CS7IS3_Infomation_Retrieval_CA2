"Even though all nations that had originally hesitated to accept (the ban) have all fallen in step with the comprehensive ban (on dumping), it is regrettable that only Russia remains out of step," Eda told a press conference after a cabinet meeting. Eda said Japan will continue to urge Moscow to accept the dumping ban and offer technological cooperation in helping Russia to manage and store its nuclear waste. Russia registered its noncompliance on Friday to an amendment to the London Convention on Sea Pollution and will be the only country of 72 signatories of the treaty to continue dumping nuclear waste at sea. Belgium, Britain, China and France, along with Russia, had abstained on voting for the amendment when it was introduced last November at a meeting of the International Maritime Organization (IMO). IMO officials said Monday that all of the countries, except Russia, have now accepted the international ban. The amendment was prompted by Russia's dumping of a large quantity of liquid radioactive waste into the Sea of Japan last October.
