[Kanis] It would not be good to speak right now about what could be expected in the sector. I would rather stress that I would like to follow up the trend whose foundations have been laid by Minister Andrejcak. It is the trend of the Slovak Republic entering the European security structures. As you may well know, I was the author of [word indistinct] programs of the Party of the Democratic Left, which were the first to push through the orientation towards NATO. This fact may have been taken into consideration in choosing a candidate for the post of defense minister. [Correspondent] The Slovak Republic was more successful in concluding agreements eastward so far. Do you envisage any change during your term of office? [Kanis] I do not think that the republic was more successful eastward as the Slovak Republic has achieved many successes in becoming closer to Western European security structures. I think that the decision on Slovakia's security orientation is unambiguous. We only have to find appropriate (?firms) and appropriate ways to implement this trend to strengthen the integration into Western security structures. It is a political as well as a military and financial issue. [Correspondent] Do you have any conceptual solutions ready? [Kanis] It would not be very appropriate to give you a positive answer.
