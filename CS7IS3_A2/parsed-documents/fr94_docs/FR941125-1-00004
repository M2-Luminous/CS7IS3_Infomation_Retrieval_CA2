ACTION: Proposed suspension of rules. SUMMARY: This document invites written comments on a proposal that would extend a suspension of certain provisions of the Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee Valley, and Louisville-Lexington-Evansville Federal milk orders from March 1, 1995, through February 28, 1996, or until the conclusion of an amendatory proceeding that has been scheduled to deal with these matters. DATES: Comments are due no later than December 27, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Nicholas Memoli, Marketing Specialist, USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, Room 2968, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC. 20090&hyph;6456, (202) 690&hyph;1932. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This action would lessen the regulatory burden on small entities by removing pricing disparities that are causing or could cause financial hardship for certain regulated plants. The Department is issuing this proposed action in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This proposed suspension has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to have a retroactive effect. This action will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with the rule. The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under §608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), the suspension of the following provisions of the orders regulating the handling of milk in the Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee Valley, and Louisville-Lexington-Evansville marketing areas is being considered for a 12-month period beginning March 1, 1995: 1. In §1005.7(d)(3) of the Carolina order, the words ``from'', ``there'', ``a greater quantity of route disposition, except filled milk, during the month'', and ``than in this marketing area''; 2. In §1007.7(e)(3) of the Georgia order, the words ``, except as provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this section,''; 3. In §1007.7 of the Georgia order, paragraph (e)(4); 4. In §1011.7(d)(3) of the Tennessee Valley order, the words ``from'', ``there'', ``a greater quantity of route disposition, except filled milk, during the month'', and ``than in this marketing area''; and 5. In §1046.2 of the Louisville-Lexington-Evansville order, the word ``Pulaski''. All persons who desire to send written data, views or arguments about the proposed suspension should send two copies of them to the USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, Room 2968, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, by the 30th day after publication of this notice in the Federal Register . The comments that are sent will be made available for public inspection in the Dairy Division during normal business hours (7 CFR 1.27(b)).
