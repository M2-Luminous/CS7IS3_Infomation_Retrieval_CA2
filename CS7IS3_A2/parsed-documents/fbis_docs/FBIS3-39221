Summing up a diplomatic marathon which ended with a meeting of the Atlantic Council in Brussels Wednesday, Andreatta said that on a political level one could say that "the trigger has been pulled." This is the only way to see to it that the cannons and heavy arms surrounding Sarajevo are eliminated, Andreatta told the Senate foreign affairs committee this evening. When a Communist Refoundation [Communist Renewal] spokesman objected to his reference to a pulled trigger, Andreatta said if ever there was an occasion in which the arms of the European Union and of NATO could be used for a universal goal of international justice it was the present need to lift the siege of Sarajevo. Andreatta reported that he had sent a message to the U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher Monday in which the Italian position was reiterated. Italy is convinced of the urgent need to stop the lethal shelling of Sarajevo and backs the idea of using air power to force the withdrawal of all heavy artillery from the hills around the city, he stressed. Nevertheless, the basic goal is to issue a stern warning to all sides to go all out to find a negotiated solution to the conflict in Bosnia, he said. The Croatians must exercise the greatest flexibility when it comes to ensuring the Muslims access to the sea and Zagreb must "without delay" proceed to the withdrawal of its military forces from Bosnia, he said. Andreatta remains convinced that an agreement between the Croatians and the Muslims is fundamental to reaching any overall agreement on Bosnia. The Italian foreign minister also insisted on the need for greater involvement on the part of the United States, Russia and the Islamic countries. He felt that Russian reservations about the "juridicial legitimacy" of any UN request for intervention in Bosnia, were too narrow. Andreatta also urged that the United States throw its full support between the European Union's action plan. U.S. Secretary of Defense William J. Perry today contacted Italian Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri by telephone to discuss the Bosnian crisis following the NATO decision to put a halt to the siege of Sarajevo. The two sides confirmed their determination to follow up on actions agreed upon along with the United Nations. Italy would provide logistical support for NATO air forces standing ready to carry out missions in Bosnia.
