FBIS4-48533 "drafr098_c_94027" FBIS-AFR-94-098 Daily Report 21 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 19 May South African Press Review for 19 May MB1905160494 MB1905160494 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR ANC's Development Plan Facing "Credibility Problem" -- The Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 19 May in a page 18 editorial criticizes the ANC's recent accessment of the cost of the Reconstruction and Development Plan, RDP. "Minister without Portfolio Jay Naidoo has reassured the nation that 'there is no need for alarm bells to be ringing' now that the ANC economic think-tank has found that the RDP will command a price tag of between R[rand]80 billion and R90 billion estimate that was doing the rounds ahead of the elections. We're reading Naidoo's lips, but the message isn't convincing. Had the programme not been a major cornerstone of the Government's economic strategy (as President Mandela often emphasised) and had the before and after projections not been as skewed as they are, the alarm bells may have been muted. In the event, they are ringing in a host of awkward questions, to which answers must be forthcoming if the new Government is not to suffer a credibility crisis in the early stages of its term of office." BUSINESS DAY "Greater Clarity" Wanted Regarding RDP -- "South Africa can no longer waste time looking at its economy through rose-tinted spectacles," begins the Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 19 May in a page 8 editorial. "Our national propensity to spend beyond our means is clear from the estimates of budget overruns that are the legacy of spending on the election and the transition to majority government. Now we have new estimates from the ANC's National Institute for Economic Policy that the reconstruction and development programme is likely to cost more than R80 billion over the next five years rather than the R39bn we were led to believe before the election." The editorial questions "what was to be gained by earlier insistence that the lower figure was correct. Transperency seems to be one loser in this particular exercise in public accounting." Turning to another issue the new government must address, the editorial states that "as we have pointed out before, South Africa's new militarists are already trying to ensure that our military budget is not pared. Yet unless it is, we are likely to find that foreign lenders and aid providers deliver less than they promised." SOWETAN Need To Address Salaries of Public Servants -- "The new Government will make a grave mistake early in its tenure if it fails to respond adequately to concerns about the salaries and perks of public servants," begins the Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 19 May in a page 8 editorial. "So far, there has been a muted response from our new parliamentarians to the recommendations of the TEC [Transitional Executive Council]-appointed Melamet Committee which, among other things, substantially increases Parliament's salary bill. Those who have responded by saying they will donate a percentage of their salary to party coffers, or President Nelson Mandela's intention to donate part of his to a children's fund, miss the point. We were hoping our new representatives, who have a history of struggle and sacrifice for the common good, would not be persuaded to board the `gravy train'." The new government needs to set "new standards of honesty, propriety and thrift in public life." The editorial continues by stating that although it is easy to dismiss those economists who "still cling pathetically to failed `trickle-down Reaganomics'," it not so easy to dismiss them when they say that "our economy will not grow if public spending is not brought under control and a bloated, `fat-cat' civil service is not trimmed."
