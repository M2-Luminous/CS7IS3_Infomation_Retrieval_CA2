In particular, the "Radio-ROX" station and IZVESTIYA reported that several dozen officers from a rocket division stationed in the town of Pervomaysk, concerned about their fate, allegedly applied for transfers to the Russian rocket forces. Although our Russian colleagues could not be rebuked for being incorrect, the timing of their report deserves closer attention. What they tried to pitch as a sensation is actually a commonplace event in the Army's everyday life. We should rather listen to the opinion of a man who knows everything about this problem and who heard nothing about the dozens of reports. Here is what Lieutenant General Aleksey Kryzhko, head of the Administration Center of the Ukrainian Nuclear Forces, told us. Facts reported by the radio station and newspaper are in fact part of the implementation of agreements reached by the Ukrainian and Russian Defense Ministries back in 1992. According those agreements, we are to facilitate in all possible ways the movement of servicemen from Strategic Rocket Forces -- both to Ukraine and from Ukraine. This is a natural process caused by many reasons which are different in each individual case. We cannot stand in the way of people's wishes. Last year, more than 300 servicemen came to Ukraine from Russia, and there were at least as many that we peacefully sent to our neighbors. Let me repeat that all these actions are agreed-upon by personnel departments of our ministries and raise no particular concerns on the part of either side. Your wrote that some 50 rocket servicemen suddenly applied for a transfer. I would have known about this in the first place, and IZVESTIYA should have turned directly to the primary source of information. As it is, they offered only part of the truth, making a "sensation" out of it. It was hard not to agree with Aleksey Kryzhko that any kind of information is more valuable when obtained from competent officials. But one more thing is also clear -- if our state is not capable of ensuring decent standards for officers of the 43th Rocket Army, which is destined to cease its existence, we will definitely have to grapple with the problem of who is supposed to take the rockets off combat readiness, drain the fuel, dismantle main components, perform a partial neutralization of the rockets, send them for recycling... The information disseminated by IZVESTIYA and "Radio-ROX" about officers starting to write reports requesting transfers should give our leadership a lot of food for thought. If we do not immediately address this problem -- after all, it is always the best people who leave -- will we be able to fulfill obligations assumed under agreements and destroy nuclear weapons without damaging society and the environment. However, this is a topic for a separate discussion, and we will definitely return to it.
