Kheireddine: "The Devaluation: The Fallout and the Consequences"] [Text] Since the Algerian economy is too dependent on imports, as exports with the exception of hydrocarbons have barely much importance, the effects of an increase of the value, in dinars, of petroleum receipts (an increase in tax receipts and a reduction of the budget deficit) are blurred in the face of the negative fallout of this harsh devaluation. First negative effect: an increase in prices for imported products. This measure will affect products that are widely consumed: bread, milk, semolina, and flour. The recent price increases for these subsidized products, which conveyed the determination of the government vis-a-vis the IMF, anticipated the present devaluation. The Economy Minister, Mr. Benachenhou, had said regarding this first increase that prices were still far from their real cost. Given the extent of this devaluation, it is certain that these basic products will again experience a major hike. Other essential products such as cement, wood, iron, and cement will rise in price, thus worsening difficulties for those who do their own building. The slim hope of getting housing cherished by a large part of the population would seem to evaporate with this evaluation. The 1991 dinar devaluation experience can enlighten us about the devastating effects of a major depreciation of the local currency. That depreciation had led to a major price hike and made the financial difficulties of businesses more acute. Public and private sector businesses, which have not yet recovered from the effects of the dinar's 1991 devaluation, risk going under and not escaping from the collapse. Unless the government decides to cover businesses' exchange losses and thus give them new financial support, which is something that risks aggravating the budget deficit, an outcome that is opposed to the objectives of the measures drawn up jointly by Algeria and the IMF, i.e., seeking to control the budget. When businesses' financial difficulties are aggravated, they will also be tempted into compensating for exchange losses by increasing production costs. Roughly speaking, if today a mechanism to protect the less fortunate is foreseen, the process of erosion on the purchasing power of that segment of the population with low income resulting from the devaluation cannot be halted by a similar arrangement. At best, the social safety net softens the consequences of a deterioration of their purchasing power. Furthermore, the fallout from a devaluation of the dinar will especially affect the middle class. The pauperization of this large swath of the population, which accounts for the "mainspring" of Algeria, will not take place without there being damage to the country's activity. The goal pursued by the IMF through its Structural Adjustment Program (SAP), which will be applied to Algeria--the devaluation being a measure that is part of the SAP--is to contain demand by households and businesses. In simple terms, Algeria is living beyond her means. She needs to reduce consumer needs and achieve a balance between demand and goods put on the market. This return to universally accepted economic rules constitutes, according to the international financial institution, the sine qua non to regain the path to growth. In exchange for this sacrifice made on the population as represented by the loss of its purchasing power, Algeria will receive the financial support of the IMF and her traditional creditors and will be able to reschedule her debt. This will avoid stopping payments during the second quarter of 1994.
