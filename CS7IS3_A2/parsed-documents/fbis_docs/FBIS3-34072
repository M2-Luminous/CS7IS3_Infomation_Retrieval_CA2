The shopkeepers and the people of Khayyam Avenue confronted and fought with the anti-revolutionaries who broke windows, tore Iranian flags and attacked shops and storefronts. "Those who are hired by the foreigners are trying in vain to create a scene to make the active presence of the people look pale in the ten-day dawn festivities," said Pir Muhammad Abu Bakr, who fought against the anti-revolutionaries. Despite the nuisance, the people of Zahedan here today attended a grand ceremony at the 17th of Shahrivar Stadium to comemmorate the victory of the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
