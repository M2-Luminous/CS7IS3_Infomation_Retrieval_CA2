The Army denied that the president had intended to implicate it in political-electoral activities, as General Jose Luis Quilo, the dismissed chief of the General Staff of National Defense, asserted on Friday. "No effort has been made to manipulate the Army, and the president has not handed down instructions to influence the Civil Defense Volunteer Committees," the communique underscored. Quilo accused de Leon of having asked Army commanders to exert pressure on the civilian patrols so they would vote in favor of the constitutional reforms during the popular referendum on 30 January. The president and Defense Minister General Mario Rene Enriquez denied the allegations, and they both pointed out that Quilo's remarks reflected his resentment at being dismissed from his post. The Army says the general's assertions were distorted and today confirmed its "total respect for the country's institutionalism and its support for the current government." The Armed Forces also urged every sector of the country to intensify its efforts in favor of peace and national reconciliation. Meanwhile, the defense minister announced that if Quilo insists on leveling accusations against the president and Army he could be taken to court.
