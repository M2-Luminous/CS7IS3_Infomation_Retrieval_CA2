He announced his decision during a meeting with a delegation of the CIS interparliamentary assembly, which arrived in Baku on Thursday. At the same time, the head of the Azeri state objected to the participation of Nagorno-Karabakh representatives in this meeting. He said that "Karabakh was part and parcel of Azerbaijan, not a state. The structures, artificially set up in this region during the conflict, have nothing to do with the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly. Aliyev said this question was open for discussion. The president believes that the Bishkek meeting should be well prepared: it is necessary to achieve definite positive changes in the confrontation zone, thereby creating a favourable foundation for talks between the parliament speakers of the two republics. "In this sense," Aliyev stressed, "I pin great hopes on the peace-making mission of the delegation of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly." He noted that its present composition differed qualitatively from that of the previous delegation, formed last autumn by this supranational CIS institution for the purpose of settling the Armenian-Azeri conflict. The head of the Azeri state specially noted the need to work out approaches to the settlement of the conflict. In his opinion, the principle "of equal responsibility of both sides" was unacceptable, "because the hostilities are occurring on Azeri territory and a considerable part of the republic is occupied". The Commonwealth of Independent States, the Azeri president stressed, "cannot and must not remain indifferent to the fact that two states that are members of the Commonwealth and signatories of its collective security treaty are actually in a state of war." In the opinion of Medetkan Shirinkulov, chairman of the Kirghizian [Kyrgyz] Supreme Soviet, who heads the CIS parliamentary delegation, "there are grounds for an important conversation in Bishkek". It could be based on the new Russian draft document for solving the Karabakh problem, forwarded today to the Azeri side by Vladimir Kazimirov, envoy of the Russian president. The contents of this draft and details of its implementation were discussed behind closed doors. The delegation plans to visit Stepanakert today afternoon.
