ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This document establishes tolerances for residues of the herbicide acetochlor (2-chloro-2`-methyl-6-ethyl- N -ethoxymethyl acetanilide) and its metabolites containing the ethyl methyl aniline (EMA) moiety and the hydroxyethyl methyl aniline (HEMA) moiety, to be analyzed as acetochlor, and expressed as acetochlor equivalents, in or on the raw agricultural commodities (RACs) wheat grain at 0.02 part per million (ppm) and sorghum grain at 0.02 ppm. This regulation was requested by the Acetochlor Registration Partnership and establishes the maximum permissible level for residues of the herbicide in or on the raw agricultural commodities. EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation becomes effective May 25, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14824), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that pursuant to petitions by the Acetochlor Registration Partnership (formed by Monsanto Co. and Zeneca Ag. Products (see the Federal Register of March 23, 1994 (13655))) under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a, it was proposed to establish tolerances for residues of the herbicide acetochlor (2-chloro-2`-methyl-6-ethyl- N -ethoxymethyl acetanilide) and its metabolites containing the ethyl methyl aniline (EMA) moiety and the hydroxyethyl methyl aniline (HEMA) moiety, to be analyzed as acetochlor, and expressed as acetochlor equivalents, in or on the raw agricultural commodities (RACs) wheat grain at 0.02 ppm and sorghum grain at 0.02 ppm. There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule. The data submitted on the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerances will protect the public health. Therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below. Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register, file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32). Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).
