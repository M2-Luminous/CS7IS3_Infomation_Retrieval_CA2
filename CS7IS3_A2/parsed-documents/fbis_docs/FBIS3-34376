The Iraqis under leader President Saddam Husayn crowned this war with a great victory and emerged from it stronger and more capable, he added. During a meeting today with a delegation from the Jordanian Arab Democratic Party, led by Samir Habashinah, the party's deputy secretary general and member of the Jordanian House of Representatives, Ramadan said that the Iraqis will foil the war of blockade and will emerge stronger. He pointed to what the Iraqis have achieved in terms of marvelous and great victories in their counterattack, represented by reconstructing what the aggressors demolished and by foiling the aggressors' schemes designed to deprive Iraq of both its livelihood and its elements of strength, progress, and reconstruction. Habashinah saluted the heroic stand of President Saddam Husayn and the great Iraqi people. He also lauded their confrontation of the largest aggression against the Arab nation. Habashinah stressed that the Iraqis' firmness and adherence to their principles and sovereignty are additional strength for all the Arabs, who are struggling for their nation and its sovereignty and progress. The meeting was attended by the head of the Foreign Relations Office of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party and Sa'd Qasim Hammudi, secretary general of the Arab Popular Forces Conference.
