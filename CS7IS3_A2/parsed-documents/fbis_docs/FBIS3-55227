He subjected his rivals to harsh criticism, in particular Mykola Bahrov, speaker of the Crimean parliament, and also all former communists from the present power apparatus -- Leonid Kravchuk and Boris Yeltsin. In the opinion of Leonid Hrach, they should be tried in accordance with Soviet laws for the collapse of the USSR. The leader of the Communist Party of the Crimea warned those present of the threat from Muslim countries, especially Turkey. "The aim of my policies, he noted, is to restore the USSR. For this the Crimea should enter the CIS independently -- this is the path of salvation for the peninsula. Its economic problems can only be resolved by getting large credits from Russia." Leonid Hrach called on Communists to be vigilant as, in his opinion, the manipulation of votes is possible at the elections. Replying to questions from the hall, he was not able to explain what he had been engaged in during the last two years and why the Communist Party had lost prestige. Observers formed the opinion that in the event of the victory of Leonid Hrach at the elections, then a dictatorship of the proletariat may possibly not come, but a dictatorship of the Communist Party will be guaranteed.
