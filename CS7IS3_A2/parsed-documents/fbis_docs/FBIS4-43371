Following the defeat in the European election in favor of a coalition statement for the Greens, new appeals by individual SPD officials in the party's left wing found hardly any response in the party and the SPD Bundestag group. The Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] is beginning to concentrate on the dispute with the Greens as its main competitor for the role of the party that can create a majority after the Bundestag election. In an address to the SPD Bundestag group on Tuesday [14 June], SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping admitted mistakes in the election campaign strategy and the image of his own party in the past few months that might have led to the defeat in the European election. "The SPD, and I, must deal with Federal Chancellor Kohl more offensively," Scharping said. To be able to do this, however, he must have his "back free." In the past few weeks, he was repeatedly forced into the role of arbiter in his own party. "This ties up forces preventing us from launching offensive attacks." In Scharping's words, the Bundestag election in October is not at all lost, even though, after Sunday's defeat, the challenge is now "more difficult than before." The SPD chairman called for solidarity and asked to stop the debate about a coalition between the SPD and the Greens. The important thing is to get across the SPD's reform program to the voters. Scharping emphasized that "the SPD cannot delegate parts of its reform policy to other parties, hoping that it might benefit from it at a later stage." Individual representatives of the party's left wing, including Deputy Chairperson Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, had earlier called for a commitment to an SPD-Greens coalition as a result of the election result. However, the great majority, not only in the Presidium but also the Bundestag group, rejected this as "nonsense." "This would mean to fall into Helmut Kohl's trap, because this is exactly what he wants," said Peter Struck, parliamentary manager of the SPD Bundestag group. The tenor of almost all deputies was that the party must, first and foremost, clearly define its government program, which clearly describes the differences to the Federal Government, and get it across to the voters more dynamically and energetically. One has to show solidarity and "thrash" the Federal Government, said Gerd Andres, head of the "Seeheimer Circle" and group of deputies in the party's right wing. Within the FDP, a discussion has been initiated on how to increase the support from the bourgeois city residents again. On the day after the disaster, FDP Executive Committee Member Gerhart Baum demanded in the Executive Committee that it must be made possible again to identify the issues of ecology and civil rights with the FDP. Despite the FDP's reduction to an "economics party," only the Christian Democratic Union /Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] are benefiting from the turn of economic trends. Baum warned that the FDP must be careful and prevent the liberal bourgeois from completely wandering off to the Greens. Kinkel, too, described the Greens, which received twice as much support as the FDP in the European election, as the "main opponent" in the Bundestag election. Guido Westerwelle, a member of the FDP Executive Committee, told SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG that the FDP and the Greens had long since become serious competitors among voters under 40, as far as lifestyle is concerned.
