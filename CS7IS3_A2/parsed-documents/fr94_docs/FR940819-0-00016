SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Implementation of the provisions of the CAA, as amended in 1990, will require regulation of many small businesses so that areas may attain and maintain the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the emissions of air toxics. Small businesses frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary to evaluate such regulations and to determine the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the impact of these requirements on small businesses, the CAA requires that States adopt a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM), and submit this PROGRAM as a revision to the federally approved SIP. In addition, the CAA directs the EPA to oversee these small business assistance programs and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing a PROGRAM are set out in section 507 of title V of the CAA. In February 1992, the EPA issued ``Guidelines for the Implementation of Section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments'', in order to delineate the Federal and State roles in meeting the new statutory provisions and as a tool to provide further guidance to the States on submitting acceptable SIP revisions. The State of Texas submitted a SIP revision to the EPA in order to satisfy the requirements of section 507. In order to gain full approval, the State submittal must provide for each of the following three PROGRAM elements: (1) The establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance assistance to small businesses; (2) The establishment of a State Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory process; and (3) The creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP. The Region used section 507 of the CAA when reviewing the State submittal for approvability. The SIP revision, discussed in detail in the Technical Support Document, is briefly outlined below. II. Analysis A. Procedural Background The State of Texas has met all of the requirements of section 507 by submitting a SIP revision that implements all required PROGRAM elements. The Texas Clean Air Act (TCAA), TEXAS HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE ANN. (Vernon 1992), §382.0365, ``Small Business Stationary Source Assistance Program'', enacted by the Texas 1991 legislative session and effective September 1991, provides authority for the State to establish a PROGRAM (SIP Appendix A). Included in §382.0365 of the TCAA are provisions establishing an SBAP, establishing the SBAP's duties and responsibilities, creating a State ombudsman, creating a CAP, establishing membership of the CAP, and establishing CAP duties. In addition, the State of Texas has the legal authority necessary to implement the control strategies for the PROGRAM in compliance with the CAA and the EPA requirements under the provisions of the TCAA, §§382.0365(f) and 382.017. The Texas Small Business Ombudsman, Small Business Advocate's Office, is located at the central offices of the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC), Office of Air Quality, [formerly the Texas Air Control Board (TACB)], in Austin, Texas. The State conducted public hearings on September 2, 3, 8, 9, and 10, 1992, to consider public comments on the proposed PROGRAM, which will amend the Texas SIP to add a revision entitled, ``Revisions to the State Implementation Plan for the Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program, Texas Air Control Board''. The proposed SIP revision was formally adopted November 6, 1992, by the TACB. The Texas PROGRAM was submitted to the EPA by the Governor of Texas on November 13, 1992 (received November 16, 1992) as a revision to the Texas SIP. It was initially reviewed for completeness and was determined complete on January 15, 1993. The submittal was then reviewed for approvability by the EPA Region 6 and EPA Headquarters. On September 1, 1993, the TACB merged with the Texas Water Commission to form the TNRCC and is now called the Office of Air Quality within the TNRCC. The merger did not abrogate, void, or rescind any rules, regulations, Orders, permits, or any other action previously taken by the former TACB. B. Plan Requirements 1. Small Business Assistance Program The first PROGRAM element is the establishment of a SBAP to provide technical and compliance assistance to small businesses. The State has met the first PROGRAM element by committing in its narrative SIP revision, under subsection I.A.3.c), entitled ``Establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP)'', to establish a SBAP in the TACB, Program Development Division. In order to establish this PROGRAM element, §382.0365(a) and (b) of the TCAA were enacted and provide the legal authority requiring for establishment of the SBAP with responsibilities consistent with the six requirements in title V of the Federal CAA. The SBAP will provide sufficient services to small businesses through the development, collection, and dissemination of information to small businesses on matters of (1) Determining applicable requirements under the CAA and permit issuance; (2) the rights and obligations of small businesses under the CAA; (3) compliance methods and acceptable control technologies; (4) pollution prevention and accidental release prevention and detection; and (5) audit programs. (Details are presented in the EPA's Technical Support Document and the State's submittal.) a. The Texas SBAP is charged with the following duties: (i) Conducting independent evaluations of all aspects of the SBAP to determine program effectiveness and continuously improving the program design; (ii) Reviewing and providing comments and recommendations to the Ombudsman's Office, the CAP, EPA, the State, and the local air pollution control authorities regarding the development and implementation of regulations that impact small businesses; (iii) Facilitating and promoting the early participation of small businesses in the development of new or modified regulations and policies that impact small businesses; (iv) Assisting in providing to other State and local authorities, associations, educational institutions, environmental groups, and the general public information regarding the applicability of the requirements of the CAA to small businesses; (v) Actively promoting and assisting in the dissemination of information (i.e., upcoming regulations, control technologies, etc.) to small businesses and other interested parties; (vi) Participating in and sponsoring meetings and conferences with State/local air pollution control authorities, industry groups, and small business representatives;
