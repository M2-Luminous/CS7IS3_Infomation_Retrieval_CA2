Vice Secretary-General Chen Chin-nan said the group members will seek to understand labor problems there and consult with Philippine authorities on the business tax they will collect from Taiwan investors. Chen said as the Philippines has frequent labor disputes and strikes, Taiwan investors are concerned about whether there will be similar incidents when they set up business there. Investment in Subic Bay is one part of the government's "southern strategy," which encourages Taiwan investment in Southeast Asia.
