North Korea, however, does not appear as boisterous about it as it was in previous years. In previous years, various events to celebrate Kim's birthday, such as "the race to relay the letter of loyalty" would have already started. On the contrary, North Korea issued an emergency alert order to the entire Armed Forces and is creating an atmosphere of tension, suspending the issuance of travel permits to residents, according to Kim Tok, director of the Agency for National Security Planning, who disclosed this at the security-related ministers meeting on 26 March. Director Kim also said that the North Korean Army is checking the maintenance of its emergency communications network, while intensifying training. North Korea is stepping up the production of military supplies, such as military uniforms, according to some information officials. Since the inter-Korean contact broke down on 19 March, North Korean broadcasts have been yelling: We will regard sanctions against us as a declaration of war. We will respond to war with war. In particular, early this week North Korea will hold the national meeting of party cells for the first time in the "Workers' Party of Korea" history, with the participation of some 200,000 party cells. North Korea is abruptly convening a national meeting of the party's frontline functionaries, while creating tension internally, because it is taking, apparently, extra precautions to prevent any crack in its system. North Korea must also want to demonstrate its resolute will externally. However, there are no signs of its provoking a war yet. North Korea declared a semi-war state last year when the ROK-U.S. Team Spirit joint military exercise was conducted. Under this condition, attention is also focused on the rumor about a setback in Kim Chong-il's hereditary succession system. President Kim Yong- sam, interviewed by the ROK correspondents in Japan on 25 March, said that there seems to be some change in Kim Chong-il's succession system. Rumors about difficulty in Kim Chong-il's succession system have circulated from time to time since Kim Tal-hyon and other aides of National Defense Commission Chairman Kim Chong-il were reprimanded last December. With the frequent exposure of confusion in North Korea's nuclear policy recently, observers predict that the North Korean officials working on nuclear policy, which Kim Chong-il has been in charge, might be replaced. On this question, the position of the National Unification Board and other relevant authorities is that although Kim Chong-il's succession system is firm, its execution could be expedited or slowed down. However, they believe that if a problem arises in the succession system, there will be a serious whirlwind in the North and its aftermath can reach the South. Therefore, we will be able to determine what is happening inside North Korea from the development of the party cell congress, preparations for President Kim Il-song's birthday celebrations, and the sixth session of the Ninth Supreme People's Assembly scheduled for 6 April.
