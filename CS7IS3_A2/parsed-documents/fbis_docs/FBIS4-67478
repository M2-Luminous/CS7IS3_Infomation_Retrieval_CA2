This conclusion was drawn by a team of Chinese geologists who recently completed extensive scientific studies on this highest plateau in the world, situated in western China. The geologists found that the bulging movement of the plateau has had a great influence on the change of water level of the lakes. For example, Qinghai lake was a shallow saltwater lake only ten m deep in its early stages. At one time, the level was 20 m higher than the present level. The dropping of the water level started only 3,000 years ago, and the change of lake water temperature began 2,500 years ago. By way of satellite reconnaissance the scientists discovered that the alternations of time, geological region and climatic conditions all produce changes in the lake.
