Measurements on mossess and lichens from adjacent shores revealed levels of contamination with Cs-137 approaching 530 Bq/g at some locations. These findings indicate that the Barents Sea region has sustained an increase in the level of radionuclide contamination over the past four decades. The contaminating radionuclides derived from nuclear weapons testing in the fifties and sixties, activities of Western radiochemical plants, as well as the the Chernobyl accident.
