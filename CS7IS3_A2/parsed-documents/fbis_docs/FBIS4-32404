He made it clear that, unlike other motions, the text of the present one no longer blames the government for economic mismanagement, but for the failure of having kept its promises. "Very comprehensive" in contents, as the PAC leader described it, the fresh motion questions Mr. Vacaroiu's Cabinet's entire activity. As for the censure motion of the Agrarian Democratic Party of Romania (PDAR), and the invitation issued to the opposition parties to join it, Nicolae Manolescu said the agrarians' decision came a little late, but he agreed that most of their objections were well grounded. As for the co-signing of the agrarians' censure motion, this is out of question, he said, because regulations allow for one signature along one parliamentary session.
