He told a press conference in the border town of Queenstown: "They won't work...They will just become inactive." The 10 included Maj-Gen "Krappies" Englebrecht. The others would be named later on Wednesday, Mr de Klerk added. Generals Basie Smit and Johan le Roux have since their implication in gun running sought legal advice. There had been negotiations on their withdrawal from service and a decision was expected on Thursday morning. Mr de Klerk said if those negotiations did not lead to the generals' withdrawal, following laid down procedures, Minister of Law and Order Mr Hernus Kriel would suspend them.
