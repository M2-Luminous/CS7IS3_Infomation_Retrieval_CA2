The ambassador's residence in Bonn, purchased in October 1984 for 2.4 million U.S. dollars, sprawls over 5,500 pyong. The house will be put out on the market in the first half of the year at an asking price of 3 million dollars. Other residences in the European Union and Saudi Arabia will be sold after the real estate market picks up, officials said. The ambassador's residence in Brussels, a 400-pyong building standing on 15,000 pyong of land, was bought for 3.7 million dollars in May 1989 but the current market price is 2.5 million dollars. The residence in Saudi Arabia stands on 3,100 pyong. It has been renovated and has a value estimated at 7.56 million dollars, but its sale is complicated by the fact that the house is within the diplomatic complex, the officials said. The ministry had ambitiously sought to increase its overseas assets, reasoning that owning the residences of mission chiefs would save money in the long run. "We received much criticism during a National Assembly hearing last year that made us reconsider this plan," an official said. Renovation of the official residence for the ambassador to the United Nations, recently purchased for 10.83 million dollars, was budgeted at 5 million dollars but will be cut by more than 1 million dollars.
