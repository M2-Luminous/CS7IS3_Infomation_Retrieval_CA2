The stability is shown in the following fields: -- The relations between the republics-regions and the federal authorities have improved. -- The inflation rate has been lowered and contained, and market's role has increased, although the economic situation remains bleak. -- The former relationship of confrontation between the parliament and the government has been turned into one of dialogue. The parliament and President Boris Yeltsin are settling their differences by cooperation and coordination. -- The Civic Accord signed in late April has restricted any political party from resorting to actions that might violate the constitution and other laws concerned. In February, tension between the lower house of parliament, or State Duma, and Yeltsin was defused after the leaders of the 1991 "August 19 incident" and former lawmakers involved in the October uprising were freed. Yeltsin first opposed the amnesty resolution of the State Duma. Yeltsin now has regular meetings with parliament speakers and the prime minister. He also has frequent meetings with leaders of the major political parties of the country. After the State Duma and Yeltsin called for national reconciliation and concentration on economic recovery and development, the Civic Accord was signed last April. The accord calls for dialogue, consultation, negotiation to seek a common ground and a reasonable compromise in the settlement of the country's problems. The accord also voices strong opposition to political confrontation and violence. Thanks to the accord, there are no more large-scale street protest rallies and demonstrations that could trigger violence, and Yeltsin said earlier this month that the opposition is now resorting to peaceful political activities. Meanwhile, the federal authorities signed a treaty with the once secessionist Republic of Tatarstan in February. Last month Yeltsin visited the republic and worked out a mechanism to implement the treaty with local leaders. Yeltsin is going to sign similar treaties with other republics and regions. Recently Yeltsin made a sharp departure from his refusal to have direct dialogue with Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev, whose republic has declared independence. Except Chechen all the republics and regions have been represented in the Federation Council (the upper house), making the chances of division of Russia remote. In the economic sphere, the Russian Government has managed to contain the monthly inflation rate to below 10 percent from a level of 20 to 25 percent of two years ago. Yeltsin recently signed 20 decrees to encourage investments and promote production, much to the welcome of the population. At the end of last year Russia adopted a new constitution under which a presidential government was formed and a new broad-based parliament elected. The new government and parliament reshaped the home and foreign policies to some extent. Gradual reforms, appropriate state control and social security have replaced radical "shock therapies" in reforms. In its foreign policy, the government attaches importance to protecting national interests and restoring Russia's status as a big power. Analysts also said that although Russia now enjoys a relative stability, uncertainties are still around. Industrial production in the first six months of this year has dropped by 28 percent compared with the same period of last year, a lot of factories are out of operation, unemployment and crime are increasing, and one half of the population are living near or below the poverty line.
