Bosnian Serb and Moslem military officials agreed in principle Wednesday on a Sarajevo ceasefire, due to come into effect at midday Thursday (1100 GMT), and pledged to remove their heavy weapons from around the beseiged capital, UN local commander General Michael Rose said. [passage omitted] The head of the self-declared Bosnian Serb parliament, Momcilo Krajisnik, meanwhile cast immediate doubts on ceasefire deal, worked out at Sarajevo airport. He said the Serbs would announce the conditions under which they would withdraw their heavy artillery at Thursday's talks here. [passage omitted] The agreement was given a cautious welcome by EC mediator Lord Owen, who said: "People sign things and don't always live up to them." But he added: "Frankly I think (the agreement) will prove to be a lot more productive (than NATO air strikes)." Rose had announced after the airport meeting that he had reached the agreement "with full consent of their political and military authorities." But confusion arose when Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic reported that the truce airport agreement included a five-day deadline for implementation. That was immediately denied by the UN Protection Forces, and a spokesman, who asked to remain anonymous stressed: "Mr. Izetbegovic's version is very different. And since no document was signed, for the moment this is only a verbal agreement." The second-in-command of the mainly-Moslem Bosnian Army Jovan Divjak, who was also present at the three-hour airport meeting, said he had no faith in the accord. "It's a game by the Serbs to get out of the bind they are in after the massacre they carried out the other day." [passage omitted]
