Fars Province farmers, who have sold to the government a surplus of 815,000 tons of wheat, have achieved first place in the production of this strategic crop for the sixth consecutive year. According to an ABRAR correspondent from Shiraz, the director-general of the Fars Rural Cooperative, Malekzadeh, on the occasion of the ending of the season of buying wheat in the province, told journalists: For the purpose of carrying out the plan of mechanized farming of wheat during the current agricultural year, 740 mechanized service units of this organization, with 400 tractors, 36 tillers, 16 combined units, and 1,174 tankers with a capacity of 2 million liters of oil are ready to offer their services to the farmers who are members of the rural cooperative companies in Fars Province. He added that during the last agricultural year, 445 tons of figs, 600 tons of rice, and 67 tons of beans, which were produced by farmers in the area, were sold in several parts of the province. For a further protection of this industrious class, plans for producing and marketing the crops -- such as shipping and exporting, creating substitute industries and establishing a system of information distribution on farming and production -- are anticipated to be carried out.
