The statement refutes Abkhazian claims that 250 armed Georgians allegedly crossed the Georgian-Abkhazian confrontation line along the Inguri River to terrorize the local Abkhazian population. Kavsadze "personally controls the regional situation and can say for sure there are no Georgian guerrilla groups or other units on territory of the Gali region. Such Abkhazian reports aim to prepare the public for a new wave of deportation of the remaining Georgian population from the Gali region."
