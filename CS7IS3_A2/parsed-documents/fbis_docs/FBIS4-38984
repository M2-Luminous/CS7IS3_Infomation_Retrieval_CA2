A broad range of issues was addressed, particularly those connected with Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet. The following was underlined: Complete alienation of Crimea from Ukraine is absurd because Crimea is inseparable from and depends upon Ukraine. Of course, there are issues that need to be solved jointly. One of these is dividing the Black Sea Fleet and determining the basing sites for the Russian Black Sea Fleet and Ukraine's Naval Forces. However, at this point one should display tolerance, common sense and mutual respect. The media chiefs asked the president of Ukraine: Is there any confidence that the use of force in Crimea can be avoided? Leonid Kravchuk answered: Under no circumstances will we resort to the use of force, and we call on the leadership of Crimea to abide by the same principle. The issue of a possible federal land structure of Ukraine was raised during the conversation. The president's reply was quite clear-cut: One cannot just hold forth on it. It cannot be considered at a domestic, unprofessional level. The leaders of the Russian mass media were also concerned about the Ukrainian president's attitude toward the work done in Ukraine by the journalists of other states. Leonid Kravchuk agreed to the proposal to discuss a common information space at the level of the CIS heads and declared his readiness to initiate the adoption of a relevant document. They also asked the president of Ukraine about his personal goals and desires. The Moscow journalists heard the following reply: I would like progress to begin in the economic sphere in Ukraine, and to see friendly relations take shape between neighbors not formally but in practical terms, in particular, between Russia and Ukraine, because there is no alternative here. I would like Russians to regard Ukraine as an equal partner. Dwelling on mutual relations with the Supreme Council and its chairman, the president of Ukraine pointed out that they are businesslike and that relations with Oleksandr Moroz are normal. As for the upcoming presidential election, Leonid Kravchuk said: The election will take place. The main struggle, in my opinion, will get under way during the second round. Who will enter it? I believe it will be Leonid Kuchma. I am almost convinced of this. Who else? Possibly myself. At the end of the conversation the president of Ukraine again turned to the issue of mutual relations between Ukraine and Russia. He underlined that these relations should be built while taking into account the fact that the two states should live in peace and accord.
