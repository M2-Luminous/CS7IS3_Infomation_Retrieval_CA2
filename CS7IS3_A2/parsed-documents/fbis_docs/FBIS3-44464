The promulgation of the "50 Articles," dubbed as a "program for action in the reform of the economic structure in the nineties," signals that China's reform has entered the stage of tackling key issues. At this moment, how to continue summing up the positive and negative experiences in the past 15 years of reform provides a mirror for the full-scale advancement of the reform in the next stage, and making a good job of the first step in tackling the key issues has become very important. With this thought in mind, this reporter interviewed Chinese economist Wu Jinglian. [Lin Chen] As an economist, you have all along had a part in the whole process of China's economic structural reform and in the formulation of many major reform proposals. What is your comment on the reform in the past 15 years? [Wu Jinglian] China's reform has made progress in many important fields. In particular, the gradual establishment of the target model of building a socialist market economy is a great theoretical achievement. However, one should also recognize that reform is still relatively lagging behind in many key areas. For instance, though we have made quite some efforts in the reform of state-owned enterprises, we have failed to achieve any real breakthrough; in the development of the market system, the building of commodity markets has been advancing at a fast pace, but the building of such production elements markets as the money market and labor market is lagging behind by comparison. Because of the slow- moving reform in key sectors, some important social and economic problems are hard to resolve properly. For example, the three biggest issues, namely, inflation, corruption, and unfair distribution of wealth in society, are still bothering us to this day. In short, in terms of reform, things that are easy to do are almost all done, and what are left are the more difficult things. Therefore, in my opinion, the reform is entering the stage of tackling key issues in the next phase. The great significance of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee is that it issued the order to start storming difficult problems. [Lin] In that case, what do you think we should pay attention to in the operation to storm difficult problems? [Wu] The "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee gives a clear and detailed outline of the reform to be carried out in the revenue and taxation, monetary, investment, and exchange systems. The question now is how to make sure that these proposals do not go out of shape or change flavor in the course of implementation. Sometimes, a good reform proposal turns out to be nothing like what was expected once it is put into practice. In this respect, we have a lot of experience to draw lessons from. [Lin] There are many reasons why a reform goes out of shape. It might be connected to some problem of understanding, operational problems, or motivation by interests. [Wu] I agree. First and foremost is the problem with understanding and the second is the problem with interests. The latter deserves special attention. For instance, some people often interpret new things in the context of market economy from a point of view that carries the hallmark of the planned economy. The "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee points out: "The purpose of establishing a system of socialist market economy is to let the market function as the foundation of resource disposition under the macroregulation and control of the state." If, according to the nature of market economy, macroregulation and control is correctly interpreted as regulation and control over total supply and demand (such as total monetary supply and demand), this would be a correct notion. The problem is that some people have now expanded the definition of macroregulation and control and put everything that the state considers important and necessary to control in the category of macroregulation and control. This is like putting the role of the market into the bag of the government's administrative control. In fact, this is a misunderstanding. Macroregulation and control is inherent in the notion of market economy. All developed nations with market economy exercise control over total supply and demand. This is called macroregulation and control. But one should not draw a parallel between micro administrative intervention and macroregulation and control. In order to prevent the reform from going out of shape, it is necessary to change the incorrect way of thinking that rejects the government's role once market policy is implemented and, whenever macroregulation and control is emphasized, puts everything under government control. There is another opinion, which goes to the other extreme. Whenever market regulation is encouraged, they will think that as long as there is a market, whatever the quality, it will be able to dispose of resources in the most efficient way; or even think that a speculation-dominated market can play the same role. Therefore, the end results of some reforms, which started in the right direction, are not as desired. Take the batch-leasing of land for example. This is a reform in line with the market orientation. However, batch-leasing of land in a market economy must be conducted in accordance with strict market procedures and rules. But we omitted the second part when employing this means. In other words, the administration made all the decisions on the leasing and the rates of lease. As a result, some people have made big fortunes by using administrative powers and the otherwise fine market means has become a hotbed of corruption. [Lin] Speaking of this, people tend to blame this problem on land batch-leasing as a market means and rarely consider the mistakes we made when using this means. It seems that when the reform goes out of shape, not only the people's interests are harmed, but the reputation of reform is undermined. [Wu] That is true. To change this situation, we all face the need for restudy. Just as Comrade Jiang Zemin said, we must acquire the knowledge of market economy. In the meantime, the guiding role of the propaganda media is also very important. It is not good to describe market building as either too easy or too simple. Spreading specious viewpoints will exert a more negative impact. Now people are vying with each other to run futures markets, believing that they are "big fish." In fact, futures trading involves extremely big risks, because it is commodity trading based on expected prices. To use a common expression, futures trading means carrying out a commodity deal in relation to which the delivery will not be executed until a certain point in the future, and the risk lies in the projection of the price at the time of delivery. Therefore, one may say that the function of futures is to help the producer and the trader avoid risks, so that large-scale economic activities can go ahead. Naturally, however, this requires interaction between the speculators and the parties trying to avoid risks. In this context, speculation does have a positive role. However, it is very wrong to think that pure speculation is also positive and therefore encourage speculation unconditionally. Pure speculation is no different from gambling. It is either you lose, I gain or the other way round. It does not create material wealth. On the contrary, excessive speculation has a destructive function. I feel that for some time in the past, the way we described futures was not comprehensive enough and was sometimes even misleading. This has caused some of those involved in it to overlook the risks they should bear while looking forward eagerly to making a fortune. As a result, the country rushed headlong into setting up futures markets, sowing the seeds of crisis from the very beginning. Some law-breaking businessmen from abroad made big fortunes while the people and the state suffered great losses. [Lin] The "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee places the reform of state-owned enterprises in a very important position and sets goals for establishing a modern enterprise system. What is your comment on this, Mr. Wu? [Wu] In the reform of large and medium-sized state enterprises, two concepts have now been accepted by most people. One is that a modern enterprise system must be established; the other is that company-oriented transformation must be conducted. Recognizing this point may be considered a major breakthrough in the understanding of enterprise reform. In my opinion, what is called the modern enterprise system is actually the modern corporate system: They are one and the same. But some theoretical issues and policy issues regarding how to transform our country's state-owned enterprises into modern companies have not yet been completely solved. How to understand public ownership as the predominant sector, what concrete forms public ownership should take, who shall represent state property rights, and how to embody the leading role of the Communist Party in the general manager responsibility system under the leadership of the chairman of the board -- all these issues should be conscientiously tackled. Only by so doing can we truly establish a modern enterprise system. [Lin] In the process of reform in the past, we have experimented with many methods, such as the economic accounting system, factory director responsibility system, economic responsibility system, enterprise contract system, and the ongoing implementation of the "Regulations" for converting operational mechanisms. All these efforts can be regarded as endeavors to build up a system. [Wu] The establishment of a modern enterprise system which has now been proposed has a clear objective, namely, the establishment of a modern corporate system. Only by establishing such an organizational system can we truly realize the goal of transforming the enterprise operational mechanism. In that case, we must be clear about what a modern corporate system is, or else the reform may still go out of shape. In my opinion, a modern company has two features: One, the company has a legal person status. It uses its corporate property as the basis for exercising its civil rights and uses its corporate property to undertake various obligations stipulated by the civil law. Two, in terms of management system, the company should establish one that incorporates three parties, namely, the shareholder general meeting, the board of directors, and the general manager, which check on one another. In this way, operational experts will be fully authorized to run the company, while the ownership is under ultimate restraint. The owner delegates the management power to the board of directors, which decides on broad policies and supervises the general manager and other executives. The general manager takes overall responsibility for the executive organ. These three tiers form a relationship of mutual balance. [Lin] In that case, what is your comment on the existing joint-stock enterprises? [Wu] There are now over 3,000 joint-stock enterprises that are in the experimental stage in China. Through years of exploration, we have gained a lot of experience. But we should also be aware that most experimental companies still have a long way to go to meet international norms. Many localities have been setting up joint- stock companies not for the purpose of changing the system, but in order to raise money or even to make money through speculative share deals. This is the wrong way to go. Therefore, we should follow the requirements of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and "rectify in accordance with the requirements of the norms" the existing companies. Naturally, however, the precondition for doing this job well is to get the essential point straight and have a clear understanding of what a modern corporate system is.
