FR940208-1-00040 FR940208-1-00011 Additionally, the proposed standards requires monitoring of equipment, maintaining records, and providing reports to verify compliance with the control requirements discussed above. 2. New Facilities It is estimated that there will be 10 storage tanks classified as new at the 2 new major source pipeline breakout stations through base year 1998. Although these tanks would be subject to these standards, they are also subject to the existing NSPS standard as defined in 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb. It is estimated that there will be nearly 80 major source bulk gasoline terminals subject to the new facility requirements of the proposed regulation (28 percent of the base year major source bulk gasoline terminals). The proposed standards would limit loading rack HAP emissions from these sources to 10 mg TOC/liter instead of 35 mg TOC/liter as under the NSPS standards. As with pipeline breakout stations, the projected 600 storage tanks at new major source bulk gasoline terminals would be subject to this regulation (as well as the NSPS for storage tanks) with the same levels of control outlined previously. All new major source bulk gasoline terminals and pipeline breakout stations would also be required to implement a monthly LDAR program to control equipment leaks from pumps and valves, as well as implement other 40 CFR part 60, subpart VV standards for other equipment. Lastly, new major source bulk gasoline terminals would be required to install, operate, and maintain a vacuum assist vapor collection system on their loading racks that fill gasoline tank trucks or railcars. Additionally, the proposed standards require monitoring of equipment, maintaining records, and providing reports to verify compliance with the control requirements discussed above. B. Air Emission Reductions 1. Existing Sources For the existing gasoline distribution network (approximately 390,000 facilities in base year 1998), the nationwide baseline HAP emissions are estimated to be 46,000 Mg/yr. Of this total, 8 percent or 4,200 Mg/yr can be attributed to major source pipeline breakout stations and bulk gasoline terminals. Implementation of the proposed regulation would reduce these emissions to approximately 43,400 Mg/yr. 2. New Sources For new sources through 1998, total nationwide HAP emissions from gasoline distribution facilities, approximately 13,000 total facilities, are estimated to be about 6,700 Mg/yr at baseline. The HAP emissions from pipeline breakout stations and bulk gasoline terminals account for 46 percent of this total (major sources contribute 12 percent of the total). The proposed regulation would reduce these emissions to a total of approximately 6,200 Mg/yr. C. Secondary Environmental Impacts Since implementation of the proposed regulation would encompass no additional water discharges, there would be no negative impact on water quality. There is a potential for a positive benefit to water quality, however, due to decreased amounts of gasoline entering drains, sewers, and waste sumps because of improved leakage control. There is projected to be no significant solid waste or noise impact as a result of implementation of the proposed regulation. Neither flares, thermal oxidizers, nor refrigeration condenser systems generate any solid waste as a by-product of their operation. The only solid waste that may be generated is spent activated carbon if carbon adsorption is chosen by an owner or operator of a bulk gasoline terminal for loading rack emission control. It is estimated that, in this case, the total environmental impact would average about 680 kilograms of carbon per year for each bulk terminal choosing this option. Therefore, the solid waste impact can be considered to be small. This impact would be minimized if the carbon were reactivated and reused. The Agency has also tested the noise level from vapor processors, and found these levels to be moderate (less than 70 db at 7 meters). D. Energy Impacts The use of vapor recovery systems on loading racks at bulk gasoline terminals, and pollution prevention measures such as equipment standards for storage tanks and implementation of LDAR programs for equipment components will all keep gasoline in the system that would have escaped as emissions to the atmosphere. Nationwide annual gasoline savings are estimated to total 2.34 million gallons at pipeline breakout stations and 12 million gallons at bulk gasoline terminals.
