It is also against the reduction of the imprisonment period. Valeriu Garbuz [prisoner who acted as a witness incriminating the others] could be an exception, states the OSTK declaration announced by the local radio. The OSTK leaders believe that the transfer of the convicted to another state could be made only on the basis of an international agreement concerning this field. OSTK opposes that Moldova's [February] general elections should also be held in the Dniester Republic. OSTK does not support the idea of a referendum on the future social and state order in the Dniester region. The idea of this referendum was launched by the union of parties, organizations, and social movements. In OSTK's opinion, the results of the referendum can be used by enemies of the Dniester Republic to undermine the state order.
