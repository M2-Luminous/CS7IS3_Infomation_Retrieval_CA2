We herewith publish his talk in abstract so that units may study and implement it. The strategic plan set forth by the Military Commission [MC] for the new era raises greater demands on military hospitals as to how they can assure delivery of medical logistics in limited warfare under modern conditions, especially those of high technology. The establishment of socialist market economy and the advancement of medical reform across the country present many new conditions and problems for military hospitals. Faced therewith, medical logistics leaders at all levels, especially comrades engaged in military hospital administration, must keep sober and ensure delivery of accurate guidance throughout all their work. I. Unify Conceptualization Regarding How To Respond to the New Situation A. "Response" Must Serve To Improve Combat Effectiveness and Not Merely To Generate Revenue Whenever discussing response to the new situation of market economy, some comrades consider only how to increase revenue, equating "response" with money-making. Increasing revenue so as to finance operations certainly forms one aspect of "response," but there is much more thereto. It means better response to the new macroenvironment of market economy through service direction and quality and effort in terms of technology, personnel, equipment, administration, finance, and other quarters so as to help improve combat effectiveness. Thus "assurance" converges with "response." Indeed, it is consideration of the external effects of market economy that leads us to stress "assurance," making it a basic premise. And, at bottom, we actively "respond" to the new situation so as to provide better "assurance." B. "Response" Must Proceed from the Fundamental Laws and Characteristics of Military Medical Work and Not Mimic Market Mechanism Under the new situation, management of military medical work, especially compensated service provided to locals, should draw on, but not mimic, some market mechanism methodology. This is dictated by the unique nature, function, and mission of medical work, especially military medical work. From the broadest perspective, the first requirement in terms of the social benefit medical work provides, the basic function of military medical work, the very nature of ensuring well-being, the characteristics of the military system, and the revolutionary humanitarian purpose of saving the dying and treating the wounded all differ fundamentally from the principles of market economy, whose principal objective is maximizing profit through exchange; is premised, in terms of participation, on a high degree of autonomy; is guided mainly by market demand; and so on. C. "Response" Must Ensure That Service Direction Does Not Skew, Treatment Quality Does Not Fall, and Professional Integrity Does Not Slip Under market economy, people's notion and awareness of material benefit and private interest grow, and disturbance from all directions steadily mounts. So if we fail to adopt effective educative and control measures, "assurance" may fail, service quality may not meet muster, professional integrity may slip, and other bad phenomena may arise. Over the past several years, we have unstintingly stressed direction, quality, and integrity. Yet even so, noteworthy problems have cropped up in some units. For example, in the area of service, some hospitals still show lack of dedication and devotion to treatment of army wounded and sick; responsibility is shirked in disguised form; and some hospitals fail to uphold funding standards in administering drugs and even charge soldiers arbitrary fees therefor. Service shortfall is even greater when it comes to taking the initiative in providing preventive guidance, monitoring disease, and technical assistance ties [BANGDAI]. Quality shortcomings are saliently manifested as failure to uphold standards for and the overall poor quality of basic treatment and care. Many hospitals have failed properly to adhere to the system and standards we have developed over the past several decades, indeed even such basic things as three-tiered examination, pre-surgical and pre-death discussion, the "three checks and seven responses," and the like. And there are numerous noteworthy problems in the area of professional integrity. In today's society, some medical personnel lose their sense of right and wrong whenever they see profit to be made, succumbing to self-aggrandizement through medicine, an evil that is reflected in military hospitals as well. We must place great emphasis on the effects the new situation creates in the areas of service direction, treatment quality, and professional integrity. If we fail to master these problems and if existing bad tendencies are allowed to fester, the consequences will be unthinkable, and we will be unable to face the officers and enlisted personnel of the entire armed forces. II. The Effective Way To Respond to the New Situation Is To Stress "Assurance" A. Establish Effective Regulatory Measures To achieve "assurance," we must, while applying administrative and legal controls, effectively employ economic ones as well. We absolutely must firmly control that which should be controlled. Moonlighting, special service, external service, work in hospitals run jointly with localities or as integrated entities, and the like must strictly abide by relevant regulation and approval procedure. No second occupation is permitted. And we must scrupulously effect positional responsibility for hospital and department directors, provide regular performance evaluation, and ensure that reward and punishment are appropriately dispensed. B. Promptly Systematize and Normatize Successful Experience under the New Situation, Including Establishing an Effective Self-Restraint System Over the past several years, medical units throughout the armed forces have pioneered much new experience in providing "assurance." After summarizing, studying, and refining this experience, we must integrate it with previous success and study how to establish an integrated, coordinated system. With a legal system and a normatized basis for behavior, stable service to the armed forces can be assured, no matter how the situation and environment fluctuate. C. Deepen and Elaborate Service I stress three things. First, in terms of treating military injured and sick, emphasize priority, quality, and convenience; fulfill one's mission to the best of one's ability; and assure treatment quality and safety as much as possible so as to satisfy officers and enlisted personnel. Second, expand hospital function and enhance preventive and health-maintenance work. We must strengthen integration of prevention and treatment in and outside of hospitals and strive to prevent disease in and to improve the health of military units. Third, we must, in accordance with the requirements of the MC's strategic plan, conscientiously prepare so that we can ensure effective response to any emergency. These desiderata must be achieved, and achieved properly, by all medical units throughout the armed forces. III. Improve and Strengthen Economic Management, Better Effect "Assurance," and Better Respond to the Needs of the New Situation A. Clarify Objectives and Progressively Advance Economic Management To manage military hospitals properly, the most important thing is to accurately guide medical work towards service. Economic management not only focuses on bottom-line profit but should also consider how better to effect the basic functions of military hospitals, provide more accurate guidance, improve quality and economic results, and serve hospital development. Secondly, we must plug loopholes and reduce costs and waste. Third, we must establish a vigorous restraint and incentive mechanism and fully mobilize initiative. Fourth, we must "keep clear books" so that accurate, timely, and scientific information and advice is provided to all levels and decision-making error is reduced. B. Concentrate Resources on Resolution of Cost-Accounting Problems First, we must scientifically and rationally define cost. Beyond actual depletion, how and by how much shall we depreciate fixed capital? How shall the military-expense conversion portion be computed? Of fixed capital, how shall the portions put up by superior agencies, locals, through accumulation, jointly, or by foreigners be appraised? How shall indirect depletion be assessed? Regulations regarding these matters were established in GLD Health Department Document 194 of 1989. After several years of experience, however, we must reexamine these regulations to determine which are suitable, which are truly feasible, and which require supplement or revision. Second, we must accurately establish accounting typology. Most other countries practice three-tiered accounting. We must strive to pave the way for and effect this and account by disease type with the patient as basic unit. In view of actual conditions in military hospitals, the basis and conditions for this approach readily exist. Third is the issue of departmental accounting. As an entity that actually provides treatment, the department certainly should form an accounting level. However, difficulty, intensity, and inputs among departments vary greatly, so careful cross comparison thereamong is warranted. And while departments may be made accounting units, they must not undertake responsibility contracting. We should administer them through composite-objective responsibility and treat economic return as but one element in evaluating their overall performance. Treatment cost accounting must closely be integrated with automation, and computers should become powerful managerial tools. Modern management and cost accounting are inseparable from automation. Units that have effected automation must advance it because this work has considerable potential. Those units that have not effected it should begin doing so as soon as possible. The master plan must be handled properly, the right personnel must be recruited, and things must get rolling promptly. Naturally, it is important that leadership provide emphasis and support. C. In Applying Economic Measures, Be Attentive To Promoting the Beneficial and Eliminating the Harmful, Use the Measures To Accurately Guide Hospital Work, and Prevent Them from Excessively Stressing Profit and Engendering Unscrupulous Money-Grubbing Economic measures are two-edged. If we are to promote the beneficial and eliminate the harmful and prevent "money grubbing" from arising and spreading, the key lies in accurately mastering and employing these measures. First, we must accurately handle the relationship between economic results and quality. We must stress results but emphasize quality even more and increase the weight of the latter in overall performance review and in determining bonus distribution. Second, we must particularize and concretize the requirements of guidance and of principle by incorporating these requirements into the specific duties assigned to each administrative post under the positional responsibility system. For example, the issues of service direction, treatment quality, and professional integrity must be linked to positional responsibility, performance evaluation, and reward and punishment dispensation so that orders from superiors are transformed, via the interest mechanism, into conscious behavior by department and individual. Third, we must mobilize initiative as much as possible by providing appropriate secondary distribution in accordance with both results and fairness. Primary distribution focuses principally on results and contribution. However, for those units that bear heavy "assurance" mission, serve many military units, or are unprofitable yet whose work is highly technical, hospitals, in addition to effecting primary distribution by department, should provide appropriate secondary distribution, taking into account both results and fairness as well as the interests of all quarters in terms of the overall picture, and thereby fully mobilize initiative. D. Take the Correct Path to Revenue Generation and Pursue Success through Technology and Integrity Under the new situation, hospitals face many new circumstances, contradictions, and difficulties in their effort to develop resources and generate revenue, and we must treat these seriously. To generate revenue, hospitals must not resort to indiscriminate drug dispensing, writing huge prescriptions, or unnecessary service, thereby increasing patient financial burden. These are impermissible and undermine the image of military hospitals. In accordance with the spirit of the directives issued by the MC and the GLD and in view of actual conditions in military hospitals, the latter should place most of their effort on providing technical service and exploiting their scientific and technological advantages and strive for success in developing through science, quality, and strength in terms of technology and integrity. These two approaches form the foundation for military hospital effort to achieve successful development and can never be relaxed. Strengthening technological development is dependent primarily on the specialities in which hospitals possess advantage and on training and recruiting middle-aged and young personnel. The key to strengthening professional integrity lies in transforming ideal into reality. We must make this effort fundamental to the development of our profession, keep dossiers on the integrity of our personnel, use great reward to recognize exemplars, sternly punish people lacking in virtue, and resolutely check evil practice. E. While Stressing Revenue Generation, Also Stress Economy and Strive for Quality While Reducing Waste Hospital economic management involves nothing other than needing, making, saving, and exploiting money. Given the situation in China, the most fundamental approach is to seek quality and reduce waste so as to provide the best treatment outcome with the least expenditure input. We must provide better treatment for less money. And to do this we must strengthen economic management, stress economy, and take advantage of our people's superb skills. In reducing expenditure, we must pay particular attention to scientific decision-making regarding investment and provide repeated study and proof of need when selecting construction and developmental projects. Examples that decision-making errors are the greatest source of waste abound. We must be careful to plug leaks and reduce waste everywhere. For example, drug purchase kickbacks run about five percent everywhere. If hospitals can strengthen supervision over each link, make secret and private operations open and public, a medium-sized unit could save about 50,000-60,000 yuan a year, which would become tremendous when multiplied throughout the armed forces. Even more importantly, there is a political factor here, which, if not stressed, will send some cadres to ruin. F. Stress Comprehensive Application of All Types of Measures No single type of managerial measure is omnipotent. Excessive reliance on any one inevitably begets trouble. This is true for economic management, too; one cannot rely purely on that approach. And this is especially true for military hospitals. We must never lose the fine tradition and practice of our armed forces, their spirit of arduous struggle, their advantage in ideological work, and their organizational discipline of strict obedience and of "following orders in everything one does." And we must not ignore comprehensive application of ideological, administrative, legal, and other measures. G. Strengthen Training of Economic Managers and Develop a Corps Adept at Finance All hospitals really need to establish economic managerial organs or at least should have experts in this field. Many hospital directors hope to resolve the problem through organizational expansion, but we must accomplish this work while retrenching and reorganizing hospitals throughout the armed forces. Each unit and hospital most devote special attention to managerial organ and personnel. We must also improve the quality of such personnel and train a corps that can handle finance and management and, especially importantly, create "amphibians" adept at both medicine and finance. We must make solid and practical effort to improve management of all military hospitals under the new situation.
