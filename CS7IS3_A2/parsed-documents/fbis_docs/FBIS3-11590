Yesterday, the minister announced new credit lines to finance exports by small- and medium-sized companies. The amount available is $100 million at an annual interest rate of between 8 and 10 percent. The minister used a meeting of the Argentine Industrial Union [UIA] to announce the plan. UIA President Jorge Blanco Villegas took advantage of the opportunity to lash out at bankers, who were absent from yesterday's meeting. He said they were "one of the main sectors missing from government economic reorganization programs." The loans will be channeled through the Bank of Investment and Foreign Trade (BICE), which is presided over by Horacio Alvarez Rivero. The main points of this new credit line are: - The loan will finance up to 85 percent of the FOB value of capital good exports of national origin and up to 10 percent of the FOB value of spare parts and accessories. - The minimum loan is $20,000 and the maximum is $2.5 million per year. - The interest rate varies from 8 percent a year for shorter terms (from six months to two years) to 10 percent for longer terms (three to five years). - All financial institutions that operate trade internationally with the authorization of the BICE may play the role of commercial banks. The banks will get a maximum profit, or spread [preceding word in English] of 1.5 percent, which is already included in the rate. - The guarantees can be presented through an export credit insurance against special risks and regular commercial risks. The endorsement of foreign banks approved by the BICE can also be used. Alvarez Rivero also presented a second line of credit to finance Argentine companies participation in international fairs and congresses. The idea is to cover up to 70 percent of the cost of renting stands, publishing catalogs, and paying for trips and hotels. With this package -- in addition to the Competitivity Plan to be disclosed next week -- Cavallo seeks to stimulate exports. The 1993 trade deficit was over $3.5 billion. Cavallo said: "We want all 1995 foreign trade activities to enjoy international financing." Blanco Villegas, who is also the president of Philco, was skeptical about Cavallo's promises. He said: "I believe the financial sector has not made enough effort. We must exert pressure and stimulation to broaden credit and to reduce production costs." The few businessmen who are members of the APYME [Small and Medium Enterprises Association] who came to hear the announcement were disappointed. One said: "This is not the first time we have heard announcements of this type." Workers of the INTI [National Institute of Industrial Technology] were also disappointed. They gathered outside to wait for the secretary of industry to protest the reorganization of this secretariat, but Carlos Magarinos did not attend the meeting because he is touring the country.
