Judging by the number of telephone calls to our editorial office, the report has caused panic among a portion of Muscovites. As Anatoliy Solovyev, head of the Main Medical Administration, announced in a conversation with SEVOGDNYA correspondent, however, the statistics on the diseases cholera (4 cases last year and 2 this year) and malaria (33 persons, 24 of them foreigners, have contracted it this year) do not give any basis for worry. In A. Solovyev's words, physicians are alarmed at the increase in adults and children of another highly infectious disease whose initial symptoms are so similar to common angina and diptheria. At the end of the 1940s and beginning of the 1950s, more than 20,000 persons died in Moscow each year from diptheria. Under these conditions, the only correct solution was made -- mass mandatory vaccination of the population. By the mid-1960s, the disease's growth curve had fallen sharply, and prior to 1989 the cases of diptheria in Moscow numbered in the single digits. It was precisely then that physicians began saying that diptheria was finally conquered, and some even expressed doubt as to the feasibility of antidiptheria vaccination. Some physicians suggested that the mercury-containing preparation Merthiolate, which is used as a preservative for preparing the vaccine, is detrimental to health even though the World Health Organization has officially authorized the use of this preparation. On the one hand, an entire generation of physicians has grown up who have studied diptheria's symptoms based on institute textbooks, and on the other hand, most of the population has simply refused antidiptheria vaccinations. According to specialists' data, about 50 percent of Moscow's permanent residents are not currently vaccinated against diptheria. The result has not been slow in coming: according to data from Moscow's Main Medical Administration, 774 persons (197 of them children) have had a confirmed diagnosis of diptheria in 1992. During treatment, 17 adults and 6 children died. In the first 7 months of this year, 932 cases of the disease have been recorded, and 188 of those cases have been among children. Ninety-five adults and three children have died. It should be noted that not one of those who died had been vaccinated against diptheria. Specialists estimated that the per capita vaccination of Muscovites for 10 years will cost city authorities 56 billion rubles. Its costs about 4,000-500,000 rubles to keep such a patient in a clinic for 1 day, and diptheria patients often stay in hospitals for 90 and 120 days each. ``Until recently, the serum for treating diptheria was supplied by the Stavropolsk Biopreparations Plant,'' says Anatoliy Solovyev. ``Since 1 July of this year, supplies have been halted and we have been forced to buy drugs from abroad, which is of course more (about 30 percent) expensive.'' According to physicians' data, Moscow hospitals now only have enough serum to last until the end of the year.
