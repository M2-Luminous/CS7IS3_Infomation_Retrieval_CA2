FR940414-1-00014 FR940414-1-00002 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION 10 CFR Part 20 [Docket No. PRM&hyph;20&hyph;23] Steve Gannis; Receipt of Petition for Rulemaking AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Petition for rulemaking; receipt. SUMMARY: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is publishing for public comment a notice of receipt of a petition for rulemaking, dated January 8, 1994, which was filed with the Commission by Steve Gannis. The petition was docketed by the NRC on February 8, 1994, and has been assigned Docket No. PRM&hyph;20&hyph;23. The petitioner requests that the NRC amend its regulations to limit the annual dose of ionizing radiation that is received by the general public from 100 millirems annually to under 1 millirem annually. The petitioner also requests that if the NRC does not establish a limit of 1 millirem annually, it establish a substantially lower limit than the current 100 millirems annually. DATES: Submit comments by June 28, 1994. Comments received after this date will be considered if it is practical to do so, but the Commission is able to assure consideration only for comments received on or before this date. ADDRESSES: Submit written comments to the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch. Hand deliver comments to: 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland, between 7:45 a.m. and 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. For a copy of the petition, write the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555. The petition and copies of comments received may be inspected and copied for a fee at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael T. Lesar, Chief, Rules Review Section, Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Telephone: 301&hyph;492&hyph;7758 or Toll Free: 800&hyph;368&hyph;5642. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The NRC has established standards for protection against ionizing radiation resulting from activities conducted under licensees and has issued these standards in the regulations codified in 10 CFR part 20. These regulations are intended to control the receipt, possession, use, transfer, and disposal of licensed material by its licensees. Licensed material is any source, byproduct, or special nuclear material received, possessed, used, transferred, or disposed of under a general or specific license issued by the NRC. The Petition The petitioner believes that it is vital to the public interest and public health that a lower radiation dose limit be established because the higher dose limit is a possible source of an unacceptable number of additional cancers. The petitioner indicates that the NRC stated in its ``Below Regulatory Concern'' policy statement (issued July 3, 1990; 55 FR 27522, and withdrawn August 24, 1993; 58 FR 44610) that if the public is exposed to 100 millirems of radiation annually over a lifetime, 1 person out of every 285 people would get fatal cancer. The petitioner states that this number does not include the nonfatal cancers that would be caused. Furthermore, the petitioner states that the 100 millirems is in addition to the approximately 90 millirems of radiation the average person receives annually from natural background radiation sources. The petitioner states that the Federal Government standards on how much cancer can be caused among the public by cancer-causing pollutants and contaminants generally permit, at most, approximately 1 cancer per million people. The petitioner therefore requests that a lower radiation dose limit be established. Specifically, the petitioner requests that the NRC issue a regulation that would limit to under 1 millirem the annual dose of ionizing radiation received by any member of the public. The petitioner's requested limit would include the exposure received from the combined sources of radiation exposure resulting from activities regulated by the NRC. The petitioner also requests that in the event the NRC does not establish an exposure limit of under 1 millirem, the NRC establish a substantially lower limit than the current 100-millirem limit. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 8th day of April, 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. John C. Hoyle, Assistant Secretary of the Commission.
