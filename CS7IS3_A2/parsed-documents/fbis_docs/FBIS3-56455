[Begin recording] [Yavlinskiy] The fact that Yegor Gaydar did not want to be a decorative figure is quite understandable. This confirms the thought that it is not right to use one's name to adorn the government. Therefore, I believe, this was not a surprise. He has been aware for quite a long time that he cannot influence the policy, he still continued to create an illusion that these reforms are such and such and that they should proceed in such and such a way and that this is indeed the government's policy of reforms. [Unidentified correspondent] Grigoriy Alekseyevich, if you are offered a post in the government, will you agree? [Yavlinskiy] Who exactly will offer it to me? [Unidentified correspondent] The prime minister, probably, or maybe the president. [Yavlinskiy] I think it is unlikely that the president will propose this to me. [Unidentified correspondent] What about the prime minister? [Yavlinskiy] This is of no importance. [Unidentified correspondent] Let us say this happened. Would you enter the new government or do you also believe that now it is impossible to do anything in the government? [Yavlinskiy] I could formulate very many proposals that I believe are the necessary prerequisites for the government to be able to improve the situation in a limited period of time, let us say over a year. These prerequisites include cadre reshuffles, the elimination of corruption in the government, a clear-cut political policy with regard to reforms, the absence of compromises on what has to be done and, first and foremost, the acknowledgment of what was done wrong with the aim of correcting it. I think that nobody is ready for this. [end recording]
