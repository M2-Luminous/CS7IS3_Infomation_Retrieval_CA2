China has set an ambitious target for telecommunications construction in its eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995), that is, building 22 national-level trunk lines of optical cable within five years, to connect all the provincial capitals. Assessed from present achievements, China is moving smoothly towards this goal. So far 11 of the 22 optical cables have been opened, of which eight cables were opened in 1993. This year the construction or remolding of 15 optical cables is being successfully carried out. Experts said that, compared with traditional telecommunications means such as electrical conduits and microwave relays, optical fibers made from quartz glass have far more advantages. For example, a pair of optical cables with the thickness of a hair can provide thousands of digital telephone lines simultaneously. China began to study optical fibers and related equipment in the early 1970s. In the 1980s China built the first two optical cables, the Wuhan-Nanjing and Lanzhou-Xining lines. China's construction of optical cable has witnessed surprising development since 1990. In the past few years China opened the trunk lines of Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Fuzhou, Fuzhou-Guangzhou, Beijing-Jinan-Nanjing, Beijing-Wuhan-Guangzhou, Guangzhou-Haikou, Guangzhou-Nanjing, Zhengzhou-Xian, Xian-Chengdu and Chengdu-Kunming, and the submarine optical cable connecting China and Japan was also opened last year. Presently China is intensifying the construction of a number of optical cables including the first-class trunk lines of Beijing-Shenyang-Harbin, Nanjing-Kunming, Xuzhou-Zhengzhou and Xian-Lanzhou. To ensure successful construction of telecommunications projects, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has decided to put 53.6 billion yuan into fixed assets this year, compared with a 40 billion yuan investment last year. China's optical cable construction speed is said to be the fastest in the world--most of the cables have been finished in about one year from laying the cable to installing equipment. The 2,800-km optical cable along the south China coast runs through five provinces and cities and was constructed and opened in only one year. Another example is the 4,700-km Beijing-Shenyang-Harbin optical cable, whose construction was started last October. To date, the laying of cable has basically been finished. The total construction term for this line is predicted to be only eight months. Construction of optical cable has greatly promoted the development of China's posts and telecommunications. Statistics show that in 1993 alone long-distance automatic exchanges increased by 548,000 lines, bringing the total capacity to 1.06 million lines, while newly-increased long-distance telecommunications lines reached 200,000, bringing the total capacity to 420,000 lines.
