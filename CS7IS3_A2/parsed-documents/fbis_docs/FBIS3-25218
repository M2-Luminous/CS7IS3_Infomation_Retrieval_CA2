Rawlings, has appealed to all whose interests are at stake in land disputes in parts of the country to exercise restraint. He said they must also avoid provocations and confrontations which only lead to loss of life and property. These were contained in a speech read for him by the presidential adviser on chieftancy affairs, Nana Akuoko Sarpong at the grand durbar at Abetifi to round off the Afahye [traditional festival] of the people of the Kwahu traditional area. Flight-Lieutenant Rawlings assured the people that all such land cases will be thoroughly investigated by government to enable peace to prevail. The president said Ghanaians have centuries-old institutions to settle communal differences. But lately, violence threatens to break the country apart. He therefore emphasized the need for peace in all communities. He said all must have the will to talk and stay at the talking table until agreement is reached. President Rawlings advised the people of Kwahu to use their rich business experience to promote the export trade in the country. [passage omitted]
