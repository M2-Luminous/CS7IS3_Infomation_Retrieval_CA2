The cabinet doors shall remain in the fully open position. The insulation resistance between the ring terminal of each sample and all the common tip terminals shall be measured each 24 hours when the temperature is between 38 and 57 ○C (100 and 135 ○F) and increasing. The minimum insulation resistance when measured in accordance with paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section shall not be less than 1 x 10 6 ohms. (B) Salt fog. A test housing with its doors closed shall be placed in a salt fog 35 ○C (95 ○F) test chamber and exposed to a salt fog spray per ASTM B 117&hyph;90 for a period of 30 days. The insulation resistance should be measured every 24 hours as indicated in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of the section and shall not be less than 1 x 10 6 ohms. The special service markers shall exhibit no sign of fading, corrosion, swelling, warping, running color, or other signs of deterioration. (ii) Insulation resistance/simulated rain exposure. (A) A test housing as described in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section shall be tested for water infiltration. The test shall be conducted using the method described in paragraph (e)(3)(xi) of this section. The cabinet doors shall remain closed for the duration of the test. The insulation resistance between the ring terminals and the common tip terminals shall be measured during and immediately following the spray application as indicated in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section and shall not be less than 1 x 106 ohms. (B) With the cabinet doors open, a spray of tap water at a rate of 3.8 liters per minute (1 gallon per minute) at 276 kilo-pascals (40 pounds per square inch) shall be directed on the terminal array for a period of 1 minute saturating all of the terminals. Following the spray application the doors shall be closed. The cabinet shall be maintained in a temperature environment of 26 to 28 ○C (78 to 82 ○F) at 95 # 3% RH for 6 hours. The insulation resistance shall then be measured as specified in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section. The minimum insulation resistance shall not be less than 1 x 10 6 ohms. (iii) Contact resistance. A minimum of 100 terminals equipped with cross-connect wire that has been installed in a manner typical of that used in the industry shall be temperature cycled. (A) The test shall consist of eight-hour temperature cycles with one-hour dwells at extreme temperatures of ^40 ○C to +60 ○C (^40 ○F to +140 ○F), and temperature changes at an average rate of 16 ○C (60 ○F) per hour between the extremes. The relative humidity shall be maintained at 95 # 3%. The eight-hour test shall be conducted for 512 cycles. Millivolt drop measurements shall be made initially and after 2, 8, 16, 32, 64, 256, and 512 cycles with the samples at room temperature. The resistance measurement technique must conform to ASTM B 539&hyph;90. The measurement method must have an accuracy of at least # 30 microohms for resistances less than 50 milliohms. The change in contact resistance shall not exceed 2 milliohms. (B) A minimum of 100 terminals equipped with cross-connect wire installed in a manner typical of the industry shall be maintained at 118 ○C (245 ○F) during the test period, except during disturbance measurement periods where each wire connection to the terminals shall have a 0.23 kg (0.5 lb) force momentarily applied in a manner to stress the connection. Initial millivolt measurements shall be made without disturbing the joints in accordance with paragraph (g)(2)(iii)(A) of this section with the samples at room temperature. After initial measurement each sample shall be disturbed followed by a millivolt drop measurement after 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 33 days. The change in contact resistance should be less than 2 milliohms when compared to the initial measurement. (iv) Fire resistance. A fully equipped cabinet including a full complement of cross-connect jumpers shall be installed in the standard field arrangement and tested for fire resistance in accordance with paragraphs (e)(3)(xiii) introductory text through (e)(3)(xiii)(B) of this section. After cooling, the cabinet, terminals, and associated wiring shall be inspected for signs of ignition, melting, burning, or structural damage of sufficient consequences such that the results are service affecting. (v) Encapsulant material compatibility. The terminal connection encapsulant compound must be compatible with the standard materials used in cross-connect hardware and wiring when aged in accordance with ASTM D 4568&hyph;86 at a temperature of 80 # 1 ○C (176 # 2 ○F). The conductor insulation shall retain a minimum of 85% of its unaged tensile strength and elongation values. The cross-connect hardware shall exhibit no visible material degradation. (vi) Encapsulant flow test. Terminal connection encapsulant must remain stable at 80 # 1 ○C (176 # 2 ○F) when tested in an environmental chamber. Test specimens shall be suspended in a preheated oven over a glass dish or other drip-catching medium for a period of 24 hours. At the end of the test period, the glass dish shall be examined for evidence of flowing or dripping of encapsulant from the cross-connect terminal. More than 0.5 gram of encapsulant in the dish at the end of the test constitutes failure. (3) Mechanical requirements _(i) Vibration. A test housing equipped with a full complement of cross-connect terminals and jumper wiring shall be subjected to vibration testing in accordance with paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this section. (ii) Torsional capacity of binding posts. The test specimens shall consist of the complete binding post terminal consisting of the screw or nut, washers if required, and threaded post or stud respectively. (A) Test specimens shall include the terminals along the matrix edge at mid-span locations as well as centrally located terminals. Tests shall be conducted using a torque indicating screwdriver, or wrench, with an accuracy of # 0.17 N-m ( # 1.5 lb-in.) or better. The torque indicating device shall be used to tighten a screw or nut until failure of the screw or nut is achieved. Tests shall be conducted while the test specimen is stabilized at temperatures of ^40 ○C, 20 ○C, and 71 ○C (^40 ○F, +68 ○F, and at +160 ○F). Record the torques at terminal failure. At least 10 test specimens shall be tested at each temperature. The failure torque shall not be less than 2.8 N-m (25.0 lb-in.) for each temperature.
