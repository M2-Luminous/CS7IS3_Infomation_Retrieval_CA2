Under this law, Lithuanian citizens will be able to buy combat pistols or revolvers in stores. Last week, the government approved the rules for acquiring combat firearms. Thus, you will be able to buy a combat firearm as of 1 April. You will have to write an application to the interior minister explaining your motive and take it to a police station. You will have to attach a medical certification stating that your health condition allows you to keep a firearm. [passage omitted] Following an inspection, the police station will have to pass your file over to the Interior Ministry within 20 days. You will not receive a permit if you were convicted for premeditated or casual crimes committed by using firearms, gas arms, or explosives, if you are on probation, or if you are undergoing a punishment other than imprisonment. Nor will permits be issued to people who experienced administrative punishments for using or keeping drugs, for violating hunting and fishing rules, for keeping firearms and ammunition, and other offenses the nature of which suggests that firearms can be the instrument of a crime. The Interior Ministry will not issue permits to incapable people, alcoholics and drug users, mentally affected persons, those who tried to commit suicides, as well as people with physical disabilities that could prevent the safe keeping and using of firearms. Permits will not be issued to people who are on the preventive and operative register with the police, as well as to those who will not pass a theoretical and practical examination arranged by the police station. If you have not violated the law, you will receive a permit to ACQUIRE firearms. The permit will be valid for six months, and you will have to buy a firearm within that time. If you fail to do so, you will have to repeat the entire procedure again. This permit does not grant you the right to carry a firearm. Therefore, you will have to apply to the Interior Ministry within five days after the purchase of a firearm for a permit to CARRY that firearm. The latter document, made of special paper, will have your photo, name, personal code, and vital information about the firearm. You will have to carry this permit together with the firearm. [passage omitted] There is only one store in Vilnius, subordinate to the Arms Fund, that is selling combat firearms for now. The government adopted such a decision because the police want to put tough controls on all arms imported into Lithuania. All firearms on sale will be tested by the police, and the information will be stored in a special catalog. The law allows you to acquire firearms of a caliber not exceeding 9 mm and with the weak firing power. Such firearms are expected to cost no less than $300. You will also be able to acquire 50 cartridges along with the firearm. Before you put the firearm in your pocket, the police will visit your apartment and become convinced that you have a metal safe that will make your gun inaccessible. Moreover, the police will have the right to enter your apartment at any time and repeatedly check on security conditions. You will be able to use the firearm to defend yourself, other people, property, the inviolability of your place of residence, other rights, the interests of society or the state, to prevent a direct threat or the appropriation of the firearm without overstepping the limits of necessary defense, to shoot an animal attacking a human being or posing a threat to the environment, or to call for help. In all these cases, you will be able to fire only after firing a warning shot into the air. The latter will be unnecessary if the attack is unexpected or if the aggressor is armed. Every such shot will have to be reported to the police. The law forbids firing at places of people's assemblies if this can harm outsiders, as well as at women, minor children, and handicapped people with distinct signs of disability, except those cases when they themselves attack and threaten with firearms. Your firearms will undergo test firings at police stations every three years. You will also have to undergo a repeated medical examination to extend your permit. You will be able to carry firearms only on the territory of Lithuania. If you are detained at the border, your firearm will be confiscated. If you need your firearm while travelling abroad, you will have to apply to officials of that country and receive their permission. You will have to show this permit to the Lithuanian Interior Ministry and get another one allowing you take the firearm abroad. Incidentally, people who voluntarily return illegally kept arms to the police by 1 April, will not only remain unpunished, but will also receive compensation and be granted a chance to acquire a legal firearm. No compensation will be paid after 1 April. [passage omitted] Although the law was prepared by the Interior Ministry, it seems that no one listened to its opinion on the expediency of this document. Those deputies who had treaded many doorsteps at the ministry when requesting personal arms for themselves showed particular effort in "pushing the law through" the Seimas [parliament]. Having received a negative answer, they must have decided to arm everyone.
