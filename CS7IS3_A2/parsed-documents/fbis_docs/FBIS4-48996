The bank's power to stabilize the local financial market will be enhanced with the note-issuance, Wang Qiren, Chairman of BOC, said on Thursday [28 April]. He said it will also increase Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre and ensure the region's smooth transition back to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Note-issuing banks will not bring any economic benefits to BOC under the current system, he said. BOC will issue HK dollars on Monday after 20 months of preparation. For every HK$7.80 [Hong Kong dollars] issued, BOC must match that by depositing $1 into the Hong Kong government's exchange fund. A total of HK$3 billion ($384.6 million) will be issued this year, representing about 4 percent of the total HK notes currently in circulation. BOC will have to bear the cost of issuing notes and the risk in the fluctuation of foreign exchange. Wang said his bank has played an active role in ensuring the smooth operation of Hong Kong's financial system in the past few years by cooperating with the region's government. "Participation in the notes issuance means our social responsibility has been enhanced," Wang said. He said his bank will continue to conduct its business strictly in accordance with Hong Kong's financial laws He said that the Bank of China's relationship with local counterparts will not be changed by the note issue. Wang said his bank will continue to support Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and Standard Chartered Bank as the main note issuers. BOC is willing to cooperate with the other two banks and all other associates to contribute to the financial stability and development of Hong Kong, he said. It has gained a firm foothold in the region and the BOC Group in Hong Kong is its largest overseas operation, as well as the second- largest banking group in Hong Kong. Wang said the group has been supplying high quality service for local residents and firms with an objective of "taking root in Hong Kong, rendering services in Hong Kong.' By the end of last year, the group assets value mounted to HK$700 billion with a network of more than 350 subsidiaries throughout the island, Kowloon and the New Territories. The group's savings and credits have risen by 30 and 46 times respectively since 1978.
