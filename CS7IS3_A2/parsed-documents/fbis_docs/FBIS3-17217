[sentence as received] Iranian civil aviation and air force experts are now at the site of the crash near Stepanakert. Conclusions are to be drawn after they return from there and analyse the collected data, the diplomat said. "The flight was not of reconnaissance nature and the C-130 plane had no photographic equipment," the Iranian spokesman emphasised. "The plane carried members of the families of Iranian diplomats who work in Moscow and several Iranian students. Regular flights from Moscow to Tehran are made once a week. Therefore they decided to take the plane to fly home for lunar new year's holidays." According to the diplomat, the authorities of Russia, Georgia, and Armenia were notified in advance about the flight, and issued appropriate permissions. "We requested the Armenian authorities to provide the recording of radio traffic between the Yerevan air traffic controllers and the Russian airliner on a flight from Sharja to Mineralnyye Vody, via which contact was maintained with the Iranian plane in question," the Iranian spokesman said. "We hope that the Armenian side will comply with regulations provided for by international law and investigate all the circumstances of the tragedy," the Iranian diplomat said.
