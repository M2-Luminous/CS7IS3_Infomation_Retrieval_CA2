In our country's case, the State Department's repeated charges that our banking system has inherited the role played by Panama changed the mind of the banking authorities who refused to implement control mechanisms and lift bank secrecy. Thus, money-laundering operations through bank branches dropped noticeably (the latest cases made public involved the Santander and Lloyd's banks, linked to the Yomagate scandal [involving Argentine President Carlos Menem's sister-in-law]). The bank branches were replaced by some money exchanges on which U.S. organizations in charge of repressing illegal financial transactions focused their attention. Money exchanges also were forced to operate more "openly" when the Central Bank of Uruguay extended some of the control mechanisms to this field. Once in a while the money exchanges appeared involved in money laundering, as in the recent case involving the Indumex [expansion unknown] money exchange, used to launder capital amassed in Brazil through a colossal corruption and influence peddling scheme. However, the operators of ill-gotten money have had to find new discreet methods to launder their money in view of the risks they run due to the control measures implemented by DEA agents, the IRS (the office in charge of fighting tax evasion), and U.S. Customs. The freedom to carry out financial transactions in our country, in this sense, offers a new and flourishing mechanism: the surfacing of corporations engaged in intermediary activities. Leaders of the banking union have just charged CADISA, Investment Management Company, Inc., one of the most important of these corporations in Uruguay, with money laundering. CADISA's trade is better known as Citicorp's "Citicarteras" [investments portfolio]. Citicorp, in turn, is the international corporation of the Uruguayan government's main creditor bank: Citibank. If one believes banking sources, one could presume that Citibank, through Citicorp, has managed to complete the circle. CADISA's operations are considered a typical financial intermediary. It attracts savings that, in turn, are invested in banks operating in Uruguay with clauses in the contracts noting that all risks are run exclusively by the client. This allows CADISA to carry out risky operations, depositing the money in saving accounts or buying "money baskets" in those banks that offer the best interest rates for investments. Citicarteras, preferably, operates with government-intervened private banks and the public banking sector, especially the Mortgage Bank. It is estimated that Citicorp, during the 18 months it has been operating through CADISA, has accumulated $100 million worldwide. Many of its clients do not reside in Uruguay. Citicarteras offers a high return in exchange for a commission. In addition to the rates -- which are an incentive despite the risk it represents -- there is another benefit: the full concealment of the operation because CADISA, not the client, deposits the money in the bank. In other words, the client enjoys complete secrecy, something that not even the banks enjoy. This is feasible because since CADISA is a corporation, although it carries out typical intermediary financial operations, it is not subject to Central Bank control measures. This abnormal situation reported by the AEBU [Association of Uruguayan Bank Employees] still has not prompted a declaration by the Central Bank management. The subject was discussed recently but the Central Bank postponed any decision on the subject. Central Bank President Enrique Braga, through his public relations manager, declined to make any comments on the issue. Union sources told BRECHA that the facilities Citicorp enjoys allow money laundering. Citicorp carries out similar activities in Argentina, where the National Securities Commission has sanctioned the holding [preceding world in English] "due to its dubious operations" and "irregularities in its activities." Citicorp in Argentina during the past two years has focused on the purchase of public enterprises earmarked for privatization and owns 28 percent of Cointel [expansion unknown] shares and 33 percent of the Zapla Iron and Steel Industry in partnership with the Spanish Telephone Company and Techint [expansion unknown]. The consulted sources asserted that CADISA's operations in Uruguay favor the strategy of Citibank, which currently has a dispute with the AEBU because it refuses to acknowledge the enforcement of the collective bargaining agreement valid for the entire industry. Citibank, on one hand, is trying to weaken the union and, on the other, to become the leader of the banks that belong to the Association of Banking Enterprises, which it left a few months ago. CADISA operations are regarded as "unfair competition" by Citibank regarding the rest of the banking institutions. Citibank channels its financial intermediary activities through CADISA, which has significantly reduced costs. The case is quite unique: Citicarteras has no employees; its agents appear as a one-man enterprise. Nor do they collect salaries because they earn commissions and percentages that eliminate, among other things, the payment of contributions to the BPS [Social Security Bank]. Labor union sources stated, however, that Citicarteras' financial intermediary operations imply a risk not mentioned in its advertisements: The corporation is not covered by bank secrecy and any judge, as well as the General Directorate of Taxation, can intervene the bank accounts. That is, as long as there is a desire to control what seems a profitable and almost perfect mechanism for money laundering.
