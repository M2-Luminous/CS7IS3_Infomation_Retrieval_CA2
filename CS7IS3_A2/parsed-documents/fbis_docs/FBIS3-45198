We have talked about the need to learn more and do more research and investigations in the last two commentaries. What was the purpose? It is for doing practical things and doing a good job in reform, opening up, and the various undertakings of socialist modernization. The advocacy of doing more practical things and speaking less empty words is to ask cadres of various levels to play an exemplary role in leading the broad masses to do real and solid work; make solid contributions to promoting reform, opening up, and modernization construction; and prevent and overcome bad work styles such as exaggeration, lip service, formalism, and fancy appearances. The magnificent mansion of socialist modernization is built by bricks and stones, not blown up by empty puffs. Empty talk ruins the country, solid work invigorates it, and many such examples can be found in history. It should be affirmed that a great majority of our leading cadres work diligently, conscientiously, and practically and this is the important reason for the prosperous development of our undertakings. However, we must also realize that among a small number of comrades some bad work styles exist. They fall to the sea of meetings and the mountain of documents, make vague calls without giving concrete guidance, and work superficially; or they part with reality, give promises lightly, and do not grasp implementation; or they try to have their "names in newspapers, sounds in broadcasts, and images on television," but are not willing to do solid work; or they watch the upper levels and engage in some fancy appearances which win praise from their superiors.... These bad work styles seriously part from the masses, hinder the implementation of the party's principles, policies, and decisions, and must be resolutely overcome. Of course, when we oppose empty talk, we are only getting at the phenomenon of not doing practical things, we are not saying that we do not have to honestly publicize development goals which we can reach, nor are we saying that we do not have to speak some words to encourage the masses to unite for the struggle. The actual work is complicated, and regarding which things we should explain first and do later, which things we should explain and do simultaneously, and which things we should do first and explain later, we must analyze and handle them from the viewpoint of concrete conditions. What is the biggest practical thing which we should do well with all our energy at this time? It is expediting reform and development. The decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee has drawn a blueprint for building our socialist market economy system. This year, based on the spirit of the "decision," the central leadership has been announcing measures to reform taxation, finance, foreign trade, investment, and planning, and various localities have been actively implementing them. In the progress of reform and development, we will surely run into new conflicts and problems, which require our cadres of various levels to rack their brains to solve them one by one in a practical manner to enable the central leadership's measures for expediting reform and development to be implemented one by one. Various localities differ in conditions, and, as they propose goals and formulate measures, they must consider their own actual conditions and refrain from blind comparisons. They must be ambitious on the one hand and work solidly on the other hand. When various localities and departments find themselves upholding this principle and properly, solidly, and fruitfully do a good job in the reform, development, and modernization of their own places, they have developed a good work style of doing more practical things and speaking less empty words. In the process of doing practical things, we must correctly understand and handle the relationship between doing practical things and demonstrating the merit of work. When more practical things are done and done better, the merit of work becomes prominent, and officials can win the support of the masses and praise from their superiors. There is no question about this. Some comrades set the goal that "when one takes the office of governor of a locality, one must benefit the locality in which he serves." This kind of ambition is worth encouraging. But we must also prevent and overcome short-term behavior, that is, one may be willing to do practical things which can easily demonstrate one's work merits instantly, but he may be unwilling to do practical things which cannot easily demonstrate his work merits instantly but which indeed have to been done from a long-term perspective. Much short-term behavior has brought about many adverse effects to the extent of hindering the pace of reform and development, and this has been proved by much practice. The purpose of doing more practical things is to benefit the country and the people, not to establish tablets or create legends for oneself. It is hoped that this starting point issue will draw the attention of leading comrades of various levels. Showing concern for the sufferings of the masses and solving their difficulties is a practical thing which ought to be done by the leaders of various levels. The purpose of our party is to serve the people heart and soul, and the purpose of reform and development is to let the people have a happier life. Speaking frankly, the adjustment of the pattern of interests and relationships during the deepening of reform will benefit the broad masses of the people. But at a certain stage and in a certain area, different masses will be benefited differently. This is unavoidable. Under this condition, leaders of various levels must always be concerned with the well-being of the broad masses, promptly discover problems, and make prompt adjustments to solve problems. Only by so doing can they protect enthusiasm among the masses, mobilize them as much as possible to participate in the reform and to support it and create a stable social and political environment for reform and development. To do more practical things, we must develop the spirit of hard struggle and a scientific and pragmatic spirit as well. Hard struggle is a precious tradition of ours. Today, while we do pioneering work in reform and opening up, the effect will be very different if we do not have a spirit of hard struggle. We must closely rely on the broad masses of cadres and people, do more practical things which require less money or do not even require money, and do less things which increase burdens on the masses and require compulsory appropriations. Due to limited financial strength, there are some things which we cannot do at this time, but we must patiently explain to the masses to win their understanding. To do practical things, we must also seek truth from facts and cherish scientific attitude. We must never do things by relying only on enthusiasm or subjective wishes. We must carry out scientific discussions and make scientific decisions on the basis of research and investigation. We must try hard to reduce minor errors while avoiding big ones and enable every practical thing to obtain the biggest economic and social returns. Since reform and opening up, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has stressed that leading cadres should have a good work style. Recently, Comrade Jiang Zemin has repeatedly asked leading cadres of various levels to learn more, have less social intercourse, do more research and investigations, have less subjectivism, and do more practical things and speak less empty words. These three requirements are the most important contents of improving the work style of the leadership. A new year has just begun, and I hope that leading comrades of various levels develop the good work style of learning more, doing more research and investigations, and doing more practical things; better unite with the broad masses of people and lead them in clearing a way to forge ahead; and work diligently to enable our reform, opening up, and modernization undertakings to proceed faster and better in order to please the whole party and the people of the whole country.
