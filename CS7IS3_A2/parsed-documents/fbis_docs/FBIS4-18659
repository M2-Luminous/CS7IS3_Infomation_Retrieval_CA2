I am pleased, Mr. de Montbrial, to be the first German foreign minister to address you. At the end of the 1970's, we were both planning chiefs in our foreign ministries. I am also pleased that you, Professor Rovan, are one of the hosts of this evening. You have been tireless in your efforts to pave the way for Franco-German friendship. For us Germans, the collapse of the Berlin Wall was the most important event related to freedom in the postwar period. The French were delighted along with us. Alain Juppe, with whom I enjoy friendly relations and close cooperation, was at the Berlin Wall in those days. In his book Tentation de Venise [Temptation of Venus], he describes people's joy on 16 November 1989, the happy atmosphere of those days, and his own emotions. Without Franco-German friendship, without Germany being firmly anchored in Europe and the West, German unity would not have been possible. The Germans are well aware of that. However, reunification has at times also revived old concerns about Germany's role in Europe. What kind of Europe do we want? How large and how closely integrated should it be? What role is a united Germany seeking in a new Europe? What roles do Germany and France have in this Europe that is drawing together following the end of the East-West conflict and following German reunification? These are the kinds of questions that occur to a German foreign minister. These are also the questions that I want to discuss with you today. They can only be answered against the background of Franco-German friendship. Germany has no other partner with whom cooperation is so close and so marked by confidence. We are each other's most important trading partners. Summit meetings twice a year and regular consultations between the ministers are the most visible elements of an incomparably close network of consultation and coordination. I constantly consult with Alain Juppe, and we see each other almost every week. There was a good reason for visiting Paris on the day I took office, and there was also a good reason why Alain Juppe visited Bonn immediately after he took office! Not one day goes by without a Franco-German meeting appearing in the schedules in Bonn and Paris. Our embassies exchange reports and carry out joint instructions. Franco-German friendship is firmly rooted among our two peoples. There are 1,600 sister cities and 3,000 school partnerships, including a youth exchange program involving over 5 million participants -- that speaks for itself. Polls show again and again how Franco-German friendship has become something self-evident for our citizens. It has become a model for reconciliation in Europe. Since 1945, France and Germany have constantly succeeded to mark significant dates in their common history in a dignified manner. I recall the meeting between Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer at Reims Cathedral, and President Mitterrand and Chancellor Kohl praying together at the graves at Verdun. There is no doubt in my mind that the French and the Germans will be able to recall the end of World War II and Germany's return to the democratic community in an appropriate manner. We will also remember France's contribution to defending the Germans' liberty when French soldiers leave Berlin now. The European unification process has opened up a new path into the future for Germany. With the decision to integrate our country into the European Union [EU], we have acted on the conclusions that are to be drawn from German history in this century. In 1953, Thomas Mann already advised us to seek "a Germany that is a self-assured element in a self-assured united Europe." That is what we want to be. The overwhelming majority that was obtained in the Bundestag for the Treaty on European Unification and the Federal Constitutional Court ruling have shown that there is agreement in Germany: We need more, not less Europe. What links us is historical insight. Two such large neighboring states in the heart of Europe can only exist by coexisting. That is why Germany and France have always placed European unification ahead of the adoption of individual or special courses. Not only have we done well by doing so, but both our countries have also become trendsetters for Europe. That is the way it will remain and must remain! All of Europe, including Germany, is experiencing economic and structural problems today. Germany faces a third challenge: The completion of unification. The open domestic market will enable our partners to act on an equal footing in the development of this region. French companies were one of the first to seize these great opportunities in eastern Germany. The involvement of French investors accounts for almost 20 percent of all foreign investment. In 1993, real economic growth there amounted to a good 7 percent. What will remain unforgettable for me is how impressed Alain Juppe was by the development of the new laender when we and our wives visited Dresden. The wave of hostility toward foreigners and right-wing acts of violence, which we thought could never occur again, horrified the overwhelming majority of Germans. Hatred of foreigners and hostility toward what is foreign should never again originate in Germany! The EU needs a common asylum and immigration policy. We Germans, especially in view of our history, believe in the duty to assist people who are experiencing need, violence, and war. German foreign policy is geared toward values and is shaped by the principle of responsibility. That is the reason for our humanitarian involvement in Somalia, in former Yugoslavia, and elsewhere. That is why we are involved in intensive diplomatic efforts to resolve conflicts and that is also the reason for our readiness to assume responsibility on the UN Security Council, with all the rights and duties that that entails. Germany is seeking a permanent place on the Security Council. France supports that wish. We are grateful for that. French soldiers have lost their lives for the cause of peace. We remember them with the highest respect. We are impressed by the exemplary deployment of blue helmets in former Yugoslavia. I am confident that we will shortly have clarification of the constitutional conditions for participation in missions aimed at maintaining or creating peace. That is the only way in which Germany remains capable of integration and being an alliance partner within the EU and NATO. The new Europe is no longer the divided Europe of the Cold War, but all of Europe. Germany and France have asked themselves three questions concerning the future: - How can we consolidate peace? - How can we safeguard the well-being of our peoples? - How will we assert ourselves within a global framework? Once again: The answer for Germany is clear. We can only master these challenges within and along with the EU. I am sure that France will provide the same answer. Our joint commitment for the EU has laid the basis for the future. I am confident that we will succeed in the historic step toward a new, greater, and stronger Europe. The questions concerning candidates for admission have been resolved. The expansion of the EU to include Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway will represent a success for Europe. It would not make any sense to be held up by the voting rights issue. The EU model involving common institutions has superseded the idea of nothing more than a free trade zone, an idea that we did not discard in 1957 simply in order to approve it today. Just as we jointly acted in 1985 to facilitate membership for southern Europe, it is now the turn of the north. The birth pangs of the new Europe are more painful than was expected. In this critical situation, Germany and France must use their combined weight to provide new inspiration to Europe. Franco-German initiatives such as the formation of a Eurocorps and our proposal for the resumption of the Geneva negotiations on Yugoslavia have become EU projects. The GATT negotiations, which are of such importance for Europe's economic future, were a success because Germany and France reached agreement. Neither of our countries if they had acted alone would have had the strength to have achieved such a conclusion to the negotiations. France knows it can rely on Germany and vice versa. Pompidou's words have been confirmed: Franco-German partnership is "exemplary," but not "exclusive." We now face difficult questions concerning the further development of the EU: They concern the rate at which new member states are accepted, the reform of European institutions, and the relationship between deepening and enlargement. All these questions can only be solved if Germany and France seek to answer them jointly. Germany and France must also retain their pivotal function in an EU that will continue to grow. It is our common task for the future. The Elysee Treaty provides us with guidelines in this respect. Germany and France have resolved that as of 1 July their consecutive EU presidencies will be oriented toward a common vision for the EU's future. Alain Juppe and I have agreed on that. I envision four main areas in this Franco-German partnership program: First, we must implement the EU Treaty in a resolute manner. With the common market and the European Economic Zone, we have achieved an integration advantage in world terms. To retain it, we have to realize economic and monetary union [EMU]. I welcome the fact that at the second stage of EMU, France restored the independence of the Banque de France. I am grateful to France for its yes to Frankfurt as the headquarters of the European central bank. Germany has also provided proof on many occasions of its readiness to make great efforts for Europe's monetary union, and has done so recently through the Bundesbank's supportive action totalling 60 billion German marks in 1993. Our common goal is the convergence of our economies. That is why we have reached firm agreement on binding criteria for entering the third stage of economic and monetary union. Not all the EU member states will be able to carry out this step at the same time. Without cohesion on the part of the first group that meets the criteria, the remaining member states will not be able to achieve the necessary level of performance at a later date too. Germany and France must defend the logic of the union treaty against all attempts to water it down! The 18 million unemployed in the EU are a warning signal. The globalization of markets and the international division of labor require rethinking and painful adjustment processes. Above all, Europe cannot afford to fall behind the dynamic development in Asia. Europe needs a modernization boost to enter the information age of the 21st century. There is an urgent need to develop transportation, energy, and communications networks all over Europe. Today, travelling by train between Berlin and Paris takes 13 hours and involves going through four different energy networks with three different railroad safety systems. How long can we afford to carry on like this? The EU must also remain capable of acting after its expansion. That is why we now need common ideas about developing the necessary institutional reforms. We have no choice. We and France support enhancing the EU and we must achieve that along with the EU's expansion. The 1996 government conference must make the necessary decisions. The expanded EU must also function. The rights of the European Parliament must also be developed. The council and the commission must remain capable of acting. It is of key importance that Germany and France will occupy clear and convergent positions. I support the idea of appointing a commission of wise men that formulate proposals for the government conference. Our citizens must once again be able to find their national and regional identity in a Europe that is drawing together. The upcoming European elections are a test. We must win over the citizens of France and of Germany for Europe! Secondly, the EU must respond to the changed security policy challenges in Europe. This means that the development of an independent European security and defense identity is indispensable. That is why we are developing the WEU as a defense component of the EU in a comprehensive manner. In future, the WEU and NATO will engage in close coordination in the event of crises. Our ability to engage in common defense will thus be adjusted to meet specifically European requirements. Our North American partners are supporting European efforts to achieve more independence in asserting our security. The most recent alliance summit provided impressive proof of that. However, future Europe also needs the transatlantic security partnership. It is one of the formative experiences of our recent history. For the core functions of the alliance, the commitment of our North American partners, above all the presence of U.S. troops in Europe, is indispensable. Franco-German cooperation strengthens the columns that support Europe's bridge over the Atlantic. Concerning events in former Yugoslavia over the past few weeks: I very much welcome the fact that France has been particularly active in promoting NATO's decisions concerning Sarajevo. The stabilization that has occurred in Sarajevo in the meantime and the agreements that have been signed on the Bosnian-Croatian federation demonstrate what can be achieved with resolve and clear goals. I am pleased to see that the EU peace plan, which is based on a Franco- German initiative, is now developing into what will hopefully be a lasting and durable international peace settlement with the participation of the United States and Russia. This is a good example of the power of Franco-German understanding. We need the courage to develop visions for the Europe of the future. After the turn of the century, everyone in Europe will bear a responsibility for the security of others, precisely because everyone has an immense interest in the security of others. Next century, Europe will have to supplement the Atlantic alliance by developing a collective security system. We must develop the CSCE into an instrument for preventing and resolving conflicts. Along with the French foreign minister, I am of the opinion that an important and necessary step in this direction was to oblige participating states to take joint action against those who disrupt peace. In such cases, participating states should jointly call for a meeting of the UN Security Council and at the same time undertake to implement Security Council resolutions jointly. We are seeking a multidimensional, graduated networking of the security interests of all the states in the region. It would simply be wrong to accord the states of Central and East Europe a place between West and East in this Europe. That is why we cannot accept the Russian proposal of militarily guaranteeing the security of these countries by NATO states on the one hand and by CIS states on the other hand. The old way of thinking in zones of influence is no longer valid. In the new Europe, there can be no place for so-called vital spheres of influence, for the concept of "an abroad close-at-hand." The Partnership for Peace has created an instrument for spreading stability to Central and East Europe and thus drawing in Russia. In a time of new risks, arms control remains a task of first-order importance for the international community. That is why I have proposed a 10 point plan for preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. I am pleased about the positive response. There must be an unlimited extension of the Nonproliferation Treaty. Thirdly, we also need an active EU policy on the Mediterranean region. I know how developments in the Maghreb countries above all constitute a vital interest for France. We share concerns about security in the Mediterranean region. Alain Juppe and I want to investigate the possibilities for joint initiatives in this region. Fourthly, we need a common EU policy on the East. This is an historic task. We must gradually lead the reformist states of Central and East Europe into our community of stability. The people there need firm proof that the difficult transition to democracy and free market economy is worth it. In 1990, Germany and France already envisaged a joint Eastern policy. This will be a key issue in both the German and the French presidencies. A start has already been made: The trilateral talks with our Polish colleagues have opened up a new bridge of understanding. In the security field too, Germany and France are making progress with Poland. At the next meeting of the WEU ministerial council in May, on the basis of the proposal made by Alain Juppe and myself, the opportunities for our Eastern partners to have an input through consultations will be given concrete form. France's initiative for a stability pact in Europe is geared toward settling particularly critical minority and border issues. We want to make a success of this EU project together! I see there being five additional areas that require an active EU Eastern policy: Firstly, for the states of Central and East Europe that already have an associate status, the previously agreed upon full implementation of the opening up of markets is a top priority. Measures aimed at closing off markets undermine the credibility of this process! The admission of the states of Central and East Europe to the EU has been promised. This is a task of historic importance. It will require time. We cannot afford to fail in this respect. It cannot be right to call on the countries of Central and East Europe for decades to join our Western community based on freedom, and then to say that there are no vacant rooms left for them in the European house! We already want to draw our association partners into common foreign and security policies as much as possible. Germany and France will work to achieve a better coordination of advisory assistance for the states of Central and East Europe. I would propose a "European Development Corps." The PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] program should be more strongly oriented toward the promotion of investment. Secondly, the development of relations between the EU and Russia will have a key role. We want an open, stable, democratic Russia, which can become a capable economic partner and reliable support for pan-European peaceful order. Just as we have firm expectations on the Russian side, we must also be ready to reach compromises with Russia regarding what is of importance to it. Yes, we want cooperation, but Russia's integration into the world economic system is only possible to the extent that Russia establishes a free market economy at home. The negotiations about a partnership and cooperation treaty must be successfully concluded now! As long as Russia says yes to Europe, we will not say no to Russia! Thirdly, Ukraine is the cornerstone of strategic stability in all of East Europe. The economic crisis there and the tension with Russia affect us directly. They could have extensive consequences. I advocate that the EU should work toward reducing tension in Ukrainian-Russian relations. Is there really any kind of argument against a common EU policy toward Ukraine? We should also jointly work toward bringing Ukraine into our European cooperation network quickly! Fourthly, we need a coherent EU policy toward the Baltics. The Baltic states can already display impressive reform results. My meeting with the Baltic foreign ministers on 9 March strengthened my conviction that a united Europe needs the Baltic states. Along with France, we want to lead these countries increasingly closer to the EU. Appropriate European treaties should be concluded this year. The withdrawal of Russian troops must be completed in accordance with agreements and according to schedule. Fifthly, what is more important than material transfer is the transfer of science and education from West to East. The development of competitive economies in the states of Central and East Europe requires enormous efforts in the areas of education, science, and research. To achieve a massive expansion of this exchange, what I have proposed to Alain Juppe is a joint initiative for an intellectual Marshall Plan for East Europe. Let us start the ball rolling, so that thousands of additional students and scientists from these countries can study and conduct research in the EU and so that more EU college professors can teach and study there. We still have a unique chance to revive pan-European cultural traditions going back hundreds of years. We must now seize this chance together! Franco-German relations are also a very personal matter for me. I have been familiar with France and French culture since my youth. My first journey abroad, which saw me travel to France as a schoolboy, was an important experience for me. My French teacher, whom I shall never forget, was a particularly great admirer of France and he instilled in me a love of Romain Rolland and Georges Bernanos. For over 20 years, my home town of Hechingen has been linked with Joue-les-Tours in the garden of France, the Touraine. Intellectual exchange is a hallmark of European history and culture. Today, we know that European integration does not lead to the disappearance of national identities. On the contrary, today, anyone who allows the images of history in Europe's capital cities to soak into him knows that the integration of Europe has led to the blossoming of national identities. Anyone who travels in your country today feels that "certaine idee de la France" [preceding words in French] of which De Gaulle spoke, irrespective of whether he visits Paris, Normandy, the Loire, or Provence. In the same way, Berlin, Munich, Dresden, and Magdeburg are unmistakably German. Anyone who understands that Germany has recovered itself and unity through the integration of Europe knows that Germany will proceed along the European path side by side with France.
