FR940208-1-00043 FR940208-1-00011 ``shall not be less stringent than the emission control that is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source, as determined by the Administrator.'' (2) For existing sources, the standards ``may be less stringent than standards for new sources *␣*␣* but shall not be less stringent, and may be more stringent than: (A) The average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of the existing sources (for which the Administrator has emissions information) *␣*␣* or (B) the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 5 sources *␣*␣* for categories or subcategories *␣*␣* with fewer than 30 sources'' [Section 112(d)(3)]. VI. Selection Rationale A. Selection of Source Category(s) Controlled The gasoline distribution facility category is made up of several facility types, which taken together form the gasoline distribution network. The pollutants emitted at each of the facilities in the gasoline distribution network are essentially the same. These emissions consist of a mixture of organic compounds (essentially all of which qualify as VOC under the Agency's definition). Section 112(b) of the Act contains a list of HAP's for which the Agency has been directed to set national emission standards. A comparison of profiles of normal gasoline vapors to the HAP list reveals several compounds common to both. Benzene, toluene, hexane, ethylbenzene, naphthalene, cumene, all three chemical orientations of xylene (para, meta, and ortho), n-hexane, and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (iso-octane) appear on both lists. Section 211 of the Act contains provisions that will affect gasoline composition in the 1998 base year and, therefore, the HAP emissions from gasoline distribution sources. This section of the Act requires that fuels purchased and sold in nonattainment areas contain higher levels of oxygenates (reformulated and oxygenated fuel programs). While the focus of these fuels programs is the reduction of both tailpipe (combustion) and evaporative emissions of CO and air toxics (benzene, 1,3-butadiene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and POM) emissions from gasoline vehicles, the intent of today's proposed rule is to reduce major stationary source evaporative HAP emissions from gasoline distribution facilities. Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) is projected to be a major source of oxygen that will be added to gasoline to meet the oxygenate content requirements for the reformulated gasoline and oxygenated fuels programs. MTBE is also listed in Section 112(b) as a HAP.
