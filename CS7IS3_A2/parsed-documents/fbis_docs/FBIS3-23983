They are assigning the detonator role for the social explosion to miners who have been combat-ready for a long time. In September, the Independent Trade Union of Coal Industry Workers conducted a strike; in November-December -- the Independent Trade Union of Miners. The miners' main demands are immutable. However, Aleksandr Sergeyev is convinced that a "nomenklatura-managerial trade union" of coal miners provokes inflation and that a "free trade union" of miners protects the course of the reforms. [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Can one and the same demand be pro-market and anti-market depending on who proposes it? [Sergeyev] The demands are different. The coal miners' trade union is insisting that the debts owed to the miners be repaid at any cost. One demand is preferential extension of credit to enterprises using coal. Supposedly, they will then pay off the mines. This means throwing tens of trillions more of "empty" rubles into the economy. [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Do you think that it is better not to pay debts, generally speaking? [Sergeyev] No, the state should pay the subsidies pledged in the 1993 budget. However, it is not obligatory that money should be printed for this purpose. The mines are now paying taxes into the budget and then receiving subsidies. Let the mines be "excused" from taxes and deductions for the employment and pension funds in the amount which they have not been paid in the form of subsidies. However, subsidies are approximately a third of what the miners are "short;" the remainder are the debts of the user. It is necessary to seek a declaration of bankruptcy through the courts for enterprises that cannot pay for the coal. In June of last year prior to the introduction of unregulated prices for coal, these prices were 30 percent of world ones. Metallurgy moved to the world price of metal using cheap coal. That means that they set the production cost of its products too high and that they raised wages for themselves at the expense of our coal's cheap price. [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Are you not afraid that workers in other branches will accuse you of trying to worsen their condition with your demands? [Sergeyev] We have conflicts with all trade unions. They say that we are "pro-government" and are being supported by state money. Only one thing cannot be understood: Why are we living in such "luxury" -- a headquarters consisting of one room? [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI comment] The leaders of the "miners" constantly emphasize that its trade union rival, which is "genetically linked with the VTsSPS [All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions]," is not a genuine one since representatives of the administration are included in it. They are convinced that a "managerial trade union" is not capable of truly defending worker interests. In turn, the "coal miners" accuse the NPG [Independent Trade Union of Miners] of splitting the worker movement. They assume that the disintegration of a single miners' trade union is a matter in the hands of the government, which is skillfully taking advantage of the trade union leaders' excessive ambitions. The "coal miners" have approximately a million members -- practically all are workers in the branch. "Miners" represent only part of the underground workers -- approximately 80,000 people. True, they have political capital earned during the initial period of the struggle for democracy. However, this capital is completely counterbalanced today by the authority of the "defenders of worker interests," who acquired the "old" trade union during the transition to a market. Miners are living in an atmosphere of fear bordering on panic. There are chronic pay delays, prospects of massive unemployment, a lack of solutions for social and living problems. In this situation, the main mass of the miners will most likely come out in favor of a trade union which is able to achieve the largest concessions from the government. [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] When the leaders of the "traditional" trade unions said that the government is acting without considering worker interests, you branded them "enemies of the reforms." Why have you always defended the government so vehemently? [Sergeyev] We have not defended the government but the policy of reform. The "managerial" trade union was demanding money to preserve the old order; we -- to bring the coal industry into the market carefully and not "throw it into it." What do we have? First of all, they adopted an edict about issuing joint stock for the branch's enterprises although it is clear that the shares of stock are blank paper: They will close the mines. It was necessary to begin with a program for structurally reorganizing the branch and providing measures for miners let go. [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Why did the reform government not listen to your completely reformist demands? [Sergeyev] There never was any reform government. It was a coalition where lobbying interests fought. Each fall, miners, oil workers and then others "stood up." All were demanding money and it was given to everyone. During the two years, the government did not develop a strategy or tactics for reorganizing the economy. The directorate and the Moscow bureaucrats adapted and built a market for themselves. I do not know whether an auditing firm capable of inspecting Rosugol and other large corporations will be found in Russia. When World Bank experts were studying Rosugol's activity, it refused to give them part of the information, citing commercial secrets. Almost all coal associations are bankrupt but Rosugol is a highly profitable company. It not only distributes state subsidies between associations but also provides them paid services for equipment purchases, marketing, etc. The bureaucrats in Moscow are living better than the miners. The directors of the associations do not protest. Certain units are trying to break away from the guardianship of the corporation. However, they often ask to return because it begins to choke them deliberately -- with high taxes and through the distribution of subsidies. [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI comment] One cannot say that the authorities have ignored the Independent Trade Union of Miners. Its leaders have been well received in many high offices and have rubbed shoulders with State Secretary Burbulis and many vice premiers without ceremony. However, the fate of the proposals proposed by them differed little from the fate of the demands by the "VTsSPS successors:" The majority of the government's promises have remained on paper. The protocol, which Yegor Gaydar himself signed in December under the threat of a Russia-wide miners' strike, is not being implemented. [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Perhaps, the government completely fulfilled a miners' demand only once: It raised their wages threefold in January 1992. [Sergeyev] That decision was provoked by the miners' trade union and the branch ministry. It was they who achieved an increase in wages for all branch workers, including nurses in the departments' kindergartens. A surge in inflation occurred -- they shifted the blame to the miners. I do not want the miners to be the "extreme" ones again and that is why I am criticizing the "coal miners" for issuing money. One only had to raise the pay of the underground group of workers in 1992. Gaydar later explained to me why they increased it for everyone: "We thought that `they' were you," that is, they thought that this trade union is also a workers' movement and that its leaders are capable of organizing strikes. I think that the government demonstrated incompetency at that time -- although some say that Yeltsin paid off the miners this way or that he was thanking them for bringing him to power. [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Do you intend to engage actively in politics as before or is this not a trade union matter? [Sergeyev] It is a trade union one -- until the NPG program adopted at the founding congress is changed. It is written in it that the trade union of hired workers must engage in politics during the transitional period. Since last spring, we have eased our political activity because the lads in the local areas have shouted: Enough politics; busy yourselves with the economy! Here is the result: They have quite ceased to consider us. Of course, not all of us have acted correctly. The demands to remove someone from the government or to keep some figure or other in it were wrong. However, if the government sharply changes course, we should intervene. [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] By participating in politics, the miners have often become a toy in somebody else's hands. Is this not annoying? [Sergeyev] It is annoying, it is not annoying.... All is natural: As long as the worker movement is uncoordinated, politicians easily use the ambitions of local leaders for their own purposes. I think that we have now overcome the sickness of growth. It is more complicated to toy with us. [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Do you consider the situation to be an extremely explosive one? [Sergeyev] A spontaneous "creeping" strike is taking place: one mine stops, then another. The transfer of state subsidies to some mines has been stopped although nothing officially has been declared about their closing. The people are scattering. The government is hoping that if it "forces out" people in small doses, there will be no massive explosion. [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Therefore, has the time for a Russia-wide miners' strike passed? Who will risk going on strike if there is massive unemployment? [Sergeyev] Many are already afraid now. Moreover, the regional differences in the miners' situation are too great. They will intensify with the market's development. That is why I think that the time for Russia-wide strikes, if it has not passed, is coming to an end. [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI comment] The leaders of the miners have always called the ability to organize a strike one of the criteria for the trade union's "truth" -- however, not a "managerial" strike with the agreement of the enterprise director. In Sergeyev's opinion, the miners' trade union is acting this way. The NPG has become accustomed to taking pride in the fact that it can "organize" the miners of an entire region and then halt a strike in an organized manner. This is more difficult than starting one. They also can wreck a strike by the competing trade union. [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Are you still capable of influencing the course of strikes? They began spontaneously in January and could not be stopped in an organized manner. [Sergeyev] We really were forced in November to follow events. Workers and their wives came to the miners' leaders in Vorkuta: "We have not been paid for two months -- there is nothing to feed our children with. Either do something or we will destroy the administration." They went on a hunger-strike and called me. We immediately called a council of representatives. They decided to give the government a month. Incidentally, it was very easy at the time to "organize" the Kuzbass also. I immediately ran for deputy to the State Duma from the Prokopyevskiy Territorial Okrug. Speaking on television, I could have called for a strike. I did not do this. However, I spoke with Gaydar by telephone in advance and demanded that he sign the protocol. [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] In September, you criticized "that" trade union for the "inopportuneness" of the strike, saying that it was playing into the opposition's hands. However, they themselves went on strike on the eve of the elections. One democratic newspaper even accused you of engaging in blackmail of the government, implementing a social directive of the anti-reform forces. [Sergeyev] Every day, a mine now stops. This means that we correctly warned the government about the danger. Why does no one want to admit guilt but looks for scapegoats? Does this mean that we already do not need the democrats who were brought to power? Incidentally, Russia's Choice waged a propaganda campaign against me during the election campaign. Everyone played the "miners' card." However, who was thinking about our interests? We were compelled to make the government think about the miners' fate by force. [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] And if it refuses to implement the December protocol? [Sergeyev] We will begin to unleash collective actions. We will possibly even make up a train from Vorkuta and will drive here. We will picket even the Kremlin. There are enough forces. MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI Dossier Aleksandr Sergeyev was born on 5 August 1960 in a suburb of Mezhdurechensk (Kemerovo Oblast). He completed the metallurgical institute in Novokuznetsk in the mining engineer-electrician specialty. After serving in the army, he worked in the Mezhdurechensk mines as a mine foreman, mechanic and electric metal worker. In July 1989 during the miners' strikes, he was elected to the city and oblast worker committees and to the oblast strike committee. Since then, he has been a professional figure in the worker movement. At the All-Union Congress of Miners in November 1990, he was elected deputy chairman of the executive bureau of the USSR Independent Trade Union of Miners which was being founded at the time. He has headed Russia's Independent Trade Union of Miners since November 1991. He is married with an eight-year-old daughter and three-year-old son. He moved his family from Mezhdurechensk to Moscow several months ago although he has worked in the capital for three years. He rents an apartment. Previously he took a great interest in volley ball and playing the guitar. During the last five years he has had no hobby -- "only work."
