Official sources said that during the meeting they exchanged views on issues of common concern in a sincere and candid way and the meeting proceeded in a friendly atmosphere. Stoiber said, China is playing a more and more important role in the world economy and the state of Bavaria intends to enhance its relations with the nation. He told Qiao that he was deeply impressed by China's rapid economic growth and is expected to visit China within this year. China has a huge market, which is of great significance to Germany, and especially to the economic development in Asia and the rest of the world in the next century, he said. The governor also appreciated China's unremitting efforts in seeking peace in the former Yugoslavia. Later this afternoon, Qiao met with Dr. Heinrich von Pierer, chairman of the Siemens company. The company now has more than 20 joint or invested enterprises in China. During German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's visit to China last November, the two countries signed a protocol on the joint construction of the Guangzhou sub-way project and a loan agreement. Qiao said Siemens is a very good cooperative partner of China. The future for cooperation between the two sides is bright. Pierer said Siemens is looking attentively at China's economic reform. "We are full of confidence in China's future," he added.
