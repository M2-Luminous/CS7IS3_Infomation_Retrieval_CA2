It also demanded the resignation of the puppet prime minister and home minister. It said the police intrusion into the universities was a preparation for railroading the treacherous "bill on the Uruguay Round world trade accord" through the "National Assembly" and urged the authorities to declare to the people their will to "renegotiate the Uruguay Round accord." It stressed that the accord must never be "ratified." Hanchongnyon demanded that the puppet authorities immediately release the students who had been taken to the police and compensate for the damages done to the furniture.
