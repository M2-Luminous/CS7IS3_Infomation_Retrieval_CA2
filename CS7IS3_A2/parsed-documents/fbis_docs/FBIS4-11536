Within this reactivation program and at a cost of 70 million cordobas, this morning I inaugurated an important public works project, which is being conducted with assistance from the Central American Economic Integration Bank and with funds from my government, and which is allowing us to restore 57 km of roadway from Nejapa to Istapa and to build 13 bridges. Today, a loan for 145 million cordobas to be used in the cattle sector was signed with the Central American Economic Integration Bank in my presence. It will be used to help our cattle breeders rejuvenate their farms and improve cattle production. We also signed, with the same bank, another loan for 24 million cordobas to be assigned to the program that is to revitalize small- and medium-sized industries. This is a very important project for me because I want to give my support to the women who run those small firms and are very good administrators. Today, in celebrating the fourth anniversary of my inauguration as president of all Nicaraguans, I have come to this palace, which is located in front of our dear Republic Plaza, the ruins of our old cathedral, and in front of Managua Lake, to confirm that progress and production financing must go hand-in-hand with culture, which is one of the main objectives of my government program. Four years ago, I made a commitment to further peace, freedom, and economic and social progress. I also made a commitment to improve the Nicaraguan people's cultural development. In keeping with the goals of our cultural policy, we are celebrating this special day by announcing the initiation of the repair of the National Palace, which from now on will be called the National Palace of Culture. It is a genuine example of our arts and handicrafts, of our history and our struggles, and it is a place where our musicians, poets, painters, and sculptors can express themselves with entire freedom. I am convinced that actions that support culture will make our progress and development comprehensive. The repair of this palace is part of the program to reconstruct the center of Managua. We have managed to restore the ruins of the Grand Hotel and have converted it into the Managua Cultural Center. We are also going to rescue the old cathedral as part of this program. I want to take advantage of this opportunity to show my appreciation for the great help we have received from the government and people of Japan, as well as from the United National Development Program. They have helped us carry out this important program. All of you, my dear Nicaraguans, should help my government in its endeavors to continue to build, strengthen, and work in order that together we can make Nicaragua an example of democracy, peace, and progress for all its children. With the help of God and the efforts of all, we will make this a reality. Thank you.
