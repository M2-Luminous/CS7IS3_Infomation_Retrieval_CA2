The shipbuilders are not satisfied with the quality of design documents, which, according to specialists, can bear no criticism. This is not the sole reason for wrecking the timetable of work on the building stocks, however. According to M. Zhukov, who is responsible for commissioning the ship, the main reason are undersupplies of metal and steel work because "Sevmashpredpriyatiye" [Severodvinsk Engineering Enterprise] does not have money to pay to supplier plants in advance.
