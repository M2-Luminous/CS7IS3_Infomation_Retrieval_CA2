We should encourage peasants to boldly enter the market economy, to simultaneously develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries, and to comprehensively develop primary, secondary, and tertiary industries. We should put increasing peasant income in the first place. Two days ago, Acting Governor Zhang Wule visited some peasant households in Shuiyuan Township, Yongchang County, and asked them about their lives in the period leading to the Spring Festival. On behalf of the provincial party committee and government, he expressed his Lunar New Year greetings to the peasants. In home of a peasant named Wang Jiaoying, Zhang Wule asked him about his income from grain sales last year, his purchase of agricultural production materials, and the township's service for agricultural production, supply, and marketing.
