Prozhivalskiy] [Text]Today, the Ukraine possesses a sufficiently high economic potential. It has well-developed industry, fertile lands, and many mineral resources. Unfortunately, the communications industry in the old centralized economic management system was financed on what was left over. As a result, telephone density in the Ukraine today comprises 16 telephones per 100 inhabitants, which is almost three times lower that the optimal telephone level. We also lag in the numbers of radio broadcasting and television programs which the population of the country needs for transmitting data at great speeds. For the Ukraine to become a state and for its economy to be revived, accelerated development of communications equipment is needed, especially telecommunications equipment. In order to bring the industry up to date and overcome the backwardness which has accumulated for many years, the Ukrainian Communications Ministry has developed a National Communications Development Program to the year 2005. The main goal of the program is to accelerate the development of telecommunications networks, including long-distance and international networks, telex, a packet switching informational network and electronic mail by broadly integrating modern digital transmission and switching systems. Another goal is to meet the rapidly growing needs of the population and government agencies, and to provide the newly forming market economic structures with modern communications services. The program calls for all urban families to have telephones by the year 2005, and 50% of rural families. Within a very short time (5-7 years), the construction of modern long-distance and international communications networks and data transmission networks and the creation of honeycomb mobile communications are planned. In order to implement the program, an enormous amount of work must be done. It is unthinkable that this work can be carried out without focusing the efforts of scientific, industrial, construction and service communications enterprises, without using modern equipment and technologies, and without additional investments, including foreign capital. Historically, the Ukraine found itself in a position in which it did not develop or manufacture digital switching and transmission systems, nor much other telecommunications equipment. As a result of conversion, more than 100 enterprises of the military-industrial complex have been converted to the production of communications equipment in the past two to three years. They were able to arrange the manufacture of small-capacity quasi- electronic and electronic automatic telephone stations, digital transmission systems for local networks, and some other equipment. As far as large-capacity digital transmission and switching systems are concerned, it would require five to seven years and large financial expenditures to develop them, which is hardly justified given the existing situation. In this area we cannot manage without foreign investments and assistance. This will allow us to buy a significant amount of time. Unfortunately, the acquisition of modern communications equipment overseas is complicated by the fact that the Ukrainian national currency is not convertible at the present time. It is impossible to buy this equipment at an exchange rate of one U.S. dollar for every 2,000-3,000 coupons, which has been established by some commercial banks. If you consider that the average wage in the Ukraine at such an exchange rate is only ten dollars, the acquisition of equipment overseas makes communications services prohibitive for the Ukrainian population. With this in mind, we concluded that it was necessary to create joint enterprises for the production of modern equipment in the Ukraine. The equipment produced by the joint venture will be sold on the internal market with partial payment in convertible currency and the national currency. Component parts produced in the Ukraine will be used. The creation of centers for the generation of software and editions of the software will allow the hard currency portion of the cost of these items to be significantly reduced. This alternative allows the need for hard currency to be significantly reduced for equipment payments. This also allows the Ukraine to significantly reduce its production by taking into account a share of the cheaper labor used for the production of equipment in the Ukraine. Of course, according to all economic laws, the manufacture of large lots of equipment causes a reduction in prices, and it will be more expensive to produce small lots of equipment in the Ukraine. However, the inconvertibility of the currency and the high exchange rate of dollars to Ukrainian coupons make the proposals of local industrial enterprises more attractive. However, for joint enterprises to acquire equipment, a certain amount of funds must be in hard currency. The banks (The World Bank and the European Bank), from which we had counted on receiving credits, drag out the provision of these credits and establish many conditions which cannot possible be carried out in one year. Time is flying. The lack of a market infrastructure, including poorly developed communications, prohibits a market economy from developing normally. That is why the Communication Ministry's Concept for Attracting Foreign Investments Necessary for the Implementation of the National Communications Development Program calls for the creation of joint enterprises (operating companies) to develop and provide communications services, in addition to the creation of joint enterprises with Western firms to produce modern communications equipment. This allows results to be seen much more quickly, and development with bank credits to take place during phase two. Based on this concept, the MKM Telekom joint venture for producing EWSD equipment has already been created (the Koroleva Production Association and Siemens in the FRG), as well as the ChRPZ and AT&T joint venture in Chernigov for producing 5 ESS equipment. Preparations are being made at the Odessa Cable Factory to jointly produce fiber-optic cables with the U.S. AT&T firm. While the production of equipment was being organized, specialists from the Communications Ministry were actively searching for Western partners for joint implementation of Ukrainian telecommunications development projects. As a result of this search, three joint operating enterprises were created: - UTEL, a Ukrainian-American-Dutch-German enterprise, founded by the regional communications administrations of the Ukraine together with AT&T, PTT Telecom, and DBP Telecom. By the year 2005, the joint enterprise should modernize and develop 25 regional automatic international telephone stations and participate in the construction of six million local lines. %UMT, a Ukrainian-Dutch-Danish-German enterprise, founded by the regional communications administrations of the Ukraine together with PTT Telecom, Denish PPT, and DBP Telecom. The joint enterprise should create a honeycomb telephone communications network in 21 cities of the Ukraine within seven years. %INFOKOM, a Ukrainian-German enterprise, founded by the ``Kievsvyaz'' Production Association and an informational computer center together with Controlwere, a German firm. The joint enterprise should have already created ``UKRPAK,'' a national packet switching center, in 1993. Since the newly created joint enterprises, as well as the highly profitable ones, will provide a significant portion of low paying services (the majority for the national currency), and since one of the main sources of currency receipts necessary for developing and repaying the currency investments of Western partners is international communications services, these joint enterprises have received the exclusive right to provide such services. This right is also provided to them because free competition does not always justify itself when communications services are thinly spread, and it can cause higher quality services to be provided in the economically developed regions and fully satisfy demand, while low-paying services may not be provided at all in regions with a poorly developed economy, which can destroy the harmonious development of the whole infrastructure of the state. The newly created joint enterprises have already begun to implement specific projects. On 17 November an international telephone station system in the city of Kiev went operational. On 17 February 1993 a new automatic international telephone station came on line in Lvov. In 1992 the first 20 subscribers began to operate on a packet switching network. By using joint ventures and by taking advantage of bartering, the investment of approximately 100 million U.S. dollars in the development of communications in the Ukraine is planned in 1993. Automatic international telephone stations will be modernized in six regions, and a telephone communications network will be brought on line in Kiev. All the areas and regions will receive access to the packet switching network. Despite the economic decline which continued in 1992 in the Ukraine, the communications industry had 30% more revenues than in 1991. The decline in the rate of development of international telephone stations was stopped. Of course, everything cannot be resolved so simply. There are many problems. Sometimes partners do not understand each other. However, if the desire is great on both sides, any problems which occur can be resolved. Unfortunately, some want to get a quick return and do not want to work toward the future. We need to modernize the primary network with fiber-optic communications cables, and we hope to carry out this work by obtaining credits. It is clear that credits can be obtained if the investors are completely convinced of a return on their investment. Therefore, we are working on improving the structure and changing the tariff policy. We are learning to earn money. Values are being reassessed. This reassessment is not always understood by our people, who are used to having social guarantees. However, there is no other way. Ukrainian legislation is creating favorable conditions for foreign investment. In accordance with the law ``On Foreign Investments,'' these investments are not subject to nationalization. Reimbursement of losses is provided for, if governmental organizations act improperly, and the transfer of revenues and profits after payment of taxes and mandatory duties is guaranteed. The law gives enterprises with foreign investments the right to determine prices for their products. The joint enterprises are not taxed for five years, and then a tax is established at 50% less than the existing tax. A portion of the profits which are reinvested in the Ukraine will not be taxed. The creation of joint enterprises and the integration of elements of market relations have revealed inadequacies in the industry's management structure, and at the present time it is being reorganized. The Communications Ministry will not fulfill the function of operating company any longer, nor interfere in the economic and financial activities of the enterprises, but will determine and be responsible for the political and strategic aspects of development, and will accept responsibility for regulating and creating conditions for competition in the industry. Work is being carried out to create a major association on the republic level. This association will be involved in a unified process in telecommunications and will eventually turn into a holding company. Foreign investment, advanced technologies and the operating experience of Western partners under market conditions will shortly permit a qualitative breakthrough in the telecommunications field in the Ukraine. These will also permit the integration of telecommunications into the world-wide network, which will create good conditions for establishing market organizations in the economy and for widely attracting foreign investments to develop the economy in other industries as well. In the final analysis, this will accelerate the process of bringing the Ukraine closer to the advanced countries in the telecommunications field.
