There are various stories about it, and the Belgian police is carrying out an intensive search for a possible murderer. VJESNIK was informed of a series of details in connection with this crime from reliable intelligence sources. It can be concluded that Juka Prazina was the victim of a well-conceived plan made at the Supreme Command Headquarters of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Prazina's murder resulted from the fact that this Muslim -- who distinguished himself as one of the organizers of the defense of Sarajevo during the first days of war in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- did not accept Izetbegovic's fundamentalist politics; moreover he and a group of his soldiers joined the Croatian Defense Council. There were many rumors about Juka Prazina even while he was alive. People know that he had his headquarters on the Jahorina Mountain near Sarajevo during the first days of the war. The name of this mountain was taken by Juka's murderers as the name of the action of his assassination. Cover-up of Crime The murder was carried out by five members of the "Delta" unit. It is a unit for special purposes at the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina Supreme Command Headquarters. The commander of the unit is Mr. Ismet Bajramovic, known as Celo, who personally led the action against Juka Prazina. The money for the logistical support was provided by Bakir Izetbegovic, the son of Alija Izetbegovic, who has been out of Sarajevo for six months already. He often travels between Brussels, Paris, Frankfurt, Baghdad, Teheran and Ankara using Pakistani and Iraqi passports. The "Delta" unit consists of 270 persons, the majority of whom come from Sandzak. They were selected by Mr. Ejup Ganic personally. For some time "Delta" was under the direct command of Mr. Sefer Halilovic, the former commander in chief of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Recently it has been noticed that the "Delta" has been performing its actions together with the "Laste" unit. The latter is the sabotage unit of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Its commander is Mr. Bakir Alispahic, the minister of internal affairs of Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is worth mentioning that some actions of the "Delta" and "Laste" units were performed in cooperation with some sections of the later dissolved 10th Mountain Brigade of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as for example the action in the village of Grbavica, close to Kojic, in which 28 Croats were brutally killed. The commander of this action was the notorious Zulfikar Alispaga, called Zuk. Mustafa Topalovic-Caco, the commander of the 10th Mountain Brigade at that time, also participated in the action. Several months later Caco was killed in one of the internal clashes among members of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina in Sarajevo. This was explained to the public as an action organized by the military and civilian authorities of Bosnia-Herzegovina against war profiteers, but it was established later on that the persons removed were witnesses of the crimes committed in Grbavica. Nine soldiers of the 10th Mountain Brigade who, together with Caco, participated in the massacre of innocent Croats were killed, too. "Logistics Expert" Fled to Khartoum The information that reached VJESNIK from intelligence services claim that the notorious Hasan Cengic is involved in the murder of Juka Prazina. He is the man whose name was mentioned in connection with the scandal that broke out at Maribor Airport after smuggled weapons had been discovered. There is evidence that he fled from Slovenia via Vienna to Khartoum after large quantities of weapons had been revealed. In the government of Bosnia-Herzegovina Hasan Cengic performs the function of head of logistics for the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Many foreign analysts think that he, together with Rusmir Muhmudcehaic, is the man who has the biggest political influence on Alija Izetbegovic, who was long ago his prison companion in Zenica. The "Jahorina" action was already planned in October 1993, and Juka Prazina's travels around Europe were followed by three "Laste" members and three Palestinians, members of the pro-Syrian Al Saqe group. The cooperation between the "Laste" and this Palestinian group dates back to the time when the unsuccessful "Efendija" action, in which Fikret Abdic was to have been murdered, was carried out. VJESNIK wrote about this action in detail, Abdic also spoke about it in an interview given to a Croatian daily. When the commanders of the "Jahorina" action realized that Juka Prazina would stay in Belgium for a longer period of time, Ismet Bajramovic-Celo gave the sign for the final stage of the plan to start. Bakir Izetbegovic and Hasan Cengic, who arrived in Belgium for this purpose with a Pakistani passport, supplied the five members of the "Delta" unit with weapons, rented cars and false documents. Two "Saab" cars and a "Peugeot" were used in the action. According to information that reached VJESNIK from intelligence sources, some of these details are already known to the Belgian police. Hit Lists One of the Al Saqe members who followed Juka Prazina made an appointment with him at a highway car park, after introducing himself as a weapons dealer. The assassins waited for Prazina, who came to the meeting in a "Golf." When he got out of the car, he was shot dead by the assassins. His body was left in a canal close to the highway, and his car was removed to avoid the attention of other drivers and the police. That is why Prazina's body was only discovered by pure coincidence 10 days after the murder. The following day the assassins left for Khartoum via Brussels, Paris, and Cairo. Bakir Izetbegovic returned to Baghdad, and Hasan Cengic flew to Islamabad with a false Pakistani passport. The three members of the "Laste" unit left for Frankfurt the day before the assassination took place, and the Palestinians from the Al Saqe group are probably still in Belgium. Reliable sources claim that the "Jahorina" action is yet another of the actions planned by the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina Supreme Command against those Muslims who do not accept Alija Izetbegovic's politics. According to well-informed sources, a large number of respected Muslim intellectuals who live in Croatia and Europe are on the list of persons to be removed.
