The Nizhegorod Way"] [Text] Lidiya Kostrova is a professional banker. She is married and has a school-age daughter. Since 1990 she has been the chairman of the Board of Radiotekhbank for the city of Nizhniy Novgorod. Vladimir Noskov, our correspondent, interviews her. [Noskov] Lidiya Aleksandrovna, there are almost three dozen commercial banks in operation in Nizhniy Novgorod today. Tell us please, in what way does Radiotekhbank differ from all the rest? [Kostrova] It certainly is different. After all, as far back as its creation in 1990, we set ourselves this task: our bank should engage primarily in extending credit to industrial enterprises. As we know, territorially we are in the Oka region, and it is here that the so-called "defense factories" are located. Just imagine the position these industrial enterprises would be in if it were not for our bank. The point is, the investments in all the enterprises of the defense complex used to come totally from the state treasury. Now their products are of no use to anyone. More precisely, quite a few customers could be found, I am sure of it. But foreign ones. Our state has begun to consume less of the output of the military plants, but they are not permitted to trade in them directly. As a result, the "defense factories" have found themselves in genuine time-trouble. There are quite a few of these plants in Russia today, and they have either totally shut down or are operating on a reduced schedule. There is not a single enterprise in our region which, as it were, has stood or been on the brink of closing, because the enterprise comes to our bank at a time of crisis and obtains preferential credit. [Noskov] If it is not a trade secret, tell us the interest rate at which you give money? [Kostrova] It is not a secret. We issue credit at 30 percent annually. I am sure that not a single bank, not only in our city, but in all of Russia, has a rate like this. Just bear in mind that we offer preferential credit to enterprises and organizations which are the founders of our bank. There are about 200 of them today. [Noskov] Pardon me, but I must ask you: then how does your bank survive? After all, if you give credit at such low interest, this means that the bank has no revenue at all? [Kostrova] On the contrary, our bank is one of the thriving ones in the city. The expert evaluation of the workers in the Central Bank of Russia attests to this. The revenue is not, however, formed only from receiving interest on the credit extended to enterprises and organizations. After all, our bank also engages in other types of activity. For example, it attracts the funds of legal and physical persons into deposits, conducts an accounting service for its customers, transfers money for very short terms, performs legal and economic consultation, etc. And, of course, we render various services to the people of our city. We have also begun to do this through our branches in Kirzhach, Arzamas and Valakhna. [Noskov] Does this mean that your borrowers may be not only enterprises, but also ordinary citizens? [Kostrova] Unfortunately, it is not quite this way. There are, of course, so-called financial persons among our founders. They account for less than five percent of the bank's charter capital, however. The main shareholders, though, are the enterprises of the defense complex, which play a leading role in the economics, not only of the Volga-Vyatsk region, but also on a Russia-wide scale. The conversion measures being carried out by these enterprises and the cutback in state orders make additional investments necessary. These enterprises, having found themselves without the support of the departments and the government, and having worked out unique programs for conversion and business plans, are experiencing a sharp lack of internal funds to carry them out. The main direction, therefore, was and remains extending credit to the conversion programs which, as a rule, require long-term investments. By decision of the bank's board, a so-called credit line was opened for these enterprises. The Nizhegorod Television Plant was the first to make use of this. Having obtained credit from us, it efficiently put money into re-equipping its production facility. In a very short time it began to produce fourth generation color television sets of the Chayka brand, sound recording video players, woodworking machine tools, tea and coffee pots and telephone equipment. The bank makes credit investments calculated to bring a rapid return, not only when fulfilling conversion programs. Last year, for example, we gave loans to other vitally important sectors of the national economy, which are, under the conditions of the radical transformations taking place in the country's economy, experiencing a serious financial crisis. These are enterprises in procuring and processing agricultural products, kolkhozes and the pharmaceutical industry. [Noskov] Under the conditions of the industrial enterprises' lack of money, however, is there not a danger that the bank will not recover the credit issued in the period established? [Kostrova] Unfortunately, this danger is becoming a reality. The production slump in industry increases daily. This situation is very alarming. After all, how could we not sympathize with the industrial workers, when for us the interests of all the bank founders are of paramount importance. They must hope that the bank workers, its specialists, will not permit our other clients to suffer because of the insolvency of one of the borrowers. On the basis of these considerations, and in view of the fact that the process of privatizing securities is being developed, the bank's potentials for ensuring the repayment of the loans are expanding. We have begun to introduce various types of bank credit into our practical work: promissory notes, overdrafts, credit for a current account, etc. [Noskov] What services do you render rank-and-file citizens? [Kostrova] Just like other commercial banks, we are working with the investments of the people. In addition, we are dealers for many investment funds, the shares of which any person may acquire from us, with no problems. Incidentally, before 1 June, vouchers can be exchanged for them at our bank.
