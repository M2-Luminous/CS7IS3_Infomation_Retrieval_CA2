IF Note: Late May the Kazakh parliament voiced a statement on non-confidence in the social-economic and legal policy of the government. The document said that while declaring the course for the market economy, the Cabinet actually blocks it and this has resulted in an economic chaos in Kazakhstan. The Supreme Soviet also believes that until now the government failed to work out a national program for consolidation of the society. Commenting the demarche of the Supreme Soviet in his interview with INTERFAX, head of the Cabinet called the parliament's statement "unconstitutional." He emphasized that in accordance with the Constitution, the government is responsible only in the face of the president. Nazarbayev reported to deputies that in the near term he intends to confirm a renewed program of anti-crisis measures prepared by the government. He said that the country confronts the hardest economic and social crisis. In his opinion, reformation of the credit and bank system is the major direction which will ensure an optimal development of the economy, "stoppage of the running inflation and strengthening of the national currency" is the key task of the present moment. Nazarbayev underlined that inflation should not exceed 10 pct a month in order the state could implement its investment policy. He deems it possible to lower inflation rate this autumn to 9-10 percent under a tough credit policy. According to available information, inflation rate in Kazakhstan this March was 17 percent and in April it raised to 31 percent. Nazarbayev insists to reduce all expenditures of the state "excluding the vitally important ones," to stop direct and indirect donations to the enterprises. He believes that it is necessary to recognize bankrupts the republic's unprofitable enterprises and to speed up privatization process. In his opinion, it is also necessary to release prices for all kinds of goods and services and for bread. "The budget should be tough in implementation," Nazarbayev underlined. Nazarbayev commissioned the government to prepare a special program to stop migration from Kazakhstan due to national reasons. As he said, it is necessary to adopt a new decree on languages and to revise the status of the Russian language (in Kazakhstan it is the language for inter-ethnic association but not the second state language), and to remove drawbacks in the staff policy. As Nazarbayev said, the issue on citizenship is as pressing as before. He thinks that it is necessary to remove all restrictions for citizenship in case of a transfer from one country to another one. At the same time he reiterated that the dual citizenship is unacceptable for Kazakhstan because its introduction can make inter-ethnic relations in Kazakhstan more difficult. Speaking about his idea to create the Euro-Asian Union, Nazarbayev pointed out that he deems it necessary to transform the CIS into a more efficient association -- "from an old form of integration to a qualitatively new union." He indicated that all peoples of CIS countries strive for this but the political elite prevents integration. Nazarbayev believes that the Euro-Asian Union will assist in surmounting the economic crisis and will become the guarantor of outer security for the members of the union against the background of instability on CIS southern boundaries. Nazarbayev specially emphasized that cessation of hostilities between members of the union and creation of common peacekeeping forces are among obligatory conditions providing for entering the Euro-Asian union. Nazarbayev proposed to create a coalition of reforms supporters which will unite all branches of power and public-political movements. Nazarbayev emphasized that it is necessary to create an atmosphere of stability and national and civil accord in order to implement the scheduled reforms.
