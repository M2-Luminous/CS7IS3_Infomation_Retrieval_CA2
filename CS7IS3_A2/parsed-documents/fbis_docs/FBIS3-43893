Although it was expected that the U.S. would shelve the project, the base will be significantly smaller than originally planned. It has been reported that white welders are being recruited in South Africa to assist with the construction of "steel structures" near Gaborone, later identified as oil tanks necessary for the fuel supply to the planned air force base. This information confirms earlier reports that the rail link from Gaborone to the American base, approximately 90 kilometers from the town, will not be built anymore, otherwise the tanks would have been built on the base. It is said that without the rail linkage the military capabilities of the base will only be a quarter of what it would be with rail links. The base is being completed under huge financial pressure. The American defense budget has been drastically cut and will be further reduced. Several U.S. air force bases have been closed and the construction of new bases contravenes the country's fiscal policy. Added to this is the change in the French government's Africa policy. From the expected 1 billion rand cost of the project, the figure now stands at 2 billion rand. The French, whose contribution to the cost of the base would be approximately 700 million rands, chiefly undertaken for a contract to be awarded to the French concern Batignolles -- with Anglo American and LTA as subcontractors -- do not want to pump any more money into the project. French Prime Minister Balladur, in a sensational shift in policy, discontinued all financial assistance to black African states. The cost of the base, at the escalated cost of 2 billion rand, means that there is a significant shortage of funds and were it not for the political importance of such a base, construction plans would have been dropped. The fact that it is still being completed on its drastically reduced budget hints at the American determination to use the project as a political threat against the whites of South Africa. According to reports the original plan was to transfer American troops stationed in Somalia, to the new base in Botswana in April. It is still possible that a small force may fly from Mogadishu to the Botswana base, but in the meanwhile, the political clout of Clinton's opponents, including Ross Perrot, has increased to such an extent that the deployment of any American troops in Africa is a political risk he can do without. It is said that the whites should, therefore, not be intimidated by the American military exhibition but that it should be realistically evaluated. The military threat from Botswana has probably not disappeared, but at least we are aware of the size of the threat.
