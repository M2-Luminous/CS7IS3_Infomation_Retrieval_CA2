Deputy Secretary Yang Zhenjie made an important speech at a provincial meeting on work with nationalities and religions which ended yesterday [5 March]. He said: A political situation of solidarity and stability in areas inhabited by minority nationalities has created fine conditions for stability and development in our province. All the previous provincial party committees and governments attached importance to work with nationalities and religions. Party committees and governments at all levels must carry forward this fine tradition of attaching importance to work with nationalities and religions, put it at the top of their agendas, make constant efforts to investigate and comprehend the situation in these aspects, and solve existing problems in a timely fashion. This should start with units at the grass-roots level. Prefectural and county party committees and governments must truly strengthen the building of party organizations at the town, township, and village level, as should state power organizations as well. They must overcome weakness and laxity. Attaching importance to work with nationalities and religions must become the general practice of the entire party and all of society. Yang Zhenjie continued: It is necessary profoundly and consistently to provide cadres and people of various nationalities with education on Marxist views on nationalities and religions, and with propaganda on socialism and patriotism. In accordance with the party's policy on nationalities and religions, we must handle properly any problems arising among nationalities or religions. We must have a good grasp of the policy, and must make strict differentiations between, and correctly handle the two kinds of contradictions of different natures. It is necessary to truly strengthen management of religious activities, and to bring religious activities into the course of the legal system. It is necessary to continue consolidating and developing the patriotic united front involving both the party, and people in nationality and religious circles. In conclusion, Yang Zhenjie stressed: Accelerating economic development and social progress in areas inhabited by minority nationalities is of vital importance to strengthening nationality solidarity, safeguarding social stability, and promoting the modernization of the entire province. Contradictions and problems arising in these areas, in the final analysis, must be solved through the development of the economy. Our provincial authorities must give more support to these areas in terms of funds and material resources, vigorously develop their cultural and educational undertakings, train more cadres and scientific-technical personnel of minority-nationality origin, and try in every possible way to speed up their economic development. It is necessary to gradually narrow the gaps between different nationalities in terms of development, and to achieve common prosperity for various nationalities. Yang Huaixiao, member of the provincial party committee standing committee and vice governor, aired his specific views on implementing the spirit of the provincial meeting on work with nationalities and religions. Li Ziqi, Zhu Xuanren, and Yang Fuxing were present at yesterday's meeting.
