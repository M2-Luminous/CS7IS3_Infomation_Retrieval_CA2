Canada's minister of foreign affairs, Andre Ouellet, presented the government's policy on China in a speech in Ottawa. He said linking trade and human rights would be counterproductive and unlikely to succeed with such a large nation as China. He says, however, that Canada won't ignore the benefits of increased trade with China. Mr. Ouellet said Canada's prosperity as a small nation depends on trade with China, but he says Canada will press Chinese leaders in private meetings on its human rights behavior. Canada's Prime Minister Jean Chretien met yesterday in Ottawa with (Wu Bangguo), a member of the Chinese Communist Party's Politburo. Mr. Ouellet said meetings such as this will be used to discuss China's human rights performance and democratic reform. Mr. Ouellet's comments followed accusations from Amnesty International. The human rights group said the Canadian Government is neglecting its commitment to human rights. The criticism comes almost five years after the massacre of democracy supporters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Amnesty says the situation in China hasn't improved since then.
