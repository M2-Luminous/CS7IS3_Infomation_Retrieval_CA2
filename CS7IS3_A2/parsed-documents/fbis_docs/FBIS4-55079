FBIS4-55079 "dreeu090_b_94004" FBIS-EEU-94-090 Daily Report 6 May 1994 BULGARIA NSD Threatens To Withdraw Cabinet Support NSD Threatens To Withdraw Cabinet Support AU0905103494 Sofia KONTINENT in Bulgarian 6 May 94 p 2 AU0905103494 Sofia KONTINENT Bulgarian BFN [KONTINENT staff report] [Text] Yesterday the leaders of the ASP [Alternative Social Liberal Party] issued a reminder that the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party] and DPS [Movement for Rights and Freedoms] deputies could not muster 121 votes, the minimum needed for parliament to adopt decisions. ASP Organizational Secretary Vasil Velinov said that if Berov gives in to all the BSP's demands for cabinet changes, he will have to propose them in a half-empty chamber, thus delivering an unmistakable hint that the deputies in the NSD [New Alliance for Democracy] group would simply boycott parliament if Berov were to reach full accord with the Socialists. The ASP leaders have no intention of meeting or holding consultations with the BSP or Berov. According to Velinov, with the DPS they had merely held "free discussions" that produced no concrete results, and that they would have a meeting with the Center for New Policy after the latter's national conference in Veliko Turnovo at the end of the week. The position of the ASP on whether it would support the cabinet and on the forthcoming structural and personnel changes in the cabinet should become known after the meeting of the ASP Political Council next Tuesday [10 May]. Following a further meeting between Berov and the BSP, it became clear that the BSP would find out on Monday how many posts it will obtain in the imminent cabinet shuffle. Berov is to announce the new names in parliament on Wednesday 11 May. Despite having been given a written document explaining the concept behind the cabinet changes, the Socialist leadership is reportedly not satisfied and has established differences in principle with Berov's intentions. At their last meeting with Berov, the BSP leaders reported did not accept the prime minister's idea of converting the power industry and forestry committees into ministries and of merging the tourism and trade departments.
