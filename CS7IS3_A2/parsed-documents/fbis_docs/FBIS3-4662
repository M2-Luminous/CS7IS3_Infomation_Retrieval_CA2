The two countries have agreed the Cairns Group -- the Australian-led group of agricultural trading nations -- will have an important future role in monitoring the commitments given in the Uruguay Round. New Zealand also backed Australia's concern over the approach taken by the United States in its trade dispute with Japan. Camille Funnel spoke to Australian Trade Minister Bob McMullan, who is in Auckland, and asked him about the future of the Cairns Group. [Begin recording] [McMullan] We agreed today that there is a very big role for the Cairns Group. It played a big part in getting the agriculture enhancement through the Uruguay Round that will be so important for Australia over the next few years. We think the two big jobs that we have in front of us at the moment are, one, to make sure that those agreements are actually implemented and, secondly to work in the body that is going to be established next year called the World Trade Organization to make sure that those of us who are involved in fair trade in agriculture -- us, New Zealand, Latin American countries, many of our friends in ASEAN, and others -- that we work together in that group to make sure that it continues as a forum that puts pressure on the unfair trading practices of some of the bigger players in agriculture so that we can build on the good achievements we have made to get a better deal for our farmers in the world market. [Funnell] How can the Cairns Group effectively monitor whether other countries stick to the letter of the Uruguay agreement? I mean, you have no sort of big stick you can wield, have you? [McMullan] Well, the World Trade Organization does give us a mechanism and a body of rules within which agricultural trade should be implemented, and it does give us that capacity to take disputes about whether people are complying with the treaty to that organization through its dispute-settling mechanism. That is why apart from the immediate benefits that will flow to particular industries, the other benefit for Australia of a multilateral agreement on trade is that it sets up a body of rules that can protect the small and medium-size players from what could otherwise be unilateral action by the bigger countries and trading groups, like the European Union and the United States. [Funnell] And what about the future of APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation]? Did you discuss that with your New Zealand counterpart? [McMullan] Yes, we did. APEC is probably the biggest issue for 1994 because of the very important leaders' meeting that is going to be held in Jakarta toward the end of the year. And it is important that it continue its momentum. What we did discuss today was that when people launched the APEC initiative four or five years ago, I think they would not have envisaged it coming as far as it has as quickly as it has. But we need to maintain that momentum and start to get some of those benefits that start to make it easier for business to trade in the region -- the trade facilitation, the things that mean that more economic success and more jobs are generated by activity in the region.
