"After the 5 months in the Lefortovo prison I realized the tragedy which had happened," he stressed in a telephone conversation with an Interfax correspondent. Rutskoy said he was not guided neither by evil nor by revenge. "Evil comes from evil. There was a bloodshed in October 1993 and innocent people perished. If we start clearing up our relations there might be a bloodshed again. We will have to face the danger of total death," he pointed out. Rutskoy announced that he was to complete his 3-volume book within a month (each volume has about 400-500 pages). According to him, he saw that the present leaders make nearly every mistake against which he had warned. He believes there was no reason to let the situation develop into the tragedy. He said he did not try to cover politics in his book since he saw no necessity to settle accounts or to criticize anybody. Rutskoy believes that there must be civilized economic and political relations established in Russia. The rule must be carried out through motivation rather than through commands. Commenting on the reforms, Rutskoy emphasized that they must be based juridically. "All rallies finally lead to fights," he said.
