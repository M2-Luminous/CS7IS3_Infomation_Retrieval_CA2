A major reason is that there were many problems with the old housing system. It is now necessary to quicken the reform of the urban housing system, increase the input to the construction of residential housing, bring about a benign cycle in the circulation of funds for housing construction, accelerate house construction, and raise the housing conditions for the urban residents to a comparatively wealthy level by the year 2000. This will: Help reduce the social burdens borne by the enterprises and institutions and promote the transformation of the enterprise management mechanisms and the establishment of a modern enterprise system. This is also of great significance in promoting the: Development of the real estate and other relevant industries; adjustment of the economic structure; sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy; and in promoting social fairness and checking irregularities in the field of housing distribution. I. Major Progress Has Been Made in Our Country's Housing Reform In 1980, Comrade Deng Xiaoping put forward a general housing reform concept which included the sale of public housing, the adjustment of rents, and measures to encourage individuals to buy and build houses. According to this idea, the reform of the urban housing system in our country has been continuously making progress through explorations and summing up experience in practice. In particular, since the Second National Work Conference on Reform of the Urban Housing System in October 1992, major progress has been made in our country's housing reform, which has advanced from the stage of pilot schemes in a small number of cities and on a small scale to the new stage of comprehensive and across-the-board reforms and the overall climate for housing reform has taken shape. Some large and medium state-owned enterprises took the lead in substantially raising rents; selling public housing at cost price; setting up housing development companies; separating the functions of building, distributing, repairing, and managing houses from the functions of the enterprises; and promoting the the three major reforms in the enterprises and the transformation of the operation mechanisms. At the same time, the system of housing funds has also been adopted widely. At present, the system of housing funds has been adopted by 104 of the 194 cities at and above the prefectural level in the country. The housing financial system has also been developed. The local governments at all levels and the enterprises and institutions have increased their input to housing construction. They attach importance to the development of housing projects which are affordable and functional. The funds for housing construction are raised through a variety of forms and the projects are started using various methods of cooperation. This has quickened the settlement of the people's housing difficulties and has markedly improved the urban residents' living conditions. In 1980, the per capita floor area of living quarters for urban residents was 3.9 square meters; in 1992, this had increased to 7.1 square meters. Most cities have offered housing to households which originally had only less than 2 square meters per capita of floor space. II. Basic Framework of New Urban Housing System According to the objective of establishing the socialist market economic structure, the State Council's leading group for housing reform set out a seven-point guideline for reform of the urban housing system and for the new system. 1. Changing the original system, under which the state and employer institutions bore total responsibility for the investment in housing construction, and replacing it with a new system whereby the state, institutions, and individuals jointly make investments according to a reasonable ratio. That is, the state exempts the land use fee for the construction of affordable and functional housing projects, the employer institutions help the employees set up housing funds, and individuals bear the costs of construction. 2. Changing the original system whereby employer institutions are responsible for building, distributing, repairing, and managing residential housing and replacing it with a new system under which specialized institutions perform such functions in society. 3. Changing the system of distributing housing as welfare benefit in kind and replacing such welfare benefit with monetary wages. 4. Establishing an integrated system for the supply of affordable and functional housing to households with ordinary income as part of the social security program and also a system for the supply of commodity houses to households with high incomes. 5. Adopting the housing funds system across the board. 6. Developing the housing financial services, including savings for housing construction, individual housing mortgages, installment payments, and housing insurance. A housing credit system composed of both policy-determined credit and commercial credit arrangements should be established. 7. Establishing a regular market for housing transactions and a market for housing maintenance and management; developing institutions which offer housing management, decoration, and maintenance services; and improving the related administrative and taxation systems. According to the requirement laid down by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee on quickening the urban housing reform and promoting the process of housing commercialization and the development of housing construction, we shall strive to basically establish the new urban housing system in the 1990's. Localities with favorable conditions should take the lead in doing this. III. Basic Conception for Accelerating Housing Reform Although great achievements have been made in the field of housing reform, we still face some prominent problems. In particular, since the second half of 1992, the housing reform has been facing two major difficulties: First, it is hard to further raise the rents. According to the original plan, by the end of the Eighth Five-Year Plan, rents for residential housing will cover the three major costs, namely, the costs of maintenance and management as well as the depreciation charges; by the end of the Ninth Five-Year Plan, rents should reflect the level of the five factors, namely, the maintenance charges, the management charges, the depreciation charges, the investment returns, and the property taxes. However, at present, in the areas where housing reform has been carried out, the average level of rents is only around 0.3 yuan per square meter, even lower than the 1992 maintenance cost of 0.75 yuan per square meter. It will be rather difficult to attain the planned target (the 1992 level of the three factors reached 1.92 yuan per square meter). When considering the action of raising rents, many city governments were facing financial difficulties with the other local governments and the enterprises as well as the inadequate bearing capacity of the residents. This made it hard for them to make the decision. Other factors making it hard to raise rents include the wait-and-see attitude of some local governments which do not have a firm determination to advance the reform. Second, the policy of selling houses at the original standard price has poor adaptability and lacks the dynamic adjustment mechanism for the transition to selling houses at a slight profit. According to the existing housing reform policy, houses may be sold at a standard price or at the market price (the standard price includes the cost of the houses proper, the cost of requisitioning land, and the cost of resettlement). In practice, however, being representative of the state's unified policy, the standard price can hardly be suited to the concrete conditions of various localities. For example, in the northern areas, the walls are thick and there are heating facilities inside the houses. That is, the costs of the houses are higher. However, being constrained by the conditions of economic development, workers' income is not high; on the contrary, the walls of the houses in the southern areas are thinner and there are no heating facilities, so the costs of the houses are lower but workers' incomes there are not low. If the price is fixed according to the costs of the houses, it is hard to sell the houses in cities where the house costs are high but workers' income is low. In addition, the conditions in large and medium cities are quite different from those in small cities. According to some surveys, in 1992, the housing standard price in large and medium cities was 900 yuan per square meter. A new two-bedroom apartment unit with a floor space of 56 square meters would be sold at more than 50,000 yuan. This is not affordable to a worker household with average income. However, in some small cities, the house construction costs are lower. Being compared with workers' payment ability, the houses may be sold at a price a little higher than the standard price but because of the policy about the standard price, houses in these localities are still sold at the standard price which even excludes the costs of land requisition and resident resettlement. This is not conducive to the transition to slightly profitable prices. Moreover, the objective of the housing reform is to eventually realize housing commercialization and to form a system of selling houses at slightly profitable prices and at market prices. The standard price is only a transitional form but the standard prices composed of the two factors is static and cannot be gradually replaced with slightly profitable prices along with the development of the economy. According to the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the current conditions of the housing reform, as well as the current financial, enterprise, and macroeconomic situations, and in accordance with the requirements of establishing a new housing system, the State Council's leading group for housing reform set out the basic concept for accelerating the reform of the urban housing system: While simultaneously selling, renting, and building houses, we should focus efforts on selling the existing public housing; increase the intensity of the rental reform; adopt the housing funds system across the board; speed up the construction of affordable and functional houses; formulate backup policies; foster markets; accelerate the process of housing commercialization and socialization; establish a new urban housing system suited to the requirements of the socialist market economy at an early date; and strive to raise the housing conditions of the urban residents to the level of being comparatively well-off by the year 2000. The adoption of such a basic concept mainly gives consideration to the following issues. 1. The housing reform must be quickened. If the housing reform is not advanced, a chain of serious problems may arise. First, if the housing reform is delayed any longer state finances and the enterprises will have to increase the subsidies and the cost of the reform will increase. According to the calculations, raising the rents to the sum of the five factors in 1987 would have required 27 billion yuan in subsidies; in 1990, this increased to 41.6 billion yuan; and in 1992, this sharply increased to 67 billion yuan, increasing by 8 billion yuan each year. [figures as published] Second, if the housing reform is not advanced, the existing public houses will still not be the wealth of the state and the enterprises, but their "burdens." By the end of 1992, there was a total of 2.7 billion square meters of public housing. If its value was 350 yuan per square meter, then the 2 percent losses each year would amount to 18.9 billion yuan. In addition, the state and the enterprises still had to spend 7-8 billion yuan on maintaining and managing these houses. That is to say, the state and the enterprises would lose 25.9 to 26.9 billion yuan a year. Third, in some cities and localities, because the rents could not be raised and the houses could not be sold at the standard price, some institutions made their own policies for selling houses. Although the quantity of houses being sold was not large, more and more localities decided to sell houses. In the course of selling houses, the prices were not regularized and the policies were not unified, thus institutions and localities vied with each other in selling houses at a lower price. This was not conducive to the long-term housing development in the same area, nor to the healthy advances of the housing reform in the whole country. It was also not conducive to the reinforcement and improvement of macroeconomic control. Fourth, if the housing reform is not quickened, it will not be possible to establish the new housing system and this is unfavorable to the expansion of housing construction and the improvement of urban residents' housing conditions. This will seriously affect the fulfillment of the plan to raise the housing conditions of urban residents to the level of being comparatively well-off by the year 2000 and will be unfavorable to the transformation of the enterprise operation mechanism and the establishment of the socialist market economic system. 2. The realistic option for quickening the housing reform is to lay stress on selling the existing public houses and to simultaneously promote sales, rental, and construction. The main means of housing commercialization is to raise rents and to sell houses. However, in the last few years, the cost of housing maintenance and management and the construction costs of new houses have been increasing rapidly. The increase rate of rents could not keep pace with the increase rate of prices and the effects of rent increases were substantially offset by price increases. Moderate rent increases can hardly break through the deadlocked situation in the housing reform. If stress is laid on selling existing public houses this will, first of all, help enliven the housing stock, quicken the recovery of the funds, promote housing construction, and turn the public housing in stock from a "burden" to assets in real terms. If 10 percent of the existing 2.7 billion square meters of public housing was sold at 350 yuan per square meter, 94.5 billion yuan will be recovered. Second, this will help increase the intensity of the rental reform. After part of the existing public houses are sold, rent increases will affect fewer workers and the funds needed for subsidizing rents will decrease. This will be conducive to substantial rent increases. Third, when house sales and rent increases are effected at the same time in a well- coordinated reform, the current deadlocked situation in which "rents cannot be raised and houses cannot be sold" will be changed. If rents cannot be raised, it is certain that nobody will be willing to buy houses and houses will thus not sell well or will have to be sold at lower prices. In the next few years, if the policies for selling houses and raising rents are announced and put into practice at the same time, and if the ratio of prices to rents is properly adjusted every year to make workers feel that it is more worthwhile to buy houses sooner rather than later, then house sales will become the breakthrough point of the housing reform and will push rents to a higher level. Thus, a favorable cycle in which sales promote rent increases and vice versa, will take shape. As the state built and distributed houses in a unified way, and the monetary wages for workers' housing consumption were deducted from the total wage expenditure and replaced with the distribution of real houses to workers, the public housing in stock cannot be generally regarded as state assets. If prices are fixed reasonably, and if there are strict rules for secondary housing transactions, then the state asset erosion problem will not exist. Fifth, at present, urban residents have a strong sense of property rights and also have better financial conditions, so the sales of public housing will be suited to their wish to purchase and own their own property. 3. In order to promote regularized housing sales in various localities, it is necessary to readjust the policies for house sales. At present, most localities do not sell houses at the standard price specified by the housing reform policy, and the prices are generally too low. To solve the problems in the original house sales policy, the new policy should be formulated according to workers' wage levels so that prices may be fixed according to their financial capacity and can be adjusted according to the differences in the level of economic development in all parts of the country. The lowest price for house sales should be fixed each year and favorable unified policies should be formulated, thus preventing some localities from selling public housing at unreasonably low prices. It is necessary to establish the dynamic adjustment mechanism for the gradual transition from the standard price to the slightly profitable prices along with economic development, thus encouraging workers to buy houses earlier. In order to give expression to policy continuity, the term "standard price" in the original housing reform policy should be kept but the content of this term should be adjusted. The new standard price should be composed of the burden price [fu dan jia 6298 2137 0116] and the transaction price [di jiao jia 2107 0074 0116]. The burden price is determined by the average annual wage income of a working couple in a city or an area and the transaction price is determined by the amount of housing funds and subsidies in the institution. The standard price should be gradually replaced with a slightly profitable price and there are two adjustment mechanisms: First, with the increases in workers' wage income, the burden price determined by the average annual wage income of a working couple should be raised accordingly; and second, the ratio of the burden price of a new house to the average annual wage income of a working couple should also be gradually enlarged. It is necessary to unify the rules and policies for the discounts in house sales. This should include the discount determined by the purchaser's working seniority and the discount for lump-sum payment. The working- seniority-determined discount should be based on the number of years in which the house-purchasing worker did not enjoy the housing fund in the past and this is, in fact, a compensation for the short payment of monetary wages for housing in the past. The discount for lump-sum payment is a compensation for the interest losses of the house purchaser and this may encourage workers to effect lump-sum payment when buying houses. 4. Properly carrying out backup reforms. It is now necessary to coordinate the formulation and simultaneous adoption of the systems for selling public housing, raising rents, and setting up housing funds across the board, as well as the systems for arranging individual mortgages and installment payments. The policies for developing and regularizing the markets for housing transactions and for housing maintenance and management, as well as the relevant tax policies, should also be properly formulated and implemented at the same time. None of these things is dispensable. Only thus can urban residents have the motivation and the financial capacity for buying houses and only thus can their misgivings be removed in the course of purchasing houses. The rental reform is always an important part of the reform of the housing system. The goal is to raise rents to the level equivalent to the sum of the maintenance charges, the management charges, and the depreciation charges by the end of the Eighth Five- Year Plan and further raise rents to the level equivalent to the sum of the five factors, namely, the maintenance charges, the management charges, the depreciation charges, the investment returns, and the property taxes. In cities and areas where it is indeed difficult to achieve this target, the proportion of rental expenditure in the overall household expenditure should still be raised to a certain level. A reasonable ratio between the prices and the rents should be fixed in the rental reform. In international practice, the reasonable ratio is about 1:90. That is, the sale price of each square meter of floor space should be 90 times the monthly rent of the same floor space. At present, it is difficult to reach this ratio on the whole. However, rationalizing the ratio between the sale price and the rent should be a goal for transforming the housing mechanism. While formulating their annual housing reform schemes, various localities should give consideration to this point and strive to gradually achieve the goal. The localities with more favorable conditions should achieve this goal as soon as possible. Various localities should announce their rental reform programs before the year 2000. The number and margin of rental increases should be linked to the transition from the standard price to the slightly profitable price. In cities and areas with favorable conditions, the sum of the rents paid by workers themselves, the housing subsidies to workers, and the part of rents covered by the housing funds should gradually become closer to, or equal to, the rental level determined by the reasonable ratio between the sale price and the rent. The housing fund system is favorable to the accumulation, turnover, and circulation of the funds for housing construction. It is also favorable to the transformation of the enterprise operation mechanism. The distribution of housing as a welfare benefit in kind can thus be changed into the distribution of monetary wages. All administrative institutions and enterprises should make regular contributions to the housing funds and establish the housing fund system according to the principle of "individual savings, institutional subsidies, unified management, and use for the purpose earmarked." At present, workers who have bought or will buy houses, generally have certain misgivings in their minds. They fear that after buying houses, nobody will take care of house maintenance. To solve this problem, we must reform the current urban housing management system and develop enterprises which offer housing maintenance and management services under various systems of ownership. Fair competition on an equal footing should be encouraged among them and more conveniences should be given to the residents. Various localities should actively explore ways to establish the market for housing maintenance and management and the market for housing transactions. The relevant policies and regulations should be improved as soon as possible and the housing market brought into the legal system. 5. The reform of the housing system should be closely linked with housing development. The purpose of the housing reform is to provide a good mechanism for housing development. It is necessary to build up regular fundraising channels for housing construction, expand the financial sources for housing construction, increase the accumulation of housing funds, and to gradually bring about a favorable cycle for the input and output of housing funds. It is necessary to attach importance to the construction of affordable and functional housing and strive to lower the costs of house construction so that the housing needs of workers with ordinary incomes can be met more quickly. Favorable policies in the fields of arranging construction land, resettlement, planning, project arrangements, and taxation should be given to the institutions which construct affordable and functional houses for ordinary workers. The banking institutions should also give them financial support. The funds raised and concentrated in the course of the housing reform should mainly be used to build affordable and functional houses and the real estate development companies should be responsible for building 20 percent of these. It is necessary to continue to develop the system of cooperative housing construction through pooling funds in order to provide houses for people still living in difficult or even dangerous conditions more quickly. IV. Issues That Should Be Noticed At Present in the Course of Quickening Housing Reform To quicken the housing reform, it is necessary to exercise more effective leadership over the work of housing reform, to intensify propaganda related to the reform of the housing system, to persistently carry out the principle of making separate decisions according to the local conditions under the guidance of the unified policies, and to properly arrange reductions and exemptions for retired workers and workers with low income. At present, it is particularly necessary to pay attention to the following two issues: First, the sales of houses at low prices must be resolutely checked. Selling public housing is a major measure in quickening housing reform. However, at present, some local administrative organs, institutions, and enterprises are selling public housing at too low prices in violation of the State Council's relevant policies. Therefore, the State Council General Office issued the "Circular on Checking Sales of Public Housing At Low Prices." The circulart demanded that all localities and departments suspend the sale of all public housing before the promulgation and enforcement of the State Council's "Decision on Quickening Reform of Urban Public Housing"; screen all public housing which has been sold; and effectively and strictly manage the funds from the sale of public housing. Selling public housing at low prices is a short-term action which only serves the immediate interests and does not consider the long-term development. This is unfavorable to the efforts to provide houses for people who are still living in difficult and uneasy conditions and may give rise to new unfairness in social distribution. This is also unfavorable to the healthy development of housing reform and must be resolutely checked. After the promulgation of the State Council's "Decision on Quickening Reform of Urban Public Housing," all localities must strictly carry out the State Council's unified policies, substantially raise rents, and arrange the sale of public housing in a well planned and orderly manner on the basis of setting up the housing funds. They should also conscientiously carry out reforms in other fields, overcome short-sighted behavior and the welfare viewpoint in the course of the housing reform, and prevent themselves from making unrealistic comparisons and handling the housing reform as a welfare measure. The actions of selling houses at low prices in a short time, selling houses in violation of the relevant policies by increasing favorable terms in a disguised form, and using official powers and functions to seek private gains must be resolutely checked. Second, the reform of the urban housing system should be focused on housing reform in the enterprises. All localities should select a number of large and medium state-owned enterprises with favorable conditions to take the lead to increase the intensity of housing reform and raise the rents substantially, thus promoting the sale of houses. This should be linked with the transformation of the enterprises operation mechanism and the three reforms in the enterprises. Houses should no longer be managed by the enterprises but by specialized institutions in society. A number of enterprises may jointly set up property management companies under the joint- stock system, or in other forms, to quicken the process of separating the functions of constructing, distributing, managing, and maintaining houses from the enterprises. The reform of the urban housing system is an important issue which concerns all households and the masses are most interested in it. Therefore, it must be successful and must not fail. It is hoped that people in all social circles will understand, participate in, and support the housing reform and will make joint efforts to successfully fulfill this important and arduous reform task.
