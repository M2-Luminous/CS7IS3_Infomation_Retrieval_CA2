Filkus said that currency devaluation was a matter for the Slovak National Bank alone, and that the government should not interfere. The second step is the restrictive measures in the social sphere, upon which the International Monetary Fund (IMF) makes conditional the provision of credit. Filkus spoke about the need to show to the outside world that the new government's actions would introduce political and economic stability. Until then it is possible to consider new discussions with the IMF with the aim of moderating the impact of the restrictions on the general population. The third step is to begin discussions about the revision of the general tripartite agreement, and to look for ways to augment state income. The notorious 50 billion koruna (about $1.7 billion) state debt requires enormous interest payments which worsen the budget deficit still further. Filkus said he saw income reserves mainly in the control of taxes and tariffs, adding that he did not yet have the necessary "prescription." He also mentioned the hitherto ineffective import surcharge, which although having "cleansed the market for Slovak producers" had not succeeded in saturating the market with local products.
