The case involves a building the Civil Administration plans to renovate and open to the public as an archaeological site. Knesset Member Hanan Porat, one of the initiators behind the motion, says the prime minister has told his aides that he does not want the yeshiva to remain on that site under autonomy. Members of the improvised Jericho yeshiva have decided to guard the place in shifts in a bid to prevent eviction by the Army. This was reported by our correspondent Ron Nesi'el.
