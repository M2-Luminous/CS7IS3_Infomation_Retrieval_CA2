Experts from the Office for the Protection of the Constitution are proceeding on this assumption after analyzing the bomb attack on the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] district office in Duesseldorf on 5 June and the letter claiming responsibility for it. Among the accomplices of the circle of the RAF auxiliary troop are reportedly people who reported on the territory around the Duesseldorf house of Trust Agency chief Detlev Karsten Rohwedder, who was murdered in 1991. The security authorities are convinced that there is an international aspect to the attack on the CDU office: The "militant leftist autonomous group" (that is, according to the letter claiming responsibility for the attack) apparently wanted to demonstrate to foreign groups that someone is putting up resistance to an imperialist policy in the Third World. According to the analysis, the CDU, as a government party, will continue to be threatened by attacks on a "decentralist basis."
