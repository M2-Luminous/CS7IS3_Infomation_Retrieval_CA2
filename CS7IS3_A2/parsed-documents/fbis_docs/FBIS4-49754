The main situation in our province's procuratorial work in 1993 was as follows: I. Resolutely Implementing the CPC Central Committee's Decision on the Struggle Against Corruption; Concentrating Efforts and Using Legal Weapons To Crack Down on Economic Crimes Such as Corruption and Bribery In 1993, the procuratorial organs at various levels in our province continued to view cracking down on economic crimes such as corruption and bribery as a key task. Particularly after the second plenary session of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, procuratorial organs immediately took action to resolutely implement the CPC Central Committee's arrangements and Comrade Jiang Zemin's instructions on "concentrating strength to crack down on a number of big and serious cases" and "striving for marked results in phases in the near future." Under the unified leadership of the provincial party committee and the party committees at various levels, procuratorial organs acted vigorously and speedily, organized efforts carefully, increased the weight of the struggle against corruption and bribery, and concentrated their strength to severely crack down on cases, especially big and serious cases. Last year, they received reports on 2,804 cases of economic crimes and opened files to investigate 1,384 of these. Of the cases for which files were opened for investigation, 584 were corruption cases, 43.32 percent of the total; 127 were bribery cases, 9.42 percent; 306 cases involved embezzlement of public funds, 22.7 percent; 111 cases involved counterfeit trademarks, 8.23 percent; and 181 cases involved tax evasion, refusal to pay tax, and tax fraud, 13.43 percent of the total. There were 749 big and serious cases involving more than 10,000 yuan or cadres at or above county and department levels, accounting for 55.6 percent of the cases for which files were opened. The proportion of big and serious cases increased by 23.3 percentage points over 1992. At present, the organs have: Finished handling 1,285 cases involving 1,524 persons; brought 551 cases to court involving 657 persons; and waived prosecutions in 496 cases involving 581 persons. They retrieved economic losses of 39.07 million yuan for the state and collectives, a 41.8 percent increase over 1992. 1. Seriously learning from a series of instructions given by the central leadership and the provincial party committee and continuously deepening understanding of the important and profound meaning of the struggle against corruption. After the central leadership issued the instruction on strengthening the struggle against corruption, the provincial procuratorate held a telephone conference and a meeting of heads of subprocuratorates, prefecture procuratorates, and city procuratorates, to relay the instruction and make arrangements. The procuratorate also organized procuratorial police, especially leading cadres, in carefully and seriously learning from the important speech by Comrade Jiang Zemin and the spirit of the second plenary session of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, as well as the relevant instruction by the provincial party committee, to thoroughly understand the important and profound meaning of the struggle against corruption and the guiding thought in the anticorruption drive. Efforts were made to sum up assessments of the work in combating corruption and bribery during the past several years and to sort out and tackle some ambiguous understandings and the passivity, complaints, and fears about the difficulties which once existed among a small number of cadres and policemen. The broad masses of procuratorial policemen in the whole province joined the struggle against corruption with a strong will, staunch determination, great enthusiasm, and a vigorous fighting spirit. The work in combating corruption and bribery continuously developed in depth and in the correct direction. 2. Upholding the mass line, strengthening the work in receiving reports and complaints, and relying on and mobilizing the masses in thoroughly launching the struggle against corruption and bribery. The work of receiving reports and complaints is a good style through which procuratorial organs can follow the mass line and, on the other hand, it is a main channel through which procuratorial organs open files to handle cases. In August, the provincial procuratorate convened a meeting on the work of receiving reports and complaints by procuratorial organs throughout the province and adopted six measures, including: Extensively publicizing the work of receiving reports and complaints; once again publicizing the phone numbers and addresses to which reports can be made; increasing the days and times for procurators to meet the masses; promptly informing the people the state and results of investigations into their complaints; and strengthening the work of investigating, supervising, and keeping confidential the clues provided by reports. These measures aroused the enthusiasm of the masses to make reports and a good trend emerged wherein the reports made by the masses rapidly increased month by and quarter after quarter. According to statistics, in the whole of 1993, 3,248 tip-offs regarding economic crimes such as corruption and bribery were received from the masses making reports. Of these tip-offs, 2,294 were received during the period August to December, an increase of 240 percent over the previous seven months during which 954 were received. The quality of the tip-offs, and the rate of the tip-offs being established as cases, also improved dramatically. Of the cases of economic crimes such as corruption and bribery for which files were opened for investigation by the procuratorial organs, 53 percent were based on tip-offs reported by the masses and many of them were big and serious cases. In order to encourage, support, and protect the enthusiasm of the masses for reporting lawbreaking and criminal activities, the procuratorial organs resolutely honored the policy of awarding the persons who had merit in making the reports and resolutely handled and investigated cases of reprisal against persons maing the reports to ensure a healthy and smooth development of reporting work. 3. Concentrating strength in handling big and serious cases and pinpointing key areas. Following the central leadership's instruction that the struggle against corruption should pinpoint leading party and government departments, judicial departments, administrative and law enforcement departments, and economic management departments, and that strength must be concentrated to investigate into a number of big and serious cases, all procuratorial organs made careful arrangements, vigorously launching the work of investigating cases and adopting the following measures: First, they sorted out big and serious cases for investigation. In the second half of last year, efforts were made on two occasions to sort out and investigate tip-offs to cases throughout the whole province. After the big and serious cases had been identified, they were studied one by one and forces were organized to crack the cases batch by batch and phase by phase. Second, when investigating big and serious cases, the responsibility system for handling cases, namely the "four fix's and one guarantee," was practiced as follows: "Fix the leadership, fix the personnel, fix the plan, and fix the period, as well as guarantee the funds for handling the cases." Third, chief procurators personally took command and directly participated in investigations into the big and serious cases which had great impact, caused great harm, and involved interference and a great degree of difficulty. Fourth, establishing a system for supervising the handling of cases, a system for urging the swift handling of cases, and a system for reporting cases to the senior levels for the records, therefore the senior departments could always monitor the situation and the progress of handling big and serious cases. Fifth, strengthening cooperation and coordination between public security departments, law courts, discipline inspection commissions, and supervisory organs. Sixth, in light of the situation whereby in recent years there has been an increasing number of economic criminals committing crimes inside and outside the province and then fleeing with the money, the provincial procuratorate strengthened unified command and coordination work toward big and serious cases. By adopting these measures, they effectively increased the strength of the work of handling and investigating big and serious cases and improved their efficiency when handling such cases. Last year, the procuratorial organs opened investigation files on 737 big cases of economic crimes such as corruption and bribery each of which involved over 10,000 yuan. Of this total, 75 cases involved between 100,000 and 500,000 yuan, 11 cases involved between 500,000 and 1 million yuan, and 13 cases involved over 1 million yuan. In the second half of last year, procuratorial organs opened investigation files for 825 cases, an increase of 57.7 percent over the 523 cases in the first half of last year. Of these cases: Some 410 involved personnel in leading party and government departments, judicial organs, administrative and law enforcement organs, and economic management departments, accounting for 30.41 percent of the total number of files opened; Shu Kaitai, a former deputy head of the provincial personnel department, received bribes of more than 200,000 yuan; He Zizhong, a former chairman of the Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] Committee, took opportunities arising from his office when he served as vice prefecture governor, to embezzle more than 2 million yuan; Cao Wei, a former deputy chief of a certain section in the Yunnan Bureau of State Administration of Exchange Control, took bribes of more than 4 million yuan, collaborating with another three persons; Ren Shujun, head of the labor management office of the provincial labor department, and Kou Wei, a cadre in the office, abused power and breached rules in performing formalities for the transfer of personnel, in return for bribes of more than 100,000 yuan; and Wu Hancheng, deputy commander of the traffic brigade of Wanding City Public Security Bureau, took bribes of more than 90,000 yuan when he ran a car business in the name of the traffic brigade, and so on. When they made efforts to investigate into cases of corruption and bribery, the procuratorial organs at various levels also investigated a number of serious and extraordinarily large cases of counterfeit trademarks, tax evasion, refusal to pay tax, and tax fraud. Last year, the procuratorial organs opened investigation files on a total of 83 serious cases of counterfeit tobacco which claimed to be Yunnan's famous and quality tobacco, as well as counterfeit and poor-quality wines, foodstuffs, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers, an 84.4 percent increase over the previous year. A total of 181 cases of tax evasion, refusal to pay tax, and tax fraud were looked into and handled, up 45.5 percent. For example, Kunming City Wuhua District Procuratorate investigated a case in which He Yuanbao, general manager of Yunnan office of Hainan International Joint Investment Company Limited, collaborated with his men in carrying out criminal activities involving counterfeit "Red Pagoda Hill" tobacco. The case involved some 8 million yuan and He and his men reaped undue profits amounting to 2 million yuan. The procuratorates in the counties and cities such as Kaiyuan, Chenggong, Shuifu, and Ximeng also uncovered four very serious cases in which tricks were used to cheat the state into reimbursisg tax. Each of these cases involved over 10 million yuan. Through investigating and handling these cases, the procuratorial organs dealt a severe blow to the criminal elements who had committed serious crimes, safeguarded the market economy order and tax collection work, and protected the interests of the state and the people. 4. Strictly enforcing the law, correctly implementing laws and policies, and earnestly ensuring the quality of handling cases. Under the circumstances whereby reform was being deepened, opening up was being expanded, and the old system was changing into a new system, investigations into and handling of economic crimes faced many new conditions and new problems. Not only were the conditions of criminal activities very complicated but there were also some problems for which the laws did not have specific written prescriptions or which the policies did not allow us to distinguish and grasp. Therefore, the procuratorial organs at various levels attached greater importance to the principle that: "First, act resolutely, and second, act prudently, exhausting every effort to be accurate," a principle which they voluntarily upheld. When handling specific cases, they paid attention to thorough investigation and research, clarified facts and circumstances, strictly fixed the boundary between what was a crime and what was not according to the relevant law, and correctly determined the nature of the crime and defined it. To ensure the quality of handling cases, procuratorial organs upheld the policy of division of labor and dividing levels when handling big and serious cases; separated investigation, arrest, and prosecution, and strengthened internal restraint; and let the procuratorial commission discuss and decide collectively every big and serious case. When a case could not be determined immediately, it was not handled hastily; effective systems and measures, such as requesting for instructions and making reports, were strengthened so that the best efforts were made to handle every case properly and solidly and to avoid mistakes, overlooking, miscarriages of justice, and letting criminals go. Attention was also paid to grasping the strategy of struggle and embodying the policy of lenience and strictness. At the same time, in work, the principle of the "three conducive's" was seriously implemented. Attention was paid to the political and economic effects of handling cases but even more was paid to the social effects of handling cases, so that procuratorial work could better serve economic construction. Although the work in handling cases last year was arduous, the time was pressing, and the degree of difficulty was great, in general, the quality of handling cases was good and no big errors or mistakes were discovered. Regarding the cases for which erroneous verdicts were given during the previous several years, once they were discovered, a serious and solemn attitude was adopted and the principle of "correcting every error" was upheld, to correct them according to law and in the manner of seeking truth from facts. Judged overall, an absolute majority of the personnel in our party and state organs are honest, law-abiding, diligent, and serve the people. However, a small handful of seriously corrupt elements do indeed exist and we cannot underestimate their potential for harm. We must soberly realize that the struggle against corruption and degeneration is a long-term and arduous duty, which penetrates the whole process of the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics. We think that we must not overestimate the recent achievements in the struggle against corruption and bribery, that we must not be complacent with the initial results we have scored, and that we must resolutely, tenaciously, thoroughly, and persistently carry out the struggle against corruption and bribery. II. Severely Crack Down on Serious Criminal Activities, Safeguard Social Stability and State Security Last year, provincial procuratorial organs received requests from public security organs and state security organs for the arrest of 30,297 persons and, after examination, they granted approvals to arrest 26,758 people. They also handled 30,874 persons who were transferred to the procuratorial organs for proceedings to be initiated, as well as 608 people requesting proceedings waivers. After examination, they initiated proceedings against 25,518 persons and waived proceedings for 1,399 people. Responding to the conditions and features of criminal activities in our province, we mainly grasped the following tasks: 1. Emphasizing key areas and according to law, we severely, swiftly, and harshly cracked down on the criminal activities which caused serious harm. The spearhead of the struggle was always aimed at murderers, robbers, rapists, offenders employing explosives, armed criminals, gangs, and crimes by triad societies. Last year, approval was granted to arrest 14,304 of the abovementioned criminals and proceedings were initiated against 13,649 of them, accounting for 53.46 percent of the criminals for whom arrest approvals were granted and 51.01 percent of the total number of persons against whom proceedings were initiated. Concerning the extraordinarily big cases, the measures such as intervening ahead of schedule, giving priority in handling, and making arrests and initiating proceedings swiftly, were adopted to strengthen the weight of handling cases, improve the efficiency in handling, and give full play to the might of legal weapons, dealing a severe blow to the arrogance of the serious criminals. 2. Resolutely and continuosly cracking down on drug-related crimes. Drug-related crime has always been an acute area for criminal activities in our province. Last year, the procuratorial organs granted approval for the arrest of 3,209 drug-related criminals, initiating proceedings against 3,271 of them. At the same time, they organized forces to actively participate two provincewide "26 June" and "26 October" campaigns to severely punish drug-related crime, burn drugs, and extensively publicize the relevant regulations, cracking down on a large number of drug- related criminals. 3. Resolutely cracking down on criminal activities by hostile elements which jeopardize the country's security. The procuratorial organs received requests from the state security organs to arrest counterrevolutionary criminals such as special agents and spies, handling some of those criminals who were handed over for the purpose of initiating proceedings; after carefully examining the cases, they granted approval to arrest and prosecute 22 persons, promptly and in accordance with the law. They strengthened the work of examining requests to arrest people and to prosecute people involved in foreign-related criminal cases, effectively safeguarding the country's security and stability along the border. 4. Actively participating in various special struggles, special rectifications, and working to combat disorder in key districts. Under the unified leadership of local party committees and governments, procuratorial organs at various levels actively participated in the national, provincial, and regional campaigns such as "one cracking down and two banning's," (cracking down on abduction and the selling of women and children, banning prostitution, and banning drugs), the antitheft struggle, the struggle against smuggling, and the encroachment of hooligans who rob passengers, thus forcefully cracking down on criminal activities which seriously undermine law and order. They actively participated in handling emergency incidents and in combating disorder in the districts which had chaotic law and order, thus safeguarding social stability. Integrating the handling of cases with various other procuratorial duties, procuratorial organs at various levels seriously implemented the "Yunnan Province Regulations on Comprehensive Management of Public Order." According to the principles of combining cracking down and prevention, and of tackling both the symptom and the cause, they actively took part in the comprehensive management of public order and, through lauching extensive and thorough mass education to publicize the legal system, they actively launched "procuratorial suggestion" activities. They visited those who had proceedings waived and supervised and examined the situation of prisoners serving their terms outside prison. They seriously and promptly handled the "emergency" letters and visits by the masses, fostering the sense of legal system and lawabiding concepts among the broad masses, especially the young people. They also promptly and correctly handled various kinds of contradictions among the people, reduced the destabilizing factors which could affect social stability, and prevented lawbreaking and criminal activities. Over the past year, by the common efforts of specific organs and the broad masses of people, achievements were made in areas such as punishing crimes and the comprehensive management of public order and stable public order was maintained in our province. However, there are still many problems which affect our province's political and social stability and, in some places, the law and order situation is not good, evil phenomena in the society are still pronounced, and the penetration and destruction by hostile forces outside our borders has never stopped. Furthermore, along with the continuous deepening of the reform and the adjustment of interest relations, new contradictions and problems will emerge. Therefore, we must maintain a sober mind and a high degree of alertness and carefully strike at our enemies, punish crime, safeguard stability, and protect the reform. III. Seriously Perform Procuratorial Duties, Earnestly Strengthen the Supervision of Law Enforcement The building and perfection of socialist market economy system require a sound legal system as a norm and protection. Last year, the procuratorial organs seriously implemented the Supreme People's Procuratorate's instruction on further thoroughly discharging the duty of legal supervision and strengthened the work in supervising law enforcement. 1 Strengthening supervision over investigation. Strictly adhering to the principle of "using fact as the base and law as the criterion," we earnestly examined arrest approvals and prosecutions. Except for crimes which deserved arrest approval and prosecution, and for which approval was resolutely granted according to law and decisions were made to initiate proceedings, last year, decisions were made to refuse approval for the arrest of 2,079 people and to waive prosecution for 203. At the same time, decisions were made to arrest 269 people who should have been arrested but were not arrested and to initiate proceedings against 71 people who should have been prosecuted but were not prosecuted. A total of 94 pieces of opinion about correcting the unlawful behavior during investigative activities was given. The procuratorates at various levels, through measures such as intervening ahead of schedule and monitoring and supervising cases, strengthened their supervision of investigations into serious, extraordinary, and big cases. 2. Strengthening supervision over hearing criminal cases. Through going to law courts to support prosecutions and examining the verdicts and judgments given by the courts, procuratorial organs at various levels supervised the court trials in accordance with the law. Last year, the procuratorial organs raised objections to 125 verdicts and judgments on criminal cases because they considered them definitely to be erroneous. To date, the law courts have corrected the verdicts in 37 cases. A total of 113 pieces of opinion on correction was offered after unlawful behaviors were discovered during trial activities. Regarding the execution of criminals sentenced to death, procuratorial organs carried out on-the-spot supervision. 3. Strengthening discipline supervision. Investigation into and the handling of five kinds of cases were strengthened, namely: Fraudulent practices for personal gain, use of torture to extract confessions, illegal detention, dereliction of duty, and major accidents arising from dereliction of duty. Particular efforts were made to investigate malfeasance and "rights infringements" by judicial personnel, as well as administrative and law enforcement personnel. Last year, the procuratorial organs opened investigation files for 366 discipline cases, of which 300 were of the five kinds of cases, 81.97 percent of the total, effectively safeguarding the dignity of the country's law and the citizens' democratic and personal rights. 4. Strengthening supervision over trials of civil cases and administrative cases. At present,, there are 13 subprocuratorates, prefecture procuratorates, and city procuratorates and 29 county-level procuratorates which have organs overseeing civil cases and administrative complaints and carrying out the training of personnel who go to posts. Last year, the province received 310 civil (economic) cases of complaints about verdicts and judgments given by the courts, as well as complaints about administration. To date, it has been decided that 51 of the cases should be reviewed and work in reviewing 31 cases has already been finished. 5. Strengthening supervision over implementation. Supervision over the conditions for implementing verdicts and sentences in criminal cases, and implementing policy and law in prisons and reform facilities, has always been given top priority. Last year, efforts were made to strengthen supervision over implementation which was not carried out in accordance with the law and that which was unlawful. Procuratorial organs addressed cases of overdue detention involving 710 people, discovered and corrected 599 incidents of lawbreaking conditions during detention and reform activities. At the same time, according to law, they cracked down on reemerging crimes such as recidivists becoming "bosses and bullies prison," to maintain order in the prison and reform facilities. Attention was also paid to protecting, according to law, the rights of those under detention. In addition, in accordacne with the law, they handled 13 cases of corruption, bribery, dereliction of duty, and fraudulent practices for personal gain by 18 prison officers. IV. Strengthen Building a Contingent and Honesty in Procuratorial Organs Over the past year, in order to adapt to the development of the situation and to meet the needs of duty, the procuratorial organs mainly grasped the following tasks in the area of building a contingent: 1. Strengthening ideological and political work to enable the broad masses of policemen to catch up with the situation of developments in the areas of deepening the reform, expanding opening up, and establishing the market economy system and to continuously upgrade awareness and voluntariness for implementing the party's basic line and serving economic construction under the new situation. The broad masses of policemen, during various procuratorial work but especially when investigating big and serious cases, invigorated their spirits, overcame difficulties, enforced the law impartially, fought continuously, and made meaningful contributions to accomplishing the difficult and glorious duties entrusted to procuratorial organs by the party and the state. A large number of advanced figures and collectives emerged. Last year, 34 advanced collectives and 244 advanced personnel were commended by the Supreme People's Procuratorate and the provincial procuratorate. Comrade Yue Congkun, chief of the law and discipline section of Tonghai County Procuratorate, sacrificed himself gloriously when discharging his public duty last August and was granted the title of revolutionary martyr by the provincial people's government. 2. Firmly grasping clean government building for the procuratorial contingent itself. On the basis of organizing policemen to seriously learn from the important instructions on combating corruption issued by the central leadership, the provincial party committee and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the leading cadres of the procuratorates of various levels launched self-inspection and self-correction strictly according to the five regulations on honesty and self-discipline issued by the central leadership. As regards the problems detected during self-inspection, these were handled according to the relevant regulations. The lawbreaking and discipline-violating personnel within the procuratorial contingent were seriously and solemnly handled according to the principle of "running the procuratorates strictly." At the same time, efforts were made to sort out and rectify companies run by the procuratorial organs. The problem of random charges and fines was also seriously tackled. Concerning the unreasonable charges and fines which amounted to 1,033,500 yuan, 944,400 yuan have been refunded and the rest will be refunded. 3. Strengthening building of a leadership group and training cadres. The work to elect procurators for the provincial procuratorate and 11 subprocuratorates and prefecture and city procuratorates, was accomplished smoothly as the terms of office of the old procurators expired. After this round of elections, the average age of those in the leadership group decreased, their educational attainments improved, the structure became more rational, and the newly elected procurators were given on-the-job training by the Supreme People's Procuratorate and the provincial procuratorate. At the same time, responding to the needs of the situation and duty, various styles were adopted to strengthen work in training cadres. As a result, the professional quality and combat ability of the procuratorial police was upgraded. Over the past year, although our province's procuratorial work scored good results and some areas made new breakthroughs and headway, a small number of leading comrades in some units did not have an adequate understanding of the great significance of the anticorruption drive, their emphases were not great enough, and their measures were not adequately effective. Deputies: The year 1994 is a very important and extremely crucial one for deepening the reform and expediting economic development and a series of reform measures has been and will be promulgated. The new situation raises new and higher demands for procuratorial work. The duties of the procuratorial work in our province this year are: Resolutely using Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as guidance; thoroughly implementing the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; upholding the party's basic line and adhering to the political orientation whereby procuratorial work serves economic construction, reform, and opening up; adhering to the ideological line of seeking truth from facts; upholding the principle of "doing two kinds of work simultaneously and with equal firmness"; strengthening procuratorial organs' legal supervision duty; enforcing the law strictly and handling cases diligently; thoroughly launching the struggle against corruption and degeneration; severely cracking down on serious criminal activities; actively taking part in the comprehensive management of public order; enabling our province's procuratorial work to have a new development; and making new contributions to safeguarding social and political stability to ensure a smooth process for the reform, opening up, and modernization construction. In order to do a good job in our province's procuratorial work this year, efforts must be made to grasp three areas: First, it is necessary to closely center on the central task of economic construction and to obey and serve the overall situation of grasping the opportunity, deepening the reform, expanding the opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability; it is necessary to voluntarily place procuratorial work under the guidance of party committees at various levels and under the supervision of people's congresses at various levels; and it is necessary to firmly grasp the procuratorial work's political direction, to enable procuratorial work to always proceed and develop in the correct direction. Second, during work, attention must be paid to grasping "two crackdown's, two constructions, and one strengthening. The "two crackdown's" means we will continue to launch an in-depth struggle against corruption and bribery, pinpoint key departments, firmly grasp big and serious cases, implement the leadership responsibility system at every level, improve standards of investigation, and ensure quality handling of cases. When there is a case which constitutes a crime, no matter who is involved, our investigation will go to the roots and we will never be weak-handed. The cases of framing charges against others must also be handled according to law and the innocent must be protected and not pursued irresponsibly. We will continue to severely and swiftly crack down on serious criminal activities according to law, persistently crack down on drug-related crimes, actively take part in the special campaigns tackling acute problems of law and order, and do a good job in comprehensive management. By "two constructions" we mean, first, with the leadership group as the key point and with building of ideology and work style and building of clean government as the main content, we will grasp self-construction of the procuratorial contingent, strictly run procuratorates, improve the overall quality of the procuratorial contingent, diligently build a procuratorial contingent which is politically strong, professionally capable, and has strict discipline and a tough work style. With strengthening and improving the means of handling cases as well as working conditions as the key point, and under the support and care from governments of various levels and the relevant quarters, we will grasp building of foundations for the procuratorates at various levels, especially the grass-roots procuratorates. By "one strengthening" we mean that: We will earnestly strengthen investigation and research; leaders should take the lead in going deeply into the reality and launch work centered on the party's central task and the key points, difficulties, and weak links of procuratorial work; leaders should carry out investigation and research on the new conditions and new problems arising from the law enforcement activities, to explore new law and deliberate new countermeasures; and that leaders should strictly distinguish between what is a crime and what is not, continuously improving the standard of law enforcement. At the same time, on the basis of investigation and research, and responding to the need of establishing the socialist market economy system, we will actively explore and promote the reform of procuratorial work, proceeding from discharging the duty of legal supervision, strengthening supervisory means, perfecting the supervisory system, enhancing supervisory effects, and further straightening out the relations between the upper and lower levels, as well as internal organizations and setups, so that procuratorial work can better adapt to the new situation of deepening the reform and expediting the development. 3. It is necessary to uphold and strengthen the work principle of enforcing law strictly and handling cases diligently.Enforcing the law strictly is the central link in building the socialist legal system and a must for procuratorial organs when they discharge their duty of legal supervision. Handling cases diligently is the concrete embodiment of enforcing the law strictly. Therefore, we must use this principle to arrange overall procuratorial work. This year, we must make new headway and breakthroughs in three areas, namely, investigating and handling big and serious cases, especially serious cases; strengthening supervision over law enforcement and of solemnly investigating unlawful cases of not enforcing the law strictly; and handling cases such as smuggling, counterfeit trademarks, and tax evasion. To conclude, we must safeguard the overall implementation of the law, ensure quality handling of cases, and handle cases as iron cases. In the new year, the procuratorial organs have very difficult and arduous duties but we are confident and determined that, under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee, the provincial party committee, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate; under the supervision of the provincial people's congress; and with the support of the provincial government and the people of various nationalities, we can further emancipate the minds, invigorate the spirits, honestly discharge our duties, work hard, thoroughly safeguard social and political stability, and make new contributions to expediting the reform, opening up, and economic construction in our province.
