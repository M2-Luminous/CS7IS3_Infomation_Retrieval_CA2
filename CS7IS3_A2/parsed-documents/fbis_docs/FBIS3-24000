To be honest my first thought is God forbid. Loss-making mines in the Donbass, exhausted mines in the Krivoy Rog area, the mighty defense industry in Dnepropetrovsk in need of restructuring. We just won't be able to cope.... [Gonchar] Imagine that a third of the modules are removed from your computer here and you are asked: How are we to get it to work? Simple. You either replace the parts that have been removed with some new components, which is a costly, awkward, and exacting business. Or you put back the old ones. Then you can use the computer. [Kuzmishchev] That is debatable. It transpires that Ukraine produced 18 percent of the former Union's GNP. Some went on reproduction and on intrarepublic deliveries, some to Central Asia, Georgia, and the Baltic. And, no matter how you look at it, Russia's dependency on Ukraine was minimal. But Ukraine experienced maximum dependency on Russia, as the last few years have shown. [Gonchar] Now let us give the people of Tyumen a say from these positions. They say that the whole Russian economy has been shored up and still is being shored up with their petrodollars and gas dollars, and you can wash your hands of and forget the rest. Let them survive on their own. It will end up with neither one thing nor the other. The system can be restructured or, to continue the computer analogy, a new program loaded. But why destroy things? [Kuzmishchev] But political realities must be taken into consideration.... [Gonchar] The former political system turned out to be fiction. If it could collapse because of a conflict between two leaders, it did not exist. I suggest that we evaluate reality. The reality is that borders which were established in an extremely arbitrary manner in the past (everyone was after all convinced that they were a formality) suddenly proved real. So far only economically, but the logic of confrontation is not always the logic of common sense. It dictates its own laws. Border guards carrying assault rifles have already appeared. The absurd thing is that a person's membership of a particular nation is only decided by geographical latitude and longitude.... [Kuzmishchev] You have been able to say things to me a journalist that you cannot say as a politician. Having traveled the entire length and breadth of Left Bank Ukraine I was never able to understand how the thinking, lifestyle, psychology, or, as people are now saying, the mentality of a peasant, a miner, an engineer in those areas differs from the mentality of someone from Tula, Saratov, Omsk, or Minsk, say. There has never been a language barrier. It was harder for me to understand, say, what a coastal dweller from Arkhangelsk was saying than a peasant from Kharkov. According to Dal [19th century Russian ethnographer] a person belongs to the nationality in whose language he thinks. Second, what have the millions of Russians who came from Russia to Ukraine or to Kazakhstan on an institute placement or in response to the authorities' appeal done to hurt us? By political realities I meant the situation today. [Gonchar] The saying that politics is economics in a concentrated form is more appropriate today than ever. Economic integration represents the means of survival for us. There is a cheap work force in Ukraine. Tell me please how we will be able to stem the flow of people from there who are desperate to come to our country to work? They are even willing to take half pay, but what are we to do with our own people? This threatens a social explosion. Now let us take the situation in the Crimea. The recently elected president Yu. Meshkov was the leader of the "Russia" bloc, A fairly eloquent name. Their objective is to leave the economic wreckage of Ukraine and form a single economic area with Russia and other states. Russia now seems to be accommodating that aspiration. But there are many problems here. We do not after all even share borders. Electricity comes from Ukraine as does the water for agricultural irrigation, and so on. The Crimea is greatly indebted to Ukraine. What will happen to Left Bank Ukraine where there are similar pro-Russian sentiments? But no one there is advocating the revival of the Soviet and Socialist Union. It is a question of economic integration. [Kuzmishchev] The chain reaction will hit Kazakhstan next. Whereas the breakup of the Union caused a series of wars in outlying regions, the breakup of Ukraine and Kazakhstan would mean.... [Gonchar] There are plenty of politicians in Ukraine and our country who would not be averse to playing that card. Both in order to remain in big-league politics and in order to reach new heights. Suppose someone in Ukraine wanted to postpone parliamentary and presidential elections. Is the possible deterioration of the situation in the Crimea not an excuse for those politicians? And aren't our radicals even better? [Kuzmishchev] But doesn't integration involve a partial loss of sovereignty for states with a weaker economy? [Gonchar] Sovereignty is not the aim, but the means of attaining contemporary civilization and a high standard of living. People in Ukraine were convinced that autonomy is the way to success. Now the result is clear. No one on the long-established Western market is waiting for us or for them. Look how quick they were to reach agreement with us and drive down prices of aluminum and oil. We thought that we would inundate the West with these goods and take off like the Arab Emirates did in the past. That is not the case. Besides, it is offensive if you have high technologies to place the emphasis on raw materials when all countries are trying to sell finished output. But for the time being we are prepared to trade finished output mainly among ourselves.... [Kuzmishchev] But how specifically are the first steps to be taken? How long has there been talk of creating a ruble zone at the highest level and it has all been to no avail.... [Gonchar] The key issue here is the number of money supply centers. Needless to say, Russia will never agree to there being several points deciding the money supply. There must only be one of these points. Europe has already reached that conclusion -- a currency institution has been set up there and it will have a single currency. Why are our politicians opposing proposals dictated by life itself? Remember the advertisement that begins with the words: "Ladies and Gentlemen, you have 30 seconds to think about it...." There are no deals that are any easier or granders han those involved in playing with exchange rate differences and brokering currency transfers. This is a colossal network and can produce billions out of thin air. On the one hand, these billions affect prime cost and thus bring soaring prices and inflation, on the other, they require political protection and lobbying for their interests. I therefore propose that, if the politicians do not reach agreement, let the peoples reach agreement. The politicians must be presented with the fait accompli of the peoples having reached agreement. Let us hold a referendum. With one sole question: Is it necessary to create a single economic area? [Kuzmishchev] The population of Ukraine will probably vote "for," but Russia is another matter. What a hullabaloo there has been over the creation of a single monetary system with Belarus. But here, after all, the scale is far greater. And the political forces of those opposed are far more aggressive. It will be enough for someone in Russia say that this will whip up inflation, and then.... [Gonchar] If you so desire, shortcomings can be found, exaggerated, and dreamed up in any plan, any idea. Let us first grasp what is meant by "unification" [obyedineniye] or the creation of a "single economic area," the specific steps involved. There are of course plenty of people in our country, in Ukraine, and in Kazakhstan whose political career is based on the policy of separation [razyedininiye]. Many people are only interested in nationalist hysteria so that they can come to power. Some individuals have already succeeded, but the parade of sovereignty indisputably had adverse consequences for most of the population. At the same time we have enough sober politicians who are capable of telling people that economic integration by no means signifies that Russia will include Ukraine in its budget and exchange rubles for coupons on a 1:1 basis. [Kuzmishchev] What does it mean then? [Gonchar] Primarily that the economic and legal barriers should be taken down and the duties removed. And private capital given the freedom to invest money in the Ukrainian economy. [Kuzmishchev] But, as Marx said, capital is not sentimental, it goes where there is the greatest profit. It is hard in Russia to force someone to invest in production in conditions of inflation, never mind in Ukraine. [Gonchar] A contentious issue. Even from the purely economic viewpoint. You only have to remember Ukraine's mighty oil refining industry, which is driving down our monopolists' prices. Anyone with a reasonable knowledge of the Ukrainian economy can name straight off several sectors in which it is profitable to invest capital. That is not the point. Entrepreneurs are primarily interested in political stability and legal protection. Russian firms, say, are willing to refine oil in Ukraine, but what guarantee is there that Ukraine won't appropriate the oil tomorrow? There must be seamless [skvoznoye] legislation on property. [Kuzmishchev] Common legislation. (Gonchar] No. Ukrainian and Russian legislation. The main thing is that the laws should not contradict one another. In a word, there must be an incentive for a change of legislation. If you want to employ an incentive, then think it through. Capital, I repeat, goes where there is greater social and political stability. If we squabble, there will be no capital. That is, the economic motor is cranked into action via politics. And, on the contrary, every stage of political rapprochement must have legal and political backup. Let us give Russian and Ukrainian capital a chance to work together. If it is just a question of Russian capital, there is one system of taxation, if it is just Ukrainian, then another applies. But if it is a joint project, there must be lenient taxes to provide incentives. It is not important what language people speak. Or what they wear. They will be united by profit and a common cause. When people come along and undermine the common cause out of personal interest, Russian businessmen will tell their Ukrainian colleagues: The plan will collapse if this idiot forces the situation. Would you be so kind as to have it out with him. Give money to his election rival, give money to the party that backs integrationist processes and we will deal with our Russian loonies. People of the same blood must be united by common interests. [Kuzmishchev] Do you think that this is the most pressing problem now? [Gonchar] Why has the rich United States suddenly taken the initiative and started strengthening the economy of Mexico? Mexicans were dying to get across the border, so economic potential had to be created there. The situation is far more acute in our country. Things are so bad in Ukraine that an explosion may be about to occur. We are hoping in vain that the debris will only fly inward. There is no alternative to economic integration. People in the Crimea have realized that and are clearing the way. The others are only hampered by the fact that some politicians in both capitals are afraid to acknowledge their mistakes, which have brought national tragedy.
