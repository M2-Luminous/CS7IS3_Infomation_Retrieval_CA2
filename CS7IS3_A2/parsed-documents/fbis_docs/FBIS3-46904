Undersecretary of State Lynn Davis told a regular briefing that North Korea had agreed to allow the inspections necessary for the continuity of safeguards on its seven installations declared with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Davis said she expects Pyongyang to talk with the IAEA to set specifics on the procedures. North Korea and the United States "are very close to satisfying" the conditions for the third round of high-level talks, and the talks could open based on these two steps, Davis said. North Korean Embassy officials did meet with the IAEA at its Vienna headquarters, but Agency Spokesman David Kyd said there were no proposals on Pyongyang's part on the inspections. The embassy officials basically heard the IAEA's position and replied they will come back with the response after consulting with their government, Kyd said in a telephone interview. The next North Korea-U.S. high-level talks will seek ways to completely solve all issues related to the nuclear situation including special inspection on two undeclared sites in North Korea.
