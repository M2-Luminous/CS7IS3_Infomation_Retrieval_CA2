Economic development in Germany is still stagnating, Scharping said in an interview with HANDELSBLATT. Scharping accused ministers Waigel and Rexrodt of "faith healing." The chancellor goes on about "flowering landscapes of the economic upswing," but the government coalition has not done its homework to achieve this, the SPD chairman said. That is why the six leading economic research institutes have quite rightly criticized the fact that the course has not yet been set by the government for a vigorous economic growth and a high level of employment. Scharping pointed out that domestic demand -- especially private consumption, but also production investment -- will continue to drop, or increase to the most insufficient degree. The incomes of the masses have also declined significantly in 1994. Capacities are far from being fully utilized, unemployment continues to increase, and a considerable number of jobs are still being cut. The SPD chairman also quotes the president of the Federal Association of German Industry [BDI], Tyll Necker, who, together, with other industrial leaders, doubts -- quite rightly -- whether the mass unemployment can be expected to drop in 1995, if the policies remain unchanged. Anyone conveying the impression that the problems have already been solved is creating false hopes, said Scharping. They are disguising the fact that outdated structures in the state and the economy have to be modernized, if the slight recovery is to become stable growth for all. Scharping said it is crucial that ecological changes of the industrial society are promoted and the modernization of the state's activities is accelerated. This is the only way to meet the challenges of the labor market and to restore "social justice in Germany, which has been damaged" by the Kohl government. Scharping: "Unless we do that, we will lose a great opportunity arising for our country during the next economic cycle." For this reason, the SPD suggests a solidarity pact, in which it wants to include the trade unions, industrialist associations, and the Bundesbank. This specific action by the state should continue a job-oriented wage policy in a climate of expansion that is free of inflation, said Scharping. Scharping said that the preconditions for such a solidarity pact coming into being are "the cornerstones of a future Social Democratic government policy": The 1995 tax rate must not be increased any further, net debt will have to be decreased, and -- as soon as the economic development allows -- the proportion of the GNP allocated to state spending must grow at a slower rate than the GNP itself. The SPD wants to "promote" investment in industry "by tax reliefs." That is why investment allowances and exceptional write-offs are being planned. Scharping wants to cut ancillary wages as "early as possible," in order to decrease the burden on industry and to increase the income available to those in gainful employment. The SPD chairman once again mentioned the surcharge planned by the SPD, which would affect fewer than 20 percent of all taxpayers. Scharping: "With this package of cost cuts for employers and companies, tax cuts for the incomes of the masses, and with tax relief for industrial investment, we will manage to achieve an economic upswing for everybody -- and not just a Kohl-made upswing for millionaires."
