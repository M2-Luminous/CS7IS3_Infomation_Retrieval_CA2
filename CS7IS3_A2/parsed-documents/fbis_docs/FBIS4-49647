The speech elicited enthusiastic applause. The subject Lu Ping dealt with was familiar to every Hong Kong resident: The implementation of the principle of "one country, two systems." Lu covered the background against which the principle was formed, the Chinese Government's determination to maintain the principle, the close relations characterized by coexistence in harmony and supplementing each other between Hong Kong and the mainland, and the central government's policy of allowing Hong Kong people to enjoy a high degree of autonomy and to administer Hong Kong, ending his speech with "all of you present here today will be given the chance to further Fat Choy [make money]." Lu's speech stands to reason, engenders a feeling of freshness, and is cordial and touching. We would like to suggest to people in all walks of life that they should carefully read the speech. In his speech, Lu analyzed the value of Hong Kong to China from the high plane of the principle of "one country, two systems." He stressed: "The value of Hong Kong to China has been, and will be, its economic value. Hong Kong has always been an economic city, never a political city." "It is precisely on the basis of Hong Kong's economic value that China formulates its present policy towards Hong Kong." "In the whole course of building socialism, Hong Kong will continue to play its important role as a bridge between China and the Western world." Lu made a practical assessment of Hong Kong's role, an assessment which conforms with the interests and aspirations of the six million Hong Kong people. Every Hong Kong resident hopes that Hong Kong will always be a prosperous and stable economic city and does not want to see Hong Kong change into a site where various political forces wrestle with one another. Just as Lu Ping pointed out, some people do wishfully plan to turn Hong Kong into a political city in order to influence the mainland in the sense of politics. In response to Lu's speech, Chris Patten said: "I do not believe that Hong Kong can only be taken as a economic laboratory," "it is a society full of various types of political ambitions." What he meant was quite clear. The British side does hope that Hong Kong will become a "political city." In July last year British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said: China must acknowledge Hong Kong's "political reality." Hong Kong "is continuing to evolve." "It is now a political city as well as an international city." These are not only their "words" but also their "deeds." Since he came to Hong Kong, Patten has not been interested in Hong Kong's economic development or the people's livelihood; instead, he devoted all his energy to challenging China and pursuing his "three violations" constitutional reform package in order to, in Hurd's words, change Hong Kong into a "political city" and "to establish a long-term political electoral system before 1997." In its recent report, the British Parliament Foreign Affairs Committee summarized Britain's duties to Hong Kong as follows: "Our duties will include setting up a legislative structure and safeguarding Hong Kong's freedom through improving the regulations on guaranteeing human rights." The committee also claimed that it will urge the government to see to it that the international community will continue its support for safeguarding Hong Kong's human rights and rule of law." It is clear that Britain is taking political action characterized by "grasping two links at the same time," namely, keeping tabs on both the political system and human rights. While trying to set up a set of organizations which can manipulate the political situation through "taking independent action," they are planning to protect those elements who are hostile to China and ready to create trouble or even turmoil by setting up a human rights committee and working out or amending several so-called laws and ordinances safeguarding human rights. Patten is probably planning to turn Hong Kong into a "political laboratory," which can influence and change the mainland in the sense of politics. The British side has kept saying it will put into effect the principle of "one country, two systems," but they only pay lip service and actually undermine the principle instead. When we say there will be no change in the principle of "one country, two systems," there are actually two aspects: The capitalist system of Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan will remain unchanged, but the socialist system of the main body of the country will also not change, Deng Xiaoping once said. Only when the socialism on the mainland prospers, can Hong Kong play its role as a bridge between China and the Western world and maintain its long- term prosperity and stability. Of course, with Hong Kong playing the role as a bridge, the mainland will do a better job in socialist modernizations. Therefore, nobody is allowed to change the capitalist system practiced in Hong Kong or the socialist system practiced on the mainland. We must especially watch out for those who try to change Hong Kong into a base hostile to the mainland under the pretext of "expanding democracy." The Chinese Government has made great efforts to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. In his speech, Lu cited many examples. Back in 1967, when the Cultural Revolution was still in progress, it was Premier Zhou Enlai who at the very last minute stopped the "Gang of Four" from sending troops to Hong Kong. It has been, and still is, the People's Liberation Army, under the strict orders of the central government, who have been guarding the Hong Kong borders. In the transitional period, the Chinese Government has handled major Hong Kong issues in the interest of Hong Kong people. State leaders have repeatedly warned that no departments shall deal with Hong Kong as they did with Shanghai; that no departments, provinces, or municipalities are allowed to interfere in the internal affairs of the Hong Kong SAR; and that Hong Kong people must be allowed to administer Hong Kong and be given a high degree of autonomy as stipulated, and so on. Hong Kong people should have full confidence in Hong Kong's and their own future and also support socialism on the mainland by building up a better Hong Kong so that under the PRC flag the two systems will stand side by side for a long time and the two places, Hong Kong and the mainland, will enjoy long-term prosperity.
