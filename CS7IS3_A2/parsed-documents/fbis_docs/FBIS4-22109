The three, including Charge d'Affaires 'Awad Fakhri, flew to Amman aboard a royal Jordanian (RJ) flight Thursday morning. Two of their colleagues were arrested by Lebanese police as they got out of their diplomatic-plate cars at Beirut airport to board the flight. The arrest of the two raised to four the number of Iraqi diplomats held in Beirut over the April 12 killing of Shaykh Talib 'Ali al-Suhayl, who was reported to have been a key figure in a foiled plot against Iraqi President Saddam Husayn last year. Mr. Fakhri had demanded that the Lebanese government, which broke diplomatic ties with Iraq after Baghdad refused to lift the diplomatic immunity for the two attaches, Muhammad Kazim and Khalid Khalaf release the two diplomats. He also refused to hand over another attache, 'Ali Darwish, and guard Hadi Hassan, the suspected assassin, who were held up in the Iraqi embassy in Beirut since the day of assassination. A Lebanese-Armenian employee of the embassy, George Teredjian, who allegedly drove the assassination team to al-Suhayl's apartment in Beirut, has also been detained and charged with complicity. It was not immediately clear how the embassy stand-off ended, given the tough statements that Mr. Fakhri had been issuing demanding the release of Mr. Kazim and Mr. Khalaf. But analysts speculated that the Iraqis realised that they could be in for a long siege by Lebanese police or be exposed to a possible storming of the embassy after Friday, the date set by the Beirut government for them to leave the country and thus the effective end to diplomatic immunity for the building. They also noted that the Lebanese government had instructed its lone diplomat in Baghdad, Sa'd Zakhya, to leave Iraq immediately after the arrest of the two Iraqi diplomats in Beirut. Mr. Zakhya left Baghdad in the early hours of April 13, shortly after the Beirut arrests, and flew out of Amman for the Lebanese capital on April 14. Mr. Darwish and Mr. Hassan were arrested as they arrived at Beirut airport to board the flight to Amman on Thursday along with Charge d'Affaires Fakhri and two other diplomats, whose names were not immediately available. But one of them was believed to be the Beirut correspondent of the Iraqi News Agency (INA). Mr. Fakhri and the other two were allowed to board the flight. The Associated Press reported that they were carrying 15 pieces of baggage weighing 350 kilogrammes, including boxes of files and electronic appliances. Journalists covering their arrival at Amman airport reported tight Iraqi security that prevented from talking to any of the three, who were met by the Iraqi ambassador in Jordan, Nuri al- Wayyis al-Tikriti and other Iraqi diplomats. A small scuffle broke out as some Iraqi security men sought to seize television films of the arrival of the diplomats from Lebanon, news agencies reported. The row was settled with intervention by Jordanian security forces, who upheld the right of the media to cover the event, the reports said. The three who arrived from Beirut were directly driven from Amman airport on the 1,000-kilometre trip to Baghdad, the Associated Press quoted Iraqi embassy spokesman 'Adil Ibrahim as saying. There was no immediate report from Baghdad of the diplomats' arrival there. The Iraqi government has denied Lebanese Prosecutor General Munir 'Uwaydat that its intelligence apparatus had ordered the killing of al-Suhayl, who held Jordanian and Saudi passports and was a known opponent of the Ba'thist regime in Baghdad. According to reports in the Lebanese press quoting "confessions" by the two attaches arrested immediately after the killing, the order for the assassination had come from Baghdad over the telex. The operation was allegedly masterminded by Mr. Darwish. Charge d'Affaires Fakhri was called in by prosecutors to hear the confession of the two, the reports said. An Iraqi Foreign Minister spokesman has accused Lebanon of violating the 1961 international convention and regulates diplomatic immunity. "It has detained diplomats who possess diplomatic immunity... charging them with baseless accusation," the spokesman said in a statement issued on Wednesday.
