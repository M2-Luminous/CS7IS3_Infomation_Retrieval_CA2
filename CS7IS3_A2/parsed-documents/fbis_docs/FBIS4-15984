The Baltic republic's major trade partners among EFTA members are Finland and Sweden, but contacts are maintained also with Norway and Switzerland, Kolbre said. The session was attended by representatives from six EFTA member states as well as the EFTA secretariat. The trade organization was officially represented by Ambassador Veijo Sampovaara from the Finnish Foreign Ministry. EFTA Secretary General Georg Reisch also attended the meeting.
