According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the gross output of the township enterprises in 20 provinces and regions in the central and western parts in the country reached RMB 400 billion last year, more than 60 percent up over the year before and 10 percentage points higher than the country's growth on average. Last year, the state made special loans of RMB 5 billion to support the development of township enterprises, seen as the biggest project for turning these areas from being poor into becoming rich. At the same time, various localities also increased their investment in this sector. Such investment for the development of these enterprises is predicted to account for RMB 35 billion, over 25 percent of the country's total, up from the 23 percent in the previous year. As a result, a large number of big-sized and highly efficient items have been set up. According to initial statistics, such enterprises there have taken on 3.3 million rural redundant labourers, making up 60 percent of the country's total new working force going into this sector last year. The gross output, business and sales income and profits tax earned by these enterprises last year amounted to 34.7 percent, 36.4 percent and 3.61 percent of the country's totals.
