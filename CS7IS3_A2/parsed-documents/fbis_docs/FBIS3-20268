This is seven percentage points in excess of the initial objective of 33 percent for tariff cutting under the seven-year-old negotiations, to be finalized in two weeks by a GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) ministerial conference at Marrakesh, Morocco. The 40 percent overall reduction in customs duties will be formally announced in a draft declaration to be adopted by ministers from about 120 countries at Marrakesh. Trade negotiators here said the tariff-cutting excercise was completed when a number of countries tabled their final market access offers here on Monday after intensive bilateral talks since the Final Act of the Uruguay Round was adopted here last December 15.
