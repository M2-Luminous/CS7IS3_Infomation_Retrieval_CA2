They are now discussing the procedure for the exchange of special envoys. At today's contact, our side stressed that this year's Team Spirit exercise will be suspended, and that the third round of North Korean-U.S. high-level talks will proceed smoothly only if the exchange of special envoys is held. Our side stated that it would flexibly accept North Korea's proposal on procedural matters if North Korea cancels its four demands, including the cancellation of President Kim Yong-sam's remarks regarding the nuclear issue that North Korea is demanding. In his first remarks, Song Yong-tae, our side's senior delegate, said: It is regretful that despite the principled agreement between the two sides regarding the exchange of special envoys, the practical discussions have not proceeded because of the North side's demands that have nothing to do with the contact. He urged the North side to immediately comply with the discussions of the procedural issues without delaying the exchange of special envoys under the pretext of unjust demands. Senior delegate Song Yong-tae pointed out that two of North Korea's demands -- including the issue of promoting the great unity of the whole nation proposed by the North side as an agenda item for the exchange of special envoys during the fifth North-South working- level contact -- will be met when the Nuclear Control Joint Committee begins operating and when the North-South agreement is carried out. Also, he urged the North side to accept the South side's proposal indicating that the North side's special envoy should first visit the South, that the envoy should stay for four nights and five days, and the exchange of special envoys should be made within 10 days after the signing of the agreement.
