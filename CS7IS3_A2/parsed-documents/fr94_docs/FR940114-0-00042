FR940114-0-00042 FR940114-0-00019 Instructions for Preparation General Instructions 1. Data for completion of Form OCP&hyph;101 may be obtained by random sampling providing that in every instance, the universe sampled is all shipments delivered under your common carrier authority (excluding Government, Freight forwarder, and Interline traffic) during the report year or all claims arising out of the transportation of those shipments that were received or settled, as appropriate, during the report year. 2. When random sampling is used, the minimum sample size in every instance shall be 400 shipments or claims, as appropriate, in replicates of 100 shipments or claims each. All samples must conform to standard deviation with a 95% confidence level. 3. Carriers submitting Form OCP&hyph;101 shall retain and make available for review by an authorized Commission employee all working papers, notes, and other files relating to the preparation of each report for a period of not less than 24 months following the date of filing such a report. 4. The data in Form OCP&hyph;101 must be verified by a sworn statement signed by an official of the company. Specific Instructions Part A Line 1: Only report those 1st proviso C.O.D. shipments moved under your common carrier authority after excluding all Government, Freight forwarder and Interline traffic. Line 2: Report all other 1st proviso shipments, including those moving under contract carriage provisions and all Government, Freight forwarder and Interline traffic. Line 3: Sum lines 1 and 2. The total should agree with total 1st proviso shipments reported in your ICC Annual Report, Schedule 600, Line 7, Column d, if you are required to file that report. Part B It is not necessary to complete Part B if the total of C.O.D. shipments reported on Part A, Line 1, did not equal or exceed 100 shipments. If completion of Part B is not required, sign the Certification and return the form to the Interstate Commerce Commission. Line 4: Report only those C.O.D. shipments where the order for service was signed after the receipt of a written binding estimate. Include in this computation all so-called hybrid estimates ( e.g., Guaranteed Price and Price Protection options). Line 5: Report the total number of C.O.D. shipments where the order for service was signed after the receipt of a written non-binding estimate. In the case of non-binding estimates, the actual charges are determined after the shipment has been picked up and weighed. Line 6: Report only those C.O.D. shipments where there was no requirement for the preparation of a binding or non-binding written estimate by the carrier. As with non-binding estimates, the charges here are determined after the shipment has been picked up and weighed. Line 7: Sum of Lines 4, 5, and 6. The number of shipments reported on Line 7 should be the same as those reported in Part A, Line 1. Computation of Percentages or Averages You must determine the number of shipments falling into each of the categories described in Lines 8 and 9, respectively, and divide these shipments by the number of shipments reported on Lines 4 and 5, respectively. You must determine the number of shipments falling into each of the categories described in Lines 10 through 16 and divide these shipments by the number of shipments reported on Line 7. (Exception: Line 13 is an average, not a percentage.)
