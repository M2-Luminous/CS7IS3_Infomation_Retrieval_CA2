Controversy Over New Croatian Currency Croatian and Serbian newspapers have published articles condemning the introduction of the kuna (Serbo-Croatian for marten) as the new Croatian currency, mainly because it had heretofore been used only in the Independent State of Croatia (NDH--World War II pro-Nazi state ruled by Ante Pavelic). "The replacement of the Croatian dinar with the Croatian kuna is primarily a political act.... The name kuna itself is pure politics, because it defines the origin of the current Croatian state differently than the Constitution does. Instead of the current name, derived from the Yugoslav dinar and originally from the Roman denarius, we are getting a name which the NDH's money bore.... Thus, the wishes and dreams of influential persons nostalgic for the NDH are being fulfilled," the 9 May edition of the Split weekly FERAL TRIBUNE writes, going on to cite Josip Manolic, vice president of the newly founded Croatian Independent Democrats and a leading critic of Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, as saying that Tudjman personally gave the order which the HDZ majority in the Croatian Assembly "simply obeyed in a discipled manner." The 5 May issue of the Zagreb weekly GLOBUS also published criticism by Manolic of the decision on the new monetary unit. The kuna has never been the Croatian currency, Manolic said, except during the time of NDH. Marten pelts, he noted, were merely a commodity used for bartering in the time before Croatia had currency, just as were seashells, leather, or sheep. The use of marten pelts was absolutely not a tradition, he added, in spite of what Tudjman and others who support the return of the NDH currency claim. Manolic went on to say that numerous "pogroms" against minorities, and even against many Croats, were carried out during the four years the NDH existed. "We should be realistic. Neither the Jews nor the Serbs will be able to accept the kuna as their money," he continued, observing that the NDH was not a "shining" period in Croatian history and that nothing from that period should be linked to the present Croatia. "We cannot seriously consider the reintegration of the occupied territories with such things as the kuna," he concluded, according to GLOBUS. "The introduction of the name kuna for Croatia's currency is a harmful political move, one of those that are renewing Pavelic's Independent State of Croatia," the 5 May issue of the Zagreb daily VJESNIK cites Branko Horvat, president of the Social-Democratic Union (SDU), as stating at an SDU press conference. Horvat went on to say, according to VJESNIK, that "the kuna has never been Croatian money; it was invented during the NDH, and there is no reason whatsoever to reintroduce this name. This is obviously a concession to the ustasha elements that surround President Tudjman, and this name offends the pride of cultured Croatian people." Several Croatian politicians critical of the introduction of the kuna have also been cited in the Belgrade press. For example, Silvije Degen, leader of the Socialist Party of Croatia and renowned Zagreb lawyer and human rights activist, noted during an interview in the 21-22 May Belgrade daily BORBA, that "symbolically, the marten is the smallest but most bloodthirsty mammal on the face of the earth." Share of Zagreb Brewery Sold to Belgian Firm With the signing of an agreement for the sale of 23.78 percent of the shares of the Zagreb Pivovara (brewery), one of the largest privatization deals in Croatia to date, worth 40 million German marks [DM], has been concluded, reported the 5 May VJESNIK. The Belgian firm Interbrew immediately paid double the "nominal" value of DM9.7 million for the shares, and is planning to invest an additional DM21 million in the Zagreb brewery -- DM11 million immediately and DM10 million in a year -- VJESNIK reported, adding that the Belgian firm for the present has a minority stake but that its share will increase with the additional capitalization. The contract was signed on 4 May by Ivan Penic, president of the Croatian Privatization Fund, and Hans H. Meerloo, president of the executive board of the Belgian firm. The privatization fund management board unanimously decided to sell the Zagreb Pivovara shares to the Belgian firm, which made the highest bid, VJESNIK added. German Firm Becomes Majority Owner of Koncar The German firm EGE, through "additional investment" in the Rade Koncar firm in Slavonska Pozega, has become majority owner of this "relatively small but profitable export-oriented firm," according to the 5 May VJESNIK. During the capitalization process, which has been going on for almost two years, the German partner has invested DM7.3 million in Koncar. Production of tube heaters began in 1993, and this year funds were invested in the production of heating plates. Koncar-EGE director Zeljko Bohm told VJESNIK that annual production of about 2.5 million heating plates and 2 million tube heaters is planned. Most of the production is for export to Austria, Germany, and Switzerland, and production for the Italian market is especially significant. This year, 500,000 heating plates will be delivered to two Italian buyers.
