"I was glad everything ended that way," Mr Surin said. Political turmoil stemming from calls for a new constitution prompted other countries to look at Thailand with suspicion since an international agreement stipulated that any international accords could be enforced only after they were legally approved through constitutional procedures of respective countries, he said. Concern had grown that if the Government bowed to demand by a group of people, foreign investors would be reluctant to invest in Thailand as they would fear changes in the constitution any time. "If we started by avoiding adherence to constitutional principles, no one could have confidence." he said. Thailand's political situation, which became tense after political activist Chalat Worachat staged a hunger strike to press for the Government to draw up a more democratic constitution, eased after Mr Chalat called off his protest on Thursday. Mr Surin said neighbouring countries were worried that Thailand's political crisis, if prolonged, could affect negotiations on cooperation in the establishment of the Growth Triangle and the Growth Quadrangle as well as the use of water and other resources in the Mekong River. He invited suggestions from academics and businessmen on how Thailand should proceed politically and how it could best protect its democratic system. Mr Surin, however, conceded he was "a little bit worried" about problems within the Phalang Tham Party [PTP] hut' said disputes and rifts were common in politics and that the party needed time to adjust to any changes. "The party needs to reorganise its own system. The Democrat Party went through that process before." In the end, all party members had to accept the decision of the majority, he said. Mr Surin said that people should not be pessimistic about the future of Thai politics following reports that the PTP might withdraw from the Government, since Prime Minister Chuan Likphai was still confident all would go well. He said Mr Chuan would not dissolve the House of Representatives and would go on working with the five coalition parties. Mr Surin asked the public not to give importance to reports that the Democrat Party had approached certain Opposition parties to join the Government. According to Mr Surin, the Government has three options to solve its problems: dissolving the House, reshuffling the Cabinet or seeking settlements among the five parties. Mr Surin said the best exit was for all five parties to discuss how to prevent disputes from recurring as well as iron out their differences. He said the Premier would not intervene in the internal problems of the PTP.
