This is exactly the style and method favored by our guest today, Andro Devdariani, the chairman of the board of the Agroindustrial Bank. He was born in 1956 in Tbilisi. He graduated from Secondary School No. 58. In 1973-1974 he worked in the Kirov Machine Tool Factory. He graduated with honors from Tbilisi State University's Economics Engineering Faculty, and later defended his candidate's dissertation. He is a candidate of economic sciences and has written about 20 scientific works. In 1985 he was awarded the Komsomol Prize in science and technology. After that he worked as a laboratory head in the University, as a teacher, as a docent, and as chairman of the party commission. He is now a doctoral candidate. He was the council chairman of the Golden Bank Commercial Bank. Batoni Andro and his friends laid the foundation for the revival of the villages of Dzhavakhetia. Through the years, he worked with students to build the Georgian village of Kotelia. In various parts of Georgia they rebuilt and restored churches and monasteries that had been destroyed and virtually forgotten, and they also did much to save the Garedzhi Complex. He is married to Maia Kvezereli-Kopadze, a university docent, and they have two children. [Anasashvili] Batono Andro, what kind of problems did you inherit on first coming to the bank? [Devdariani] Well, when you come to a bank you have to know very well what kind of responsibility to the people and the country you are assuming. So being appointed to this post is a great honor and a burden to me, one that is not easy to bear, especially under today's conditions. I came to the bank from science and business, and I have my own ideas and vision as to the most urgent changes in the system to be anticipated in the near future. It was Great Ilia, you know, who founded banking in Georgia. His banking efforts alone are sufficient proof of the role the banks play in building the country. [Anasashvili] Indeed, Ilia devoted much time and energy to banking, and people often said of him that "the bank is making him neglect his calling as a writer." In fact, someone even wrote a little verse: "Do not give up your steed, "put down your abacus, Ilia, "all of this will vanish, pass away, "what will remain is your [immortal poem] `The Hermit.'" [Devdariani] These days, sad to say, Ilia's spirit in the banks is confined to hanging his portrait in the board room. Remember that a bank's reputation is the foundation of the public's trust by which every bank prospers. Rumors and slander cost the country dearly. Anyone who is dishonest deserves reproach, but all this endless talk and carping are unseemly. The way we do business, a dishonest man is quickly exposed. But let's get back to our problems. Although the Agroindustrial Bank is one of the biggest state structures, I found that wages and salaries were very low. Paradoxically, the bank's staffers have the least social protection. Our bank's building is also in sad shape. One floor is occupied by the city commandant's office and we haven't been able to get it back. They don't even pay their lease. We also have cadre problems; there are many nonprofessionals employed in this system who are not even qualified. Most important, they totally lack the necessary knowledge, skills, and habits. Our bank has lots of other problems too. The first thing we need to do is root out vices such as the misuse of funds and personal travel at the bank's expense. We will no longer permit the subjective approach in granting loans, the way we used to grant loans at low interest rates on flimsy grounds. There were absolutely no criteria for setting the rates. This gave dishonest persons many loopholes and caused a lot of talk. To make a long story short, I found I had more than enough to do. I've only been examining the problems for a few weeks; soon I will work out plans and begin to take practical steps. The public will be fully informed about what we do. One thing is certain: most of the bank's profit has to be spent on social needs. [Anasashvili] The country's agrarian sector is in critical condition. How can the Agroindustrial Bank help the countryside, the peasant? [Devdariani] Of course the bank and the banking system must play a crucial role in solving the country's crisis. It needs to be in tune with the structure of the national economy and conduct a reasonable monetary-credit policy to boost the economy. By its nature, the Agroindustrial Bank is a versatile institution, serving our economy's strategic sector--the agrarian sector--through more than 70 offices. Right now, up to 80 percent of our credit investment (400 billion coupons) is in the form of loans to financially shaky partners in agriculture, and the recovery of these loans is doubtful. The recovery failure rate of loans given in past years is due primarily to the breakdown in state discipline in agricultural enterprises, massive theft and wastage of products, and general lack of control. Given the present disarray, I think it is totally unacceptable to grant credit at "reduced rates" to agricultural enterprises that are in shaky financial shape. The fact is that most of them are practically bankrupt. This also has resulted from the fact that 70 percent of the 10-percent loans granted to agricultural enterprises last year have not been recovered. Things are made worse by the fact that the mechanisms stipulated in the law on mortgages, which would have made relations with debtors easier, have not been activated. In general I think that granting loans at reduced rates to unpromising enterprises fails to stimulate their financial performance. Managers of such enterprises are used to sitting around waiting for government handouts, waiting for the low-interest loans that are charged to them to be written off or deferred. As for the countryside and the peasant, we hope to benefit them in many ways. I'm optimistic because there are many knowledgeable, industrious, professional, and--most important--honest people working in our bank. They are always doing their best to help the countryside; the country can count on that. [Anasashvili] At a meeting of the government's Food Commission, as we know, the National Bank proposed that you be obliged to allocate 65 billion coupons from your own funds so the agricultural enterprises could complete their spring operations. You came out categorically against it. Why? [Devdariani] Here's why. The National Bank stipulates that loans can be granted using a bank's own resources only if it has a stable surplus. But a surplus is possible only if there are deposits. In the case of Agroindustrial Bank institutions, however, there are practically none. We are against that kind of loan practice because it is quite possible that it will inevitably lead to granting emission credit, which is the government's sole prerogative. Considering our inflation and market conditions, giving credit--at the rate of 120 percent annually--is totally unacceptable. In short, Georgia's economy is in terrible shape. The situation in the sphere of monetary-credit policy, as well, is uncertain, to put it mildly. In my opinion, both the former and the present managers of the National Bank are not conducting a real monetary-credit policy, they are just making individual decisions which they think reflect the country's essential interests. [Anasashvili] Everybody knows that the banks are the life blood of the economy, which depends on them to function normally. In your opinion, what shape is Georgia's banking system in today? [Devdariani] Georgia's banking system is only in the formation stage today. It is developing rather slowly, owing to many objective and subjective factors. All else aside, the formation of a monetary-credit system characteristic of a market economy is a complex process. The right kind of banking system is being created, and taking part in it is a crucial and complex business, because essentially new banks are being formed. It requires working in a new way, new cadres. The system is having a hard time getting free of old stereotypes. The number of banks is increasing day by day, of course, but numbers alone are not going to help things. Another negative factor is that the process is not being analyzed. A bank, of course, is a specific institution, but it must not have the seeming of a clan institution. Another reason for the banking system's many shortcomings is the fact that conditions in the country are unstable. Furthermore, political forces have ambivalent attitudes toward the banks. Today, unfortunately, at some stage or other, any particular bank's power is defined by whoever stands behind it and sponsors it. Another unacceptable practice is when high officials establish banks just to "secure their own future." Banks are institutions full of bustling activity, where everything is done according to the law, and where, as in any other sphere, you can even get rich, but only while maintaining human dignity, complying strictly with rules and regulations, according to your talent and ability. But ordinary people do work in banks, and all the woes afflicting our society can be sensed there as well. It is essential, therefore, for us all to struggle to restore things to health. Most important, I think, is the fact that always, and especially today, the banks have a grand national cause to pursue, requiring not only competence but also clean hands and a clean conscience. The bankers who were appointed as board chairmen along with me are educated, knowledgeable, honest, and "still unblemished" persons. We have to do the people's business; the public, the press, and television must be informed of our every step; and the people must hand down the verdict--not the way it's being done now, with prejudiced notions, using campaign methods, and insinuating statements, but weighing everyone's virtues and defects. Banks, and bankers, must work strictly according to the rules and laws. It is urgent and essential to create banks of the Western type. The wheel has already been invented, and we can't do any better; what we have to do is pick up on everything advanced and progressive and adopt it in accordance with Georgia's interests and Georgian realities. We must also keep in mind that our banks' computer equipment is very primitive, and transactions are being carried out using the old methods at the same old pace. The reason is that the system is backward. Everything needs to be changed as soon as possible. I repeat, it is essential to create a banking system that befits a civilized country. It is the banks that will have to save Georgia. I hope that a strong cadre of bankers will soon take shape in Georgia to serve as a guarantee of the irreversibility of the country's democracy. [end of Q and A] It looks as if this new executive, who is dedicated to his cause, pays attention to every detail, and favors strong financial discipline, is going to have to thoroughly overhaul the banking business. Meanwhile, the hullabaloo concerning the banks continues. There are some who are categorically rejecting the new people. There are those who are doubtful that the new people's experience is sufficient to rebuild the banks and solve their problems. Whatever the case, the choice has been made, and a "new broom" is coming. We would like to accost the Great Ilia once more and remind you of what he said: "The bank represents one of the best and most reliable aspects of our life. Therefore, anyone who cares about our country ought not to gleefully seize upon every mistake, failure of foresight, and other shortcomings of the bank--these are inevitable in any new endeavor--but rather take careful note of them and just as diligently try to correct the mistake and eliminate the defect."
