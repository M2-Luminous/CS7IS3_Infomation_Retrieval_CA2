Saving deposits in both urban and rural areas across the province increased by 15.014 billion yuan last year, an increase of 3.776 billion yuan over 1992, while net currency withdrawals of 5.755 billion last year represented a 1.068 billion yuan increase over 1992. These improvements have lent a strong hand to Zhejiang's economic construction. Over the past year, Zhejiang has taken a series of effective macroeconomic control measures over the banking sector, singling out "wanton fund-raising, borrowing, and investment" for rectification. Through such measures as intensifying propaganda and guidance, standardizing fund-raising from the public, tightening supervision and management, and taking action against illegal fund-raising, branches of the People's Bank of China throughout the province managed to stabilize credits and sources of funds. While conscientiously clearing all illegal loans, various financial organizations in the province succeeded in recalling 2.1 billion yuan in loans from non-financial organizations, or 49.8 percent, and 3.57 billion yuan from non-banking financial organizations, or 57.4 percent. In the meantime, branches of the People's Bank of China in Zhejiang conducted inspections and screenings on 149 economic entities run by the bank itself, resulting by the end of last year in the withdrawal of all loans extended to them as capital. Twenty- six of these economic entities were eventually removed, merged with, or transferred to other enterprises; the remainder have no more capital, personnel, asset, or financial connections with the People's Bank of China. Another effective measure taken by Zhejiang in strengthening macroeconomic control over the banking system was the blocking of all illegal means and the opening up of proper channels. With concentrated efforts to attract savings, banks in Zhejiang led other provinces in turning around the declining savings situation in China. As of the end of April, savings deposits for both urban and rural areas in Zhejiang were still down by 300 million yuan as compared to the beginning of the year, a decrease of 6 billion yuan as compared to the corresponding period in 1992. However, things turned around by the end of last year, registering an increase of 3.776 billion yuan in savings deposits over the previous year. While appropriately extending more loans, Zhejiang has adjusted its loan targets so that funds will be concentrated to meet the requirements of key projects. New bank loans extended to state-owned industries and foreign trade last year increased by 13.1 percent and 2.9 percent respectively over the previous year. No "IOU's" were issued in purchasing farm and sideline products. While strengthening macroeconomic control over the banking sector, Zhejiang also accelerated the pace of reform of the banking structure. Last year saw the incorporation of the Ningbo International Bank, the first joint venture between Zhejiang Commercial Bank and a wholly foreign-funded bank. With the approval of the head office of the People's Bank of China, two commercial banks--the Zhongxin Realty Bank's Hangzhou Branch and the Pudong Development Bank's Hangzhou Branch--began the process of incorporation last year. Simultaneously, a host of financial organizations were added throughout the province--including the People's Bank of China's county branches, Communications Bank office, city credit service, stock exchange trading division, and housing loan service--which served to enhance the operating capacity of specialized banks and functions of international finance. The financial market has been developing rapidly with the inauguration of the provincial Stock Registration Center and the provincial Stock Trading Center, initially forming a financial market system that brought the three markets--interbank loans market, stocks market, and foreign exchange regulatory market--into one. The provincial financing center reported an accumulated transaction of 17.09 billion yuan last year, a 67.7 increase over the preceding year, while that of foreign exchange regulation reached $1.94 billion, a 41.2 percent increase.
