You will recall that even U.S. President Reagan was fond of impressing us by using old Russian folk sayings. God himself ordained that we should "stigmatize" our own deeds with a scathing phrase. Which is what we do. Recall this one: "The Russian peasant is wise after the event." First he does something, then he scratches his head and says: "Well, why did I do that...." Is he annoyed with himself? That is hard to say.... But is the Russian not offended when, in the fourth year of his state's existence, he hears the foreign minister saying clearly, firmly, but too late: "The CIS and Baltic countries are the region where Russia's paramount vital interests are concentrated. It is from there that the main threats to those interests stem." Thank you, Andrey Vladimirovich, for this unambiguous and definitive comment at the recently concluded Foreign Ministry conference on questions of Russia's foreign policy in neighboring foreign countries. To be fair, this idea began to be expressed, albeit timidly, back in 1992. But nevertheless it was not unjustifiably timid in Russian terms. It was drowned out then by the thunder of the collapse of the Soviet empire, the euphoria caused by the acquisition of sovereignty, and the unfeigned and sincere joy of the fledgling Russian democracy at the appearance of a number of sovereign states nearby. Yes, yes, joy, because it had helped in the struggle of those selfsame Baltic republics against the Union center. This support may only have been moral but it was support nonetheless. But the naive expectation of requited love from the newly independent Balts gave way to disappointment -- the Soviet "occupation forces" became Russian. Forces of occupation, as we know, have to leave. Then people remembered that in this regard the Gorbachev center was not all that bad: It tried to set a five-year term for the "divorce" of the young sovereign states from their hated "master." Everyone, both those who had fled from the Union and Russia's democrats, saw this as merely an attempt to preserve the empire. However, there was another aspect too -- the geopolitical and military-strategic. You only had to look back and closely examine the history of Russia, which has reached the Baltic after several centuries by blood and sweat, and then raise your hand to your eyes and look beyond the horizon of our disorganized life today to realize that the forced march from the Baltic must not be so rashly and humiliatingly fast. But what has happened has happened. We now have the added factor of the destabilization of the domestic political situation and tremendous tension within the army milieu. You may say what you like but it is the military man on active service or the retired military man who has suffered most of all -- the former is facing unprecedented deprivations as he settles down in Russia while the latter has been turned into a second-class citizen in the Baltic states. But while punning on the subject of the times, it is comforting to think that they can still change. The feeling that Russia has no specific interests in neighboring foreign countries is being agonizingly replaced by the realization that it has a special role to play in the post-Soviet area. In this regard 1992 was a crucial year. The many armed conflicts along Russia's borders, the infringement of Russia's state interests in strategically important neighboring regions, and finally the shameless and at times humiliating pressure on our fellow countrymen in neighboring foreign countries has led to the realization that we cannot close our eyes and ears and withdraw into our own Russian backyard. This is an act of criminal disrespect if you think of the many centuries of Russia's arduous history, it is a facile way to treat the country's future, and it is immoral toward those 25 million of our fellow countrymen who now find themselves separated from the motherland. So, thank God, it seems that Russia's difficult, months-long progress toward an understanding of its own role in neighboring foreign countries is nearing the desired end. Undoubtedly there is still much work to be done to make the process of Russia's adaptation in the post-Soviet area civilized, successful, and worthy of a great country. But the finishing touches have been added, it seems, and Russia's foreign policy priorities in neighboring foreign countries have been listed. When speaking about them the Russian foreign minister remarked that "Russia must preserve its military presence in regions which have been spheres of its military interest for centuries." He added: "The withdrawal of all military presence from those regions is the same extreme approach as imperial suppression using tanks." In the event of withdrawal, Andrey Kozyrev is convinced, the "security vacuum" thus created will not always necessarily be filled by friendly forces. Another vital priority is the protection of the Russian-speaking population, our fellow countrymen. "To help create conditions in which Russians feel that they are equal citizens" -- that is how the foreign minister put it. I think that these comments by Andrey Kozyrev will be understood precisely as they stand. Because attempts by anyone anywhere to assume the role of interpreter and organizer of Russian affairs in neighboring foreign countries will now be viewed as unfriendly acts. Russia is ceasing to do that which historically was inappropriate to it -- backpedalling. Russia is making it plain that everyone who wants to live with it in love and fond accord should take account of its geopolitical interests. Just as it is prepared to do unto others. With determination, dignity, and honor.
