This means that Russian television and radio are unable to have good-quality and stable communications with their correspondents in any of the regions of our country. The management of the Russian Television and Radio Company has held intensive talks with Russian Communications Minister Vladimir Bulgak, who gave the assurance that there would be no disconnection from communications channels. Today, however, the Rostelekom joint-stock company refused to accept and deal with orders from television and radio companies, citing a directive from the joint-stock company's management. All attempts today to talk to the Russian communications minister have been unsuccessful, although, according to our information, he had received information about the desperate plight in which radio and television find themselves yet again. It seems that today the language of the ultimatum is the only way in which Russian communications workers can voice their interests.
