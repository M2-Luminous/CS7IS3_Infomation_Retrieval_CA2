Andrzej Olechowski, minister of foreign affairs, said at a news conference in Warsaw that from now on we would have new rights. [Olechowski] "Poland, not only because of its aspirations but also in the institutional sense, occupies a specific place in Europe. It is now joining the countries which have decided to achieve a historic task, rare on our continent, namely to get integrated into one body. The form which this body should take has, of course, been a subject of discussions. From now on, we shall also be able to influence this discussion and we shall be able to express our views on the future shape of the continent." [Announcer] Now over to the minister of foreign economic cooperation, Leslaw Podkanski. [Podkanski] "The preliminary agreement which expires today will be replaced by the Association Treaty, which gives us guarantees for the continuity of principles and conditions of trade between Poland and the [European] Community. The fundamental objective is to create in the next few years a free-trade zone for our state and the [European] Community states. The treaty, however, does not give the final ruling on the issue of agricultural products and fish." [Announcer] When assessing the two-year transitional period, from the moment of signing until the moment when the Association Treaty comes into force, Minister Leslaw Podkanski said that at present almost three quarters of our exports find their way onto the EC market without any duties being levied. The minister added that until now a quarter of goods imported to Poland from the EC had been duty free. Minister Leslaw Podkanski: [Podkanski] "As of 1 January 1995 we shall be able to export all goods duty free, apart from textiles and metallurgical products. When it comes to our concessions with regard to allowing EC goods onto the Polish market, from 1 January 1995 to 1 January 1999 we shall have to carry out a proportional reduction in the duties levied on all industrial goods, which are still in force." [Announcer] Jacek Saryusz-Wolski, the government plenipotentiary for European integration: [Saryusz-Wolski] "A whole package of agreements is coming into force. They concern not only a free flow of goods but also of services, capital and people, although people to a lesser extent. The association institutions are starting to function as well. This should put us in a better position to negotiate and improve the treaty further." [Announcer] Our full membership in the European Union will complete the process of association. It is, however, not known yet when this will happen, Minister Andrzej Olechowski pointed out. [Olechowski] "We have in this respect an unequivocal declaration from Copenhagen which says that it is in the interest of both sides that Poland should become a member of the European Union. For this reason it is a duty of both Poland and the European Union that Poland should become a member, and that this should happen in our lifetime. A schedule of specific steps will be needed for this purpose. We shall make efforts for such a schedule to emerge." [Announcer] The minister of foreign affairs, Andrzej Olechowski, said that at the meeting of the Council of Ministers tomorrow he would ask the council to authorize Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak to sign during his forthcoming visit to Brussels, an agreement on Poland's membership in the Partnership for Peace program. [Olechowski] "The decision concerning the prime minister's signing the document, which is an invitation to the Partnership for Peace [program], will be taken by the Council of Ministers tomorrow. If we look at the decisions made by the Council of Ministers so far, such an authorization will certainly be formulated. The Council of Ministers has already expressed its support for the Partnership for Peace [initiative] and Poland's willingness to take active part in this program." [Announcer] Krystyna Koziol was the author of this report from the press conference.
