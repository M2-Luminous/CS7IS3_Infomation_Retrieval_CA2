Security Council statement on North Korea issued Thursday took the format suggested by China but it is not milder in content than the resolution that had been initiated by Western countries, a Foreign Ministry official said yesterday. He said South Korea and four countries with permanent membership on the council--the United States, Russia, Britain and France-- decided to accept the Chinese proposal to issue a statement instead of a resolution in order to gain future cooperation from China, the other permanent member. But the content included much that had been suggested by the five countries, especially South Korea, he claimed. "The statement, therefore, can be said to be a compromise of the Western idea of adopting a resolution and the Chinese proposal for a statement," said Ham Myong-chol, director-general for international organizations of the ministry. He tried to place the most significance of Thursday's U.N. Security Council statement in setting a deadline for an additional nuclear inspection on North Korea at the end of this month or early next month. He said Hans Blix, director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), is scheduled to make a report on North Korea to the council within "six weeks from March 24." The statement issued Thursday has required the director-general to report also on the completion of the inspections agreed between the IAEA and North Korea Feb. 15 on the day. "This means North Korea is given a deadline for receiving additional inspections to make up for those conducted last month, which the IAEA said are unsatisfactory. "The deadline, to be specific, is the end of this month or early next month," he said. He said another noticeable change in the process of negotiations on the statement was the active participation of China. Ham said China participated in the process from the beginning when the other four permanent members of the Security Council started to draw up the first draft. China, however, remained silent during the first stage and proposed a few days later to issue a statement instead of the resolution. South Korea also took part in the whole process and succeeded in having the statement include a phrase on the deadline for additional inspections of North Korea, Ham said. He said the original draft drawn up by the four Western permanent members did not mention the deadline. The Seoul government, however, supported the Chinese proposal out of the belief that what counts more is content not format, he said. The official said a resolution appears more resolute than a statement. But a statement, if it is made with a consensus among members, could be more effective than a resolution that is vetoed by one member. He said a presidential statement can also serve well the purpose of the Security Council measure--to urge North Korea's acceptance of inspections and recommend dialogue between the parties concerned.
