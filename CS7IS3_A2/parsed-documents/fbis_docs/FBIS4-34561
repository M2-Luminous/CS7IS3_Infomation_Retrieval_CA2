FRAPH leader Emmanuel Constant confirmed that the group changed its name to People's Armed Revolutionary Front this Tuesday, and he criticized what he called was the Clinton-Aristide-Gray policy. Constant was referring to U.S. President Bill Clinton; Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the Haitian president who was toppled in September 1991; and William Gray, the U.S. President's adviser for the Haitian crisis. Constant, however, clarified at a news conference this afternoon, that the name, People's Armed Revolutionary Front, does not mean the organization will take up arms due to U.S. military intervention threats. He explained that the members of the organization are to be relief personnel who will be deployed to strategic areas and await the Armed Forces' requests. Constant commented that the Front's members will have machetes and will use magic, voodoo, and the "Ouanga" (object used in voodoo practices to show special powers). The right-wing leader indicated that they will use those powers to protect the country from a foreign invasion. Louis Jodell Chamblain, who was not allowed to speak on behalf of the FRAPH on 11 June after he said "nobody is safe in Haiti" and he reported that he had been attacked, was also present at the news conference. Chamblain's presence at the FRAPH locale in Delmas, near Port-au-Prince, surprised reporters who attended the event because they thought there had been a split in the group when Chamblain made those statements after he was allegedly attacked. A voodoo ceremony is also being held at the Haitian National Pantheon Museum, near the National Palace, this afternoon. Chamber of Deputies President Frantz Robert Monde; Emmanuele Menard, the director of the museum and of the national television station; and Army officers are participating in this ceremony. The ceremony, in which flower offerings have been made, is organized by a cultural association that was founded by Deputy Lionel Bouzi. According to several of the participants, the ceremony is being held to honor the country's forefathers.
