One week ago to the day, after weeks of exhaustive negotiations, the IFP and the ANC agreed on the terms of reference for international mediation. It was a solemn contract between us and was submitted to the mediators. On the basis of this, some of the most eminent men in the world arrived in South Africa on Tuesday, to start mediation the following day. The ANC however, tore up the Sunday agreement which had been made by national chairman Mr Thabo Mbeki. If the ANC can tear up a covenant like that, what value can be attached to its word? Our fellow South Africans, we know you will now understand why we cannot accept the ANC's word and why we insist that your rights can only be safeguarded in cast-iron constitutional guarantees. We negotiated in good faith for more than 15 long years before the National Party recognised the wrongness of its ways and decided to break with apartheid. We have done so since February 2 1990. The ANC showed bad faith at CODESA and then held the country to ransom through violent mass action. The Government buckled and has negotiated in bad faith in the Multi-Party Negotiating Forum. It is this that has brought our country to the brink of disaster. A Power for Good. We promise you that we will find a way to bring peace, democracy and development to our country." If you want to help us build a better future, you can do so by supporting us financially.
