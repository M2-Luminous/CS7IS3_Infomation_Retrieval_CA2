Pyrographite plates were used as substrates in accordance with the specifics of scanning tunnel microscopy. Nanometer-size structures were formed on the surfaces by chemical modification of transition metals and phosphorus with halogens. The first results indicated that pyrographite treated with vanadium oxychloride had the most structure ordering. Therefore, the present work was devoted to studying the surface composition of vanadium oxychloride-modified pyrographite using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It was demonstrated that the carrier gas used (air, nitrogen, or helium) plays a significant role in the concentration of elements on the surface layer as well as the shape of the V 2p[.sub]3/2[/], C1 s, O 1s lines in the photoelectron spectra. A comparative analysis of the spectra of modified pyrographite with the bulk oxygen compounds of vanadium led to the hypothesis on the structures formed on the pyrographite surface are similar in nature to that of hydrated vanadium oxide. The concentration and degree of polycondensation of surface structures are determined by the oxygen content in the carrier-gas. Figures 3; references 6 (Russian).
