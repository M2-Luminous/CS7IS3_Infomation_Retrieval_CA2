FR941005-1-00013 FR941005-1-00004 FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION 12 CFR Part 327 RIN 3064&hyph;AB46 Assessments AGENCY: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. ACTION: Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Board of Directors (Board) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is seeking comment on whether the deposit-insurance assessment base currently provided for in the FDIC's assessments regulations should be redefined and, if so, how. Because of recent statutory amendments and other developments affecting insured depository institutions, the Board believes review of the assessment-base definition is desirable at this time. The FDIC will carefully consider comments received in response to this Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Notice) in determining whether revision of the assessment base is warranted. If the Board finds revision to be warranted, it will propose specific amendments on which public comment will then be invited. DATES: Written comments must be received by the FDIC on or before February 2, 1995. ADDRESSES: Written comments are to be addressed to the Office of the Executive Secretary, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 550_17th Street, NW, Washington, DC 20429. Comments may be hand-delivered to Room F&hyph;400, 1776 F Street, NW, Washington, DC 20429, on business days between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. (FAX number: (202) 898&hyph;3838).
