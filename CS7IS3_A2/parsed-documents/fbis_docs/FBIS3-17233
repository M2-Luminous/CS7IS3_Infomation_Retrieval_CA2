At present, both K. Morozov and B. Kozyn are candidates for deputies of Ukraine's Supreme Council. A few days ago, the Coordination Council of the Congress of Sevastopol Ukrainians appealed to residents of Kiev and Rozhnyativ who had nominated these military figures, and called upon them to give support to K. Morozov and B. Kozhyn at the elections. In particular, the Sevastopol Ukrainians' appeal reads that it is precisely Kostyantyn Morozov who "did everything he could not to allow the conclusion of the scandalous agreement on leasing out Sevastopol for 99 years or selling the Ukrainian part of the Black Sea Fleet to Russia. General Morozov has been and continues to be an authoritative and well-respected person not only in the Army." That is why the Coordination Council of the Congress of Sevastopol Ukrainians called upon the voters of Kiev Constituency No. 1 to vote for the former defense minister of Ukraine. Sevastopol Ukrainians turned with an identical appeal to residents of the town of Rozhnyativ in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast where former commander of Ukraine's Naval Forces is registered as a candidate for Ukraine's people's deputy. The elections will show whether the electorate has heeded the appeal by the Coordination Council of Sevastopol Ukrainians.
