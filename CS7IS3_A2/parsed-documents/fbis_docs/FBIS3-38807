Mr Reynolds said he had provided "copious clarification" of the document he signed along with John Major in London on December 15. He told a European Parliament candidates selection meeting of his Fianna Fail party in Dublin that he had given clarification of the declaration in numerous statements as well as in a lengthy response last week to a letter from Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams. "Since such clarification was requested from us we are entitled to expect that it would be carefully studied and taken into account," he said. "Two months after the joint peace declaration it is time for political realism and for a clear decision soon ..." he added. [passage omitted] Mr Reynolds warned against thinking that clarification from London for the Republicans was all that was needed and said the role of the Irish Government was central to the peace process. He said it was clear the armed conflict could resolve nothing and equally clear that bilateral dialogue or negotiation between Sinn Fein and Britain, without regard to Dublin or the other Northern Ireland political parties, would also fail to solve the impasse. "I have provided comprehensive textual clarification," he added. "I have presented a closely argued analysis of how self-determination is applied in international law in partitioned countries worldwide. I would expect people to study it and respond to it and not to treat the issue simplistically," he urged.
