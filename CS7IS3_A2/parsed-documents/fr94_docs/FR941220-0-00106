FR941220-0-00106 FR941220-0-00014 (2) Actual wage. In addition to payroll data required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section (and also by the Fair Labor Standards Act), the employer shall retain documentation specifying the basis it used to establish the actual wage. The employer shall show how the wage set for the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant relates to the wages paid by the employer to all other individuals with similar experience and qualifications for the specific employment in question at the place of employment. Where adjustments are made in the employer's pay system or scale during the validity period of the LCA, the employer shall retain documentation explaining the changes and clearly showing that, after such adjustments, the wages paid to the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant are at least the greater of the adjusted actual wage or the prevailing wage for the occupation and area of intended employment. See appendix A to subpart H. (3) Prevailing wage. The employer also shall retain documentation regarding its determination of the prevailing wage. This source documentation shall not be submitted to ETA with the labor condition application, but shall be retained at the employer's place of business for the length of time required in ยง XXXX .760(c) of this part. Such documentation shall consist of the documentation described in paragraph (b)(3) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this section and the documentation described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. (i) If the employer used a wage determination issued pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act, 40 U.S.C. 276a et seq. (see 29 CFR part 1), or the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act, 41 U.S.C. 351 et seq. (see 29 CFR part 4), the documentation shall include a copy of the determination showing the wage rate for the occupation in the area of intended employment. (ii) If the employer used an applicable wage rate from a union contract which was negotiated at arms-length between a union and the employer, the documentation shall include an excerpt from the union contract showing the wage rate(s) for the occupation. (iii) If the employer did not use a wage covered by the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) (i) or (ii) of this section, the employer's documentation shall consist of: (A) A copy of the prevailing wage finding from the SESA for the occupation within the area of intended employment; or (B) A copy of the prevailing wage survey for the occupation within the area of intended employment published by an independent authoritative source. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B), a prevailing wage survey for the occupation in the area of intended employment published by an authoritative independent source shall mean a survey of wages published in a book, newspaper, periodical, loose-leaf service, newsletter, or other similar medium, within the 24-month period immediately preceding the filing of the employer's application. Such survey shall: ( 1 ) Reflect the average wage paid to workers similarly employed in the area of intended employment; ( 2 ) Be based upon recently collected data_ e.g., within the 24-month period immediately preceding the date of publication of the survey; and ( 3 ) Represent the latest published prevailing wage finding by the independent authoritative source for the occupation in the area of intended employment; or (C) A copy of the prevailing wage survey or other source data acquired from a legitimate source of wage information that was used to make the prevailing wage determination. For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C) of this section, a prevailing wage provided by another legitimate source of such wage information shall be one which: ( 1 ) Reflects the weighted average wage paid to workers similarly employed in the area of intended employment; ( 2 ) Is based on the most recent and accurate information available; and ( 3 ) Is reasonable and consistent with recognized standards and principles in producing a prevailing wage. (c) Satisfaction of required wage obligation. (1) The required wage must be paid to the employee, cash in hand, free and clear, when due, except that deductions made in accordance with paragraph (c)(7) of this section may reduce the cash wage below the level of the required wage. (2) ``Wages paid,'' for purposes of satisfying the H&hyph;1B required wage, shall consist only of those payments that meet all the following criteria: (i) Payments shown in the employer's payroll records as earnings for the employee, and disbursed to the employee, cash in hand, free and clear, when due, except for deductions authorized by paragraph (c)(7) of this section; (ii) Payments reported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as the employee's earnings, with appropriate withholding for the employee's tax paid to the IRS (in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 U.S.C. 1, et seq. ); (iii) Payments of the tax reported and paid to the IRS as required by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, 26 U.S.C. 3101, et seq. (FICA). The employer must be able to document that the payments have been so reported to IRS and that both the employer's and employee's taxes have been paid except that when the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant is a citizen of a foreign country with which the President of the United States has entered into an agreement as authorized by section 233 of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 433 ( i.e., an agreement establishing a totalization arrangement between the social security system of the United States and that of the foreign country), the employer's documentation shall show that all appropriate reports have been filed and taxes have been paid in the employee's home country. (iv) Payments reported, and so documented by the employer, as the employee's earnings, with appropriate employer and employee taxes paid to all other appropriate Federal, State, and local governments in accordance with any other applicable law. (3) For salaried employees, wages will be due in pro-rated installments ( e.g. , annual salary divided into 26 bi-weekly pay periods, where employer pays bi-weekly) paid no less often than monthly except that, in the event that the employer intends to use some other form of nondiscretionary payment to supplement the employee's regular/pro-rata pay in order to meet the required wage obligation ( e.g. , a quarterly production bonus), the employer's documentation of wage payments (including such supplemental payments) must show the employer's commitment to make such payment and the method of determining the amount thereof, and must show unequivocally that the required wage obligation was met for prior pay periods and, upon payment and distribution of such other payments that are pending, will be met for each current or future pay period.
