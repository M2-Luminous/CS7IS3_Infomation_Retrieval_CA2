FR941125-0-00004 FR941125-0-00003 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 12 CFR Part 3 [Docket No. 94&hyph;20] RIN 1557&hyph;AB14 Capital Adequacy: Net Unrealized Holding Gains and Losses on Available-For-Sale Securities AGENCY: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Treasury. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has determined not to adopt its proposal to include the Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 115, ``Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities'' (FAS 115), adjustment for net unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities in Tier 1 capital. Based upon analysis of the comments received and having considered the potential consequences of including the FAS 115 adjustment in Tier 1 capital, the OCC, in consultation with the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of Thrift Supervision (Federal banking agencies), determined not to amend the definition of Tier 1 capital as previously proposed. The OCC also decided to maintain the current requirement that national banks deduct net unrealized losses on equity securities when calculating Tier 1 capital. However, because FAS 115 changed the names and requirements of the security classifications in the investment portfolio, this final rule amends the definition of common stockholders' equity to reflect the revised classifications used for equity securities that are not in the trading account. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 27, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thomas G. Rees, Professional Accounting Fellow, (202) 874&hyph;5180; J.
