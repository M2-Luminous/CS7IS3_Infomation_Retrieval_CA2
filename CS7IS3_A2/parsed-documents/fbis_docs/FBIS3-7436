"We are going work for a negotiated settlement," In Sopheap, a representative for the guerrillas in Phnom Penh told AFP. The comments contrasted with a combative statement made earlier Monday by Khmer Rouge radio. The Khmer Rouge representative could not confirm rumors circulating here that the guerrillas' nominal leader, Khieu Samphan, would soon be arriving in Phnom Penh. Cambodia's co-prime minister, Hun Sen, told AFP Monday that the government "left the door open" to negotiations with the Khmer Rouge. Cambodian Government forces launched a major offensive against Khmer Rouge-held territories earlier this month.
