This was the first decline since the survey was started in 1954. These figures clearly indicate that demand for funds have remained in the doldrums both on the corporate and private individual level owing to a decline in capital investments and consumption because of the recession. Some quarters also point to the reluctance of banks to issue new loans. Aside from city banks, the seven trust and banking companies' loans outstanding stood at 25.4258 trillion yen, an increase of 4.1 percent over the prior year. The three long-term credit banks' loans outstanding stood at 47.4462 trillion yen, a drop of 0.2 percent from the prior year. Even the combined loans outstanding for city banks, trust and banking companies and long-term credit banks showed a 0.1-percent drop from the prior year, the first such decline since initiation of the survey. On the other hand, deposits at the 11 city banks as of the end of fiscal year 1993 stood at 196.168 trillion yen, reflecting a 2.0-percent increase from the prior year, the first increase in three years. Time deposits centered around large accounts declined, but corporate deposits and individual demand deposits increased. Preliminary estimates of outstanding debentures issued as of the end of fiscal year 1993 by long-term credit banks reflected a balance of 51.3323 trillion yen, a 0.9-percent decline from the prior year. Trust and banking company deposits outstanding stood at 10.919 trillion yen, an increase of 4.9 percent from the prior year.
