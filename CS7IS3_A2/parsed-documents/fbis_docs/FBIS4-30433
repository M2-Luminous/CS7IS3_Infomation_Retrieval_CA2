An official at Pomchonghangnyon, the Pan-National Federation of Youth-Students for Unification of the Fatherland, said that Choe, 25, a horticulture major on temporary leave from Seoul National University, had left for Moscow aboard a (North) Korean Airways Flight from a German Airport. Officials of Pomchonghangnyon, which arranged Choe's visit, saw him off at the airport, according to the source. It is not yet known whether Choe has already arrived in Pyongyang via Moscow or if he is still in the Russian capital. Pomchonghangnyon, the Joint Organization of South and North Korean Students Headquartered in Berlin, declined to comment on Choe's whereabouts, saying only that it will announce the relevant details in a few days. Choe, at a press conference here last Friday, said he planned to stay in Pyongyang for a couple of weeks to meet with key officials including North Korean President Kim Il-song to convey Hanchongnyon's position on peace and unification on the Korean peninsula. Hanchongnyon has entrusted Choe with contacting Kim Il-song, political groups and social organizations, clarifying its opposition to unification through absorption, demanding that Seoul and Pyongyang implement the South-North basic agreement, and calling for the conclusion of a North Korean-U.S. peace accord and a package deal on the nuclear problem. Choe will be the second representative of a South Korean student activists group to visit North Korea without government permission. Yim Su-kyong of Chongdaehyop, the defunct National Council of Student Representatives, visited the North Korean capital to participate in the Pyongyang Youth Festival from June 30 to Aug. 15, 1989. After returning through the truce village of Panmunjom, Yim was indicted and sentenced to five years' imprisonment. She was released under a special pardon on Dec. 24, 1992.
