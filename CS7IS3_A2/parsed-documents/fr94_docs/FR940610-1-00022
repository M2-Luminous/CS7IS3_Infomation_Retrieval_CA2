FR940610-1-00022 FR940610-1-00003 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Office of Thrift Supervision 12 CFR Parts 563b and 575 [No. 94&hyph;106] RIN 1550&hyph;AA74 Conversions From Mutual to Stock Form; Mutual Savings and Loan Holding Companies AGENCY: Office of Thrift Supervision. ACTION: Proposed rule; extension of comment period. SUMMARY: The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) is extending the comment period until July 18, 1994 for its proposed rule regarding conversions from mutual to stock form and mutual savings and loan holding companies that was published on May 3, 1994. DATES: Comments must be received by July 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Interested parties are invited to submit written comments on this proposal to: Director, Information Services Division, Public Affairs, Office of Thrift Supervision, 1700 G Street, NW., Washington, DC 20552, Attention: Docket No. 94&hyph;49. These submissions may be hand-delivered to 1700 G Street, NW., from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on business days, or may be sent by facsimile transmission to FAX number (202) 906&hyph;7755. Comments will be available for inspection at 1700 G Street, NW., from 1:00 p.m. until 4:00 p.m. on business days. Visitors will be escorted to and from the Public Reference Room at established intervals. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael P. Vallely, Senior Attorney (202) 906&hyph;6241, Kevin A. Corcoran, Assistant Chief Counsel, (202) 906&hyph;6962, Corporate and Securities Division, Chief Counsel's Office; Diana L. Garmus, Deputy Assistant Director, (202) 906&hyph;5683, Corporate Activities Division, Office of Thrift Supervision, 1700 G Street, NW., Washington, DC 20552. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The proposed rule, published in the Federal Register on May 3, 1994 (59 FR 22764), indicated that public comments were to be submitted to the OTS no later than July 17, 1994. This date was not properly calculated by the Office of the Federal Register . The requested closing date for comments was 45 days from date of publication, or June 17, 1994. A correction was published on June 7, 1994 (59 FR 29480). However, in order to afford the public adequate time to comment, the OTS has determined that closing date in the original notice should be used. The OTS believes that there has been sufficient level of confusion about the closing date to warrant reinstating the later date. Therefore, the comment period is hereby extended until July 18, 1994, as July 17 is not a business day. Dated: June 8, 1994. By the Office of Thrift Supervision. Jonathan L. Fiechter, Acting Director. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;14307 Filed 6&hyph;9&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6720&hyph;01&hyph;P
