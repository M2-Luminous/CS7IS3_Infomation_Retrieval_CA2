The significant preference for the Colorado Party increased after Sanguinetti achieved an electoral agreement with Senator Hugo Batalla, the leader of the social democratic Party for Government by the People, who will be the vice presidential candidate. According to the results of a nationwide poll by the Consultants Team Company, the Colorado Party has 33 percent of the preferences while 21 percent of the voters remain undecided. After the establishment of most of the presidential candidates, the Colorado Party has received the largest percentage of preferences in the polls since February 1993. The Colorado Party has maintained an upward trend after it reached its lowest point--26 percent--in July 1991, one year after the National Party (Blanco) administration of President Luis Alberto Lacalle was installed.
