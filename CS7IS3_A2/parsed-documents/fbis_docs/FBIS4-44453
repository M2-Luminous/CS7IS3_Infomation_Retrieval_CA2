In a short two years, Shanghai has first achieved spectacular breakthrough advances in expanding its money market scale. Shanghai Makes Plans in 1992 for Developing Into a "Financial Center" Financial reform had become imperative for China as to needs, such as marketizing the Chinese economy, spurring the economy "onto an international track," and taking better part in world economic circulation. The choice of a location with geograpahic advantages and a sizeable industrial base, in which to carry out this reform first, by developing a standardized money market, had become an especially important "contact" linking China to the outside world. The Chinese economy's decade-plus of developments and realities had determined this choice to be Shanghai. Deng Xiaoping, who had celebrated the Spring Festival in Shanghai for seven or eight years in a row, has always paid attention to Shanghai's reform and economic development. He pointed out in 1991 that: "Finance is very important, being the crux of a modern economy. Just as Shanghai used to be a financial center, a place of currency convertibility, it will be so again in the future. If China is to acquire international standing in finance, it will have to rely first on Shanghai." He went on to say that "we must begin now." In fact, while Shanghai was fully capable of undertaking this important mission, having conducted certain financial reforms earlier than the rest of China, it has taken genuinly bold reform steps only in the last two or three years. In early 1992, Shanghai clearly set forth its strategic goal of developing into "an international financial center" by the year 2010, including this in its urban development plans. Through a burst of effort, Shanghai has first achieved spectacular breakthrough advances in expanding its money market scale. The signs show that a long- and short-term money market system in mostly areas, such as securities, lending, and foreign exchange conversion, has begun to take shape in Shanghai. The Shanghai Stock Exchange has over 420 member companies everywhere throughout China. It has nearly 200 listed securities, of which 140 are listed stocks, almost one-third of which are in outside companies that were sold to foreigners. In 1993, its stock trading value topped 500 billion yuan, up seven times from 1992. On 11 March 1994, its stock trading value set a one-day record of 3.9 billion yuan, RMB and similarly hereinafter). Shanghai's stock market has become a veritable national market. Some hold that it is already showing signs of becoming a large Far Eastern and world-class market. Foreign Banks Swarm to Shanghai's Bund In 1993, Shanghai loaned over 232.9 billion RMB, while discounitng and rediscounting by Shanghai financial institutions amounted to more than 22 billion RMB. Its lending net has spread from the eastern zone to all of China. The most recent figures show that Shanghai's foreign exchange conversion center conducted transactions in 1993 worth $5.294 billion, making 1993 its biggest year since its opening in 1988. In the first seven trading days of 1994, its foreign exchange conversion transactions reached $126 million, making for a brisk and stable foreign exchange market. To help Sino-foreign joint ventures avoid risks, Shanghai also began foreign exchange futures services in 1993, with the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China recently establishing a "foreign exchange treasure" service with a more than 10-percent discount for individual foreign exchange transactions, immediately invigorating individual foreign currency trading, with the first 10 days of 1994 bringing a transaction value of nearly $2 million. This conversion center has also completed its linkup with six key domestic cities. The first national foreign exchange market established on these grounds will open soon. In the near future, Shanghai's decisive money market standing and role in China and even the Far East will be emphasized similarly by the international business world. Foreign banks and financial institutions have competed to swarm into Shanghai in recent years, becoming a large part of Shanghai's landscape. Since financial institutions, such as Japan's Sanwa Bank and Societe Generale, the U.S. Huaqi [5363 2475] Bank, France's Oriental Exchange Bank, Britain's Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp, and the Sino-foreign joint ventures of the Shanghai-Paris International Bank and the Shanghai International Financial Corp, were allowed to set up branches in Shanghai in 1991, foreign financial institutions have come one after another to set up on Shanghai's Bund. By now, 26 foreign banks have opened branches in Shanghai, with 56 others from throughout the world having set up representative offices in Shanghai, waiting for permission to "upgrade." Shanghai has become mainland China's province or municipality with the most foreign and domestic financial institutions, with statistics showing that by the end of 1993, foreign financial institutions had assets in Shanghai totaling $3.2 billion, or three times that of 1992. Shanghai had by the end of 1993 a foreign exchange deposit balance of $470 million, and a foreign exchange loan balance of $1.296 billion, both of which figures were up 150 percent from 1992. Shanghai's "Bund" Regains Its Significance Shanghai's existing over 6,600 foreign-funded enterprises undoubtedly provide forceful business support for foreign financial institutions. Foreign banks act as intermediaries in attracting foreign investment to Shanghai, as well as providing services for the Shanghai region in areas, such as export settlement and import accounting. In the last one or two years, foreign financial institutions have used their respective advantages to participate enthusiastically with international or Chinese banking consortiums in lending, in support of Shanghai's large and mid-sized state enterprise production. For instance, 10 Sino-foreign financial institutions, such as the Netherlands Trading Bank, leading the way, the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, and the Lyons Credit Bank, have participated in financing, providing $50 million in seven-year commercial loans to Pudong's Waigaoqiao power plant; the Shanghai branch of the BOC has taken the lead in foreign bank participation in providing loans to projects, such as $60 million to Shanghai's Yongxin Color Display Imaging Corp Ltd. Since the U.S. Friendship Insurance Company began operation in Shanghai, its business has become ever brisker, making it a strong competitive adversary to Shanghai's existing state-owned insurance companies. In early 1994, the U.S. Huaqi Bank was the first to move its Chinese head office from Hong Kong to Shanghai. While the French Lyons Credit Bank has just been officially named, its first action involved its Chinese head office. All of this shows that Shanghai is actually already demonstrating the standing and role of a regional financial center. In order to step up to its goal of becoming an "international financial center," Shanghai is now taking a series of steps to speed up this process. The "Bund" is a symbol of the international significance of the metropolis of Shanghai. Its cluster of tall buildings in grand style towering along the banks of the Huangpu Jiang [River] has played roles varying with the changing times. At one time, it was seen as a symbol of "imperalist aggression." Later, its fine regional environment made it a tourist destination. However, its genuine role in setting off Shanghai's march toward achieving its goal of becoming a modern international metropolis needs reacknowledged. A Financial District Rebuilds on the Banks of the Huangpu Jiang Records show that of the tall buildings towering along the Bund, 113 were originally bank buildings, making the Bund the site of old Shanghai's most concentrated financial institutions. Since Shanghai set its goal of developing into an "international financial center," the Bund has been included in its development plans, to be developed along with the "small Lujiazui" district across the river into Shanghai's "central business district." Its row of tall buildings is being returned to their true "financial" colors. So at the end of 1993, Shanghai set up the "Shanghai Municipal Building Replacement Corporation." This company will sell these large buildings in forms, such as invitation of bids, auctions, and agreements. Once this news was released, domestic financial institutions rushed to get in on it first, with the former "Central Bank" that later became the location of the "Spaceflight Tower" now becoming the "China Foreign Exchange Trading Center," and the Shanghai branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China occupying a key location. The Shanghai Municipal Government has now built a tower in People's Square, and is expected to move its offices there within the year from their current location (the former Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp tower). When Shanghai's foreign financial institutions heard the news, they also came in streams to make arrangements. Banks such as the U.S. Morgan Bank and Huaqi Bank, the Swiss National Bank, the French Lyons Bank, and the Oriental Exchange Bank, were the first to take action. It is understood that Shanghai is drawing up the first draft of a legal document concerning the many problems involved in the Bund's building replacement, to help to standardize the work. Speeding up the computerization of its banking industry is also an effective step being taken by the Shanghai Municipal Government. Since the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China put out Mainland China's first credit card, the "Great Wall Card," in 1987, five credit cards from various banks are now in circulation, with cardholder consumption topping 1 billion RMB a year. But as cardholding by special business firms and available ATMs were still too small-scale, the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of China set up and organized in 1993 the Shanghai Credit Card Network Corp Ltd, to issue "Gold Cards." By the end of 1993, it had begun to complete the establishment of an ATM/POS joint-network information system. Once all credit cards throughout Shanghai are linked to this network, there will be a new market order. In addition, the various categories of services available to Shanghai banking circles over the long-distance satellite communications system are growing steadily. The Shanghai Stock Exchange's long-distance communications network has now linked up all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions except for the Taiwan region, with its transaction and settlement accuracy and speed already up to the most advanced world stock market level of T + 0 [formula as published]. Moreover, Shanghai's promotion of reform to convert specialized banks to commercial ones is also now in intense progress. In the new Pudong zone, the operating style of the 11 biggest Chinese-owned financial institutions througout China is already quite flexible, with the Shanghai, Pudong Development Bank, operating completely according to international banking standards, being China's first local shareholding bank. In less than a year after its establishment, its assets have reached 6 billion RMB, drawing increased public respect. Driven by rapid money market development, Shanghai's related intermediary service agencies, such as stock companies, accounting, auditing, and legal offices, credit evaluators, notaries, arbitrators, and information advisors, are also developing very quickly, ranking first in China as to numbers, thus forming a quite complete service system.
