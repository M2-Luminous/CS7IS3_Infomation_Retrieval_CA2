Leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) and central government Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Zhu Rongji, Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao and Rong Yiren attended today's meeting to extend their greetings. The meeting was presided over by Li Ruihuan, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, and attended by 1,860 CPPCC National Committee members from all over China. The meeting first examined and adopted an agenda for the current session of the CPPCC National Committee. According to the agenda, members of the national committee will: examine a work report by the CPPCC National Committee; attend the second plenary session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) as nonvoting delegates; deliberate draft amendments to the CPPCC Constitution; discuss a report by the proposal sub-committee of the CPPCC National Committee; examine various resolutions; and elect new vice-chairmen, standing committee members and secretary-general of the CPPCC National Committee. Entrusted by the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee, CPPCC National Committee Vice-Chairman Ye Xuanping delivered a report on the work of the Standing Committee. Ye said that since its first plenary session held a year ago, guided by Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the CPPCC National Committee has been exploring new ways to engage in political consultations and exercise supervision over government work. "The CPPCC National Committee is now playing a significant role in China's political, economic and cultural life," he told the meeting. Ye described 1994 as a "year of vital importance" for China's reforms, opening up and modernization drive. He called on all CPPCC organizations and members to hold high the banner of patriotism and socialism, work hard to help implement the central task of the CPC and the government, and better perform their duties of participating in political consultations and exercising democratic supervision over government work. The CPPCC leader also called on these organizations and members to improve their work efficiency and make greater contributions to continued reforms, open policy implementation, economic growth and social stability. Attendants listened to an explanation on draft amendments to the CPPCC constitution, which has played an important role in creating a new situation in CPPCC work since its adoption in 1982. However, given a changed situation brought about by reforms, implementation of the open policy and the modernization drive, and in view of new developments of CPPCC's own work, a number of stipulations of the constitution stand in need of revision, according to the explanation. The draft amendments to the CPPCC constitution have been adopted by the fifth meeting of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee and are being submitted to the general session for examination and adoption.
