SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 984, both as amended (7 CFR part 984), regulating the handling of walnuts grown in California. The marketing agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the provisions of the marketing order now in effect, California walnuts are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment rate as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable walnuts handled during the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year, which began August 1, 1994, and ends July 31, 1995. This interim final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. There are approximately 5,000 producers of California walnuts under this marketing order, and approximately 65 handlers. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of California walnut producers and handlers may be classified as small entities. The budget of expenses for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year was prepared by the Walnut Marketing Board, the agency responsible for local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Board are producers and handlers of California walnuts. They are familiar with the Board's needs and with the costs of goods and services in their local areas and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget. The budget was formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have had an opportunity to participate and provide input. The assessment rate recommended by the Board was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected merchantable certifications of California walnuts. Because that rate will be applied to the actual quantity of certified merchantable walnuts, it must be established at a rate that will provide sufficient income to pay the Board's expenses. The Board met September 9, 1994, and unanimously recommended a 1994&hyph;95 budget of $2,170,772, $229,125 more than the previous year. Budget items for 1994&hyph;95 which have increased compared to those budgeted for 1993&hyph;94 (in parentheses) are: Administrative salaries, $101,712 ($101,331), Board expenses, $35,000 ($32,000), office rent, $26,419 ($25,704), domestic market research and development, $953,000 ($875,000), walnut production research, $718,302 ($438,488), crop survey, $45,000 ($43,000), and crop estimate, $60,000 ($52,000). Items which have decreased compared to the amount budgeted for 1993&hyph;94 (in parentheses) are: social security and hospital insurance taxes, $8,129 ($9,700), group life, retirement, and medical, $44,370 ($47,485), office salaries, $40,740 ($40,771), equipment maintenance and warranties, $10,000 ($12,000), furniture, fixtures, and automobiles, $5,000 ($20,000), and production research director, $40,000 ($91,068). The Board also eliminated funding for export market research and development and the reserve for contingencies for which $20,000 and $50,000 were recommended last year, respectively. All other items are budgeted at last year's amounts.
