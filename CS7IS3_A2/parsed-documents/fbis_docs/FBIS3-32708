What do you know about this? [Rebolledo] I have been unable to establish the basis or the source of these reports. The president has said the secretary general of government will continue to act as the government spokesman. I have already performed several assignments for the administration that will be installed in March. Moreover, this is one of the three posts that deal with the political sector and as such it has an indisputably political role. [Oyarzun] How do you see your post within the government's three political ministries? [Rebolledo] To efficiently fulfill the duties the law assigns to the General Secretariat of Government through the directorates under its jurisdiction, and to look after social organizations and the government's political communications. In addition, there is a political role which is more intangible and which deals with issues on the agenda. [Oyarzun] Do you think the Frei administration will have a more difficult task than [Chilean President Patricio] Aylwin's? [Rebolledo] I believe the Frei administration will face different problems. Many issues that were a priority in President Aylwin's administration -- such as development and the progress of the democratic transition -- are not at the top of the agenda as they were in 1990. Better civic-military ties, the certainty of continued economic stability that results in interesting growth rates, the expansion of Chilean markets, and healthy macroeconomic guidelines will help. Right now we have a more complex economic situation than President Aylwin's administration had to face: International recession has an impact on our economy. Although I am not frightened by it, some believe that as democracy consolidates itself, social conflicts -- which in Chile have been extremely scarce -- will increase. [Oyarzun] What is your response to criticism that President-elect Frei has been more "politically cautious" in appointing his cabinet than Aylwin? [Rebolledo] I disagree. President-elect Frei appointed his cabinet fully exercising his prerogatives. [passage omitted] [Oyarzun] You have admitted that you were not surprised by your appointment as minister in charge of the political sector. Why? [Rebolledo] We made a great effort in the current legislature to show our representative force nationwide but this was not the case in the last legislature where we only had seven deputies. One of our goals was for one of our members to head a political affairs ministry. [Oyarzun] How long do you think you will be in the cabinet? [Rebolledo] One tends to think that during a six-year term, an administration such as the one headed by President Frei will work with a couple of teams, at least. But beyond what is established by common sense, it is very difficult to predict. [Oyarzun] Are you planning to run for deputy or senator in four years or so? [Rebolledo] I am very involved in politics and thus cannot reject this possibility, but I am not working toward this goal. I am fully concentrated on being a loyal and efficient cabinet member of the Frei administration. [Oyarzun] Will this administration be beyond political parties or will political parties have great participation? [Rebolledo] I believe both. President Aylwin's administration was beyond political parties but it also allowed the participation of those political parties that had incipient cadres as a result of the military government that we were leaving behind. For the past four years, political parties have experienced three national elections: the 1989 presidential and legislative elections, the 1992 municipal elections, and the 1993 presidential election held last December. Political parties are stronger, they are more clearly aware of their true forces and know which of the almost 30 political parties both in the government and the opposition are mere acronyms. President Frei will have an administration that is beyond political parties. [Oyarzun] The newly appointed PS [Socialist Party] President Camilo Escalona, has stated he will ask the government to restore diplomatic ties with Cuba. Do you agree? [Rebolledo] Yes, I have always said that Chile should have diplomatic ties with all countries, particularly with Latin American countries. Chile and Paraguay are the only Latin American countries that do not have diplomatic ties with Cuba; restoring these ties would be advantageous for Chile and for Chilean businessmen. [Oyarzun] Will Fidel Castro be invited to the inauguration? [Rebolledo] No, because Chile does not maintain diplomatic ties with Cuba. That is my personal opinion, but the foreign policy is encompassed in the platform of the Coalition of Parties for Democracy and is implemented by the president and his foreign minister. [passage omitted] [Oyarzun] All administrations -- including the current one -- pressure the media, either through summons, appeals, suggestions, etc. How will you handle the situation? [Rebolledo] I would never pressure any member of the media nor would I summon them out of principle or for simple practical reasons. I believe it is improper and harmful to pressure the media. However, I will react if faced with any erroneous reportage, but this is something else. [Oyarzun] Why do people say that you are against journalists? [Rebolledo] I am very pleased with my ties with the press. I have studied each situation individually and conclude that I know many important journalists and many who are just starting. This has been gratifying because we are engaged in an activity that is good for the country with people from different levels. I have a positive assessment of the responsible way in which the press has worked during these four years of the transition process. I believe it has greatly contributed to the excellent transition period we have experienced. Even though this administration does not control any member of the media, it is leaving office with great prestige. This is because the press has acted objectively and responsibly. [Oyarzun] During your years in exile, did you ever think of overthrowing the military government through armed struggle? [Rebolledo] Never. I have never believed in the armed struggle and have always rejected it. [Oyarzun] What credit would you give to the 17-year military government? [Rebolledo] Although at a very heavy cost -- with which I disagree -- I believe they helped to modernize the country. [passage omitted]
