At this meeting, Mr. al-Hatm referred to the longstanding ties between the two countries and said that the basis for fraternal relations between Iran and Qatar is their common religious and historical heritage. He added that one of the fundamental policies of his country is to observe the principle of mutual respect and to refrain from interference in the internal affairs of other countries. Mr. Nateq-Nuri then stressed the need to establish cordial ties between regional countries, in particular among the Islamic states. Furthermore, he said that the spread of Islam and the desire for Islam are the main cause of global arrogance's enmity toward world Muslims. He added that the ruthless massacre of the Muslim people of Bosnia-Herzegovina serves to prove such a claim. The Majles speaker, moreover, criticized the double standards adopted by the world's so-called human rights organizations and forums. He referred to the horrific crime of the Zionists in the al-Khalil [Hebron] mosque, and stressed: The al-Khalil atrocity will certainly not be the Zionists' last crime. The only way to confront the enemies of Islam is by displaying unity among world Muslims. He continued his remarks by alluding to the existing problems in the sensitive and strategic Persian Gulf region. He emphasized that the region's security should be safeguarded by the region's people. He asserted: In its attempt to create discord among the countries of the region, the enemy has entered the arena under the pretext of bringing about security, whereas in fact it is disrupting the region's security. Mr. Nateq-Nuri also referred to relations between the two friendly and fraternal countries of Qatar and the Islamic Republic of Iran. He alluded to the religious, historical, and geographical traits that the two countries have in common, and said: Because of these common traits, and also because of the fair stances adopted by the Government of Qatar during the course of the war imposed by Iraq on Iran, the Islamic Republic of Iran reserves a special regard for Qatar. The Majles speaker then expressed the hope that cordial and fraternal ties between Tehran and Doha will serve as an exemplary model for all the Persian Gulf littoral states.
