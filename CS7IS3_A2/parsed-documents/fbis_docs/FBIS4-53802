After nearly four years of research and financial aid of 500 million won from the Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry, an electronic engineering department team at Kwangun University led by Prof. Na Kuk-hwan said Friday it has developed a satellite transponder for broadcasting on the tricky Ku frequency band. Industry sources say a Ku-band transponder is designed to operate in space for more than 10 years and can be installed in a satellite anytime for satellite broadcasting as well as communications. "We will be able to install Korean-made transponders in satellites and save some 800 million won for every unit in doing so," Na said. He said the transponder can be widely applied in satellite receivers, ground stations and cellular facilities for satellite broadcasting. Na's development will be awarded the top prize in the government-sponsored industry-academy-research cooperation.
