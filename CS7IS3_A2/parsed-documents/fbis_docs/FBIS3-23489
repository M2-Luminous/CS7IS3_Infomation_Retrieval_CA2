The message said that the fugitive terrorists had not left the country but were still hiding in Thailand. It has also been found that the group has shifted their objective from the targeted embassy to assasination attempts against high-level officials of that same embassy. "Major targets are high- level officials of the U.S. and Israeli Embassies, as well as those at the Pakistani and some other embassies," the source said. The source also revealed that U.S. and Thai intelligence authorities found that, on the day the terrorist abandoned the truck, he left a black James Bond briefcase on the truck. It is believed the briefcase contained some important documents. But the case disappeared during the time the truck was parked near the Lumphini police station. The Police Department and the Metropolitan Police Division have already set up a committee to investigate how the briefcase disappeared.
