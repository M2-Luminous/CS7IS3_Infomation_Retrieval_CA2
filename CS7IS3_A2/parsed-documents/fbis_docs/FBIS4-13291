In an interview with the Japanese newspaper ASAHI SHIMBUN and Asahi television, President Mubarak said that Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat is still the leader who enjoys the respect of the Palestinians, and that his leadership has not been shaken. Most of the Palestinian people respect the leadership of 'Arafat, who has sacrificed a great deal for the sake of his homeland. The text of President Mubarak's interview follows: [ASAHI] Mr. President, the target date for Israel's withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho on 13 April has passed. What were the obstacles that have caused this delay, and which party is to blame for it? Can Your Excellency tell us of any specific date for the signing of the final agreement? [Mubarak] The 13th of April has indeed passed, and this is due to some obstacles in regard to security measures affecting the Palestinians and the Israelis, particularly on the border between Gaza and Egypt and between the West Bank and Jordan. There are some other problems regarding land and how to deal with crimes that could occur in any of these areas. There were many problems, but the situation is now improving, and the two parties are about to solve many of them. I hope that they will reach agreement by the end of this month or the first week of May at the latest, and immediately after that the withdrawal will begin. Regarding the negotiations, you cannot say that the Israelis or the Palestinians are responsible for the delay. Both sides are responsible. Let us be frank. The Israelis have the land but the Palestinians have nothing. Therefore, concessions must be made. Problems and obstacles are expected in the negotiations, but they must continue because they are the only way to establish peace and to solve the problems. I think that the two parties are about to reach a settlement on these problems. [ASAHI] Mr. President, it appears that Yasir 'Arafat's leadership of the Palestinians is shaky because of the delay in implementing the Declaration of Principles. What is your assessment of his leadership? [Mubarak] We cannot say that 'Arafat's leadership is shaky. I can tell you that the assessments of the foreign agencies and those who do not live in the area are not totally correct. Sometimes these assessments are wrong because of false information given the media by some factions that do not want peace to prevail or for problems to be solved. 'Arafat is still the leader of the PLO and enjoys the respect of the Palestinians. You will hear voices here and there. No one can expect all the Palestinians to agree on 'Arafat's leadership. There is Hamas and other factions. But the majority of the people want peace, and respect the leadership of 'Arafat, who has sacrificed a great deal for the sake of his homeland. 'Arafat is the one who makes the decisions. There is a council that assists him. He discusses all points with the council, but he makes the decisions on the basis of the discussions with the council, the PLO Executive Committee. Therefore, the man is strong. Had there been another man now, I do not think it would have been possible to reach a settlement. [ASAHI] You met recently with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. What is your assessment of President al-Asad's real intentions regarding the peace process with Israel, what are the major obstacles hindering peace between Syria and Israel, and how optimistic are you about making progress in the Syrian-Israeli peace talks? [Mubarak] Although the major problem hindering the Syrian-Israeli negotiations is represented by the lack of confidence between the two sides, I can frankly say that President al-Asad wants to reach a peaceful settlement, recover the Golan Heights, and find a very fair agreement. There is no way other than negotiations to achieve peace. Every leader is eager to see peace prevail in his country so that he can dedicate all his efforts to his people's prosperity and provide job opportunities for all so the people can have a chance to live and work in peace. The same thing goes for Israel. But the lack of confidence I mentioned before raises some doubts among the Israelis. Through my contacts with both sides, I can see that both want to reach a peaceful settlement through negotiations. Let us be realistic. The Golan Heights must be returned fully to Syria, otherwise there will be a major obstacle to peace, not only with Syria, but with all the other parties as well. This issue is important, very important. The Syrians will never agree to sign a peace accord unless they regain their occupied territories. We did the same thing; we did not relinquish an inch of our territories. It is not the leaders who say that; the public urge the leaders not to make any concessions, not even an inch of land. [ASAHI] Egypt has played an important role in the Middle East peace process. At present, you play a central role in the peace negotiations. What kind of role is Egypt likely to play to reach a comprehensive, peaceful settlement in the Middle East? [Mubarak] We are helping on all fronts. Egypt is a major state in this region; it is the biggest regional state. It regained its occupied lands through negotiations, war, more negotiations, and then the International Court of Justice. We have much experience in that field and we know how to negotiate. Negotiations involving land are very difficult and complicated. We are trying to narrow the differences between the Israelis and Palestinians, and even between the Israelis and the Syrians and between the Israelis and the other parties. As far as the Palestinian problem is concerned, we are helping the Palestinians, we support the peace process, and we are trying hard to bring the views of the PLO and the Israeli Government closer. I believe that what we did brought the parties together in Oslo and then in Cairo. The parties are holding negotiations in Cairo at present. I hope these negotiations will produce an agreement soon. [ASAHI] The problem of the settlements in the occupied territories seems to be very hard to solve. How can this problem be solved in your view? [Mubarak] This is a very hard and complex question. When the second framework of the Camp David accord on the Palestinian problem and settlements was signed, the number of settlements was 48, all of which were small. There are 180 big settlements at present. This will be the major obstacle in the coming phase of negotiations for a comprehensive peace settlement. I hope a good solution will be found for this problem through negotiations. [ASAHI] What kind of solution? [Mubarak] I cannot speak on behalf of either the Palestinians or the Israelis. We will do our utmost to examine the various options and ideas on both sides with the help of the United States and others. We will try to narrow the gap between the two sides to find a solution to this very complex problem. Had the problem been addressed in 1978 it would have been much easier. With 48 small settlements, many could have been removed and settlers could have found some other job. But what are they going to do now when there are 180 settlements? It is a major problem, both for the Palestinians and the Israelis. [ASAHI] What is the Egyptian strategy to expand the peace process? [Mubarak] Negotiations are proceeding with the Palestinians right now over the first phase. Then there will be a timetable for negotiations on the final status of the occupied territories. In the meantime, the Israelis are negotiating with the Syrians on returning the occupied Golan Heights. There are some small problems with Jordan. I believe that all these negotiations will eventually reach a final settlement. [ASAHI] Through Egypt's mediation? [Mubarak] I told you from the beginning that Egypt is playing the role of mediator and that some of Egypt's efforts have not been publicized. We do not disclose them to the media. Some parties release certain information that we do not want to reveal to the media because they might ruin or complicate negotiations. We are doing our utmost. [ASAHI] When do you think a comprehensive peace agreement will be concluded? [Mubarak] We hope this will happen in 1994. There must be an agreement with the Syrians, the Palestinians, and all the parties concerned. I hope so. I am very optimistic. [ASAHI] What is your assessment of the situation concerning terrorism? [Mubarak] Terrorism exists in Egypt just like it does all over the world. It is everywhere right now. As far as Egypt is concerned, we ruled out a dialogue with these criminals--I cannot describe them as Muslims. They have been criminals since 1981, and in 1992 they started to use force to kill civilians. The Egyptian police are not accustomed to killing anyone, except in self-defense. When these criminals started to attack the police and civilians on the streets here and there, the police had to be more effective. The police are responsible to public opinion; they have to safeguard domestic peace. Therefore, the situation must be under their control. We have no concerns in this connection. The problem is that these people are being financed by foreign quarters, probably Egyptians or persons from other states who used to fight in Afghanistan. Many of them are in Yemen at present. [ASAHI] Can you specify the names of these states? [Mubarak] I have told you that I generally do not reveal all the information available to me. But everybody knows this all over the world. Ask the Jordanians and all the states that have terrorism. Terrorism exists in Turkey, in your country, Japan, in the United States, Germany, France, Asia, everywhere. [ASAHI] What is the reason for the sudden postponement of your visit to Japan? [Mubarak] It was not sudden. The prime minister resigned and the government is busy selecting a new prime minister. It is not proper to visit Japan at such a time; they have not appointed a prime minister. He might be appointed today; and the visit was supposed to begin today. I could not have gone there while the government was experiencing a change. Your parliament will still have to approve the appointment, probably on Wednesday. Therefore, I believe that it is difficult. The public would ask me why I visited Japan when there was no government there. But relations between Egypt and Japan are good. The sudden postponement was due to the sudden resignation of the prime minister. [ASAHI] Will you visit Japan in the near future? [Mubarak] Certainly. Once the new government takes over we will fix another date to visit Japan. [ASAHI] Do you believe that Japan should play a bigger role in this region? [Mubarak] I believe that it has a quite significant role in this connection. It can at least contribute to the region's development. I am talking about the occupied territories in our region, including Syria and all the equally-important states. That is how we look to Japan. This kind of contribution is very effective in developing the states that will constitute the foundation of the modern age after peace has been established. I believe that Japan is capable of playing a very significant role in developing this part of the world. [ASAHI] The Palestinians and Chairman 'Arafat are frustrated by the delay in implementing the agreement, while the Israelis are indifferent to that delay. What are your observations on this difference in positions? [Mubarak] It is a political game.
