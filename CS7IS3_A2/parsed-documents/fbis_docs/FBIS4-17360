The circle of people asked for questioning as witnesses keeps widening. The office of Aleksandr Gorbunov, investigator of especially important cases under the Russian Federation general prosecutor, has already been visited by both the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA founder and staffers of its politics desk. Aleksandr Yakovlev and Oleg Poptsov are expected to testify. Mr. Gorbunov has stressed specially that the instituted case has nothing to do with OBSHCHAYA GAZETA. If one is to judge from his questions, the investigation's attention is centered not so much on the authors of the notorious document (who obviously have been identified) as on the need to "pinpoint" the channels along which it was circulated, and the persons interested in that. If this is how it really is, the publication in OBSHCHAYA GAZETA, too, pursued the same goal. As is known to the editorial office, Gleb Pavlovskiy, the "legal" author of the analytical note, has stated that he will decline to testify, believing the prosecutor's office actions unlawful. His arguments are like this: The text of the "Version" speaks about an intention to remove the president from power, not by a forcible and unlawful way but by legal means. Hence the prosecutor's office has no grounds for instituting a libel case that entails charges of committing an especially dangerous crime against the State (Article 130, Part 3, Russian Federation Criminal Code). Pavlovskiy maintains that he and his colleagues are being subjected to groundless pressure primarily from the Federal Counterintelligence Service. It is this pressure, as well as direct threats, according to Pavlovskiy, that force him and his colleague, Simon Kordonskiy, co-director of the "The 20th Century and Peace" analytical center, whom KURANTY recently named (together with Andrey Makarov, Mikhail Lukin, and Pavlovskiy himself) as a co-author of the "Version," to hide from the authorities. In Kordonskiy's opinion, the scandal around the publication has generally been used by the Federal Counterintelligence Service to convince the president of its loyalty, to become stronger, and to feel around for ways to revive political police in Russia.
