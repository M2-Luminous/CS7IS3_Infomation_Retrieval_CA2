FBIS3-52732 "drnes005_o_94003" FBIS-NES-94-005 Document Type:Daily Report 7 Jan 1994 SYRIA Commentary Assails Israeli `Provocation' JN0501163994 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 1230 GMT 5 Jan 94 JN0501163994 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Station commentary] [Text] While the world is looking with hope and confidence to the Syrian-U.S. summit in Geneva mid-January, Israeli Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer has inaugurated a new quarter in the Qatzrin settlement in the occupied Syrian Golan. He also distributed 500 housing units to extremist Jews who publicly insist they will stay on this Syrian territory and not give it back to its owners, even in return for peace. The Israeli minister has pledged to develop and expand Zionist settlements on the Golan. Naturally, Ben-Eli'ezer was assigned by the Rabin government to carry out this blatant, provocative action, which is part of new-old scheme to undermine the peace process, sabotage the U.S. initiative, circumvent in advance the results of the Clinton-al-Asad summit, and put the United States and the world face to face with a fait accompli. Everybody knows that Israel has tried, since the signing of the Oslo agreement, to mislead the world and the United States by claiming that peace has been established in the region, that the Palestine question has been resolved, and that peace efforts on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks can be put on hold. Furthermore, Israel has feverishly sought to marginalize Syria's role, exclude Security Council resolutions, and replace the objective of a just and comprehensive peace with separate deals, such as the Gaza-Jericho agreement. However, all these misleading attempts did not last long. The Americans, and the world, have discovered that the Oslo agreement will not lead to peace and that it has created new obstacles to a comprehensive solution in the Middle East. It was not merely a courtesy that Secretary Christopher praised Syria's key role in the peace process and arranged for a summit meeting between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton. Since the announcement of the summit, the Israelis have cast doubt on the point behind it and leaked misleading information about an alleged Syrian role in this or that incident. Their maneuvers, however, did not find any response. So they decided to move from casting doubts to provocation. Thus, they encouraged Zionist settlers to settle on the Golan and pledged to provide all possible assistance to expand the existing settlements. This was done in the hope of perplexing the Clinton administration and planting mines to obstruct serious U.S. efforts to advance the peace process on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks. The Israelis and the entire world know perfectly well that peace in the Middle East is impossible without Syria's effective participation. They also know that peace with Syria depends on returning all of the occupied Golan and evacuating the settlers. The Israelis and the world further know that when Syria says no, it means what is says. Syria will not relinquish any territory or rights; nor will it bargain over any inch of territory or any rights. If Israel does not want peace and is seeking separate deals that bolster occupation and usurpation, then the international community knows there can be no peace in the Middle East until it rests on the principles of justice and right and UN resolutions. Certainly there can be no peace without Syria's effective participation. Inasmuch as Syria believes in and works for a just and comprehensive peace, it adheres to its occupied territory and those of the Arabs and resists blackmail and relinquishment. The Golan is Syrian and shall remain so, whatever settlements Israel builds on it. Syria will not relinquish an iota of the Golan. Certainly, there will be no peace in the region or with Syria without the full return of the Golan to its kinsfolk and sons. Such familiar provocative Israeli policies can only undermine the chances for peace. This requires that the international community have a firm stance. Peace is the cause of all nations, and it can no longer remain silent on Israel's deliberate sabotage of U.S. and international peace efforts.
