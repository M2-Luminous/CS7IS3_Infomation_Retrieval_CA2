The Administrator may commence a civil action to assess and recover any civil penalty under paragraph (a) of this section. (1) An action under this paragraph may be brought in the district court of the United States for the district in which the defendant resides or has the Administrator's principal place of business, and the court has jurisdiction to assess a civil penalty. (2) In determining the amount of a civil penalty to be assessed under this paragraph, the court is to take into account the gravity of the violation, the economic benefit or savings (if any) resulting from the violation, the size of the violator's business, the violator's history of compliance with Title II of the Act, action taken to remedy the violation, the effect of the penalty on the violator's ability to continue in business, and such other matters as justice may require. (3) In any such action, subpoenas for witnesses who are required to attend a district court in any district may run into any other district. (c) Administrative assessment of certain penalties _(1) Administrative penalty authority. In lieu of commencing a civil action under paragraph (b) of this section, the Administrator may assess any civil penalty prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, except that the maximum amount of penalty sought against each violator in a penalty assessment proceeding shall not exceed $200,000, unless the Administrator and the Attorney General jointly determine that a matter involving a larger penalty amount is appropriate for administrative penalty assessment. Any such determination by the Administrator and the Attorney General is not subject to judicial review. Assessment of a civil penalty shall be by an order made on the record after opportunity for a hearing held in accordance with the procedures found at part 22 of this chapter. The Administrator may compromise, or remit, with or without conditions, any administrative penalty which may be imposed under this section. (2) Determining amount. In determining the amount of any civil penalty assessed under this paragraph, the Administrator shall take into account the gravity of the violation, the economic benefit or savings (if any) resulting from the violation, the size of the violator's business, the violator's history of compliance with Title II of the Act, action taken to remedy the violation, the effect of the penalty on the violator's ability to continue in business, and such other matters as justice may require. (3) Effect of administrator's action. (i) Action by the Administrator under this paragraph does not affect or limit the Administrator's authority to enforce any provisions of the Act; except that any violation with respect to which the Administrator has commenced and is diligently prosecuting an action under this paragraph, or for which the Administrator has issued a final order not subject to further judicial review and for which the violator has paid a penalty assessment under this paragraph shall not be the subject of a civil penalty action under paragraph (b) of this section. (ii) No action by the Administrator under this paragraph shall affect a person's obligation to comply with a section of this part. (4) Finality of order. An order issued under this subsection is to become final 30 days after its issuance unless a petition for judicial review is filed under paragraph (c)(5) of this section. (5) Judicial review. A person against whom a civil penalty is assessed in accordance with this subsection may seek review of the assessment in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or for the district in which the violation is alleged to have occurred, in which such person resides, or where the person's principal place of business is located, within the 30-day period beginning on the date a civil penalty order is issued. The person shall simultaneously send a copy of the filing by certified mail to the Administrator and the Attorney General. The Administrator shall file in the court within 30 days a certified copy, or certified index, as appropriate, of the record on which the order was issued. The court is not to set aside or remand any order issued in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph unless substantial evidence does not exist in the record, taken as a whole, to support the finding of a violation or unless the Administrator's assessment of the penalty constitutes an abuse of discretion, and the court is not to impose additional civil penalties unless the Administrator's assessment of the penalty constitutes an abuse of discretion. In any proceedings, the United States may seek to recover civil penalties assessed under this section.
