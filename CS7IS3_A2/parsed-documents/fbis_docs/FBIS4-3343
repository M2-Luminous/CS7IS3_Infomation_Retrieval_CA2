The move is part of a bid to keep the arable acreage at roughly current levels until the end of the century-levels which are still nearly 20 million hectares short of what China needs to feed and clothe its people. And it comes as the government makes every possible effort to preserve the country's farmland which has been overwhelmed in recent years by the growth of towns and cities. The move was initiated by the State Council and aims to curb the use of farmland for non-agricultural purposes, a ministry official said. And now a set of rules and regulations to protect farmland have been jointly drawn up by the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Land Administration and they will be issued later this year the official said. The regulations say all non-agricultural use of farmland must be first approved by the authorities and the user will be required to pay for such use. However the official declined to elaborate. China has only about 96 million hectares of arable land to feed its 1.2 billion people. That's about 0.087 hectares of land per head. Chinese agricultural experts believed the minimum requirement is 110 million hectares of grain cropland, plus 5.7 million hectares of cotton-growing land. Nevertheless, the limited farmland is still being overrun by an invasion of industrial and residential developments, said land administration officials. A report in the Beijing-based ECONOMIC REFERENCE NEWS, says 747,000 hectares of farmland have been lost in the past two years, particularly affecting grain and cotton crops. The State Council, China's cabinet, launched a basic farmland preservation drive in 1992, urging all local governments to put mandatory preservation orders on their high-yield cropland. The programme covers rich rural land, suburban vegetable farms, and national or local agricultural production centres. The pilot programme has so far led some 900 counties, or 45 per cent of the country's total, to set up protection zones. In Shanxi Province, protection orders have been put on 3 million hectares of land, 61 per cent of its total, while zones have been set up to cover 80 per cent--4 million hectares--of the counties in Jiangsu Province. Meanwhile, most of local governments have also issued related regulations, rules or policies specifying details of the programme. However, the official said some problems still exist such as the lack of management of the protected zones and the regional protectionism. To make up the massive land deficit, China has launched several projects to reclaim or develop its 33 million hectares of wasteland and switch some of its 333 million hectares of grassland to agricultural use.
