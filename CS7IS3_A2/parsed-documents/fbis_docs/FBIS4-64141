A high-ranking representative of the Russian Space Agency, involved in organizing the committee's session, to be held in Moscow on June 2 and 3, told INTERFAX that the draft program envisaged allocations of 1.25 trillion rubles (in January 1994 prices). However, this sum is likely to be increased to 2 trillion rubles, he said. In accordance with the project, another six satellites will be deployed within the framework of the program for creating the Gonets low-orbit global communication system (two experimental satellites of this series are on orbit already). In addition there are plans to launch the first four satellites of the Signal space communication system. The program also provides for financing the development of heavy- duty boosters, including Energiya M and Proton M ones, and Start-1 and Start-1 super-light boosters.
