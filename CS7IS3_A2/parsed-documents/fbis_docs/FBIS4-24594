As the Malaysian Prime Minister Mohamed Mahathir put it, links between the two countries stretched a long way back, but it is only over the last two decades that the bilateral relationship has reached a new level of understanding and cooperation. "In the last five years or so, bilateral relations have increased by leaps and bounds in many fields of cooperation," he added. The visits by the state and government leaders to each other's country deepened mutual understanding and trust and pushed the relations into a new stage of all-round development. Earlier this month, Mahathir visited China for the third time. During the visit he met with President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Li Peng respectively, exchanging views on the bilateral, regional and international issues of common concern. Since Mahathir's first visit to China in 1985, the two governments have signed ten agreements including those on trade, aviation, marine transportation, investment guarantee, avoidance of double taxation, establishment of the joint economic and trade commission, information and science and technology. Two-way trade has been recording a double-digit growth since 1987 with 1993 seeing a 21 percent increase to 1.79 billion U.S. dollars from 1.475 billion U.S. dollars in 1992. China has stood as one of the biggest buyers of palm oil of Malaysia, the world's largest producer. Two-way investment has covered a wide range of industries with a considerable expansion in volume and is moving toward internationalized cooperation. Incomplete statistics show that the number of Malaysians travelling to China rose from 11,200 in 1989 to 125,200 in 1993 while the number of the Chinese touring Malaysia surged from 9,000 in 1990 to 85,000 in 1993. Last year the two governments agreed to set up consulates-general in each other's country. The Malaysian Consulate-General in Guangzhou started business by the end of last year while the Chinese one will be opened in Kuching, Sarawak soon. "On many major international issues, we are delighted to see that our two countries share extensive common understanding and have been maintaining good cooperation. We highly value the Malaysian Government for its upholding justice and speaking out to safeguard the rights and interests of the developing countries in the international affairs and for actively promoting the political stability and economic prosperity of this region," Chinese Ambassador Qian Jinchang said recently. "We have full confidence in the future development of the bilateral relationship. We believe that the development of long- term, stable and friendly relations between China and Malaysia on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence, is not only in conformity with the fundamental interests of our two peoples, but also beneficial to the peace, stability and development of this region," he added.
