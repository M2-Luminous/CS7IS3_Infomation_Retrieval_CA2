Senator Turneb explains that this suspension was decided in an assembly. Interviewed by our colleague Leontes [Dorzilme], Delpe recalled that it is a temporary suspension, not an expulsion. Let us listen to the report of Dorzilme's report: [Begin Dorzilme recording, in Creole] The pot of division is boiling within the FNCD following the front's latest decision temporarily suspending CONACOM. However, if we are to believe a note dated 10 May, many FNCD member parties say there is no breakup within the FNCD, and that the decision that the member organizations made as regards CONACOM is only an administrative one. This matter developed on 13 May, when we received a note signed by Jude Marie Jacinthe, Isaac Garcon, and Mitrany Victor as officials of the FNCD parliamentary bloc within the Chamber of Deputies. Those people asked that [FNCD spokesmen] Evans Paul and Turneb Delpe go back on their decision [temporarily suspending CONACOM from FNCD] within 48 hours. They threatened to no longer recognize the spokesmen if they failed to do so. The resolution suspending CONACOM from FNCD was voted by a minority, according to the note from Jude Marie Jacinthe, who shares a position with Dunois Eric Cantave, the person in charge of political affairs within CONACOM.
