Zhu Rongji, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee and vice premier of the State Council, emphatically pointed out at the meeting: Prices of grain and edible oil are the base prices of the market. Therefore, we must quickly curb the current rise of these prices and bring them back to a reasonable level so we can prevent a possible chain reaction. To achieve this, all localities must act as one body, coordinate their efforts, and immediately take effective measures to resolutely lower the current excessively high prices of grain and edible oil as well as ensure a stable market in order to create a favorable climate for the smooth institution of various reform measures in the next year, and for ensuring the economy develops rapidly and in a sustained and healthy manner. Li Lanqing, Li Tieying, Chi Haotian, Ismail Amat, and other leading comrades of the State Council attended and spoke at the meeting. Also attending were responsible officials of various concerned departments and responsible comrades of concerned departments of the people's governments of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. The meeting was presided over by State Councillor Luo Gan, who is also secretary general of the State Council. Zhu Rongji said: Since November, prices of grain and edible oil have risen by a large margin -- from the coastal areas to the interior of the country, from the south to the north -- rapidly spreading to many localities across the country. In some localities, this might have been caused by the inadequate supply of grain, low grain stocks, untimely shipping of grain, and other factors. But judging from the overall situation, this has been primarily caused by psychological factors, speculation, and other temporary factors. This year, China's grain output has been abundant, grain stocks have been ample, and grain transportation has been ensured. As long as we provide better guidance; unify our thinking; eradicate the erroneous idea that "price increases do not matter," as is harbored by comrades of some localities and departments; and employ various kinds of propaganda to clear misunderstanding and doubts from the masses minds, we will completely be able to swiftly keep down grain prices and return them to a reasonable level. Zhu Rongji pointed out: Some feel they no longer need to watch grain prices now that control of grain prices has been lifted. This is a misunderstanding of the market economy. Decontrolling the grain market and prices does not mean we no longer need to pay attention to them, and certainly does not mean we can let things go their own way. According to the law of market supply and demand, exercising regulation and control of grain prices -- which affect the national economy, the people's livelihood, and social stability -- is a common practice in market economy countries as well as an important part of our macroregulation and control efforts. Zhu Rongji stated: The current efforts to keep down the prices of grain and edible oil and to stabilize the market are an important decision made by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council; this decision must be resolutely implemented. Localities across the country should act as one body and quickly carry out the decision. First, by the end of this year, state-owned grain stores should lower the selling price of grain to around the level established in the state's plan for 1994; localities who fail to reach this level must not take the opportunity to raise grain prices. Second, grain prices should be further appropriately lowered before the Spring Festival to provide room for the readjustment of grain prices scheduled to be made next year. State- owned grain stores should fully serve as a major player in regulating and controlling the grain market; they should list the lowered prices and should supply grain without setting restrictions. While the purchase price of grain stays high, state-owned grain departments should not race to purchase grain at high prices, but should insist on purchasing grain at originally established prices. They should realize the grain supply is ample and the purchase price of grain will decrease after the selling price is lowered and stabilized. The grain and oil currently to be sold at lowered prices was purchased at previous prices; therefore, selling them at the lowered prices will not increase grain departments' losses. The meeting urged all concerned departments of the State Council to meticulously organize and coordinate work on keeping down the prices of grain and oil. It urged grain departments to organize cadres and workers -- group by group and from time to time -- to study the macromanagement of grain circulation under the conditions of the socialist market economic system, and to improve their business management skills to ensure a good job in circulating grain. The meeting called on the railway and other transportation departments to give priority to and fully assure the transportation of grain, edible oil, and non staple food; it called on local people's governments at all levels as well as their grain, price, industry and commerce, taxation, and other concerned departments to tighten supervision and inspection of local grain markets and to properly manage them; it resolutely urged cracking down on unlicensed grain dealing, attempting to drive up grain prices, speculation, and attempting to manipulate grain markets in order to ensure the grain market remains stable and the objectives of price lowering are achieved within the specified period. The meeting emphasized: While stabilizing the grain prices and the market, we should effectively strengthen our leadership over agricultural production, take effective measures to ensure good agricultural production this winter and the coming spring, and, following the bumper agricultural harvests we have this year, strive to reap another good agricultural harvest next year. Bai Meiqing, vice minister of internal trade, briefed the meeting on the "Opinions on the Arrangement for Keeping Down the Prices of Grain and Edible Oil and for Stabilizing the Market," which was prepared by the State Planning Commission, the State Commission for Economics and Trade, the Ministry of Internal Trade, and the State Grain Storage Bureau. He also set forth a plan for keeping down the price of grain and edible oil and for stabilizing the market; he urged grain departments at all levels to go all out and take the lead in keeping down the price of grain and edible oil, to endeavor to ensure a good job in grain and edible oil processing and transportation, to supply grain and oil in a timely manner at the announced lowered prices without setting restrictions, to not set limits on the amounts of grain and oil to be sold, and to ensure that grain and edible oil are not out of stock. He also urged grain departments to ensure grain and edible oil supplies for key large and medium cities as well as for poor areas, and to ensure timely supplies at wholesale prices for the cafeterias of universities and special secondary schools. The meeting coordinated and decided the procedures for lowering the price of edible oil and the standard levels of the price of edible oil. Based on production-supply-marketing balance situations and the price relations in specific localities, the meeting decided the price parities for respective localities and for grains and edible oils of various categories.
