Addressing the World Economic Forum summit in Cape Town, Mr de Klerk told international business leaders that South Africa would be foolish if it "precipitately tore out the stitches from wounds which are only now beginning to heal". But Mr Mbeki, speaking from the same platform, said his sister-in-law was still looking for her unionist husband who had disappeared without trace in Durban about seven years ago. "We are trying to find him and we are hoping somewhere in South Africa there is somebody who knows what happened, who will come and say I am sorry...because of the particular times in which we were, we took him and because of who he was and what he was doing, given those times, unfortunately we got rid of him. That's why you can't find him. Because then his wife and two children can at last say he is dead and do whatever custom and tradition demand they do in the circumstances. It's that kind of truth, (Deputy) President de Klerk, that we are looking for." His sister-in-law could then become part of the process of national reconciliation, Mr Mbeki added. Earlier, Mr de Klerk said South Africa had to be very careful how it approached sensitive questions relating to the past, particularly with regard to amnesty, indemnity and the truth commission. "We agree that processes have to be developed to put the political crimes of the past behind us once and for all, that the wounds of the past must be healed. But such a process cannot be allowed to develop into a tug of war or even a running sore which might continue to suppurate for years." The reality, he said, was that during the past conflict, unacceptable crimes were committed by followers of all sides and factions. "We have just completed four years of hard negotiation aimed at resolving that conflict. We would be foolish if we precipitately tore out the stitches from wounds which are only now beginning to heal." Mr de Klerk also said it was important that South Africa "build well" and not make basic errors that could weaken its national structure in the future. He had no problem with affirmative action, but the country should be very careful about the way it implemented such programmes, and dared not throw merit out of the window. "Instead of drifting into new state-sponsored discrimination against some members of our society, we should redouble our efforts to remove any vestiges of discrimination against any South African." Other issues that would have to be handled with sensitivity and care were land ownership, financial discipline, the size of the civil service and the funding of the Reconstruction and Development Programme.
