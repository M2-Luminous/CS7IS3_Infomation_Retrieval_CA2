While both sides have been close to an agreement for some months, the obstacle remains China's demand for a much bigger naval base for the People's Liberation Army (PLA) than the one being built on Stonecutters Island. Joint Liaison Group (JLG) experts from the two sides will meet for three of the four days scheduled from 22 to 25 February in Hong Kong to resolve differences over the disposal of military sites -- an issue which China believes goes to the heart of its sovereignty. The discussions will also involve military site inspections of as yet undisclosed locations. There are up to 30 military sites in Hong Kong. Alan Paul, who will be heading the British team, yesterday expressed optimism over the forthcoming discussions, saying China's agreement to three days of talks rather than the usual two days augured well for a satisfactory outcome. The last bilateral meeting of defence experts, held from 21 to 23 December, made only limited progress towards an agreement on details of future defence arrangements. China's insistence on a bigger naval base on Stonecutters Island is based on its argument that its size must be comparable with HMS Tamar on the Central waterfront. But in the last round of talks the British side stood firm on demands for a bigger base. It is concerned that legislators will baulk at approving more funds to expand the site. Moving the naval facilities from Central has already cost more than $358 million. JLG discussions will also focus on Britain's demand for a guarantee from China to return to the post-1997 Special Administrative Region (SAR) government any military sites unused by the PLA. Another area of contention is the Chinese side's desire to keep the married quarters currently used by British troops as quarters for PLA officers. The prospect of next week's meeting has raised hopes that strained relations over the political row will not impede co-operation on other crucial handover issues. Sources on both sides yesterday expressed the hope that the pace of work by the JLG might now pick up, averting the need by Britain to take unilateral action. However, concerns remain that talks on funding for Chek Lap Kok airport and Container Terminal No 9 have been hindered by the political reform row. The Chinese side is expected next week to propose a meeting of the JLG's airport committee to discuss Britain's latest financing proposal.
