On Saturday [26 March], it will be transferred to Sarajevo on two UN peacekeepers' aircraft to reinforce the Russian element of the "blue helmets." The back-up group includes a representative of the Russian Federation president, senior officers of the General Staff of Russia's Armed Forces, and of the airborne forces and diplomats. As Major General Nikolay Stasko, the head of the group and deputy commander of the Russian Federation airborne forces, told an ITAR-TASS correspondent, its mission includes settling issues linked to the status and tasks of the Russian peacekeeping contingent in Sarajevo. The fact was, he explained, that the UN Secretariat had yet to grant the Russian unit the status of a fully-fledged battalion of peacekeeping forces and was using it as a reserve element. The Russian soldiers and diplomats intend to discuss this matter with General Michael Rose, the commander of UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The airborne company that arrived includes soldiers of 10 nationalities and various religious persuasions. They include a Muslim platoon that is to serve in the Serbian sector of Sarajevo.
