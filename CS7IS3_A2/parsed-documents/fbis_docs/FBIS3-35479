At a time when our Yemeni people received with great satisfaction the signing of the accord document in the Jordanian capital, Amman, and after it was hoped that a final countdown would begin to resolve the political crisis, the Yemeni people were surprised by a deterioration in the security and military situation in Abyan Governorate. As a result, many people fell as victims, even in this blessed month. These regrettable incidents are sought by forces hostile to unity and democracy to prevent the implementation of the accord document, which is a safety mechanism for unity and democracy. While receiving this regrettable news, we denounce these incidents and consider them the beginning of a new political crisis that could jeopardize our unity and life. We ask for a prompt investigation and trial of the elements that sparked these incidents so that the tragedy will not be repeated. We also call for the removal of the causes of these incidents and the prevention of further such irresponsible actions so they will not expand beyond control. We in the follow-up committee of the mass gathering for the sons of Shabwah ask the political leadership to face up to its responsibilities and begin the implementation of the accord document, since they have signed and pledged to implement this document. The document is a national program that has won the consensus of the Yemeni people. We also ask our brothers and sons in the Armed Forces, the bulwark of Yemeni unity, not to disappoint this patient, loyal people and to help implement this document. They should also not be carried away by selfish whims and narrow interests. All military units should remain in their positions since their movement under these circumstances would delay the start of the implementation of this document and threaten the homeland's unity, security, and stability. The sons of the Shabwah Governorate also assert that they will be faithful to the implementation of the document to which they have agreed upon in their gathering. They will particularly spare their governorate all conflicts, military skirmishes, and political confrontation. All military units will remain in their original places to avoid any clashes, which could claim many lives in the governorate. This governorate will also refrain from causing any tension to spread to other governorates so that the accord document can be implemented in accordance with the agreed upon mechanism. The follow-up committee also asks the political leadership and the commanders of military units to honor the documents of the mass gathering of the Shabwah Governorate and not to turn the governorate into a battlefield or a source of tension for other governorates. May God grant us all success for the good, security, and stability of this homeland. Our Lord. Decide thou between us and our people in truth, for thou art the best to decide. [Koranic verse] Issued by the follow-up committee of the mass gathering of the sons of Shabwah Governorate.
