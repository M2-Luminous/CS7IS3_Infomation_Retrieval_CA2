The people have rejected, by a 57.3-percent majority, the creation of a Swiss contingent for UN peacekeeping operations. The opponents, surprised by the widespread rejection, are happy that Switzerland's neutrality remains unaffected. For the supporters of the project, Switzerland has missed a chance to rise on the international scene. The "yes" got the upper hand only in four cantons: Geneva (54.7 percent), Vaud (53 percent), Neufchatel (52.8 percent), and Jura (52.4 percent). Fribourg said "no" to the blue helmets with one of the lowest majorities against: 52.3 percent. The Valais rejected the idea with more determination: 60.6 percent. Participation was 46 percent. All in all, 1,203,870 people rejected the project while 898,925 approved it. A Failure for the Federal Council Kaspar Villiger accepts the result from a military point of view: There will not be any Swiss blue helmets. In his opinion, most Swiss people did not want to engage financial means for this project. Mr. Villiger further says that this vote reflects a certain mistrust toward parliament. Flavio Cotti also stressed the financial situation of the Confederation and of the welfare state to account for this result. Supporters: A Missed Opportunity Those supporting the creation of a corps of blue helmets -- namely the Radical Democratic Party (PRD), the Christian Democratic People's Party (PDC), the Socialist Party (PS0), the Liberal Party (PLS), the Independents' Alliance (AdI), and the Green Party of Switzerland (PES) -- have called this rejection by the people a missed opportunity. The causes of failure include the difference in funds plowed into the campaign and the people's feeling of insecurity at a time of recession and financial crisis for the Confederation. Several groups in favor of the blue helmets idea are concerned that emotive arguments may have won the day. They stressed the need to promote the humanitarian missions to counter the negative image which this vote will procure at international level. UDC: Loyalty to Armed Neutrality The Swiss People's Party (UDC) pointed out that the principle of armed neutrality remains deeply rooted in the Swiss people. The citizens reject any attempt to whittle it down. That must be taken into account in the future, the UDC stressed, noting that once again it is the only government party to represent the popular will. Opponents: A "Marignano" for the Federal Council The Liberty Party (PDL, formerly Swiss Car Party) and the Swiss Democrats (DS) noted the popular result with satisfaction, relief, and great joy, although they were surprised by the extent of its clear-cut nature. The PDL felt it was a Marignano [1515 battle lost by the Swiss which entailed an oath of neutrality toward France, Milan] for the Federal Government and the parties supporting it. A "no" vote was the only proper response to the slice-by-slice policy leading toward UN membership, the PDL and DS said. While the Swiss Officers' Association (SSO) was disappointed by the "no" vote, it stressed that this is not a rejection of the Army. The goal was not reached because it would have meant a proportional cut in the military budget. The Group for Switzerland Without an Army (GSsA) was not surprised by the result. The creation of such a military corps seemed in its eyes devoid of credibility. United Nations: Switzerland Has Not Spoken its Last Word Vladimir Petrovsky, UN director general in Geneva, said the United Nations respects the Swiss people's rejection. The country is coming to grips with adapting to the new international environment. We know it is not easy and it takes time, the director general stressed, before expressing the hope that "this is not the last word Switzerland will utter on the matter."
