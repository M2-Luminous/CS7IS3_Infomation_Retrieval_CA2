This has resulted in a mass exodus of civilians toward the city center, to where the small UN contingent has also withdrawn. One of the British soldiers seriously wounded this evening has died of his injuries. In Washington, President Clinton said tonight that one should be firm with the Serbs but avoid provocation. This evening the defense minister, Francois Leotard, reacted too: [Begin Leotard recording] The behavior of the Serb side is extremely worrying. It is the continuation of ethnic cleansing in Gorazde, as in Sarajevo, as elsewhere. This is unacceptable for the international community and for France. Our soldiers are there to end the acts of violence and hatred which run against the grain of European culture. We fervently wish that, through the talks currently underway, the Serb side will understand that it cannot win through force, and in the face of the international community territorial and other gains rejected by the other parties. France will continue to try, with special care, through its presence on the ground, through its diplomats and the action of its foreign minister, Alain Juppe, to obtain a peace settlement, which represents the only solution to this conflict.
