The discussion is scheduled for next week. Boris Yeltsin sent an address to both chambers of the Russian parliament reminding them that, according to the Constitution, decisions are considered adopted if they receive support of more than a half of the total constitutionally-envisaged number of deputies. However, while adopting interim procedural rules, lawmakers interpreted the notion of the "total number of deputies" as the total number of elected lawmakers, although several seats are still vacant in each of the chambers. The president requested the deputies "to bring the interim rules in accordance with the Constitution".
