ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This regulation implements section 519 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA) by amending 24 CFR parts 905 and 960 to permit public housing agencies (PHAs) and Indian housing authorities (IHAs) (hereinafter, both public housing agencies and Indian housing authorities will be referred to as HAs, unless a specific reference to a PHA or IHA is applicable) to allow police officers and other security personnel not otherwise eligible for occupancy to reside in public or Indian housing dwelling units under a plan that will increase security for housing residents while minimizing both the reduction of available public and Indian housing dwelling units for eligible families and the loss of income to HAs. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 1, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act Statement The information collection requirements contained in this final rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget, under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520), and assigned OMB control number 2577&hyph;0185. I. Background_Proposed Rule On June 7, 1993 (58 FR 32006), the Department published a proposed rule that would implement section 519 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA) by amending existing regulations to permit public housing agencies (PHAs) and Indian housing authorities (IHAs) to allow police officers and other security personnel not otherwise eligible for occupancy to reside in public and Indian housing dwelling units under a plan that will increase security for housing residents while minimizing both the reduction of available public and Indian housing dwelling units for eligible families and the loss of income to housing agencies (HAs). Under this final rule, eligibility for use of units as provided by section 519 of the NAHA requires that an HA submit a plan to the Department that identifies the total number of units under management by the HA; the specific housing developments, and the number of units they contain, where the HA intends to place Officers; and the particular units (stating number of bedrooms) within each development that would be allocated to Officers. This plan is required by §§905.308(c)(1)(ii) and 960.505(a)(2) of the rule. Since the Department intends that each plan will be reviewed and approved by the local HUD Field Office or Office of Native American Programs, §§905.308(c)(2) and 960.505(b) of the rule call for submission of the plan directly to these offices.
