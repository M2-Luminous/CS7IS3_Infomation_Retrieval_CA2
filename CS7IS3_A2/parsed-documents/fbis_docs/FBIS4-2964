The white paper, "China's Agenda 21" was released at a press conference jointly held by the State Planning Commission and the State Science and Technology Commission. Chen Yaobang, vice-minister of the State Planning Commission, said that the Chinese Government has formulated the agenda in line with the resolutions of the United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. He said that, in accordance with China's actual comprehensive conditions, the agenda puts forward overall strategies, policies, measures and plans to promote the coordinated and sustained development of the economy, society, natural resources, environment, population and education. The agenda will become a guiding document for the formulation of China's long and medium-term plans for the national economy and social development, and will be embodied as important contents and objectives in China's Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) and the development program until 2010. Meanwhile, it is also a manifestation of the seriousness in action and firmness in principle of the Chinese Government in implementing the U.N.'s agenda, he added. The agenda is written in over 200,000 Chinese characters in 20 chapters. It has 78 projected areas under four headings: Sustained Development Strategies, Social Sustained Development, Economic Sustained Development, and Rational Utilization of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection. It was drafted by 300 experts and scholars from 52 government departments and social organisations. At the same time, the Chinese Government has also organized related departments to draft "the priority projects plan for China's Agenda 21", with the first 63 priority projects selected in favor of international co-operation, on the basis of more than 500 project proposals. Chen said that the implementation of the program will not only solve crucial problems such as population expansion, environmental deterioration and resources shortage, but also promote public participation so that sustained development in China can get experience which can help foster the economic development and environmental protection in the Asia-Pacific region, and throughout the world. He said that the total input for the first priority projects is estimated at 3.76 billion U.S. dollars, of which 60 percent will be guaranteed domestically, while the other 40 percent will come from international co-operation. The domestic part of the input will mainly come from government investment and loans, or be raised by the localities; while international co-operation will be carried out in forms of multilateral and bilateral co-operation, grants, loans, joint investment and BOT (building, operation and transfer). Chen said he was optimistic about the prospects for the financial support of these projects. Chen said the United Nations Development Program has paid great attention to the drafting and implementation of "China's Agenda 21" and has decided to include the agenda in its co-operative projects with the Chinese Government.
