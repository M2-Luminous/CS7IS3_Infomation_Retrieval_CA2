[Al-Hakim] My staying in Iran is natural, as it (Iran) was and continue to be a base for jihad and political action against the regime. And it provides opportunities for contacts inside and abroad, whether within the region or with the international community. It also has major scientific seminaries like the Qom seminary -- which provide opportunities for moves at all levels in line, of course, with all our political and cultural moves. And I do not believe that my moving to northern Iraq would provide a new opportunity for the opposition, especially as I have always believed it is necessary for me personally to remain outside the unified opposition establishments. However, I believe in the opposition's unity. [passage omitted] [Qusaybati] Is your moving to northern Iraq on the cards? [Al-Hakim] My moving to north Iraq is on the cards and natural. I also believe that it would provide a better opportunity to serve the aim of getting rid of the criminal regime and achieving justice, brotherhood, and unity in Iraq. But I do not believe that there is a need for it at the moment, especially as general harmony and cooperation exist with the Kurdish brothers, may God bestow success on them, and also with the other opposition parties operating in Iraqi Kurdistan. [Qusaybati] Do you believe the opposition can still be unified? And what about your reservations about the Salah al-Din conference? [Al-Hakim] I believe that unifying the opposition in the general sense is possible. And some steps have been achieved, as a group of the major forces is cooperating this connection. And efforts are still continuing to achieve the other steps. What is easy to achieve should not be abandoned because of what is difficult to achieve, as the Islamic jurisprudence rule says. As for the reservations announced by the Islamic forces about the Salah al-Din conference, this institution has responded to some of them and efforts are being made to surmount the others. [passage omitted] [Qusaybati] Some people accuse you of adhering to Iranian policy and confirming things with it. [Al-Hakim] That is a completely false accusation. It is a method used by the enemies in the psychological war to achieve political aims. This is in the knowledge that we respect the views of the brother believers in Iran and also respect Iran's policy. [passage omitted] [Qusaybati] You are calling for a change of regime, but the opposition is accused of ineffectiveness and lack of influence inside the country. [Al-Hakim] The Iraqi position, in particular the Islamic opposition, has turned from an opposition of political groups and forces into an opposition of a people fighting for the sake of salvation. The best proof of this is the uprising of 15 Sha'ban 1411 H (March 1991) and the Iraqi people's resistance and jihad operations, which are still continuing despite the regime's numerous attempts to destroy the resistance, use of heavy and deadly weapons, and numerous and huge life-destroying schemes like draining the marshes, the economic and military blockade, the continued large-scale sweeps in the cities, and physical liquidations and executions. [Qusaybati] Do you believe foreign intervention is on the cards? [Al-Hakim] I believe that the Iraqi people should carry out the salvation task, and the international community should help them to do so. Regrettably the international community still has not responded to the appeal for help. [passage omitted] [Qusaybati] You demanded the establishment of a "safe area" in southern Iraq. How do you explain the West's intervention to set up a safe area in the north and its and the United Nations' disregard for your appeals vis-a-vis the south? [Al-Hakim] I did not demand a safe area in the south. I demanded protection for all the Iraqi people against heavy weapons and annihilation operations -- that is, the annihilation of people and life. [passage omitted] [Qusaybati] What is the number of the men of the "Badr Corps" belonging to the "Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution" in Iran? [Al-Hakim] It is not right to reveal such information. [Qusaybati] Iraqi opposition sources say that Iranian sources have scattered the corps' men. [Al-Hakim] That is untrue. At any rate, we have our own means of retaining our own military forces. [Qusaybati] What about Tehran's attempts to normalize relations with Baghdad? Does that not worry you? [Al-Hakim] I have said from the outset that these attempts do not worry us, because our work is associated with the Iraqi people as a whole, and the issue is too broad and deep to be harmed by these relations. This is why we see the regime more frightened than us of these relations. [sentence as published] [Qusaybati] How do you explain President Saddam Husayn's threat to retaliate against the extension of international sanctions, given that a split has emerged in the Security Council over determining an armament inspection timetable that would help lift the oil blockade? [Al-Hakim] Saddam is experiencing a real crisis, not only at the economic level but also at the level of the narrow and limited base on which he relies, which has begun to shake. This is in addition to the popular turmoil and his inability to control the situation except through the Army -- which poses a real threat to his existence. This is why he is trying to preoccupy the Army with fabricated actions. And he could commit a crime or another foolish action for the sake of staying in power. This is why three areas are likely to targeted: the marshlands and the north, Kuwait, or Iran... or all of them. And he has indeed begun his attack in the marshlands but has so far failed to achieve his aims. And he has also begun to provoke Iran through some limited military operations. He has also begun to deploy troops [on the border with] the north and Iraqi Kurdistan and Kuwait. Maybe in his view Kuwait is the most important of the fronts in question. God knows. As for the Security Council's split, it is the result of a conflict of interests. And the regime has its own means of tempting and making the interests owners' mouths water as regards the hope of having some of the debts paid. Even though the regime has not paid its previous debts. In fact it has increased the debts and failed to fulfill its promises and pledges. It has actually broken them and failed to achieve stability for the region. In fact these opportunist attitudes have resulted in unrest and serious threats.
