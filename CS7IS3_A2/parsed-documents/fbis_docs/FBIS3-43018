First paragraph is TEKHNIKA-MOLODEZHI introduction, a question from a student.] [Text] ``In 1990's No. 5 issue, the capabilities of supercomputers were described using examples of foreign supercomputers. In 1991's No. 1 issue the development of the Elbrus 3-1 domestic supercomputer, with a capability of more than a billion operations per second, was mentioned. It's 1993 and I'm still waiting for you to tell us about this computer in detail.'' Vladimir Sergeyev, student, Perm. ``Don't describe our machine as anything special,'' they told me at the S. A. Lebedev Institute of Precision Mechanics and Computing, ``there's nothing special about it.'' This was a strange comment. What was behind it: exaggerated modesty or a judicious recognition of the significance of what had been done? I got the answer in the computer room where the Elbrus 3-1 is being checked out. ``If you want to be scrupulously exact, what stands before us is not a computer, but a general-purpose multiprocessor computing system with well-developed software,'' stated one of the authors of this work, the deputy chief designer, Vladimir Abramovich Zhukovskiy. ``You can see the difference if you look at its architecture. First let's be specific: architecture in computing doesn't mean the metal racks and units filling the room. Nor does it mean the design, in terms of shape, color, etc. Computer architecture can only be clearly seen on a sheet of paper showing what's connected to what and in what sequence (see schematic).'' The main parts of the Elbrus are the modular switching system, the peripheral system, the power supply system, the cooling system, and the general system software. Communication with the machine is facilitated by automated digital printers, individual control panels, otherwise called work stations, and automated digital displays. Today's communication systems make it possible to input data and receive the results of calculations without entering the computer room, either from the next room or another city. One can conduct not only man-machine dialogs, but machine-machine dialogs. With one set of adapters the Elbrus 1-5B and Elbrus-2 representatives of the YeS family of computers can work with the Elbrus 3-1. In general, one can increase the power of the computer complex, not only with external resources, that is, by attaching other computers, but also using the internal features of the Elbrus 3-1. The central computer of the Elbrus 3-1 is the modular switching system. It, in turn, consists of modular pipeline processors, a bulk RAM, and the adapters which connect the high-speed switching network. When these adapters are used together, 16 modular pipeline processors can be attached, as well as 16 RAM units. If this is not enough to solve the problem, another 32 channels can be activated to connect in more resources, including other computers. The modular pipeline processor itself is comprised of several modules, each of which executes a certain operation, addition, multiplication, etc. If one must first multiply the incoming data to solve a problem, and then add it, then the assembly line of modules is formed as follows: multiplier first, then summer. Special modules which operate in a general pipeline mode make it possible to sharply increase speed. It is because of these special processors that one can calculate at such a high speed: from 50 million operations per second with scalar quantities to 400 million operations per second with vector quantities. The modular switching system may have not one, not two, but four processors (in the future more will be possible), so the total performance of several such pipelines may reach 1.6 billion operations per second or more. The high level of performance of the Elbrus 3-1 creates certain technical problems. One of them is that the computer heats up when it is in operation, and the excess heat may melt contacts, conductors, and integrated microcircuit elements, the very foundations upon which the computer is built. The traditional solution, blowing a stream of cold air through the units, was ineffective in this case: one could create a hurricane in the computer room. Then the developers decided to use liquid cooling along with air cooling. Abroad, this is what is frequently done: the units which perform the most intense work are placed in Dewar vessels, that is, in thermoses with liquid nitrogen or helium. The cooling is reliable and in some cases may even reach the superconducting stage, but a great deal of frost is formed. We managed to solve this problem using very simple measures. Zhukovskiy showed me a micromodule, a plate about 3X3 cm in size. It had a radiator through which a cooling fluid was pumped. The radiator removes the excess heat from micromodules on a board 0.5X0.5 m in size. The fluid then enters a refrigerator, where the heat is removed; the fluid is then returned to the cooling system. Boards with micromodules are placed in a frame similar to the plates of glass in a balcony door. The aluminum frame in turn is fastened to a column in an equipment rack. Thus, by rotating the door, the debuggers and operators can gain access to any unit, to each micromodule, even while the machine is in operation. This greatly simplifies and speeds up debugging and repair. These are only some of the designs of the many used in the construction of one of the first domestic supercomputers. And yet, overall, the specialists are not very satisfied with their work. For example, abroad one chip can have millions of transistors, capacitors, and resistors; here in the best case, only hundreds of thousands are possible. The result is a great increase in size, mass, and energy consumption, as well as a reduction in performance. That is why the developers don't want to say anything special about their baby: they created a computer using domestic micromodules which stands up to the remarkable Cray in a number of ways; but if it only exceeded the Cray in every way! American television reporters tagging along at the institute held another opinion. They wanted to see with their own eyes and show the viewers back home one of wonders of what is to them a poorly understood nation. After work people stand in lines for increasingly expensive bread; at work they manage to reach the level of the world's best achievements. How do they do it? Unfortunately, the answer for us is the same as in the famous Leskov story of Levsha. There is no scarcity of talent in Russia: when there is no magnifying glass, we just sharpen our eyesight...
