ACTION: Affirmation of interim rule as final rule. SUMMARY: We are adopting as a final rule, without change, an interim rule that amended the list of suppressive areas under the witchweed quarantine and regulations by adding and deleting areas in North Carolina and South Carolina. These changes affected 7 counties in North Carolina and 2 counties in South Carolina. These actions were necessary in order to impose certain restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles to prevent the artificial spread of witchweed and to delete unnecessary restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 18, 1994.
