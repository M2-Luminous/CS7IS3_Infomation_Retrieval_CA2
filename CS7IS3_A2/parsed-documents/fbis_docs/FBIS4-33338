He said it would be dangerous if anarchy descended on the country, as this would go against the country's need for development. Gen. Sanjines also reiterated his support for the state of law. He added: "From the prudent viewpoint of not discussing political issues and putting ourselves within a realistic framework, we believe that the solution to our problems should be entrusted to capable Bolivian statesmen, as accepting foreign influence would lead to greater complications." These comments were made during the 165th anniversary of the Armed Forces General Staff, a celebration headed by President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, commander in chief of the Armed Forces. Gen. Sanjines recalled that since the birth of Bolivia as an independent republic, threats of the division of society and interference by foreign interests have caused irreparable damage throughout its history. He said that this concern has allowed the armed institutions to become the country's moral reserve and national identity in the face of possible threats to the legally established government, and to become the indissoluble part of the dearest aspirations of the Bolivian people for progress and development. Sanjines said: "We have improved our criteria in these 12 years for preserving legality, our sole concern being to diminish dependency. And this is an objective mainly based on political stability, which is the basis for economic potential and social justice, which in turn are the result of productivity and efficiency." He also demanded the careful reorganization of the Armed Forces on the basis of the country's real requirements, and not on the basis of personal or subordinated criteria. He also called for: "The conciliation of human and material requirements that would ensure the better fulfillment of our mission of protecting sovereignty and territorial integrity." He also called for understanding among the different social sectors to overcome the problems of the country through dialogue and agreement. He also rejected what he called "the latent threat of anarchy and its terrible outcome of instability, which could scare away investments and slow the enthusiasm for new efforts to make economic growth possible, which is the basis for creating more jobs."
