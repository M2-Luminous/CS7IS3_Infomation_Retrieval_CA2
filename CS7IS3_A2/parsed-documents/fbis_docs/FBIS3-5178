The group reached their conclusion at a luncheon meeting at Princess Hotel after a hand grenade was lobbed into the home of the former public health minister off Wiphawadi-Rangsit Highway shortly before 2 a.m. But the allegation was immediately rejected by Prime Minister Chuan Likphai who said the Government was not involved. "I really don't know how this happened, but it is definitely not what the Opposition said," he said. Government spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa said: "This Government respects the basic right of people to criticise its performance," he said. "We can live with those with different opinions because our society is an open one. And we can use the same right to argue and defend ourselves. "There is no need for this government to resort to illegal means or violence. That's not the nature of this government or politicians in this government." Yesterday's meeting was attended by Opposition and Chat Thai leader Praman Adireksan, Chat Phattana [CPP] leader Chatchai Chunhawan, SAP [Social Action Party] leader Montri Phongphanit, Ratsadon leader Chaipak Siriwat, Chat Thai deputy leader Sano Thianthong, CPP secretary-general Prachuap Chaiyasan, SAP deputy leader Suwit Khunkitti and SAP secretary-general Chaloem Yubamrung. Mr Montri, the nephew of Mr Bunphan and a resident of the same compound in Soi Panni, said he was confident the bomb attack was intended more as intimidation than actually hurting anyone. He said he had recently been pointing out the Government's shortcomings to people during the city and district council election campaign. "So this is apparently aimed at preventing the Opposition from telling the people the truth," he said. "I have thought it over and I cannot see why anyone would ever want to hurt Mr Bunphan. We finally concluded it was an act of intimidation. "But I don't know who could be behind this act because we don't have any personal problems with anyone." Mr Montri said he respected Prime Minister Chuan Likphai. "By nature, we are political enemies. We criticise the Government because we want it to work and it must listen to us. I am really sorry. Anyone who sees what happened will know how violent it was." The politician said he and other Opposition leaders would not seek extra protection during the remaining campaign period, but would continue to inform the people of the problems in the Government. Pol Capt [Police Captain] Chaloem said he did not think police would be able to arrest anyone in connection with the attack. "It's just intimidation and only those who were behind it know who the perpetrators are," he said. "This kind of thing never happens to people in the Government but is frequent with Opposition members." Pol Capt Chaloem later told the BANGKOK POST at Mr Montri's home a police officer who is a younger brother of a senior official with the Prime Minister's Office and the bodyguard of a Democrat minister might be responsible for the attack because of Mr Montri's rude criticisms of Prime Minister Chuan during political activities. SAP deputy leader Dusit Sophitcha, in a separate interview, said the bomb attack was the work of "a third hand" to distract the public attention from conflicts within the coalition. Mr Aphisit said it was the duty of the police to find who were behind the attack and the Opposition should provide evidence if they can help investigators locate the culprits. Deputy Prime Minister Bunchu Rotchanasthian called on the public to treat the Government fairly over the incident.
