Last year, the output of nonferrous metals in the province was nearly 400,000 tons, 95 percent of which came from the five bases, and the amount accounted for 12 percent of the country's total nonferrous metals output. Dozens of rare earth materials and nonferrous metal products, including silver, copper, aluminum, lead, zinc, barium, nickel and cobalt, are being sold on world markets. Local government officials attribute the achievement to the state's large sum of investment during the past decade when the central government injected some five billion yuan (about 574.7 million U.S. dollars at the present exchange rate) to upgrade such metals manufacturers.
