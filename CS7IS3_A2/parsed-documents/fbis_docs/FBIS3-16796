The telegram states, inter alia, that the proposal made by a number of Russian deputies to introduce federal rule on the territory of North Ossetia has given rise to indignation among the people of the republic. Such proposals are regarded in North Ossetia as an attempt by certain forces -- I quote -- to play the national card on the Yugoslav model.
