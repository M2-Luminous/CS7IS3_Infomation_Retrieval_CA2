It will be allocated the 4.5 billion francs [Fr] earmarked annually for military cooperation and will focus on bilateral military programs. The 63d Franco-German summit held last week in Mulhouse has given impetus to the proposed Franco-German arms "structure" -- there is no talk of it having the status of a formal agency, although officials recognize it will be very similar. The process appears to be in its final stage as the French Defense Ministry has now set a deadline for the creation of the structure: September 1995, that is, in a little over a year's time. The quasi-agency set up by Paris and Bonn is expected to integrate bilateral weapon programs ("Tigre" assault helicopter, antitank missiles, the VBM modular armored vehicle.) But it will also include Franco-German participation in joint programs with third parties (NH-90 helicopter, ATF heavy transport aircraft, satellites, etc.). This, in cases where the combined French and German shares exceed 50 percent of a program, will amount to a virtual takeover of the project on the part of Paris and Bonn. The Franco-German arms agency will also cover bilateral research and technology, for which there are already 80 projects. This has already had the effect of prompting some harmonization, including in preliminary research for helicopter design, a field in which, despite the creation of Eurocopter (Aerospatiale, 70 percent; Deutsche Aerospace, 30 percent), resources remained to be pooled. The Franco-German agency will also work on future equipment for the Eurocorps, which is mostly made up of French and German soldiers. Last, it will integrate parameter studies for long-term military planning (up to 2010-2015), as well as the first preliminary technical and operational studies on future threats. The annual cost of this Franco-German cooperation will total Fr4.5 billion out of the French Armed forces' Fr100-billion equipment budget. The project will produce some items, mostly missiles, but its main focus will be development (of armored vehicles, helicopters.) Overall, it will cost its French and German sponsors more than Fr60 billion. This makes a compelling case for such an agency, which in future could be opened up to Belgium and the Netherlands; the latter maintain close ties with the Germans, including a joint army corps. Paris has even been considering establishing another quasi-agency with the Italians, who have been working with France on several large programs (a torpedo, a satellite, the Aster missile, the NH-90 helicopter.) Such an increased focus on cooperation is firmly rooted in reality. Today, on the eve of the implementation of the 1995-2000 military programming law, the share of cooperation in France's defense programs budget is 25 percent. By the end of the programming period, in the year 2000, it will have reached 40 percent, a boom that will require an appropriate structure. [Box, p 10] Research Credits to Small Companies To Be Doubled On the occasion of the fifth birthday of the Richelieu Committee, which includes 75 percent of the small- and medium-sized businesses [SME] active in the defense field (92 firms), DGA [General Armament Delegation] Director Henri Conze said: ``I ask all DGA operational directorates to at least maintain and even increase the preliminary research credits allocated to SME's from one year to the next, whatever happens to the Defense Ministry's research budgets. ``Furthermore, the DGA will endeavor to double the share of SME's in its budget for preliminary research by the end of the current programming period: Thus, within six years we must increase from 6 to 12 percent preliminary research credits allocated to SME's.''
