It includes Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko, parliament's Speaker Abish Kekilbayev, and other senior officials. Presidents Islam Karimov and Nursultan Nazarbayev had a meeting today, then they attended the opening of Kazakhstan's exhibition "Science, New Technology and Conversion" at the exhibition center. The head of our state laid flowers at the memorial to Alisher Navoi. Members of the Kazakh delegation met with their Uzbek counterparts. Both presidents and members of the official delegations attended the opening ceremony of Days of Kazakhstan at the Torkeston center. It was followed by a concert of Uzbek music. The Days of Kazakhstan will last until 27 May and will contribute to closer integration between the economies of two countries. The two presidents were interviewed at the airport today. [Begin Nazarbayev recording] Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have not held an event like this since 1977. Earlier, such events were mostly political. This is the first event of its kind since the two countries gained their independence and sovereignty. Around 600 people from various regions of Kazakhstan have arrived in Tashkent. Among them are scholars, businessmen, leaders of enterprises and farms, and others. The aim is first to familiarize them with the reforms in Uzbekistan and their progress. Second, as you know, [Uzbek President] Islam Karimovich and I have signed an agreement on encouraging cooperation between the two countries. We want the economies of the two countries to compliment each other -- Kazakhstan has certain things which are not available in Uzbekistan and vice versa. I hope that a commission, which has been set up by the two presidents will contribute to encouraging closer economic cooperation without bureacratic hurdles. A similar event will be held in Kazakhstan at the beginning of winter this year. Such events are important in strengthening ties between the two countries. Through them the two nations will get to know each other better, will learn about the market reforms in the respective countries. Kazakhs and Uzbeks were once considered as one nation. We have common roots, similar languages, and a common mentality. There is nothing that can divide us, and there never has been. We have always been together and all we have to do now is to revive these ties. [end recording]
