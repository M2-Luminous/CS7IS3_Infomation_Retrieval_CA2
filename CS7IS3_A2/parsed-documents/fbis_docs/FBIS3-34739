In a statement released on Wednesday, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) issued a 10-day ultimatum calling the Serbs to withdraw their heavy artillery from around Sarajevo within a radius of 20 kms. In its editorial, 'JOMHURI ESLAMI' said that on the first encounter, the statement was expected to be a response to the demands of the world public opinion to end atrocities against Bosnian Muslims. However, a careful study of the context of the statement shows that once again NATO is following the policy of procrastination and is only posing as a decisive organization. Furthermore, it wants to make the world believe that it has made an effective and resolute decision. The evidence available indicates to the fact that the main objective of the statement is mere publicity and that NATO would never enter into the scene against the Serbs who are carrying out the same mission favored by the U.S. and Europe. It said that the U.S. and Europe were making efforts to provide further grounds to facilitate implementation of the mission by the Serbs. NATO's goal is to pretend it has managed to take a stance against the Serbs while under the status quo the United States and Europe are working on an agreement to dismember Bosnia. It turned to the statements issued by the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC), calling for a severe stand by the Security Council and the NATO against Serbs, and said that NAM has never shown decisiveness at decisionmaking level. If NAM and the OIC use their deterrent levers to settle the Bosnian crisis, they have the necessary potentials, the daily noted, adding that this will be materialized in practice when all members have unity of expression and determination.
