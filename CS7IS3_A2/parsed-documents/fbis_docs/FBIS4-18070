Several spokespersons of human rights groups and pro-Kurdish organizations said in Bonn on Wednesday [30 March] that Germans attending the Nevruz celebrations and municipal elections were harassed, arrested temporarily, interrogated for hours, and beaten up. A total of 250 Germans had travelled to Kurdish areas. Joerg Hilbert from Braunschweig, who wanted to go near Mt. Ararat with 15 people from Lower Saxony and Thuringia, spoke of "punches in the face and kicks to the kidneys." In spite of obstructions, the group repeatedly tried to reach their destination, for which they were "kicked, spat at, and beaten up" by security forces. A female interpreter was slapped in the face. A member of the group was kicked down stairs at a police station. Hilbert and Franciscan monk Juergen Neitzert reported a "massive military presence." They took photographs of German arms being used against Kurds; among others they spoke of tanks from the former GDR National People's Army (BTR-60, BTR-80). Neitzert said that members of the German Embassy in Ankara knew about the use of FRG arms. The "Christian Organizations Against Arms Exports" want to make enquiries with the Foreign Ministry in this context. The spokespersons called upon the government not to deport Kurds from Germany to Turkey, as they face torture, displacement, and death.
