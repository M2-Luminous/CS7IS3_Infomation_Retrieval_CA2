President Rauf Denktas will receive Lamb tomorrow. The Greek Cypriot radio announced that Lamb is not bringing any new proposals but that he will conduct more effective initiatives for the adaptation of the 21 March UN document. Lamb will leave the island on Friday [15 April] after concluding his contacts. Denktas said that nobody can take away the Turkish Cypriot people's just rights by force. Assessing Lamb's unexpected visit on the island, Denktas noted that there are efforts to conduct new ploys in Cyprus. Denktas stressed that Lamb's arrival in Cyprus at a time when the Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller is visiting the United States gives rise to thought. Denktas stated that the Greek Cypriot side is responsible for the deadlock reached in the proximity talks regarding the confidence-building measures, and added that the Turkish Cypriot side is open to new suggestions that Lamb may bring forward. Indicating that it is natural for Tugay Ulucevik, Turkish Foreign Ministry deputy under secretary, to visit the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, Denktas pointed out the advantages of frequent exchanges of views with Ankara. Indicating that Turkish and Greek Cypriot youths participating in the archery competition held under the auspices of the United Nations in the Greek Cypriot side has no political aspect, Denktas added that these kinds of events should not be transformed into a political message. Noting that these kinds of political messages prevent the development of events that further intercommunal personal contacts, Denktas added that these events are not related to the Cyprus issue. Reiterating that the Turkish Cypriot cannot live under Greek Cypriot administration nor under the United Nations control, Denktas stressed that for a permanent agreement, the Turkish Cypriot should live freely under equal rights and conditions as the Greek Cypriots.
