Do you believe that these arrangements ensure the security of the Palestinians in Hebron? ['Urayqat] In fact, there are causes for the problem in Hebron. The root of the problem is the existence of settlers in the heart of the city of Hebron. I fear that without the evacuation of the settlement hotbeds from the heart of Hebron, the problem will remain and could explode despite any measures. [Mu'addi] Will the arrival of international observers from Norway, Belgium, and Italy ease friction between the settlers and Arab residents in Hebron? ['Urayqat] The question is not one of easing anyone's worries. The question is one of finding a fundamental solution to this issue. This would be achieved by tackling its roots. First, the root of the problem is the presence of settlers. Settlers must be evacuated from Hebron. Second, there are questions that must be addressed, such as what authority these international forces will come under, what their jurisdiction will be, what their responsibilities will be, until when will they submit their reports, and how will they implement their measures and orders. In fact, we do not know the details of all these matters. However, the problem will remain as long as the settlement hotbeds exist in Hebron or anywhere else. [Mu'addi] Dr. 'Urayqat, will signing the agreement on arrangements in Hebron help complete the measures regarding the Gaza-Jericho plan? ['Urayqat] We have always emphasized that the negotiations are not an end in themselves. After the Hebron massacre, unless the settlement subject is placed at the top of the agenda, it is unreasonable to expect any negotiations to lead to the hoped-for just, comprehensive, durable peace, a peace based on Resolution 242. I fear that unless the main problem, represented by settlement activity, is resolved, the arrangements that have been agreed upon may lead to further future complications. [Mu'addi] Dr. 'Urayqat, concerning the bilateral negotiations, has the Palestinian side received an invitation to go to Washington next month? ['Urayqat] No. The Palestinian side has not received any invitations. The negotiations which took place in Tunis and Cairo dealt with providing protection for the Palestinian people in accordance with Resolution 904. However, it seems that the basic issue and the root of the problem, which is the settlement existence, has not been tackled. This will have negative consequences in the future. [Mu'addi] Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, thank you very much. ['Urayqat] Thank you.
