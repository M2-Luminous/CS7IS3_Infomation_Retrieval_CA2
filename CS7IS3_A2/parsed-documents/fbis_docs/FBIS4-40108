This was reported on Monday [13 June] to INTERFAX-Ukraine by a senior official at the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry Vladimir Yelchenko. He said Ukraine is most likely to form a battalion of specially trained paratroopers who will be required to speak foreign languages. Kiev is also ready to offer Ilyushin-76 transport planes for peace-keeping operations. Yelchenko said that the final decision on the matter has not been made, as organizational and financial questions should be resolved first. He voiced hope that part of the spending on the formation of the Ukrainian contingent would be assumed by the United Nations. Under the constitution the involvement of Ukrainian troops in operations overseas should be sanctioned by parliament. However, Yelchenko thinks that if the Ukrainian contingent is formed, the decision on its use will be made by the head of state after an appropriate appeal from the United Nations. The idea of forming a UN rapid deployment force belongs to the UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali. In a letter to him last February President Leonid Kravchuk confirmed Ukraine's readiness to take part in the formation of the force.
