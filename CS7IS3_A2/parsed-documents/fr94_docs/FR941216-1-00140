FR941216-1-00140 FR941216-1-00012 (k) Rebowling operations. Rebowling operations involving lead azide and primer mixes shall be performed by remote control, with the operator protected by an operational shield. (l) Thread cleaning. (1) Nonferrous picks shall be used for thread cleaning. Stainless steel brushes may be used to clean threads of explosives-loaded projectiles if a fuze seat liner separates the thread cleaning operation from the explosive charge. Operators do not need operational shields; however, thread cleaning operations should be separated from unrelated operations. (2) Power-actuated thread-chasing tools may be used to clean loaded projectiles when threads are imperfect because of previously applied sealers, provided the operation is performed within a separate cubicle and by remote control. Hand-operated thread-chasing tools may be used when no explosives are present in the threads. (3) Neither correcting cross threads nor thread cutting shall be performed on projectiles containing explosives. Straightening crossed threads is considered thread cutting. (m) Profile and alignment gaging operations. (1) Operational shields shall enclose each profile and alignment gaging operation, excluding small arms ammunition, to protect adjacent operations. The layout of the equipment and the operational procedures shall be developed to minimize personnel injury and property damage in case of accident. (2) During chamber gaging of high caliber fixed ammunition, the gage should be pointed toward a dividing wall or other barrier and the round inserted and removed by the same operator. In no case shall the round be left in the gage. Rounds of mortar ammunition shall be gaged before attaching propellant increments and, unless prohibited by the design characteristics, before assembly of the ignition system.
