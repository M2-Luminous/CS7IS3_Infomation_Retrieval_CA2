There were exchanges of artillery, mortar, and machine-gun fire between the government army and the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] rebels. The UN soldiers on the spot were forced to suspend the evacuation of civilians trapped by the fighting. Talks on a cease-fire were expected to resume today. In the capital, Kigali, eyewitnesses say that there is hand-to-hand fighting in the city centre. The RPF has in any case taken control of the Sainte Famille Church. Earlier, a shell hit the church, injuring 40 people. It was in this church that 60 adolescents took refuge and from which they were abducted [on Tuesday] and probably massacred by Hutu militiamen.
