In a statement in London, it said: "The murder was planned by the Turkish National Security Council and carried out by the Turkish National Intelligence Organization's agents." The front also claimed that it will definitely retaliate. Yeoryiadhis Acted Like a Militant Theofilos Yeoryiadhis, who was known for coordinating PKK activities in south Cyprus, established the Committee of Solidarity With Kurdistan in 1988. As a Turkologist who spoke Turkish very well, he worked as a member of the Greek Cypriot secret service organization until he was appointed head of the PIO Turkish Department. Yeoryiadhis visited the PKK camp in the al-Biqa' Valley together with several Greek Cypriot deputies in 1990. In a statement made in that camp, he claimed that the Kurds and the Greek Cypriots shared a similar fate. As the head of the Committee of Solidarity With Kurdistan, Yeoryiadhis was invited to attend the PKK's activities in Europe as a "guest of honor." He leveled serious accusations against Turkey when he addressed the "Kurdish festivals" in Bochum and Frankfurt. Yeoryiadhis organized campaigns on the Greek Cypriot side to support the PKK several times. He also opened bank accounts for donations to provide funds for the PKK. Yeoryiadhis refused to be interviewed by the Turkish newspapers for a long time. However, he agreed to make a statement to HURRIYET in December 1993. Stelios Vervirakis, HURRIYET correspondent in Athens, interviewed him at the time. Some of the views he expressed were as follows: 1. The PKK will definitely destroy the Turkish State. 2. The Cyprus problem can be resolved only after the Turkish State is destroyed. Meanwhile, the Armenians will be relieved. 3. I have problems with the Cyprus Government because of my links to the PKK and other Kurdish organizations. The Turkish Cypriot newspapers have declared war against me. 4. A PKK camp does not exist in Cyprus. PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan has not visited the island. I would have been the first to be informed of his arrival. Turkish and Kurdish refugees cross from north Cyprus to south Cyprus. However, a provision on "refugee status" does not exist in south Cyprus. So, they are returned or dispatched to Syria or sent to prison. 5. Abdullah Ocalan is a great leader. He travels to wherever he wishes to go. He has fascinating capabilities. He is definitely not a stupid person. I can help anyone who wishes to talk to him, that is, if he agrees.
