The sources pointed out that al-'Amaliqah's attempt received the support of Jihad elements and the fundamentalist militias to besiege the battalions of the southern al-Wahdah Brigade and clash with the Madram Brigade (partisan militias), but it failed to achieve its aims. In fact it enabled the Socialist Party to correct a mistake which had existed since January 1986, namely reinforcing its military presence in Abyan and destroying fundamentalist infiltration, which took place after the establishment of unity. Southern forces succeeded in storming the Afghan Arabs' centers in the al-Maraqishah mountains. High-level political sources arriving in Aden from Abyan the day before yesterday said that 90 Afghan Arabs from the Jihad organizations have been arrested and 30 killed. And that the others are being pursued in the northern Abyan heights toward the northern governorate of al-Bayda'. The source accused northern army commanders of supporting the Afghan Arabs, who were stationed in Abyan, and of supplying them with food and military equipment. The sources said that these did not exist before unity and they began to arrive in Shabwah, Hadhramout, and Abyan after unity. [passage omitted]
