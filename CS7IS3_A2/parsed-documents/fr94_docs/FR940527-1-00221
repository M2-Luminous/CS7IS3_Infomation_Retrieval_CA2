FR940527-1-00221 FR940527-1-00014 The stability of HCFA's vintage-weighted interest rate compared to annual changes in interest rates is portrayed in Figure 3. BILLING CODE 4120&hyph;01&hyph;P E:GRAPHICSEP27MY94.001 BILLING CODE 4120&hyph;01&hyph;C As we have discussed in connection with previous versions of the model, stability is an important criterion for evaluating the CIPI because it provides an important degree of predictability to the index. Although Medicare cost reports show that only 60 percent of current hospital debt is in the form of notes or bonds (about 40 percent is in the form of mortgages), we assumed that the relative annual weights for all debt and the relative annual changes in interest rates for all debt were the same as bond-related weights and price changes. We are still searching for an appropriate source of information on hospital commercial mortgage data. We do not expect that the discovery of such data will materially alter our current conclusions about trends in effective interest rates over time.
