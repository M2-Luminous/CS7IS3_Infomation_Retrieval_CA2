The two esteemed Spanish guests' activities this evening included a visit to the National Assembly, where Assembly President Shaykh Sid'Ahmed Ould Baba and Senate Speaker Dieng Boubou Farba welcomed them. During this visit, the Spanish royal delegation listened to a speech delivered by the president of the National Assembly on behalf of the two chambers of the parliament, which convened on this occasion. The Spanish monarch delivered a reply speech, in which he lauded the Mauritanian democratic experience. Colleague Mohamed Abdallah Ould Amin has a report on this visit: [Begin recording] [Ould Amin] [passage omitted] In a reply speech, the Spanish monarch, King Juan Carlos I, said: [Juan Carlos, in Spanish fading into Arabic translation] When we crossed the gates of this wide and luminous Sahara, we recalled Ibn Khaldun, who was of a Spanish Islamic origin and was among those who founded sociology, the creed that reminds us that Mauritania was the offspring of the great Sahara and that it is a melting pot for various cultures, elements, and races. According to Ibn Khaldun, the development of historic events, despite its variation, could be summarized in a simplified portrayal and centers on two different and integral elements: bedouin and urbanite. [passage omitted] As I address you today, I cannot but refer to these distant sources of our common history because I find them fresh in the memory and appropriate in status. This is because of the fact that the Mauritanian parliament--which represents one of the phenomena of national sovereignty and a legitimate representation of the noble Mauritanian people--is the fruit of a vital democratic process and is liable to result in a Mauritania with more vitality, freedom, justice, and progress in accordance with its traditions and appreciative of its past generations. The democratic vitality of your people is the best guarantee to continue the enormous effort that you have made to arrive at a balanced economic growth capable of integrating the people and the cultures in your country, with the respect of human rights according to the preamble of the Mauritanian Constitution. [passage omitted] Mr. President, honorable parliamentarians, because of your geographical and historical position, you are eligible to become the link between the Arab Maghreb and Africa south of the Sahara. I am aware that it is a very difficult task. However, it is, at the same time, an important incentive that depends on dialogue with neighboring countries and on finding quiet settlements to all differences and on the fruits of the efforts exerted in this field. On the regional level, Mauritania is considered an active member within the Arab Maghreb Union, due to the energies it employ in this field. Spain values the actions and initiatives undertaken with the aim of achieving economic integration in this region. [passage omitted] Spain will support every effort that will lead toward the settlement of the problem of the Western Sahara according to the UN secretary general's peace plan. This will enhance the prospects of regional integration. Within the EU, Spain will continue its policy, which aims at making Mauritania benefit as much as possible from all the allowances and activities on which the European-Maghreb cooperation is based. In the various international organizations, Spain will continue its support for Mauritania's strong efforts at modernization in the economic and social fields. [passage omitted] The foreign ministers of our two countries signed today a joint declaration that consecrated a collection of political principles aimed at consolidating bilateral cooperation in numerous fields. I am confident that everyone shares the belief in the importance of fulfilling these aims because they include the aspirations for a better future for our peoples as we approach a new century.
