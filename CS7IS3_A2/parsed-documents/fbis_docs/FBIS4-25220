A similar measure has also been taken between Britain and Russia. Meanwhile, the Russian and American armed forces have arranged a joint military exercise for the first time in early July, however, although only 500 soldiers will be involved, the details have yet to be worked out. In light of the sensitive discussions by the Russian press regarding the areas along the Volga as the site of the exercise, several American senators have suggested that the site of the exercise should be changed to a U.S. military base, and now the two sides are discussing the matter. Both issues have symbolic significance. The former signifies an "end to the era of viewing each other as nuclear opponents" between the two countries; the latter indicates that although Russia and the United States are no longer "nuclear opponents," it is not easy to build a new relationship in concrete terms. These two matters quite clearly reflect the current situation of the Russian-U.S. relations. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Russian-U.S. relations once became very "hot," and the press in the West called the situation a "honeymoon" in Russian-U.S. relations, holding that this was a "romantic period" after the two countries experienced a cold war and confrontation for more than four decades. Since the end of last year, difficulties in relations between the two countries have begun to increase. In February this year, Russia acted alone to intervene in the Sarajevo crisis, using vigorous political mediation to get rid of NATO's air strike plan, thus, ending the "honeymoon" period in Russian-U.S. relations. It seems that the relations between the two countries are changing into a new phase. There are many reasons for Russian-U.S. relations to change from "honeymoon" to a condition of cooperation on the one hand and competition on the other. One important reason is that although the ideological factor which played a vital role in the Soviet-U.S. relations in the past no longer exists, the geopolitical interests of Russia and the United States, the two big powers in the world, remain unchanged, and to a great extent this determines the basic orientation of Russian-U.S. relations. National interests, the status of a big country, and influence on the world have already become the foundation stone of Russia's diplomatic strategy. It seems that the United States has not abandoned the "restraining strategy" it once used in the past. The suspicious and precautionary mentality in the relations between the two countries still exists. Judged from a certain stance, changing the targets of nuclear warheads to the high seas also vividly reflects a new pattern of relations between the major powers after the cold war: Gone are the days when a clear line between friends and foes could be drawn and confrontation between groups could be seen. A new picture, more complicated and characterized by a condition in which one is neither friend nor foe or both friend and foe, has emerged. Proceeding from their own basic interests, Russia, the United States, and other major Western powers attack, defend, charge, and retreat in the big chess board of international politics, and maneuver among various political groupings, to strive for a better position in the emerging new world pattern.
