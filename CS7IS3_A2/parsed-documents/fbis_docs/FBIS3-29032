In the election of Rengo officers that was held last September, Yamagishi was elected to a third term in recognition of his efforts and achievements directed toward establishment of the coalition government. Even so, it was not the kind of thing one could call unanimous; it was because rival candidates stepped down reluctantly. It was certainly not a smooth election to a third term; there were such things as an argument for replacing Yamagishi emerging from local industrial unions connected with the former Sohyo [General Council of Trade Unions of Japan], which originally backed Yamagishi for chairman of Rengo. An argument for bringing in a new generation came from major private-sector local industrial unions, and there also welled up a reaction against a Yamagishi line which leans excessively toward politics. Certainly Rengo has suffered a series of defeats in the spring labor offensives of the last few years. Alienation of workers from unions has also become conspicuous, and although Rengo is a national center that mustered 8 million workers, the actual situation is that it has things which are far from what one would call the main headquarters of labor unions. Moreover, the labor environment has become harsher and harsher because of the bursting of the bubble economy and stagnation of business conditions. With real discharging of workers and so on being carried out by such means as employment adjustment, layoffs, and company restructuring, the existence of labor unions is now about to be called into serious question. If Rengo is only for such fortunate workers as those in major private-sector unions and in public-sector unions, its meaning as a national center will also disappear. It is also natural that calls to return to the labor movement come from within Rengo. There is even a feeling that most Rengo executives from Yamagishi on down have become "labor bureaucrats" rather than leaders of labor unions. Because of the end of the East-West cold war structure, ideological rivalry has disappeared. The word "working class" has also become an obsolete word. It is to be expected that not only politics, but labor unions as well, are pressed by the necessity to grope for new policy lines. It appears that Yamagishi tried to flaunt his sense of being a person to be reckoned with by intervening in politics with Rengo for a background. Thesis of Ozawa's "Purification" Is a Staged Event Yamagishi was the one who first granted an indulgence in the question of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] secretary general Ichiro Ozawa "turning over a new leaf." Yamagishi spoke out on the thesis of Ozawa's purification, saying "The past is the past. Everyone has a past. I think that for a person who up till now was at the heart of the government, and knows the delicious taste of politics, to abandon power by his own volition, resolving to take a big risk by wagering his political life, cannot be done by an average person. I think that Ozawa's political `purification' was completed by the formation of the new party. It is not a matter to go on discussing forever." Ozawa appears to have been overjoyed by this statement. It is said that when, even after that, Sadao Yamahana, who was chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], said "the public still has doubts regarding the connection between Ozawa and the Sagawa scandal," Ozawa spoke immediately. Ozawa said, even showing anger toward Yamahana, "It is no good because people say things, like Yamahana does. If you make up your minds on a coalition, get a firmer grip on yourselves. If you once say things clearly, like Yamagishi, everyone will stop asking." But at a subsequent press conference, Yamagishi stated the true meaning of the thesis of Ozawa's purification, saying "My saying that Ozawa's purification was completed was a political judgment. I do not think that his purification is complete, either. I said it because I thought Ozawa would feel indebted to me if I came to his aid when he was being attacked. Even after forming a coalition government, he will probably not be able to do something like refusing what I ask." It was, so to speak, a type of "staged [yarase]" statement. However, the truth be what it may, Ozawa and Yamagishi drew closer to each other rapidly through these circumstances. During the lower house election as well, Ozawa devoted himself to burrowing underground, hardly appearing on the surface. During that time he conferred with Yamagishi at Rengo headquarters more than once. While on the one hand Yamagishi is said to have performed great service in the birth of the Hosokawa coalition government, he has been branded a "Class-A war criminal" who caused the crushing defeat of the SDPJ because there were also cases in which SDPJ candidates who were excluded from recommendation by the Rengo selection lost in the election, but more than that, one cannot deny an overall lowering of the the SDPJ's image by Rengo making the selection. But according to a survey of the voting behavior of members of the Japan Telecommunication Workers' Union (NTT's union), which is Yamagishi's original parent body, the rate of support for the SDPJ was 52.6 percent. The result has become clear that 77 percent voted for SDPJ candidates in the last lower house election. Moreover, concerning recommended candidates in national elections, the number who say "even a Liberal Democratic Party candidate is all right" if he is sympathetic to the Japan Telecommunication Workers' Union, has risen to all of 43 percent. But in a February 1992 survey, the rate of support for the SDPJ in the All Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Union was 26.5 percent, and in the All Japan Federation of Electric Machine Workers' Unions was 13.3 percent. This means that the rate of support for the SDPJ in the Japan Telecommunication Workers' Union is still high, compared to the All Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Union and the All Japan Federation of Electric Machine Workers' Unions, but even though they are members of unions under the Rengo umbrella I cannot believe they are voting in accordance with Rengo headquarters' recommendations and support directives. It is no exaggeration to say that Rengo has already been reduced to a shell, not only in such labor-movement activities as the spring offensives, but also in the aspect of a political movement. Rengo's Demands Will Not Be Realized Be that as it may, how much meaning does establishing a nonLDP coalition government hold for Rengo? To be sure, labor-management relations within companies and workers' rights are of course all very well, but it is necessary to win a share of the pie in the aspect of government policy. Because such things as shortening working hours, the tax system, and all types of pensions are policy questions that are necessary and vital to workers. But if it becomes a matter of those who are working, that is, "workers," it means expanding to a national scale. If it becomes a matter of winning rights for one segment of workers, however, problems are generated. Consequently, there cannot be a coalition government for the benefit of Rengo. But Yamagishi is delighted at the birth of the coalition government. Yamagishi, who visited the prime minister's official residence immediately after the birth of the Hosokawa government, beamed as he shook hands with Prime Minister Hosokawa, saying, "I feel as though I have come home." He may have had the thought that he built the coalition government. This was probably because when former prime minister Miyazawa and Yamagishi conferred, Yamagishi was treated coldly, without even a handshake. Just because a coalition government has been created does not mean that Rengo's demands are about to be realized. In the time of LDP cabinets Rengo kept demanding income tax reductions. The argument for a broad reduction in income tax as a decisive factor in a policy to stimulate business conditions is being advanced from all sides, but the response of the government is not very different from that in the time of LDP governments. The government is adopting a cautious attitude because of the problem of revenue sources. An increase in the consumption tax rate has become a precondition for tax reduction. At one time Rengo united with the SDPJ and opposed introduction of the consumption tax. The situation is now such that an increase in the consumption tax cannot be avoided, but if it is this method, it would be possible to reduce income tax by any amount at all, even if it were not the coalition government. Furthermore, the question of starting to pay welfare pensions at age 65, which Rengo opposed, has also become a situation in which it seems likely to be settled in the direction of LDP governments. Yamagishi was welcomed warmly by Prime Minister Hosokawa, but that does not mean that Rengo's demands, themselves, will be respected. Is the Breakup of Rengo Also in Sight? The Hosokawa cabinet is maintaining a high rate of support as usual, but it is probably a matter of a certain kind of freshness manifesting itself as hope because the characteristic hue of the Hosokawa cabinet has not been shown in concrete policy. It is natural, because the coalition government parties agreed to carry on LDP government in basic policies, but one cannot sweep away the question: In that case, what is the purpose of the coalition government? Of course, starting with the succession of suspicious incidents, at the peak is the question of a 500 million yen contribution from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin to former LDP vice president Shin Kanemaru, which further developed into questions of illegal contributions and evasion of taxes on a grand scale. Needless to say, corruption because of long rule by the LDP burst forth. Speaking from that viewpoint, the fact that the coalition government put an end to the LDP's long rule has great political significance. However, Shinseito Secretary General Ozawa was at the core of the former Tanaka-former Takeshita faction, which was referred to during the long rule of the LDP, in particular, as "one-faction rule," and he controlled a part of power to the extent that it was spoken of as "Kanemaru-Takeshita-Ozawa." Because of Kanemaru's resignation from the Diet, the former Takeshita faction split up, and Ozawa was defeated temporarily in the power struggle. That Ozawa and his associates, the Hata-Ozawa faction, endorsed the no-confidence motion against former Prime Minister Miyazawa and proceeded to form a new party was Ozawa's counterattack against the anti-Ozawa forces. The birth of the Hosokawa coalition government was, so to speak, a concentration of the Ozawa versus anti-Ozawa power struggle. In a word, it means that Yamagishi supported Ozawa's struggle for power. Power struggles are inseparable from politics. In that sense, one cannot simply reject them, but what kind of meaning does the establishment of a non-LDP coalition government hold for Rengo? That point remains unclear. Nevertheless, Yamagishi is moving energetically to cause the SDPJ to turn toward a more realistic line. The SDPJ may cease to exist even if Yamagishi does not move. One can pass it off as the trend of the times, but will not the result be that Rengo will end up also losing the political base on which it depends? There is probably also the logical view that, if the SDPJ ceases to exist, Rengo need only join hands with such new forces as Shinseito and the Japan New Party; but in that case the influence of Rengo would become markedly weaker. Or, I even suspect that Yamagishi might foresee the future of Rengo as a national center, and have the breakup of Rengo in his sights. The Close Relationship of Ozawa and Ikeda In contrast with Yamagishi, who acted openly, the one who did not once come out publicly, but is said to have supported Shinseito's Ozawa, is Taisaku Ikeda, honorary chairman of Soka Gakkai. The LDP is doing things like demanding that Ikeda be summoned as a witness; that is because it is strongly conscious that Ikeda is behind Ozawa. Shinseito and Komeito are said to now be in total unity, and [Ichiro] Ozawa and Komeito Chief Secretary Yuichi Ichikawa have such a close relationship that they are called the "Ichi-Ichi combination." It is said that the greatest factor in Ozawa embarking on formation of Shinseito was because Soka Gakkai and Komeito promised complete support. In Nagata-cho all sorts of information flew about concerning the relationship of these two. There are such items as "the Soka Gakkai gave Shinseito's Ozawa 3 billion yen," or some such, and ones that said "10 billion yen," and "the Soka Gakkai became the guarantor, and Shinseito received a loan of 5 billion yen from Mitsubishi Bank." Of course, it is uncertain how much truth there is in these bits of information. Speaking from the proverb that where there is smoke there is fire, one can also suspect that there was probably some providing of funds, and on the other side one can also say that it is beneficial information. Because there is no way for anyone other than the persons involved to confirm questions about funds. But in the last lower house election, Shinseito's funds were more abundant than those of the LDP. The LDP provided each candidate with an endorsement allowance of 5 million yen and with 20 million yen for campaign expenses, but Shinseito gave an endorsement allowance of 5 million yen and 30 million yen for campaign expenses, and it is said that 60 million yen was given, depending on the candidate. The situation was such that an executive of the Obuchi faction of the old Takeshita faction, who had once been a close comrade of the members of Shinseito, was shocked, asking, "Why does Shinseito have so much money?" Up till now Soka Gakkai has depended on Kakuei Tanaka and Noboru Takeshita. As a huge religous organization, Soka Gakkai has all sorts of problems. There are many problems which require political power: doubts being raised about it as a religous corporate entity because of rivalry with the Ishiyamadera sect, suspicions regarding transactions in paintings by Renoir, it is being pressed to file revised reports because of a tax audit of Soka Gakkai headquarters, criticism of the thesis of unity of politics and religion in Komeito and Soka Gakkai, and so on. But Takeshita, upon whom the Soka Gakkai relied up till now, is in the situation of having to leave the LDP because of intervention of the right wing and gangs when the Takeshita government began; and with the breakup of the Takeshita faction, which was his base, he can no longer be relied upon. To the Soka Gakkai, it was in a situation in which it had to create a political force on which it could rely. Ikeda sekected Ozawa as his partner. Soka Gakkai and Komeito Have Influence When Ozawa was LDP secretary general, he supported Hisanori Isomura in the Tokyo gubernatorial election and was defeated, so he took responsibility for it and resigned the post of secretary general, but it is said that the one who originally recommended Isomura as a candidate for governor was Ikeda. It is judged that the problem of the Tokyo gubernatorial election was the turning point in the close relationship of Ozawa and Ikeda. Ichikawa is said to have been their go-between. It is said that Ozawa never speaks out actively at meetings of the representatives of the coalition governing parties (made up of general secretaries and secretary generals). It is said that the one who has the power to lead the meeting in Ozawa's stead is Ichikawa, and that has become the conventional wisdom. To put it in another way, it is probably a matter of the cooperation between Ozawa and Ichikawa being that close. It has been reported by all that the selection of Management and Coordination Agency Director General Koshiro Ishida, Posts and Telecommunications Minister Takenori Kanzaki, Labor Minister Chikara Sakaguchi, and Environmental Agency Director General Wakako Hironaka, who joined the Hosokawa cabinet, was done by Ikeda. In the last lower house election, Komeito replaced many candidates with younger ones. Former chairman Junya Yano, for example, was forced to step down in spite of having had some years to go before the mandatory retirement age. They cannot win election unless they have the support of Soka Gakkai. The will of Soka Gakkai is absolute. Conversely, if they are endorsed officially by Komeito, 90 percent are elected, without name recognition or anything else. Komeito counters the LDP's "criticism that it combines religion and politics" by arguing that "Soka Gakkai is nothing more than a simple support organization," but it is clear just by looking at election results that it is not a simple support organization. Moreover, Taisaku Ikeda's influence is so strong that Soka Gakkai is called "the teachings of Ikeda." It is said that in the last lower house election also Komeito and Soka Gakkai supported Shinseito candidates across the board in election districts where they were not competing with Komeito candidates. The "concept of a new new party" is about to become a reality between Shinseito and Komeito, and there is no impediment whatsoever on the Komeito side. Ichikawa says things like "If it were to become a system of two major political parties, it would be all right to disband Komeito," but looking at it in strategic terms, is this not an attempt to grasp the power of one of the two large political parties? Because so long as Soka Gakkai exists, its organizational strength will truly be everlasting. Ozawa insisted upon "power surpassing that of Komeito" as the condition for forming a new party. Was this not because, speaking from Ozawa's philosophy of numbers being power, he thought that with a force smaller than Komeito he would be unable to eliminate the influence of Komeito and Soka Gakkai? Whatever the situation in the upper house, Shinseito surpassed Komeito in the lower house. Which means that, in that point, Ozawa's plan was able to be achieved provisionally. But in order for Ozawa to continue to maintain influence within the coalition governing parties, Komeito's cooperation is indispensible in the current situation. This also means that Ikeda's support is necessary. However, there is no talk of Ikeda having made any request directly to the Hosokawa coalition government. Yamagishi cannot be compared with Ikeda in strength of real influence, but Ikeda is in the strange position of not being able to move in an open manner. It lies in the special nature of the leader of a religous organization, but on the other hand, it is also certain that he is an entity which the Hosokawa coalition government cannot ignore.
