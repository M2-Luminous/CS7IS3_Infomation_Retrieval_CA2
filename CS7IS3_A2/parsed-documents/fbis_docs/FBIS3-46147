Among those travelling, laborers seeking jobs outside their provinces are a large proportion. As predicted by pertinent departments, the total number of laborers flowing from region to region during the Spring Festival this year will exceed 10 million. For this reason, persons in charge of various localities and departments should make appropriate preparations and concerted efforts to straighten out the flow of laborers around the Spring Festival. Over the past few years, along with the urban and rural economic development, the shift of rural surplus labors to nonagricultural sectors has gathered pace, and laborers seeking jobs outside their regions have repeatedly increased. This has become a phenomenon in China's economic life, which merits people's attention. Thanks to the growth of agricultural productive forces and the markets of production factors, the emergence of such a phenomenon in China's economic life during the transition period from an agricultural to an industrial country, and from a backward to a modernized economy is, to a certain extent, inevitable. On the one hand, it has accelerated the mutually promotive and beneficial economic relationships among various regions, which is conducive to the improvement of peasants' lives and the enhancement of economic level as a whole, but on the other hand it has brought forth problems having an adverse impact on production, living order, social stability, and so on, owing to the blind flow on a large scale. In this regard, governments and functional departments at all levels should fully exercise their role of macroscopic regulation and control and play a positive part in actively cultivating and fostering labor markets, providing services to the rural population, and straightening out the flow of laborers with a view to bringing about the development, utilization, and rational distribution of rural labor resources, boosting economic construction, and maintaining good social order. The work to direct the flow of laborers during the Spring Festival is difficult to tackle and demands high techniques for its numerous links and concentrated tasks to be fulfilled in a short period of time. On the basis of summing up past experience, various localities and departments should study and work out measures and emergency plans to direct the flow by conscientiously intensifying leadership and meticulously organizing the masses to ensure that all measures are carried out in good time. In light of the quantity and direction of the flow, the railway and communication departments should draw up plans in advance and make proper arrangements for transportation. In the arrangements of tickets, runs, flights, and so on, efforts should be made to convenience the returning laborers, and the communication system should undergo strict technical and standardized examination to really ensure passengers' safety. Departments in charge of labor power in various localities should seriously perform their duties of organization, management, coordination, and others so as to keep abreast of the condition of the flow. Public security departments should properly organize the police force to maintain order in stations and ports as well as on traffic lines, and severely crack down on road robbers and other criminal activities so as to strengthen the sense of safety among the masses. The work to direct the flow of laborers is an important policy issue. In treating the masses, first of all, it is necessary to provide good services to them, pay attention to the work method in handling the matter, take an amicable and cordial attitude toward them, and refrain from being harsh and impetuous, lest it should sharpen the contradiction. Departments in charge of labor power and civil affairs should coordinate with other departments in patiently persuading and helping the transients to return home as early as possible. Propaganda departments should vigorously publicize the necessity of rational transference and orderly flow of rural surplus labor, disseminate the good experience in transference to work in local or nearby regions and organized exports of labor, and make peasants realize the drawbacks of seeking jobs in other regions. It is necessary to correctly explain and implement the party's policies so as to prevent peasants from misunderstanding these policies. In light of the seasonal and periodic characteristics and law governing the flow of rural laborers, leading cadres in various localities should pay close attention to carrying out the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and, while studying the issue of agricultural development, study and formulate policies and measures to facilitate the employment and utilization of rural laborers and boost labor markets, so as to take the initiative in settling the problem at an early date and in an effective way. The work to direct the flow of laborers around the Spring Festival is a major event that has a bearing on the immediate interests of and the social stability for millions upon millions of peasants. All localities and departments should fully realize its importance and take the work as a specific content of transforming government functions, changing work style, and doing practical things for the people. Hence, efforts should be made to do the work appropriately so that the vast numbers of people in cities and villages can spend a joyful and auspicious Spring Festival, thus making a good start for the work in the coming year.
