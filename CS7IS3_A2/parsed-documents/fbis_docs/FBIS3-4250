Ltd. here today. The symposium will be co-sponsored by the China Intellectual Property Right Society, the China Copyright Society and the Zhongcheng Intellectual Property Right Protection Service Co. Ltd. The representatives will come from the U.S.A., Japan, the Republic of Korea, Hong Kong and some European countries. Cai Cheng, chairman of the organizing committee of the meeting and member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that China has improved its own legal system regarding intellectual property right protection and has brought it into line with international practice. He said that if an overseas company found its intellectual property rights infringed upon, it could file a complaint with a Chinese court in accordance with Chinese laws and regulations, Cai said. He said that China has attracted more investors by the strength of its open policy and reform process. "In order to maintain the legal rights and interests of overseas investors and other intellectual property rights owners," Cai said, "the Chinese Government has promulgated a series of laws, regulations and rules." China adopted the Copyright Law in 1991, enforced the new Patent Law at the beginning of last year, and passed the Law on Trademarks in March of last year. China has also opened special courts in Shenzhen, Beijing and Shanghai cities and Hainan and Fujian Provinces, to handle cases involving intellectual property rights. Moreover, China has acceded to the world intellectual property right organization as well as a series of multilateral accords, including the Paris pact on industrial property right protection, the Madrid agreement concerning the international registration of trademarks, the patent cooperation treaty, and the Bern Convention for the protection of literary and artistic works.
