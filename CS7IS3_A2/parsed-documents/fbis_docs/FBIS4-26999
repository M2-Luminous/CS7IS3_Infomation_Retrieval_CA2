Agricultural issue topped today's agenda. CPPCC Chairman Li Ruihuan presided over and spoke at the meeting. He said agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. In China, agriculture has a direct bearing on economic construction, people's life, social stability, and so forth. The broad masses of people show great concern about ways to solve the agricultural issue. The CPC Central Committee and the State Council also attach great importance to the agricultural issue and have called a number of meetings since last year to make important arrangements. As a political organization, the CPPCC should show concern for and attach importance to agriculture and suggest ways and means to solve agricultural problems. Li Ruihuan said the CPPCC has made elaborate preparations after deciding on the meeting agenda. The CPPCC National Committee Office set up three inspection groups. Members of many special committees conducted special investigation and study. Provincial-level CPPCC organizations have also done a great deal of work. Li Ruihuan expressed the hope that comrades at the meeting would freely air their opinions, fulfill their duty of taking part in politics and in political discussion, and contribute to agricultural development. State Councillor Chen Junsheng delivered a work report at the meeting on agricultural work. He said the situation of agriculture and rural economy at present is good as a whole. However, he called on all to see that in the course of the rapid development of the national economy and in the process of changing the economic system, new situation emerges in the development of agriculture and of rural economy. China is now faced with some issues which it cannot afford to ignore. The CPC Central Committee and the State Council have always attached great importance to the new situation and new problems. Both the CPC Central Committee and various levels of governments are adopting measures to solve those problems step by step. He said agriculture has a direct bearing on the overall situation of the national economic development. It will be difficult to maintain the overall performance of the economy unless we take steps to guarantee the basic status of agriculture, to further enhance leadership over agricultural and rural work, and devote more energy solving existing problems in agriculture and in rural work. The CPC Central Committee and the State Council have repeatedly stressed the need to attach great importance to agriculture, called on localities and departments to enhance leadership over agriculture and rural work, and called for implementing measures to support and develop agriculture in actual work. In conclusion, Chen Junsheng said: The CPPCC has always showed great concern for agriculture and rural work; it has enthusiastically advanced suggestions and ideas to develop agriculture, rural economy, and to build new, prosperous, and civilized socialist rural areas. I want to express sincere thanks on behalf of Premier Li Peng and the State Council. I also hope that the CPPCC members will continue to supervise and support our work, make even greater contributions to develop agriculture and to revitalize rural economy.
