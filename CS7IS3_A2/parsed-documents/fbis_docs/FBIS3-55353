Svirin maintained that his country's position and the directions of its foreign policy are determined by the Russian president, who "has unequivocally stated his views on this issue." The diplomat hinted that Russia is much more concerned about Estonia's cold attitude toward proposals for solving the problems of Russian-speakers' citizenship and social protection. He claimed Russia presented the principles of troop withdrawal from Estonia already at the Dec. 1-2 meeting in Tallinn. "Unfortunately, the Estonian delegation insisted even then that the pullout of Russian troops be completed by Jan. 1," Svirin claimed. He said he has no information about Estonia's proposals for the next round of talks scheduled to take place Jan. 18-19 in Moscow. Svirin said the Russian delegation expressed during the latest round of negotiations its displeasure at the Estonian government's Dec. 1 decree on granting residence permits to retired military and their family members. In his opinion, the requirement that military pensioners sign a promise to honor Estonia's constitutional order, not to endanger the country's security with their activity and not to participate in the activity of armed groups, is humiliating. Svirin also said that, in the field of economy, Russia is preparing for "constructive work" this year to study closely a draft agreement on economic and commercial cooperation, as well as contracts on the use of ports, on transportation and on questions related to the Soviet Union's foreign debt. He said the drafts for about a dozen economic agreements will come under negotiation. Svirin stated that Russia intends to tie the conclusion of economic agreements favorable for Estonia to the signing of humanitarian accords.
