Tarasov, A. Vozhzhov, and A. Lebedev, identified by caption] [Text] [Tarasov] Four days of work out on the high seas have seen the ships of the Black Sea Fleet running through various combat training exercises to fend off underwater, surface, and air attacks from any likely adversary. The exercises were led by Vice Admiral Vitaliy Laryenov, first deputy commander of the Black Sea Fleet. In his judgment, the sailors coped well with the tasks set. But in general the results of the exercises would have been far better but for the regular disruption of drills and combat training due to shortages of financial and material resources. It is indicative that these latest exercise, completed without any hiccups, involved inducted personnel. As we know, nowadays warship crews are made up equally of citizens drafted both from Russia and Ukraine. Nevertheless, according to the sailors themselves, the long promised carve-up of the Black Sea Fleet is inevitable. So what is required now is the most vigorous action on the part of top Ukrainian and Russian officials.
