The affected towns are Ekumfi Otuam, Apam, and Komenda. According to Dr. George K. Aggrey, Mfantsiman District Medical Officer who led a team of medical personnel to Otuam said 23 cases had been reported at the Otuam Health Post. He said out of the number, 20 patients were treated and discharged while three are on admission. He attributed the disease to shortage of water in the area. Dr. Charles Ntiamoah Takyi, the senior medical officer in charge of Apam Catholic Mission Hospital, attributed the outbreak to the acute water shortage which has hit the Apam area for more than six months now. According to Dr. Takyi, about 20 students were treated from Apam Secondary School alone with diarrhoea for the past two weeks. Dr. Takyi advised the people to stop buying water from petrol and oil tankers. He alleged that some of the petrol and oil tankers are not well washed before they are filled with water for consumption. Commenting on the issue, Dr. Elias Sory, Central Regional Director of Health Services said an outbreak of cholera has also been reported in the Komenda area. He said apart from enough stock of drugs for the treatment of the disease, mobile vans have also been despatched to the affected areas to educate the people on its prevention. The director appealed to the people to ensure that their environments are kept tidy at all times.
