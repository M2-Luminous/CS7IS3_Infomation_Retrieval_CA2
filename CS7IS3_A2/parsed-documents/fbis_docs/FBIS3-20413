Reviewing the 1993 economy of our province, we are happy to note that it continued to grew steadily on the basis of the relatively fast development achieved in the previous year. According to the initial figures provided by the departments concerned, our province's total output value of goods and services for 1993 could reach 64.8 billion yuan, up 10 percent over the previous year. This double-digit growth, which we achieved despite numerous economic difficulties, was attributable to our efforts to deepen the reforms, open ourselves wider, adjust the economic structure, and raise our economic efficiency. Among the various components of the total output value, it is estimated that the tertiary industry increased 15 percent, topping the primary and secondary industries. Last year our province's economic operations had the following main features: A fairly high agricultural output. Despite the severe natural disasters--a drought followed by waterlogging and a cold spell--which hit a large part of our farmland, we still had a fairly good harvest, thanks to the strenuous efforts of the cadres at all levels and the masses in the province. Last year's total grain output is estimated at 10.85 million tons, or 1.4 percent more than the previous year. A continued growth was achieved in the output of tobacco, tea, sericulture, and animal husbandry. Township enterprises developed at a quicker pace. Total agricultural revenue is estimated at 20 billion yuan, a 53.2 percent increase over the previous year. A stable industrial growth. Despite numerous difficulties, such as a shortage of electric power, insufficient revolving funds, seriously inadequate outbound freight facilities, and rising prices of raw materials and other supplies, it is estimated that the gross value of industrial production could still reach 53 billion yuan, 14 percent more than the previous year. Production and sales were well coordinated, and economic efficiency continued to improve. For the period from January to November, sales within the budgets of state-owned enterprises increased 36 percent, while their profits and taxes rose 84 percent. Investment in fixed assets were focused on basic industries and infrastructure projects. The amount invested in production accounted for 67 percent of the total investment. More emphasis was laid on key construction projects. Stable sales on the market. With the step-by-step implementation of macroregulatory and control measures, the retail market gradually became stable. Retail sales between January and November totaled 24.6 billion yuan, 23 percent more than the previous year's corresponding period. The upward trend of consumption by government institutions was put under control. In the capital goods market, the problem of unbalanced supply and demand was eased for rolled steel, cement, and other main products. An improving financial situation. Through screening and rectification, we were able to effectively control such activities as illegal lending and borrowing as well as indiscriminate fund-raising. Residents' savings showed an upturn, and banks had a better paying capability. Fairly good results in fulfilling the revenue and expenditure budget. With the rise in the economic returns of industrial and commercial enterprises and especially due to the further development of the two tobacco-related industries, there was an increase in the industrial and commercial tax receipts, leading to a relatively fast growth of government revenue. Last year's revenue was estimated at 14.5 billion yuan from local resources. A continued rise in residents income. For urban people, the average per capita annual income used for living expenses is estimated at 2,430 yuan. In rural areas, the average net income of an individual is estimated at 670 yuan. Allowing for inflation, these are higher than the previous year by about 6 and 2 percent respectively. A further growth of imports and exports. According to estimates, last year's exports stood at $510 million, an increase of 12 percent over the previous year; imports $230 million, an increase of 12.7 percent; and the amount of border trade, including imports and exports, 2.8 millon yuan, an increase of 25 percent. With the continued development of the tourist industry, it is estimated that 376,000 travelers came into our province for sightseeing, a 20 percent surge over the previous year. Total receipts from travelers' foreign exchange certificates amounted to 530 million yuan, surpassing the previous year by 43 percent. An objective analysis shows that, despite our stable economic growth, some problems still exist in our economic activities. Chief among them are the difficulties encountered in developing agriculture caused by severe natural disasters and the hiking prices of means of production, the arduous task of curbing the sharp rise in commodity prices, the increased losses suffered by certain enterprises, and the relatively large amounts of unpaid taxes. All these problems have to be resolved through improving the reform drive. Based on the three-step national economic development strategy, the provincial party committee and government have come up with the following basic proposal for Yunnan's economic development in the future: With respect to the total output value of goods and services, we should maintain an average annual growth rate of 9-10 percent during the 1990's and achieve the objective of quadrupling the 1980 figure by 1995; that is, earlier than specified in the national strategy. We should score a total output value of more than 100 billion yuan and try to make it as much as eight times the 1980 figure by the year 2000. By that time, the rural people in our province should have a net per capita income of 1,200 yuan, the food and clothing problems in poverty-stricken areas should be resolved, and the people in most parts of the province should enjoy a comfortable life. The Yunnan people should work hard to achieve this goal. The first priority task will be infrastructure construction. In agriculture, we will build 50 more large- and medium-sized water conservancy projects during the eighth and ninth five-year plan periods. Our goal is to raise the irrigated acreage from the present 35 percent to 50 percent of the total farmland in the province and build 25 million mu of high- and stable-yield fields of various categories to meet different requirements. With regard to the power industry, we will invest some 10 billion yuan in building the 1.35-million-kw Dachaoshan Power Station and the 600,000-kw Qujing Power Plant, beginning this year. And we will continue to build a number of small- and medium-sized hydro power projects. Transportation construction will be focused on building four railways, renovating six highways, improving and constructing eight airports. As for communications, we will build a number of microwave, fiber optical, and second-grade satellite communications facilities to link Kunming with various prefectures and autonomous prefectures. With respect to mail and telecommunication services, we will see to it that automation is achieved in all counties and program-controlled equipment is installed in all major cities. Commencing this year, development of promising industries will be one of the major economic tasks in our province. In addition to the tobacco, sugar, and tea industries, we will develop livestock production, food-processing, nonferrous metal, machinery, phosphatic chemical, iron and steel, and building materials projects so as to gradually turn them into new strong industries. Another major task is to seize opportunities to create a new situation in opening our province to the outside world, Southeast Asia in particular. Now, our province has nearly 700 foreign-funded enterprises, and the negotiated foreign investment has reached $1.46 billion, of which the amount actually received and put to use is $144 million. To bring our opening-up activities to a high level, expand their fields, and develop them in breadth and depth, our goal is to increase the number of our products capable of earning more than $100 million of foreign exchange from one to six and solicit more foreign investment, mainly in the exploitation of our strong resources, in infrastructure construction and basic industries, in exchange-earning agricultural projects, and in the development of tourism. We will try to bring the three kinds of foreign-funded enterprises to over 1,000 and sign a number of agreements on Sino-foreign cooperative projects during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period. Additionally, we will further develop border trade and economic cooperation with neighboring countries in an effort to maintain a 20 percent growth in border trade. According to what we have learned, accelerating the development of township enterprises, export-oriented economic undertakings, and the tourist industry and further restructuring the economy are also major parts of Yunnan's economic work in the future. Meanwhile, Yunnan will always pay attention to correcting unbalanced development as a strategic task in economic construction. At the beginning of the new year, people are expecting Yunnan to take new strides to deepen its reforms and further its openness to the outside world.
