After two weeks of negotiations, the German delegation left without having achieved a result. Therefore, the planned alliance between Lufthansa and the largest U.S. carrier, United Airlines, continues to be blocked. The talks were supposed to complete the elementary agreement achieved in September. However, the U.S. Administration made use of some technical gaps to torpedo the agreement. Until the very last moment, the delegation from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) demanded that U.S. airlines once again receive unlimited access to the German market. Lufthansa rights in the United States, on the other hand, were to be restricted. Before the departure, the Federal Government once again offered comprehensive concessions to the U.S. side, among others in the field of the so-called third-country code sharing as well as regarding the number of permissible weekly frequencies. A U.S. response has not yet been received. Thus, the conditions of the elementary agreement remain valid, which results in disadvantages for both sides. Lufthansa now cannot cooperate with United. However, the Americans also have their hands tied: The number of weekly flights that Northwest wants to offer together with KLM from the United States via Amsterdam to Germany is limited to 140. In addition, only one U.S. airline may offer code sharing flights with a third-country airline beyond the FRG. In addition, the weekly frequencies across the North Atlantic will be frozen at the level of last October. A leading airline lobbyist in Washington said that "we are all losers in this situation." The decisive point for the unsatisfactory result was the influence of Delta Airline lobbyists in Washington. Via a complaint, Delta had demanded more rights for its own dispatching at Frankfurt airport. If these rights are not granted, the entire agreement should become pointless, it was argued. Disadvantage for Lufthansa For Lufthansa, which sees the cooperation agreement as an important building block on its path toward recovery, this limbo is particularly critical. The German state airline expects code-sharing across the North Atlantic to provide it with many times the additional revenues that it would lose in European business as a result of concessions to the Americans. DOT circles speak of up to 1 billion German marks. United Airlines is also disappointed about the collapse of the talks. A spokesman said in Washington that "the American attitude was intolerable right down to the last minute and violates the spirit of free trade."
