Det Sgt Tom Madden said he arrested Andrew Carass (26), married and an unemployed barman, of Buckingham Village, Summerhill, Dublin 1 on October 30, 1992. Carass told gardai he was to get £1,000 which he wanted as a house deposit. "I don't use drugs. It's only for fools. Jesus, I'm sorry for getting into this," he told gardai. Det Sgt Madden told Dublin Circuit Criminal Court that the defendant had 98.9g of cocaine strapped to his back and 692 ecstasy and other tablets in two packages down the front of his trousers. Carass pleaded guilty to importing the drugs from Amsterdam. Det Sgt Madden told Tom O'Connell BL, prosecuting, that the cocaine was 80pc pure and could have been cut two or three times before sale. Cocaine sold on the streets is usually 30pc pure and this amount would have been worth £50,000. The ecstasy tablets had a wholesale value of £4,500. Carass told gardai he also owed gambling debts to drug dealers. He flew to Brussels and took the train to Amsterdam where he booked into a hotel. After receiving an early morning phone call he collected the drugs at a bus shelter. He had no money for the return flight to Dublin and had to ring another man to pay for it. He didn't wish to name this man. Det Gda Madden agreed with Patrick Marrinan BL, defending, that Carass was easily led and had been used by other experienced drug-dealers as a courier. Father Dermot Peakin said he had known the Carass family for 30 years. They were very respectable and hardworking. The family had gone through hell since the arrest.
