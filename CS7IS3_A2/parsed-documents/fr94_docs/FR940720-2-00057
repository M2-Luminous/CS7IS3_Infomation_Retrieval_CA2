FR940720-2-00057 FR940720-2-00047 [AZ&hyph;930&hyph;4210&hyph;06; A&hyph;25613] Notice of Proposed Withdrawal and Opportunity for Public Meeting; Arizona AGENCY: Bureau of Land Management, Interior. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) proposes to withdraw for a period of 50 years, 1,988.27 acres of public land in Maricopa and Yavapai counties contiguous to existing Lake Pleasant which is an integral part of the Central Arizona Project. The purpose of the withdrawal is to reserve, from all forms of settlement, sale, location, or entry, the lands lying within the normal operating levels of the New Waddell Dam which are/would be prone to periodic inundation and/or water storage regimes. Any form of entry onto these lands, except for temporary uses of extremely short duration, could be hazardous to the health and safety of the public land users. Additionally, the enlarged lake will allow for increased recreational use and the BOR proposes to construct several new recreational developments to meet this demand. This notice closes the land for up to 2 years from surface entry and mining. The land will remain open to mineral leasing. DATES: Comments and requests for a public meeting must be received by October 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments and meeting requests should be sent to the Arizona State Director, BLM, P.O. Box 16563, Phoenix, Arizona 85011. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Mezes, BLM Arizona State Office, 602&hyph;650&hyph;0509. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 24, 1994, the petition was approved allowing the BOR to file the application to withdraw the following described public land from settlement, sale, location, and entry under the general land laws and the mining laws, but not the mineral leasing laws. The withdrawal would be issued subject to valid existing rights.

For a period of 2 years from the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register , the land will be segregated as specified above unless the application is denied or canceled or the withdrawal is approved prior to that date. The temporary uses which will be permitted during this segregative period are only those temporary land uses which are compatible with the proposed use of the land by the BOR.
