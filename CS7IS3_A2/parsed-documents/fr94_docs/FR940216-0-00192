(11) If the olefins level of the target fuel is greater than 19 volume percent, then D OLE shall be set equal to (OLE^19 volume percent). (12) If the olefins level of the target fuel is less than or equal to 19 volume percent, then D OLE shall be set equal to zero. (2) The winter NO X emissions performance of gasolines shall be given by the equations presented in paragraph (d)(1) of this section with the RVP value set to 8.7 psi. (3) The NO X emissions performance of the target fuel in percentage terms from baseline levels shall be given by the following equations: For Phase I: Summer NO X %=[100% × (NO X ^0.660 g/mi)]/(0.660 g/mi) Winter NO X %=[100% × (NO X ^0.750 g/mi)]/(0.750 g/mi) For Phase II: Summer NO X %=[100% × (NO X ^1.340 g/mi)]/(1.340 g/mi) Winter NO X %=[100% × (NO X ^1.540 g/mi)]/(1.540 g/mi) Summer NO X %=Percentage change in NO X emissions from summer baseline levels Winter NO X %=Percentage change in NO X emissions from winter baseline levels (e) Toxics performance _(1) Summer toxics performance. (i) Summer toxic emissions performance of gasolines in VOC Control Regions 1 and 2 shall be given by the following equations: TOXICS1=EXHBZ + FORM + ACET + BUTA + POM + NEBZ1 TOXICS2=EXHBZ + FORM + ACET + BUTA + POM + NEBZ2 where TOXICS1=Summer toxics performance in VOC Control Region 1 in terms of milligrams per mile. TOXICS2=Summer toxics performance in VOC Control Region 2 in terms of milligrams per mile. EXHBZ=Exhaust emissions of benzene in terms of milligrams per mile, as determined in paragraph (e)(4) of this section. FORM=Emissions of formaldehyde in terms of milligrams per mile, as determined in paragraph (e)(5) of this section. ACET=Emissions of acetaldehyde in terms of milligrams per mile, as determined in paragraph (e)(6) of this section. BUTA=Emissions of 1,3-butadiene in terms of milligrams per mile, as determined in paragraph (e)(7) of this section. POM=Polycyclic organic matter emissions in terms of milligrams per mile, as determined in paragraph (e)(8) of this section. NEBZ1=Nonexhaust emissions of benzene in VOC Control Region 1 in milligrams per mile, as determined in paragraph (e)(9) of this section. NEBZ2=Nonexhaust emissions of benzene in VOC Control Region 2 in milligrams per mile, as determined in paragraph (e)(10) of this section. (ii) The percentage change in summer toxics performance in VOC Control Regions 1 and 2 shall be given by the following equations: For Phase I: TOXICS1%=[100% × (TOXICS1^48.61 mg/mi)]/(48.61 mg/mi) TOXICS2%=[100% × (TOXICS2^47.59 mg/mi)]/(47.59 mg/mi) For Phase II: TOXICS1%=[100% × (TOXICS1^86.35 mg/mi)]/(86.35 mg/mi) TOXICS2%=[100% × (TOXICS2^85.61 mg/mi)]/(85.61 mg/mi) where TOXICS1%=Percentage change in summer toxics emissions in VOC Control Region 1 from baseline levels. TOXICS2%=Percentage change in summer toxics emissions in VOC Control Region 2 from baseline levels. (2) Winter toxics performance. (i) Winter toxic emissions performance of gasolines in VOC Control Regions 1 and 2 shall be given by the following equation, evaluated with the RVP set at 8.7 psi: TOXICW=[EXHBZ + FORM + ACET + BUTA + POM] where TOXICW=Winter toxics performance in VOC Control Regions 1 and 2 in terms of milligrams per mile. EXHBZ=Exhaust emissions of benzene in terms of milligrams per mile, as determined in paragraph (e)(4) of this section. FORM=Emissions of formaldehyde in terms of milligrams per mile, as determined in paragraph (e)(5) of this section. ACET=Emissions of acetaldehyde in terms of milligrams per mile, as determined in paragraph (e)(6) of this section.
