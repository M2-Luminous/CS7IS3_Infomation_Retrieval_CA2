Whenever there is a opportunity to hit the terrorist organization Hizballah without necessarily harming civilians, we do so, and we will continue doing so. They violated the understandings and responded with Katyusha attacks on civilian targets on Israeli soil. The fact that there have been no casualties or damage up to this point does not change the fact that they violated the understandings. And if they continue, we will have to respond to the violations. I presented the matter to the Americans via the ambassador here. It was the Americans who mediated the understandings. I prefer that they first try to arrange something within the framework of the understandings with Hizballah's patrons, the Syrians, but if this situation continues, we will not be able to abide it. [Sukenik] What prevented Israel from hitting that base before? Why today? [Rabin] We chose the right time because they are not always there. [Sukenik] Did you take into account the possibility that the price for attacking that base might be painful if Katyushas harm Israelis? [Rabin] Yes, because in harming them we harm those who in another week or two months will operate against us. [end recording] [Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television Network in Hebrew on 1700 GMT on 2 June carries similar remarks by Prime Minister Rabin at an Armored Corps gathering in Latrun. Asked by correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen whether the air raid might harm negotiations with Syria, Rabin says in a recorded passage: "There is no tie between the political negotiations with Syria and our war against Hizballah. Hizballah is the one that initiates the attacks against the IDF [Israeli Defense Forces] and SLA [South Lebanese Army] in the security zone, therefore the war against it is not carried out by responding to an act, but through an ongoing war based on the understandings reached in the wake of Operation Accountability in July 1993."]
