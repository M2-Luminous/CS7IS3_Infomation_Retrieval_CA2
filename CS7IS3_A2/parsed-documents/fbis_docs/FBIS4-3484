After hearing the reports, Comrade Wan Li pointed out: I am very glad to see Tianjin's vigorous progress in reform, opening up, and economic construction. Your such great achievements made through the efforts to develop the development zone in the past 10 years and the bonded area in the past three years fully prove the gigantic power of reform and opening up. At present, so long as we unswervingly work in accordance with the party Central Committee's 20-character policy on "grasping favorable opportunities, deepening reform, expanding the scale of opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability," will we be able to make greater achievements. During the inspection, Comrade Wan Li especially stressed the importance of science and technology and skilled persons. He said: Things should be done by the people. In conducting reform and opening to the outside world, we need a large number of specialized talents with the knowledge of technologies, management, and foreign languages. Open cities must open themselves to the outside world. We should learn foreign languages since childhood. Capable of foreign languages, our younger generation will better assimilate the advanced and scientific things in the world and spread the excellent culture of our Chinese nation to the outside world. At the Motorola corporation, Comrade Wan Li saw that the world advanced production line was operating at a highly-clean, sealed workshop. He was very glad to know that last year, this corporation generated 820 million yuan in output value and 130 million yuan of profits and taxes.

Our aim to conduct joint investment and bring in techniques, capital, and skilled persons is to bring in the most advanced techniques and managerial skills. We cannot bring in the things that have been eliminated by others.
