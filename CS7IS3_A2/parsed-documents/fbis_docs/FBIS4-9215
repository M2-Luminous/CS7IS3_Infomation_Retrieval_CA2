The refugee center has been hit. At about 1030 a tank caused bloody havoc in the Red Cross refugee center, where the old and the weak have been housed. Since this facility is still under constant chetnik artillery fire, the total number of casualties is still unknown. So far the bodies of four killed, and five wounded old folk have been dragged out. The evacuation of others is still under way. We have just received information that a tank shell in the center of Gorazde has killed one person, and wounded six others. This is just one illustration of the hell in Gorazde, just one example of the suffering of these people. [passage omitted]
