FR940916-0-00051 FR940916-0-00016 Paragraph (b), Determinations by the Secretary, sets forth the determinations that must be made in order to issue an Eligible Export Vessel loan Guarantee. Paragraph (b)(1) requires the Vessel to be of at least 5,000 gross tons if the loan Guarantee commitment cost is made available from funds transferred from the Secretary of Defense. Several commenters suggested that MARAD should make it clearer that Vessels under 5,000 gross tons are entitled to be financed as Eligible Export Vessels. In such instances, the loan Guarantee commitment cost would be charged against the appropriated funds provided by the Department of Transportation instead of the Department of Defense. However, one shipyard argued that all Eligible Export Vessel projects should be greater than 5,000 gross tons because the purpose of the statute is to facilitate conversion from defense to commercial activities. It asserted that to expend resources on relatively small Vessels, such as yachts and service boats, would not maximize U.S. shipyards' potential to compete in the commercial market. In addition, there would be the added practical difficulty of administering monies from two sources (Department of Defense and Department of Transportation) and the administrative overlay would be too expensive. Paragraph (b)(3) provides that Guarantees for Eligible Export Vessels shall not be approved unless the Secretary determines that the country to which the Vessel is to be exported, together with related institutions, is sufficiently creditworthy. Numerous commenters objected to the requirement that the Secretary make a determination as to the creditworthiness of the foreign country to which an Eligible Export Vessel is to be exported. They noted that the new statute does not contain such a requirement and that the regulation does not clarify what is meant by the country ``to which the Vessel is to be exported.'' The country could be the country of flag, the country where the owner and/or operator is located, or the countries where the Vessel could operate. Two commenters expressed concern that the creditworthiness requirement, if applied to the country of flag, would apply to flag-of-convenience countries where the Vessels will rarely call. One commenter specifically noted that Liberia and Panama, two of the largest Vessel registers, would be off limits pursuant to such a requirement. The commenter stated that a lender can accept a Mortgage and registration from a country with poor credit provided the overall project is sound. Some commenters argued that the creditworthiness of a foreign nation should not be a concern because the Secretary will have a security interest in vessels or other collateral. Another commenter suggested that where there is adequate security for the Guarantees, MARAD's only other legitimate interest should be whether the country of registry's legal structure provides for adequate enforcement of the Mortgage or other security. One commenter noted that this is a different loan program from those that would require some political or country risk analysis and the provisions for a review by the Secretary of Defense should be adequate to screen out deals that may involve entities from countries whose interests are hostile to the U.S. or who pose a threat to our national security. Another commenter noted that the regulation does not identify the issues or elements to be weighed by the Secretary in making a determination of ``creditworthiness'' nor do they state the standards against which such elements shall be measured. MARAD Response: The role of the Secretary of Defense is established by statute. See section 1104A(j)(1) of the Act. MARAD cannot alter the time period established by Congress for review by the Secretary of Defense or otherwise expand or contract that Secretary's authority. It is, of course, clear that the Secretary of Defense may only disapprove a loan Guarantee based on an assessment of ``the potential use of the Vessel in a manner that may cause harm to the United States national security interests.'' Id. MARAD concurs, however, with the comment that the third reference in the second sentence of paragraph (a) to the Secretary should include the words ``of Defense'' and has so modified that sentence in the final rule. MARAD concurs with the suggestion that it should clarify that vessels under 5,000 gross tons can be financed as Eligible Export Vessels with funds provided by appropriations to the Department of Transportation instead of funds provided by the Department of Defense. MARAD believes that it should exercise the broadest possible flexibility to assure that U.S. yards can be stimulated to engage in international commerce effectively. MARAD also believes that it may, in fact, be very reasonable to finance smaller, ``niche'' vessels, and is acting to preserve its authority to do so. Problems of administering the monies from two different sources are negligible.
