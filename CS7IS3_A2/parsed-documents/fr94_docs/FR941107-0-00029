FR941107-0-00029 FR941107-0-00010 The Proposing Release also solicited comment as to whether hybrid debt securities should be considered as debt or equity securities for purposes of new Rule 3a12&hyph;11. The Commission received limited comment. After further consideration, the Commission believes that no further clarification regarding hybrid securities is necessary; if a security is not an equity security as defined by the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder, then the security will be considered a ``debt security'' for purposes of Rule 3a12&hyph;11. 35 35 Specific questions regarding whether a security is a debt security for purposes of Rule 3a12&hyph;11 may be brought to the attention of the Division of Corporation Finance, Office of Chief Counsel at (202) 942&hyph;2900. C. Exemption from Compliance with the Proxy Rules As discussed above, debt securities listed on a national securities exchange are subject to proxy regulation while debt securities traded in the OTC market, the principal trading market for debt securities, 36 are not. The disparate application of the proxy rules between listed debt securities and OTC-traded debt securities reflected the nature of the debt markets in the 1960s when Congress amended the Exchange Act; 37 this difference in regulatory treatment is cited by some as a significant disincentive for corporate issuers to list their debt securities on a national securities exchange. 38 36 The OTC market is the principal trading market for debt ( see n. 21, above). Of the more than 13,000 publicly traded domestic corporate bond issues in 1989, fewer than 20% (2,135 on the NYSE and 280 on the American Stock Exchange (``AMEX'')) were listed on the NYSE and AMEX. See Colloton, ``Bondholder Communications_The Missing Link in High Yield Debt,'' Hill and Knowlton, Inc. at 17 (August 1990). 37 In 1963, the Commission submitted a report to Congress that set forth its recommendations as to the scope of regulations needed for the OTC market. See, Report of Special Study of Securities Markets, (``1963 Special Study'') U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, H.R. Doc. No. 95, 88th Cong., 1st Sess. pt. 3, 34 (1963). These recommendations led to the adoption of Section 12(g) in 1964. The Commission concluded that proxy regulation should not be required with respect to debt securities since Section 14 was designed to protect shareholders and the solicitation of proxies was ``rarely [a] problem[ ] related to debt securities and, then, most probably in insolvency cases where other protections are available.'' Id. See also Section I.C of Release No. 34&hyph;34139. 38 See, e.g., letter from Jeffrey S. Werner, Senior Vice President, General Electric Capital Corporation to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, dated August 5, 1994 (``GE Capital letter''). To eliminate the disparity, the Commission proposed Rule 3a12&hyph;11(b) to exempt debt securities listed on a national securities exchange from proxy regulation, but solicited comment as to whether the antifraud proscriptions 39 and the Exchange Act rules governing the transmission to beneficial owners of proxy and consent materials and information statements should be excluded from the proposed exemption. 40 The majority of commenters favored the proposed rule. With respect to listed debt securities, the proxy rules largely cover solicitations to amend the terms of an indenture contract. 41 Commenters who supported the exemption noted that debtholders often negotiate specific provisions governing the amendment of the indenture contract, and therefore, unlike shareholders, debtholders do not need the protection of the proxy rules. 42 39 Exchange Act Rules 14a-9 [17 CFR 240.14a-9] and 14c-6 [17 CFR 240.14c-6]. 40 Exchange Act Rules 14a-13, [17 CFR 240.14a-13], 14b-1 [17 CFR 240.14b-1], 14b-2 [17 CFR 240.14b-2] and 14c-7 [17 CFR 240.14c-7]. All terms used in these rules have the same meanings as in the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 14a-1 [17 CFR 240.14a-1] and 14c-1 [17 CFR 240.14c-1]. Additionally, the exemption afforded by Rule 14a-2(a) [17 CFR 240.14a-2(a)] will continue to be available. 41 Solicitations of debtholders are infrequent. For example, between 1990 and 1993, 18 have occurred with respect to NYSE-listed issuers. See letter from Fred Siesel of NYSE to David Sirignano of the Division of Corporation Finance dated May 12, 1994. 42 See letter from John F. Olson, Chair, Committee on Federal Regulation of Securities, American Bar Association (``ABA''); John J. Huber, Chair, Subcommittee on 1933 Act, ABA; and Richard E. Gutman, Chair, Subcommittee on Reporting Companies under the 1934 Act, ABA, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, dated August 4, 1994 (``ABA letter''). See also letters from Karl R. Barnickol, Chairman of Securities Law Committee, American Society of Corporate Secretaries, Inc. to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, dated July 26, 1994; Earle Mauldin, Chief Financial Officer, BellSouth Corporation to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, dated August 4, 1994; GE Capital letter, n. 38, above. In addition to the protections supplied by the indenture contract and the Trust Indenture Act, debtholders will continue to be protected by the proxy rules' antifraud proscriptions and the Exchange Act rules that facilitate the transmission of materials to beneficial owners. The Commission has determined that any exemptive relief from the proxy rules should not encompass the antifraud proscriptions or the rules relating to the transmission of materials to beneficial owners. The antifraud proscriptions provide protection to investors without placing any undue burden upon the issuer. Further, the rules relating to the transmission of materials to beneficial owners not only provide protection to investors but also benefit the issuer by facilitating its ability to communicate directly with its debtholders. Accordingly, new Rule 3a12&hyph;11(b) will exempt exchange-listed debt securities 43 from proxy regulation, except that the antifraud proscriptions and the rules adopted under the Exchange Act to facilitate the transmission of materials to beneficial owners will continue to apply. The foregoing provisions, coupled with the issuer's reporting obligation under the Exchange Act, should ensure that investors remain protected. 43 The term ``debt securities'' will be defined in the same manner as in the exemption from the restrictions on borrowing. See Exchange Act Rule 3a12&hyph;11(c).
