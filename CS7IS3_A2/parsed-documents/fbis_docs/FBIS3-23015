Prominent figures belonging to armed formations are, to all intents and purposes, being wiped out gradually and almost in a systematic manner. The hallmarks are identical in almost every case. Unfortunately, the law enforcement bodies have not uncovered a single fact concerning this terrorism. Who could be responsible for this? Nothing can be excluded in our troubled times. The point is that countless armed groups are active in the country. The general public knows that relations between these groups are far from good and, on this basis, we could be dealing with clashes between mafia clans or a "mafia war" similar to that in the United States in the 1930's. The reason lies in the redistribution of spheres and lines of action. As a result of the existing unstable political factor in the country, it is quite possible that certain political forces are also interested in the "removal" of some of these people. There is also another element -- external forces that, today, are not creating or are unable to create new hot spots in Georgia (life is, to a certain extent, following its course) and this method gives them the means to preserve a certain measure of instability and create an atmosphere of fear among the population. It is known that recent terrorist acts have resulted in the deaths of innocent people. Therefore, such a serious situation in the country enables both external and internal political forces to destroy physically their main political rivals. Unfortunately, one can expect the further development of events in this direction: It is much easier today to get rid of a political rival with a bomb than have him arrested. So, if the authorities are unable to dispel these suspicions, they should at least aim to unmask the perpetrators of these terrorist acts in order to restore order. Otherwise, we will have every reason to believe that the current authorities are creating the serious situation prevailing in Georgia. [Natadze] I have specific information (about one month now) that Russia is planning to occupy Georgia within six months using several divisions. The first stage: One and a half months will be needed to disarm bands and also, against this background, all those left [in possession of weapons] or, in other words, the physical removal of weapons from Georgia. The next month and a half will be needed for the production of meager "calories" (loans, supplies) and the final three months will be needed for the creation of its own power structures (troops to guard the railways...). As I knew, in order to embark upon this operation, Russia needed an "invitation"; if not from parliament (naturally, they would not be able to get it from parliament) and if not from the head of state (the head of state would never take such a direct step), at any rate, from some kind of elite group of 200-300 persons. The so-called proletariat is no longer suitable for such a thing as it was in 1921. That needed a clever elite. They have been unable to muster such a group, not because there are not 200-300 unscrupulous people in Georgia, but because this potential group of unscrupulous people has the ability to make minor forecasts. They know what to expect by taking such a step. As can be seen, they [Russia] have abandoned such a move and have started to take direct action. I think that what is happening is state terrorism; only, the state concerned is not Georgia but a neighboring one that has countless agents in Georgia. Your newspaper has dealt with this issue in Irakli Batiashvili's [former head of the Information and Intelligence Service] article [in the issue of 8 February].
