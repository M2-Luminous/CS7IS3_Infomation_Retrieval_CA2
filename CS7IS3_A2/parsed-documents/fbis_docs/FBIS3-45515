The following circular on several legal issues which often crop up in the course of running Sino-foreign joint ventures in various localities is now issued: 1. Concerning replacement of approval certificates. Sino-foreign joint ventures, in the course of carrying out contracts, often have to change the addresses of the joint ventures, the parties in the joint ventures, the total amount of investment, the business scope, the formation of the boards of directors and changes in the chairmen and vice chairmen of these boards, and changes involving the contents of approved agreements, contracts, rules, and approval certificates which have already been issued. Article 17 of the "Regulations for Implementing the Sino-Foreign Joint Venture Law" stipulates: "Agreements, contracts, and rules for joint ventures come into effect on approval by examination and approval organs and the same holds true in the case of alterations." Therefore, all changes in the major contents of agreements, contracts, and rules for joint ventures should be approved by the original organs for examination and approval. Upon approval, new approval certificates will be issued with the same serial numbers as the original approval certificates and the old approval certificates will be taken back. Changes in registration will be made against the approval certificates at the original registration organs. 2. Concerning the issue of not allowing general managers or deputy general managers of Sino-foreign joint ventures to take up concurrent posts as general managers or deputy general managers of other economic organizations. Article 40 of the "Regulations for the Implementation of Sino-Foreign Joint Venture Law" stipulates: "General managers or deputy general managers will not take up concurrent posts as general managers or deputy general managers of other economic organizations and will not take part in commercial competition for other economic organizations against the joint ventures." At present, the general managers of the foreign sides of some Sino-foreign joint ventures have concurrent posts as general managers or other posts in enterprises outside the bordera. This violates the laws in China and should be stopped. The "other economic organizations" stated in the provision include both economic organizations at home and abroad. 3. Concerning the limits of authority for examination and approval of increasing investment in Sino-foreign joint ventures. If an approved Sino-foreign joint venture wants to increase investment because of the needs in production, operation, and so on, and if the sum of the amount of investment to be increased and the amount of the original investment exceeds the limits of authority for examination and approval of the original organ of examination and approval and the expanded part is within the same project, the newly signed agreement on increasing investment should, together with the originally approved documents, be submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade for examination and approval. The abovementioned matters regarding approved Sino-foreign joint ventures and foreign trade enterprises should be handled according to the abovementioned principles. [Signed] Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade [Dated] 17 December 1987
