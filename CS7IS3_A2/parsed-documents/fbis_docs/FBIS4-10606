FBIS4-10606 "drlat073_k_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-073 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 SOUTH AMERICA Argentina Cuban Foreign Minister Views Trip's Objective Cuban Foreign Minister Views Trip's Objective PY1404204994 Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS in Spanish 1129 GMT 14 Apr 94 PY1404204994 Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS Spanish BFN [Text] Buenos Aires, 14 Apr (NA) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina asserted that the nearly $1 billion debt Cuba has with Argentina "is not a tabled issue," but that Fidel Castro's administration "does not have the necessary money to repay it." After meeting with Senate bloc leaders on 13 April, Robaina said: "In our view, the fact that the debt issue has not been tabled means that we will assess all possibilities and mechanisms so as to include some items like medicines and agroindustrial input." Robaina was received after the meeting by President Carlos Menem at the Olivos presidential residence. The Cuban foreign minister noted that his trip to Argentina "mainly seeks to explain the investment opportunities Cuba offers." To this effect, he expected to hold talks with local business people from different sectors. The diplomat -- who headed the Cuban Communist Youth General Secretariat in the 80's and is now considered one of Fidel Castro's "dauphins" [delfines] -- said the opening of the country to foreign capital "is part of the situation Cuba is going through, which can be labeled difficult." He stated that this economic opening drive also applies to the political sphere. Regarding this, he said: "Cuba is willing to take any subject to the negotiating table as long as it does not affect its independence and sovereignty." "Opening does not mean going backward in education, health care, science, or sports because these are achievements that we are not prepared to negotiate," he remarked. Robaina explained: "The concept of a normal political opening in any country that lives under normal conditions cannot be applied in the case of Cuba, since it continues to be a besieged stronghold and cannot afford to lose its unity." Commenting on the possibilities of a meeting between Presidents Carlos Menem and Fidel Castro at the next Ibero-American summit to be held in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, in May, Robaina said it will depend on the heads of state's respective agendas. "There are no concrete plans for a meeting, but we keep an open mind about it and the practical possibilities of holding such a meeting will depend on the meeting date and on Menem's and Castro's respective agendas in Cartagena," he pointed out. With regard to trade relations between both countries, the Cuban foreign minister said: "There are many opportunities and our efforts are geared to areas like tourism, medical and paramedical services, biotechnology, and agriculture. Nevertheless, we have not yet discussed any project in particular." Robaina stated: "Cuba has opened the country to foreign investment as part of a huge package of measures that are under way. This is precisely what we intend to explain to Argentine entrepreneurs. In this lies the fundamental objective of our visit."
