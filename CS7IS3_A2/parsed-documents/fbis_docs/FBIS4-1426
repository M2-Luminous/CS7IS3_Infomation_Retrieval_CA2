Police could not comment immediately. It is understood the vehicle was hijacked by four men on its way to a polling station at a school in the area. The vehicle was later recovered by police, with only four boxes of ballot papers. The rest of the papers were missing. The IEC men in the vehicle were unhurt. Two men were reportedly arrested by police, but this could also not be confirmed. IEC officials, escorted by police, went to collect more ballot papers. By just before noon on Wednesday, a 3km queue had developed at the polling station. Also in the queue were scores of voters from nearby squatter settlements and from Soweto and Pimville townships, outside Eldorado Park. Voting at the polling station in the coloured area began just after 7AM.
