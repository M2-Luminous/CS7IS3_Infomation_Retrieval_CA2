CN coordinator Jose Miguel Uzcategui said the party has already told the president their position. He also said, however, that CN legislation experts have studied the empowering bill proposed by AD and have found that financial and economic outlines, which should have been included in the proposal, are missing. He also said that analysts have been looking into past experiences with previous empowering laws, particularly those during former President Ramon J. Velasquez' time when he was forced to apply measures, like the value-added tax, on consumers. [Begin Uzcategui recording] Additionally, we must discuss the temporary nature of the law. Three of the previous experiences lasted one year each and the last one lasted five months. We believe some decrees can be drafted and enacted in 30 days. This period of time, however, is too short for fiscal measures. [end recording] Finally, Uzcategui said it is the president which must decide on an empowering bill, providing the president is familiar with the bill's definitive wording.
