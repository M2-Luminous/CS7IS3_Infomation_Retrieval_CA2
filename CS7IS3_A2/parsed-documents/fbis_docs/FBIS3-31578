The minister of agriculture, Ioan Oancea, read a report on the stage of agricultural works and stressed that the soil fertilization is taking place at a very slow pace because of the lack of funds. However, the situation is about to improve, through the implementation of a recent government decision. In the same context, Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu called for the expansion of control over the implementation of the government norms and over the application of reform in various economic sectors. Also during the government meeting, Minister of State Mircea Cosea, president of the Coordination, Strategy, and Economic Reform Council, briefed those present about the stage of the discussions regarding the actions that have been taken in the privatization acceleration process. Mr. Mircea Cosea insisted on the need to ensure a uniform coordination of privatization policies of various bodies in charge of various sectors in this area. The norms currently valid in connection with reform and certain norms that are in the middle of a finalization process have been reviewed, namely, a draft decision regarding the organization and functioning of the secondary market for property certificates, another draft decision regarding methods to sell bonds, and the draft law on accelerating the privatization process. Likewise, it was noted that there are plans to reorganize the National Agency for Privatization. At the same time, proposals were made to modify certain existing norms, respectively law No. 15 regarding the legal status of commercial companies and their responsibility. State Minister Mircea Cosea mentioned that a first action to speed up privatization will be to make a public offer, that is to sell bonds from six commercial companies, out of the 63 that will be privatized in April-May 1994. Further, Mr. Mircea Cosea presented the projects for the future development of small and medium-sized enterprises, informing the executive that the Romanian Fund for Guaranteeing Credits for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise, in which the Romanian state has a share of 98 percent, started operating. He also informed the executive that the Balkan Center for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises has been set up in Bucharest. Also during the meeting that the cabinet held today, the draft decision to increase the salary fund, exempt from additional tax, has been adopted, as a result of the increase of economic efficiency of the activity carried out by commercial companies whose majority shares belong to the state and autonomous public corporations. He also noted that, as a result of discussions with trade unions, the basis for calculating salary increase according to other economic indicators, remains open.
