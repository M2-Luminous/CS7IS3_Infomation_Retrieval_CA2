Foreign trade departments, product-exporting enterprises, and foreign businessmen generally welcome this measure, but the black market price for foreign exchange certificates [FEC] fell on the announcement. Shanghai: After the news was announced that the renminbi exchange rates would be unified as of 1 January, there was a strong reaction in Shanghai, China's largest economic city. Our reporter has learned from foreign exchange "speculators" that no one wants to ask about the FECs, which previously were as attractive as the U.S. dollar. The exchange rate between the FEC and the renminbi has dropped from 1:1.4 to 1:1.1. With the abolition of foreign exchange settlements, it will be easy to exchange foreign currencies into renminbi. Many black market traders think it will be very difficult to operate in the black market in the future. Chinese residents have a lot of FECs. To prevent them from devaluating further, many people are shopping in foreign-related arcades, bringing about extraordinarily brisk business. Take the well-known Shanghai Friendship Store as an example. As it is still less expensive to buy gold with FECs than with renminbi, the turnover in gold ornaments doubled today. There has been no great change in terms of transaction volume at the Shanghai Foreign Exchange Swap Center today, but more small traders are selling U.S. dollars. The central bank has absorbed more than $6.3 million. The swap center finally closed at 8.7 yen to the dollar, which has remained at this level for several months. Moreover, the Shanghai Foreign Exchange Swap Center -- China's largest -- today closed the last foreign exchange swap transactions for 1993 with an annual transaction volume of over $5 billion. Guangzhou: The market reaction in Guangzhou is quiet today and the foreign exchange swap market is operating normally. As provided by the Guangzhou Foreign Exchange Swap Center, from today's swap exchange price for individuals, we can see that since the small readjustments on 24 December, there have been no changes in exchange rates so far. The spot exchange buying price is 825 yuan per 100 U.S. dollars; the banknote buying price is 815 yuan; and the selling price for spot exchange and banknotes is 877 yuan. The rate between the Hong Kong dollar and the renminbi is: Buying price -- 100:107 for spot exchange and 100:106 for banknotes; Selling price -- 100:114 for both spot exchange and banknotes. A person in the trade holds that the unification of exchange rates does not have a major impact on foreign exchange swap business, either for individuals or for enterprises. A person in charge of the deposits and exchange swap section of the Guangzhou branch office of the Bank of China said: Since the launch of foreign exchange swap business, most foreign exchange business has been operated according to foreign exchange swap prices. For this reason, the effect on business following the exchange rate unification is very small. A person in charge of the Guangdong Foreign Exchange Swap Center stressed: Following the unification of exchange rates, the terms under which enterprises use foreign exchange will be relaxed. To a certain extent, this will ease the situation in Guangzhou in which demand for foreign exchange is greater than the supply. When commenting on the unification of exchange rates and other new measures for reforming the foreign exchange management system, Xu Dezhi, chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Commission for Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, said: Although these measures come under reform of the banking system, they are principally operated in the foreign trade field. In his view, these measures are very favorable to the expansion of foreign trade and exports. Fuzhou: After the news on the unification of exchange rates was announced, the price of foreign currency dropped on the black market today. It dropped from 8.63-8.65 yuan to the U.S. dollar yesterday to 8.6 yen today. According to a foreign exchange speculator, the price will contionue to fall tomorrow. This is because the unification of renminbi exchange rates will deprive speculators of the chance to make profits from the "dual price system." Shenzhen: Since it was rumored that the state would further reform the foreign exchange management system as of New Year's Day, the reaction in Shenzhen's banking sector is calm today. There has not been any abnormal situation. The listed exchange rate between the renminbi and the U.S. dollar remians 8.7:1, as it has been in the past few days. Since FECs are not widely circulated in Shenzhen, there is no problem of a drop in the exchange rate of the FEC. As for the argument that the circulation of foreign currencies is banned in China, the public here generally hold that there is a special reason for Hong Kong dollars to circulate in certain places in Shenzhen. It is unlikely that it will not be used any longer in the near future and therefore there have been no major sales of Hong Kong dollars. Zhuhai: There has been no change in the swap price for renminbi in Zhuhai today. It remains as it has been in the past few days. Although Zhuhai residents learned from the newspapers and television that the exchange rates of the renminbi would be unified as of 1 January, the reaction has been calm. It also has been learned that the Zhuhai Foreign Exchange Swap Center will not open for business on 1 and 2 January because of the holidays. The initial market reaction to the unification of the renminbi exchange rates will be known on 3 January.
