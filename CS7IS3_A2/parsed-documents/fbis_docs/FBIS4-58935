He described what is taking place there as civil war, and talked about what he called military victories and the determination to fight in these events. This fact that this statement was made by someone who is also an official in the CIA reveals once again the dubious U.S. intentions toward this fraternal country. In a comment on this, JANA's political editor asked whether these Americans have come to mediate, as their media claim, or whether they have come, as is their custom, to sow discord, incite hatred, and make the fighting spread, within the framework of the plan they are implementing to destroy the Arab nation.
