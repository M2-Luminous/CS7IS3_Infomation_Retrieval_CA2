Dr. Sergio Ramirez opened the meeting with an analysis of the Special Congress, stressing that programmatic views were given little attention, even though this was the primary purpose behind convening the congress. Dr. Ramirez said that in order to save Sandinism and make it viable in future elections, the inferior leadership that was elected at the congress had to be left behind, because this kind of FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] does not have the remotest possibility of influencing the rest of Nicaraguan society. The participants marched on stage and, putting aside the topic of the authenticity of the FSLN Congress, focused on offering formulas for continuing the work of the renewal current. They all agreed that the job had just begun and that a great deal of work remained to be done. Taking advantage of the fact that representatives from nearly every department were present, they began to outline the work that will be conducted nationwide. Those in attendance were informed that the "purges" conducted in the congress were rejected both at home and abroad. They also learned about the widespread feelings of Sandinists who do not belong to the squalid structures and who oppose the control the conservative sector has gained over the party leadership. Some speakers predicted the National Directorate will veer to the right in alliance with COSEP [Higher Council of Private Enterprise]. The conservative trend was revealed during a news conference held by the reelected secretary general after the congress concluded.
