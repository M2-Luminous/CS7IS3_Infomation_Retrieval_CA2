Quoting South Korean Government officials, ASAHI said the Clinton administration has notified Seoul that it plans to exchange liaison offices with North Korea if Pyongyang guarantees the transparency of its past, present and future nuclear activities and allows inspection of two undeclared sites critical to determining how much plutonium the North Koreans have stockpiled. The United States would then be ready to relax trade restrictions against Pyongyang, change North Korea's status in the category of the "Trade With the Enemy Act" and promise financial assistance to change its outdated nuclear reactors to a much safer system, the paper said. For this transition, Washington may ask South Korea and Japan to chip in, according to ASAHI. But the United States will demand that North Korea halt missile exports, improve human rights and renounce terrorism before it will establish ties with the communist state, it reported. ASAHI noted that North Korea is likely to strongly oppose such a phased plan since it would increase barriers to full diplomatic normalization. The White House is treading cautiously on normalizing relations because Congress, and some within the administration, still mistrusts North Korea. The growing pressure to address human rights conditions is another reason, ASAHI said.
