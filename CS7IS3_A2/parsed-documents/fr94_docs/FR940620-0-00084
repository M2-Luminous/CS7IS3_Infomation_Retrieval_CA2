ACTION: Interim final rule. SUMMARY: The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Board) is issuing interim final guidelines to provide additional guidance to the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation in establishing accessibility standards for new construction and alterations of State and local government facilities covered by title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990. The guidelines will ensure that newly constructed and altered State and local government facilities are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities in terms of architecture, design, and communication. The standards established by the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation must be consistent with and may incorporate the guidelines. In addition to the provisions for State and local governments, the Board has also made some editorial changes to the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines to further clarify the guidelines. These editorial changes are not substantive. DATES: Effective date: December 20, 1994. Comment date: New comments responding to this Interim Final Rule, which have not already been sent in response to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for State and Local Government Facilities published on December 21, 1992, should be received by December 20, 1994. (See Comments, Supplementary Information ). Comments received after this date will be considered to the extent practicable.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Comments received in response to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for State and Local Government Facilities published on December 21, 1992 (57 FR 60612) will be considered along with new comments received in response to this Interim final rule. It is not necessary therefore to resubmit comments which were forwarded in response to the previous notice of rulemaking. Statutory Background The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) extends to individuals with disabilities comprehensive civil rights protections similar to those provided to persons on the basis of race, sex, national origin, and religion under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title II of the ADA, which became effective on January 26, 1992, prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in services, programs and activities provided by State and local government entities, and the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak). Section 202 of the ADA extends the nondiscrimination policy of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, (29 U.S.C. 794) which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in Federally assisted programs and activities to all State and local governmental entities regardless of whether such entities receive Federal funds. Most programs and activities of State and local governments are recipients of financial assistance from one or more Federal agencies and are already covered by section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.
