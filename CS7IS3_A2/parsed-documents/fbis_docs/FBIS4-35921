Syrian officials had thought that the appointment of Djerejian, who had served as ambassador in Damascus before he was appointed assistant U.S. secretary of state for Middle Eastern affairs -- to head the U.S. diplomatic mission in Tel Aviv was a positive signal that the Clinton administration wants this seasoned diplomat, who is an expert on the Middle East, to energize Israel's position toward a peaceful formula with Syria that is thought to be a central formula for a comprehensive settlement in the region. Those officials, however, have immediately noticed that there are concerted efforts to keep Djerejian away from any important activities. In fact, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher almost ignored him completely in his efforts to approximate views between the Syrian and Israeli governments. Damascus thinks that the decision of Djerejian -- who had faced a personal predicament from which resignation was the only way out -- gives further evidence of the efficiency of the attack launched by the Jewish lobby in the United States to prevent the Clinton administration from playing a balanced role in advancing the negotiating process. The Syrian officials are very tense when they view the fierce method adopted by the Jewish lobby to contain President Clinton, as signs of another presidential election campaign have drawn near. Some members of the lobby had previously made it public that they object to giving Syria an influential role in crystallizing the structure of the forthcoming regional order. Those sources think that Dennis Ross, the U.S. negotiation coordinator, and Martin Indyk, the official in charge of the Middle East in the National Security Council, have managed to close in on Djerejian. In fact, Syrian fears go farther than this. Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary of state who is known for his relatively balanced view of the Middle East crisis, is being totally ignored. Syrian officials have noticed some signs of a trend in the U.S. State Department and the National Security Council -- without casting doubt on President Clinton and Secretary of State Christopher -- to dismantle the diplomatic formula launched by the former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker and on whose basis the Syrians had accepted to attend the peace conference in Madrid in October 1991. The Madrid formula depends on Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 which were bypassed when the Gaza-Jericho agreement was signed, according to Syria's view of this agreement. Now that Djerejian is absent from the scene, it seems that all doors are wide open to Jewish influence in the circles at which U.S. policies on the Middle East are drawn up.
