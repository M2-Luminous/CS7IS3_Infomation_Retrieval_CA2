He is also in the habit of never telling everything he knows or thinks to everybody. He says a little bit to each one and keeps for himself the prerogative of putting facts together and forming convictions. But he cannot do without the cooperation of a select group of individuals whose power to influence him varies according to their area of activity, degree of friendship, and competence. There are the professionals, the politicians, the intellectuals, and the friends. A place as special as it is discreet is that occupied by his wife, Ruth Cardoso. Those who are on close terms with FHC are of the opinion that if he won the election, she would be much more than the First Lady. "Ruth is a very good thinker, and Fernando listens to her more than people can imagine," says his friend Sergio Mota, secretary general of the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] and a member of the group that combines friendship and politics. Another such member is Deputy Jose Serra, a friend from before 1964 and a companion in exile who, he says, is unfairly pointed to as a surreptitious opponent of FHC. The loyalty invoked by Serra is the feature common to the three advisers currently regarded as the most important people in Fernando Henrique's day-to-day political life. They are press adviser Ana Tavares, special adviser Eduardo Jorge, and combined congressional adviser and ghost writer Eduardo Graeff. They will be important figures in the campaign, and if Fernando Henrique is elected, they will occupy a privileged place in Planalto Palace. FHC also has supporters outside Brasilia. One of them is Francisco Graziano, chief of the candidate's Sao Paulo office. And in the field of ideas, he has philosopher Jose Arthur Giannotti of the USP [University of Sao Paulo] at his side. Some people also point to former Deputy Jose Gregori, now chef de cabinet to Marcilio Marques Moreira, as being one of his very close friends. A bright star in the political category is Tasso Jereissati, although Fernando Henrique now regards Senator Mario Covas as one of the most loyal and honorable party members on his side. Here we present a short profile of some of Fernando Henrique's faithful companions. Sergio Mota: Close Friend, Indispensable Adviser In the group that combines friendship and politics, Mota, Cardoso, and Federal Deputy Jose Serra form an inseparable trio. Sergio Mota is an engineer who engaged in student politics as a member of Popular Action (AP) during the years of repression. He owns a business in Sao Paulo, was president of Eletropaulo (the electric company in Sao Paulo) when Franco Montoro (PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]) was governor, and is such a close friend of Fernando Henrique Cardoso that they own a ranch together in Minas Gerais. At crucial moments, such as the time when it was decided that the PSDB would join Fernando Collor's administration in 1992, or during party crises, or now, as Cardoso leaves the Ministry of Finance, Sergio Mota lands in Brasilia and works at party headquarters -- he is secretary general -- or in Congress. But he is on the telephone with Fernando Henrique several times a day. There are those who say that Sergio Mota will run for federal deputy, but he himself evades the issue: "I enjoy party politics; I have been involved in it since I was a student," he says, but does not explain whether or not he is going to move up to the front line in politics. In one way or another, he is already there. As secretary general of the PSDB, he takes part in all party decisions and is active on several fronts. Eduardo Graeff: Most Prestigious PSDB Writer The one who describes him exactly is Jose Serra the sociologist: "If there was an Eduardo pill, I would take it." The reason is that the congressional adviser to the former minister of finance, who has now gone on the campaign trail, is one of the most highly praised members of Fernando Henrique's staff. Chiefly because of his writing, which, according to PSDB members in general, borders on perfection. He is the one behind almost everything that leaves the PSDB and its environs in written form: speeches, articles, documents, and even technical texts. Provisional Measure 434, which created the URV [real unit of value], owed a great deal to Eduardo, who is very much in demand as a speechwriter by the party's bloc in Congress. As congressional adviser, he functioned as Fernando Henrique's point man with Congress, where he spends the entire day talking on his cellular telephone. He has been part of the group for over 10 years, and because of his duties as a writer, he is considered to be one of those most familiar with what Fernando Henrique is thinking. Jose Serra: Not-Always-Peaceful Friendship Considering everything that is said, it is surprising that Serra should be on this list. But there is no one in the group who does not say he is one of Fernando Henrique's closest and most influential friends. The two of them have followed a common path that began before 1964, when the deputy was president of the National Union of Students in Sao Paulo, continued in exile abroad, and is now being strengthened in post-amnesty politics. But the surprise some people feel at Serra's presence in the group is the result of two facts. First, there is the story that has always made Serra out to be a candidate for the Ministry of Finance. Second, there is the fact that relations between the two are not always peaceful. A typical love-hate relationship, according to some. It is true that they quarrel and that they frequently disagree -- especially since Fernando Henrique is the king of tolerance and Serra the emperor of impatience -- but there is no important decision in FHC's life in which Serra does not participate. Ana Tavares: Adviser Who Also Knows the Political Game Ana is the daughter of journalist Tavares de Miranda, who was FOLHA DE SAO PAULO's society columnist for years, and that may explain why she has so much mobility in her duties as press adviser -- duties that end up slipping into the giving of personal and political advice. She receives about 80 telephone calls per day, and it is not rare for her to have to write 12 exclusive memos for 12 different political columns. Ana likes to stay home to read and talk on the telephone. Before 0900, she is already at work in her office. Unobtrusive even in the way she dresses -- always skirt and blouse, low moccasins, black hair combed back and sometimes held in place by red-framed glasses -- Ana Tavares is so discreet as to be mysterious. Out of respect for such a reserved manner, not even her closest friends ask her how old she is. Nonsense: she says straight out that she is past 40. But that is as far as she will go, since she is absolutely against the idea of coming out of the shadows. "An adviser has to stay in the background" is her motto. Ana does her work, which goes far beyond that simply of a press adviser. "When I want some information and cannot get through to Fernando Henrique, I turn to her, and she always has something to say," says Alberico de Souza Cruz, director of journalism for the Globo Network. Eduardo Jorge: Discreet `Lightning Rod' for Entire Team An expert on public administration, Eduardo Jorge is considered to be Fernando Henrique's alter ego. Like Ana Tavares, he has a horror of being in the spotlight and, if questioned, greatly downplays his own importance to the candidate: "Here I am just an adviser." Modesty. He is the man that FHC puts in charge of special missions, and he is called the team's "lightning rod." His missions are so special and secret that there is no record of them for history. There is only the testimony of the other members of the group, who suddenly turn forgetful. Eduardo is an international consultant in the legislative area. He was educated abroad and has worked as director of the Senate Data Processing Center (Prodasen), which he helped organize. Both in the Senate and in the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Finance, Eduardo Jorge's office has always been just a couple of meters away from Fernando Henrique's. Tasso Jereissati: Key Man in Setting up Alliances A new friend but one always close to Fernando Henrique at crucial moments. In the two weeks before FHC's candidacy was announced, he was put in charge of contacts. It was he who worked hardest to get the PT [Workers Party] to ally itself with the PSDB. Now he is talking to Minas Gerais Governor Helio Garcia of the PTB [Brazilian Labor Party] and to the president of the PP [Progressive Party], Alvaro Dias. His point men in the PFL [Liberal Front Party] are Antonio Carlos Magalhaes and the party president, Jorge Bornhausen. Tasso, who is also in charge of the communications area, was recently in Rio de Janeiro to talk to Roberto Marinho, owner of the Globo Organizations. Until the end of May, which is the deadline for holding party conventions, he will be the key man in setting up alliances. Twice considered for a cabinet post (in the Sarney and Collor administrations), he is said to be a shoo-in for a first-echelon position if Fernando Henrique reaches Planalto Palace.
