FR940722-2-00120 FR940722-2-00075 Federal Railroad Administration Locomotive Crashworthiness; Open Meeting AGENCY: Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Department of Transportation. ACTION: Notice of open meeting. SUMMARY: FRA will hold an informal open meeting on August 29, 1994, in order to present the initial results of an analysis of locomotive crashworthiness. The meeting will be open to any interested person who wishes to attend as an observer. DATE AND ADDRESSES: The open meeting will be held on Monday, August 29, 1994, beginning at 10 a.m., in room 2230, Nassif Building, 400 7th Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Program Person: Thomas D. Schultz, Program Manager, Office of Research and Development, FRA, Washington, DC 20590. Telephone: (202) 366&hyph;0466. Principal Attorney: Kyle M. Mulhall, Trial Attorney, Office of Chief Counsel, FRA, Washington, DC 20590. Telephone: (202) 366&hyph;0635. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The provisions of law that were contained in section 10 of the Rail Safety Enforcement and Review Act (Pub. L. 102&hyph;365), simultaneously repealed and reenacted as section 4(t) of Pub. L. 103&hyph;272 on July 5, 1994, require that FRA assess the adequacy of existing locomotive crashworthiness standards. At this open meeting, FRA's Office of Research and Development will present the methodology and the initial results of the analysis. These first results are based on a model developed for this research project relying on engineering data from existing locomotive designs. Using information gleaned from previous accidents, accident scenarios are applied to the model. This analysis will be used to assess crashworthiness as required by statute. Since the issues to be discussed have potential bearing on future FRA regulatory activities, this meeting will be open to any interested person who may wish to observe. There will also be an opportunity for questions. Issued in Washington, DC, on July 18, 1994. James T. McQueen, Associate Administrator for Railroad Development.
