Over the first three months of the year, spending came to 132.032 trillion lire (81.7 billion dollars) against revenues of 101.715 trillion lire leaving a net balance of 30.317 trillion to finance, plus 12.071 trillion lire generated by Treasury management operations. The release of these figures today boosted cautious optimism on the prospect of lowering the PSBR also over the longer term. Yesterday, the studies center of the national manufacturers association, Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian Industry], estimated PSBR for the first five months of the year at 75.4 trillion lire (46.66 billion dollars), against 87,800 trillion lire (54.33 billion dollars) for the same period in 1993, but would not dismiss worries about exceeding the PSBR forecast for the full year. The forecast deficit for 1994 drafted by the government led by Premier Carlo Azeglio Ciampi is 159 trillion lire (98.39 billion dollars) and this figure has been spoken of as reliable by the new economic team installed by Premier Silvio Berlusconi. If the trend reported for the first quarter continues as is, the PSBR would come to 169.552 trillion lire by December 31, more than 10.5 trillion lire over target, but Treasury technicians said account must be taken of the range of variables on both the spending and revenues sides which condition budget management. Among the factors conditioning the figures for the first quarter were the virtual paralysis of public investments and the reduction of debt servicing thanks to falling interest rates. Even taking these variables into consideration, said the Confindustria studies center, "rigorous conduct on the side of the public administration" could lead to a deficit for the full year of 152 to 154 trillion lire.
