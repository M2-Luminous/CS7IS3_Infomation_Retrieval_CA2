FR940725-1-00039 FR940725-1-00009 4. Section 31.102(c) is amended by adding the following sentence at the end thereof: §31.102 State agency structure. (c) *␣*␣* At a minimum, one full-time Juvenile Justice Specialist must be assigned to the Formula Grants Program by the State agency. Where the State does not currently provide or maintain a full-time Juvenile Justice Specialist, the plan must clearly establish and document that the program and administrative support staff resources currently assigned to the program will temporarily meet the adequate staff requirement, and provide an assurance that at least one full-time Juvenile Justice Specialist will be assigned to the Formula Grants Program by the end of Fiscal Year 1995 (September 30, 1995). 5. Section 31.203 is revised to read as follows: §31.203 Open meetings and public access to records. The State must assure that the State agency, its supervisory board established pursuant to section 299(c) and the State advisory group established pursuant to section 223(a)(3) will follow applicable State open meeting and public access laws and regulations in the conduct of meetings and the maintenance of records relating to their functions. 6. Section 31.301 (a), (c), (d), and (e) is revised to read as follows: §31.301 Funding. (a) Allocation to states. Funds shall be allocated annually among the States on the basis of relative population of persons under age 18. If the amount allocated for title II (other than Parts D and E) of the JJDP Act is less than $75 million, the amount allocated to each State will not be less than $325,000, nor more than $400,000, provided that no State receives less than its allocation for Fiscal Year 1992. The Territories will receive not less than $75,000 or more than $100,000. If the amount appropriated for title II (other than Part D) is $75 million or more, the amount allocated for each State will be not less than $400,000, nor more than $600,000, provided that Parts D and E have been funded in the full amounts authorized. For the Territories, the amount remains at $100,000. * * * * * (c) Match. Formula Grants under the JJDP Act shall be 100% of approved costs, with the exception of planning and administration funds, which require a 100% cash match (dollar for dollar), and construction projects funded under section 299C (a)(2) of the JJDP Act which also require a 100% cash match. (d) Funds for administration. Not more than 10% of the total annual Formula Grant award may be utilized to develop the annual juvenile justice plan and pay for administrative expenses, including project monitoring. These funds are to be matched on a dollar for dollar basis. The State shall make available needed funds for planning and administration to units of local government on an equitable basis. Each annual application must identify uses of such funds. (e) Nonparticipating States. Pursuant to section 223(d), the OJJDP Administrator shall endeavor to make the fund allotment under section 222(a), of a State which chooses not to participate or loses its eligibility to participate in the formula grant program, directly available to local public and private nonprofit agencies within the nonparticipating State. The funds may be used only for the purpose(s) of achieving deinstitutionalization of status offenders and nonoffenders, separation of juveniles from incarcerated adults, removal of juveniles from adult jails and lockups, and/or reducing the disproportionate confinement of minority youth in secure facilities. Absent a request for extension which demonstrates compelling circumstances justifying the reallocation of formula grant funds back to the State to which the funds were initially allocated, or the pendency of administrative hearing proceedings under section 223(d), formula grant funds allocated to a State which has failed to submit an application, plan, or monitoring data establishing its eligibility for the funds will, beginning with Fiscal Year 1994, be reallocated to the nonparticipating State program on September 30 of the fiscal year for which the funds were appropriated. Reallocated funds will be awarded to eligible recipients pursuant to program announcements published in the Federal Register . 7. Section 31.302 (a) and (b)(2) is amended to read as follows:
