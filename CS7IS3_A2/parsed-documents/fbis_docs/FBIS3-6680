FBIS3-6680 "dreas054_m_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-054 Document Type:Daily Report 19 Mar 1994 Thailand Reportage, Commentary on Bombing Continue Source of Chemical Sought BK1903090194 Bangkok THE NATION in English 19 Mar 94 pp A1, A3 BK1903090194 Bangkok THE NATION Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] The Defense Ministry is trying to trace the source of the ammonium nitrate which made up part of an extremely powerful suicide-bomb found in the back of a truck in Bangkok on Thursday. Ammonium nitrate is a colorless, crystalline salt used chiefly in explosives and fertilizers. Sources at the Defense Ministry said it is classified as a "military logistical item" and its distribution is restricted by law. All purchases and shipments of ammonium nitrate must be made through the ministry's Industry and Energy Center. "The center is trying to trace the source of the one ton of the substance found as part of the explosive device in the foiled bombing attack believed directed at the Israeli diplomatic mission," one of the sources said. The sources said the person who assembled the bomb must have bought the chemical from authorized users registered with the Industry and Energy Center. Buyers of ammonium nitrate must prove they are in the rock-blasting business or produce fertilizers, as well as have a license to possess and use explosives from the Interior Ministry. There are about 20 merchants licensed to sell the compound in Thailand, the sources said. Under the law governing military supply, illegal possession and use of ammonium nitrate is punishable by a maximum prison term of five years and/or a fine of up to Bt50,000. Using the fertilizer to make an explosive device is liable to punishment under the law on firearms and explosives. One of the sources said the explosive mixture found on the truck--C-4 explosive, diesel oil and ammonium nitrate, known as "witches' brew"--would not be very effective if detonated in the open. "If detonated in an open space there would be very loud blast and not much else," the source said. "But the bomb would be devastating if set off in an enclosed area, inside a building."
