Vladimir Shumeyko, who arrived in Bishkek on Monday and the same day signed an interparliamentary agreement with the head of Kyrgyzstan's legislature, Meditkan Sherimkulov, said Azerbaijan had recently stated readiness to recognize Nagorno-Karabakh as "one of the parties to the conflict." This is a "major step forward" in the negotiation process, Shumeyko said. He said a peace mission of the Interparliamentary Assembly of the Commonwealth of Independent States "has done a good deal" to achieve peace in the embattled enclave. "We will be working as much as necessary for the settlement of the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh," he said.
