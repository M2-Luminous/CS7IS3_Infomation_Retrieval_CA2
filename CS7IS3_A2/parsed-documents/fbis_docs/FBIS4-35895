The magazine explained that the visit of this delegation, which will be headed by Oil Ministry Under Secretary Taha Humud, to Rome falls within the framework of the contacts which began several months ago between Agip and the Iraqi authorities in order to reach agreements on sharing the productions of al-Nasiriyah, al-Halfayah, and Dujaylah oilfields in southern Iraq. The magazine added that the delegation's visit to the Ukraine will center on the possibility of importing oil industry machinery from that country in exchange for Iraqi oil following the lifting of the blockade on Iraq. The magazine pointed out that the talks with the Ukrainian oil authorities will also deal with the possibility of Ukrainian companies sharing production in and developing al-Yamamah region in the vast western al-Qurnah oilfield. Last April, an Iraqi Oil Ministry delegation left for Moscow to discuss the development of Mushrif region which is also situated in the western al-Qurnah Oilfield. Iraq held contacts with a number of European countries several weeks ago in preparation for the period which will follow the oil embargo imposed by the United Nations. An iraqi Oil Ministry delegation also visited Paris early last March in response to an invitation by the two major French petroleum companies Elf-Aquitane and Total.
