FR940204-1-00064 FR940204-1-00012 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Highway Administration 49 CFR Part 391 [FHWA Docket Nos. MC&hyph;93&hyph;25 and MC&hyph;93&hyph;30] RIN 2125&hyph;AD22 Qualification of Drivers; Hearing Deficiencies; Waivers AGENCY: Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT. ACTION: Extension and reopening of comment periods. SUMMARY: The FHWA announces the extension of the time during which it will accept comments to Docket MC&hyph;93&hyph;30 and the reopening of Docket MC&hyph;93&hyph;25. Comments to Docket MC&hyph;93&hyph;25, which closed on January 14, 1994, will be accepted until April 5, 1994. Comments to Docket MC&hyph;93&hyph;30 will be accepted until April 15, 1994, an extension of the original February 14, 1994, deadline. DATES: Written, signed comments must be received on or before April 5, 1994, for Docket MC&hyph;93&hyph;25 and on or before April 15, 1994, for Docket MC&hyph;93&hyph;30. ADDRESSES: Submit all comments to the Federal Highway Administration, Docket MC&hyph;93&hyph;25 and/or MC&hyph;93&hyph;30, Office of Chief Counsel/HCC&hyph;10, 400 Seventh Street, SW., room 4232, Washington, DC 20590. Comments may be examined at the above address from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., e.t., Monday through Friday, except legal Federal holidays. Persons desiring notification of receipt of comments must include a self-addressed, stamped postcard. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION C0NTACT: The FHWA has established a special telephone number, 1&hyph;800&hyph;832&hyph;5660, for inquiries about this notice, the hearing deficiencies advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM), and the hearing deficiencies study. The TDD number is 1&hyph;800&hyph;699&hyph;7828. Messages may be left on both telephone numbers 24 hours a day. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On December 15, 1993, the FHWA published an ANPRM (Docket MC&hyph;93&hyph;30) that requested comments on whether there is a need to amend the Agency's driver qualification requirements relating to hearing. 58 FR 65634. The current Federal hearing standard is at 49 CFR 391.41(b)(11). The FHWA believes that a review of the hearing standard is necessary to assess its continued relevance and the effect advances in medical science and technology may have on it. Such advances may lead to amending the current standard. The FHWA simultaneously published a notice of its intent to initiate a study examining the relationship between hearing deficiencies and safe operation of commercial motor vehicles, and sought comments on that notice (Docket MC&hyph;93&hyph;25). 58 FR 65638. The public was notified that the FHWA would accept comments on both notices for the periods listed above. Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety (AHAS), an organization with an expressed interest in highway safety issues, subsequently requested that the FHWA extend each comment period by 60 days. The AHAS stated it needed additional time to gather information about the history of the hearing standard and the effect that hearing deficiencies may have on safety. The FHWA is mindful of the need for all interested parties to have enough time to prepare thoughtful comments. The FHWA therefore is extending the deadline for comments to Docket MC&hyph;93&hyph;30 an additional 60 days and is reopening Docket MC&hyph;93&hyph;25 for 60 days. As indicated in the Rulemaking Analyses and Notices section of the ANPRM, all comments received before the close of business on the comment closing dates indicated above will be considered and will be available for examination in the dockets at the above address. Comments received after the closing dates will be filed in the dockets and will be considered to the extent practicable. In addition to late comments, the FHWA will continue to file relevant information in the dockets as it becomes available after the comment closing dates, and interested persons should continue to examine the dockets for new material. Authority: 49 U.S.C. app. 2505; 49 U.S.C. 3102; and 49 CFR 1.48. Issued on: January 28, 1994. Rodney E. Slater, Federal Highway Administrator.
