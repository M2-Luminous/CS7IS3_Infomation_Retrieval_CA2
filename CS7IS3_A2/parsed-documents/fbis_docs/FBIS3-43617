Garcia Bires says there is solid evidence to prove that South African rightwing groups are sending equipment to UNITA, via Zaire. Bires says white mercenaries, believed to be from South Africa, are fighting alongside UNITA in northeast Angola. He refused to name the extremist groups involved in aiding UNITA, but says it's a coordinated effort among the rightwing groups. The ambassador's claims come as UNITA and the Angolan Government are pursuing negotiations in the Zambian capital Lusaka to end their civil war.
