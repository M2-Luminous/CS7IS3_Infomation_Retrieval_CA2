The results of the design are outlined below. COMETS seeks to develop the following three new communication and broadcasting technologies: (1) Inter-satellite communication technology using a large antenna of 3.6 m diameter with a gimbal mechanism; (2) Advanced satellite broadcasting technology for high-quality local broadcasting using a 21-GHz-band 200 W amplifier; (3) Advanced mobile satellite communication to meet diversified mobile communication requirements. It will also attempt to develop the following performance upgrading technologies for large geostationary satellites: (1) Multi-frequency-band satellite system construction technology; (2) Highly efficient power supply system; (3) Propulsion system with apogee engine and reaction control systems integrated; (4) Attitude control system which operate harmoniously with large antenna drive control. The major characteristics of COMETS based on the results of the preliminary design are shown in Table 1. On-orbit appearance and the appearance at lift-off are shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. The main results of the preliminary design are described below. (1) A structure with an antenna tower in the center was designed to enable housing three large antennas effectively (see Fig. 2). (2) Engineers established the detailed specifications of the frequency and performance for each of the three mission systems verified by analysis that each development objective can be attained. They also confirmed by analysis that there was no mutual frequency interference problems. They will use the development model test to validate the results. (3) Various problems arose in integrating the large flexible solar paddles with the satellite attitude control due to the complex paddle flexibility, but engineers verified that it is possible to attain the predetermined control accuracy by revising the paddle design and optimizing the attitude control system. (4) Designers clarified that it is necessary to fold back the deployed solar paddle because of its problematic strength during the apogee engine burning. They studied number of apogee engine burning and redesigned the paddles to improve reliability. In the paddle development model test, the engineers will validate reliability fully by conducting folding and deployment test in a simulated space environment. Fig. 2. Appearance at Lift-Off Table 1.

Scheduled to communicate with ADEOS, JEM, etc. Advanced satellite Output 200 W-class, broadcasting #1 capable of local partitioned broadcasting. Composed of 2 beams for Kantokoshin'etsu and Kyushu districts. Advanced satellite Output 20 W-class, broadcasting #2 Ka-band and millimeter wave. The COMETS development has entered the next phase, the detailed design and the production and test of the development models of each satellite-borne system. The development is scheduled to prepare COMETS for launch in early 1997.
