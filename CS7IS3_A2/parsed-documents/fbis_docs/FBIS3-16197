The report includes recorded excerpts of the meeting. Ahmedova begins her report by saying that the meeting discussed the military and political situation in the republic, problems connected with the creation of the Army, and measures to end the war. In a recorded excerpt, Guliyev says: "Azerbaijan has been holding talks at the international level and directly with the Armenians for the peaceful resolution of the military conflict with Armenia. Although there are certain achievements in this regard, they have not yet been implemented. As you know, a protocol was signed on 18 February 1994 between the Armenia and Azerbaijani defense ministers with the participation of the Russian Federation. According to this document, the fighting was to end by 1 March; Armenia's Armed Forces were to withdraw from Nagorno-Karabakh within three days; and, in accordance with our own variant, they were to free the occupied Azerbaijani lands within 14 days. Recently, we received international representatives from the Minsk Group under Eliasson. First, the republic's president met them and then I held talks with them for a few hours. They said that Azerbaijan's position is correct and hoped the Armenians would accept it. They first met us in Baku, then left for Khankendi [Stepanakert] in Nagorno-Karabakh and Yerevan. We were apprehensive that after their visits to Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia they might have changed their views. However, I want to inform you that despite their visits there they have not changed their views and are supporting our own variant and position. "As always, the Armenians exploited our aspiration for peace and resumed their attacks [words indistinct] mostly in the south in Fizulinskiy Rayon. Bloody battles have continued there the last few days. The Azerbaijani Army is dealing the necessary reply to the Armenian aggressors. Armenians have suffered considerable losses and are unable to achieve anything. "At around 1900 yesterday, the Chairman of the Armenian Parliament Babken Ararktsyan phoned me and told me that he wishes to meet me to resolve this conflict. I replied that we have always favored the peaceful resolution of the problem and I am ready for talks anywhere, be it in Moscow, Yerevan, Idzhevan, or in any foreign country. We decided that we should meet on the border of Kazakhskiy and Idzhevanskiy Rayons on 12 March to search for ways to peacefully resolve this war. "The Azerbaijani Republic and its people must deeply understand one thing: The future and destiny of Azerbaijan rests solely in the hands of the Azerbaijani people and citizens. No one, be they close neighbors or friendly countries elsewhere, will solve the Azerbaijani people's problems. For this reason, we must have a strong army and internal unity, must mobilize our economic potential, and deal decisive and courageous blows to the enemy. Such blows will bring peace closer. The opposing side will bow and opt for peace only when faced with force. There is no other alternative." Guliyev also says that the Azerbaijani side rejected the disengagement plan because it would place people behind the lines and under threat. He then goes on to strongly criticize the TURAN news agency for publishing reports that freedoms in Azerbaijan are being suppressed. Resuming her report, Ahmedova says that the speakers complained that the troops are not receiving their wages on time and spoke on measures to establish discipline in the Army and prevent desertions. In a recorded excerpt, Prosecutor-General Ali Omerov says the Defense Ministry is responsible for the increase in desertions. He accuses the military commissars for criminal behavior in this regard. He also accuses the TURAN news agency for its distorted reports on the seizure of arms from the People's Front headquarters. He said TURAN should publish reports on "objective reality," or face legal measures. In another recorded excerpt, the military prosecutor says that the main reason for desertions is that "the combat readiness is not up to the desired level." He says in some cases the commanders are telling the soldiers to flee so that they too could flee from the front. Therefore, he says, first of all the training of the military cadres should be improved. Guliyev interjects and says: "Every one of you have sinned before the Azerbaijani state and people. You must all realize this. And the actions of some of you are criminal in nature. You should know this. You should not think that we are not following your actions. We fully know everything you are involved in. You have come here to discuss what concrete measures to take. If the talk is about desertions, you must openly state, for example, that the deserters should be in a certain location within two days. Therefore, you should talk about concrete military measures you want to implement to speedily extract the Azerbaijan Republic from its present situation. If you want, you can also express your political views." Guliyev goes on to say that there cannot be internal divisions when it concerns Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. He again indirectly criticizes TURAN's reports as acts of "enmity" against Azerbaijan. He says everybody in the hall are to be blamed for desertions. He ascribes the desertions to the fact that young people have not been imbued enough with feelings of patriotism. He also criticizes those present for their lack of ideas on economic reforms. He says economic reforms, primarily in agriculture, should be launched courageously in each rayon. He supports the proposal that the Defense Ministry should report to parliament within three or four days that it has resolved the problem of desertions. He indirectly criticizes certain people for trying to exploit the war for their own interests. He calls on the prosecutor-general and military tribunal to publicize information in papers and on the television on this so "people could see and recognize its enemies."
