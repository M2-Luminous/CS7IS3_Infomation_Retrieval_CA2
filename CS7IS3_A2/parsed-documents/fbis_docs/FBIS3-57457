The aircraft has an almost unlimited flight range. The Su-34 can fly 4,000 kilometers without aerial refueling or auxiliary fuel tanks. Its fundamentally new on-board digital computer, and other radio and electronic equipment, unerringly guides the aircraft to a given target with accuracy down to a meter. And it does this in any meteorological conditions. [video shows the aircraft landing, taking off, and in flight, showing its similarity to an Su-35 with a cockpit similar to that of the Su-25TK] The homing and guided missiles, and bombs permit the Su-34 to strike well-defended point targets at a distance of from 0 to 250 kilometers and it carries sufficient weapons to fulfill any task. The new aircraft is equipped with a so-called artificial intelligence system which allows the bomber to perform intricate maneuvers at top speed and at minimal altitudes, and to unerringly follow the lay of the land and easily avoid the anti-aircraft actions of ground forces. [video shows the Su-34 on the ground being viewed by a group of people] The Su-34 looks like no other aircraft. It has its own features, its own bearing, its own fighting spirit, and its own purely Russian unpredictability. This is our own domestic aircraft which is not a threat to anybody. It was created for us, for our spirit, for the defense of Russia. [video shows A.A. Kokoshin, first deputy Russian Minister of Defense, being interviewed among a group of officials; a man on his right has the air force banner over his shoulders] [Begin recording] [Kokoshin] Those who built this machine today and who lifted it into the air are the real heroes, our Russian people, and our country has always had many of them. You agree, Nikolay Ivanovich? [Man with Banner on his Shoulders] Yes. (Lizovtsy) and Chkalovtsy, you can be proud. We have achieved victory. Hurrah. [everybody cheers] [end recording]
