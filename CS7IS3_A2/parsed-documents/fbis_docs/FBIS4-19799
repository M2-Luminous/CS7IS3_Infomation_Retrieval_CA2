FBIS4-19799 "drweu077_i_94007" FBIS-WEU-94-077 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 FRANCE Ministers Evaluated After First Year Ministers Evaluated After First Year 94P20663A 94P20663A CSO [Editorial Report] An article by commentator Philippe Reinhard in the 30 March Paris center-right daily LE QUOTIDIEN "subjectively" rates the performance of cabinet ministers one year after the government's accession to power. Minister of Foreign Affairs Alain Juppe heads the list, with 18.5 points out of 20, in acknowledgment of the fact he is the "best foreign minister of the Fifth Republic," especially because of the difficulties the position entails in an era of cohabitation, Reinhard notes. In addition, Juppe has deftly avoided a clash with both Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and Rally for the Republic (RPR) leader Jacques Chirac. Minister of the Budget Nicolas Sarkozy comes in second, with 18 points out of 20. While initially lacking experience for the job, Sarkozy is now widely praised by his aides. As government spokesman, he has succeeded in "announcinge bad news with incontestable talent." Minister of Interior Charles Pasqua alse receives 18 points out of 20. In Reinhard's view, he has become a "statesman" without losing his popularity and has been able to reassure those who feared his stance on human rights. The post of prime minister is now "within his reach." Reinhard praises Minister of Agriculture Jean Puech, giving him 17.5 points out of 20 for his "faultless" course and for having contributed to the success of the GATT negotiations. With 17 points out of 20, Minister of Defense Francois Leotard, "unconvincing as minister of culture in the past, proves there are no desperate cases," Reinhard comments. An initially skeptical military now acknowledges him as "the boss." He is preparing "solid weapons" for the future. "Rookie" Minister of Health Philippe Douste-Blazy (16.5 points out of 20) is now a "credible" minister, according to Reinhard. A Balladur fan, he has in-depth knowledge of health matters and is "decidedly someone to reckon with." Minister of Industry Gerard Longuet receives 15.5 points out of 20, because he acted hastily in the Renault-Volvo affair and "imprudently" announced the Telecom privatization. However, he possesses the great capacity for work and the political sense that characterize "great ministers." With 15 points out of 20, Minister of Cooperation and Development Michel Roussin is not in an "ideal" post to be appreciated by the public, but has managed French relations with Africa as best he can. Reinhard notes that the devaluation of the franc CFA was carried out in "exemplary" fashion. Minister of Overseas Territories Dominique Perben gets 15 points out of 20 for defending republican values in territories where officials "have a tendency to forget them." Mith 14.5 points out of 20, Minister of Culture Jacques Toubon is doing as well as expected considering the popularity of his predecessor Jack Lang. Minister of Communication Alain Carignon receives 14.5 points out of 20 for his able management of a ministry "whose necessity is not obvious." Minister of Industrial Development Alain Madelin is given 14 points out of 20 for "hiding in increasingly better fashion the fact that he is bored with his ministry." He should be able to aspire to a more important post. Minister of Environment Michel Barnier (14 points out of 20) "lacks glamor," but is convinced of the importance of his task, Reinhard notes, adding that if other ministers were as knowledgeable of their duties as Barnier, the government would have avoided a number of failures. While Minister of Youth and Sports Michele Alliot-Marie (14 points), Minister of Regional Development Daniel Hoeffel (13 points), Minister of Civil Service Andre Rossinot (13 points), Minister of Housing Herve de Charette (12.5points), and Minister of Relations with the National Assembly Pascal Clement and Minister of Relations with the Senate Roger Romani (both get 12 points) get a fair rating, Minister of Social Affairs Simone Veil is only accorded 12 points out of 20. "One can be a `grande dame' without necessarily being a great minister," Reinhard writes. Despite her possessing the requisite attributes, she has been "poorly advised." Minister of Justice Pierre Mehaignerie only rates 11.5 points. His "extreme prudence" has only "created the impression" justice is again independent, Reinhard notes. Mehaignerie uses the time he does not devote to his ministry to defend his presidency of the Social Democratic Center (CDS). Minister of War Veterans Philippe Mestre (11.5 points) "is there because someone has to be," but deserves better, Reinhard comments. With only 10.5 point, and cornered by Balladur, Sarkozy and Bank of France Governor Jean-Claude Trichet, Minister of Finance Edmond Alphandery lacks the opportunity to make his talents known; "when he did speak, he said too much." Minister of Education Francois Bayrou (9.5 points), "perhaps the most intelligent of all," let himself be entrapped by the secular education controversy, Reinhard comments, adding he hopes that Bayrou's "good ideas" on education will be implemented in the future. Minister of Higher Education and Research Francois Fillon shares nine points with Minister of Labor Michel Giraud. A better interlocutor could have been found for the young rather than Fillon, and Giraud has "good will but no luck," according to Reinhard. The list ends with Minister of Public Works and Transport Bernard Bosson (8.5 points) and Minister of Humanitarian Action Lucette Michaux-Chevry (six points).
