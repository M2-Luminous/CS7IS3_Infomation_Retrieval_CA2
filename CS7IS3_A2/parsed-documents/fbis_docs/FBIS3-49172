Our Prague correspondent, Daniela Galikova, attended the ensuing news conference and filed the following report: [Galikova] Replying to a question from Slovak radio, Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus confirmed the planned talks with Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar as well as with the prime ministers of Poland and Hungary, which will take place after the talks with the U.S. President. On the evening of 12 January--that is, after the U.S. President departs--the Czech president, prime minister, and foreign minister will give dinners. According to Prime Minister Klaus, the presidents of Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic will dine at the Castle, the prime ministers of these countries will dine at Prime Minister Klaus's invitation in Lichtenstein Palace, and the foreign ministers will dine at the Czech Foreign Ministry. Responding to another question concerning the summit, Prime Minister Klaus stressed that, right from the beginning, as soon as President Clinton's intention to visit Prague was announced, the Czech Republic did not doubt that it would use the meeting for holding talks with the representatives of the Visegrad Group countries. At no time was it considered that only we would be holding talks or that the talks would be held collectively, the Czech prime minister stressed. He thus reacted to some reports carried by both the domestic and foreign press that the Czech Republic did not support the idea of joint talks between the representatives of the Visegrad Group and the U.S. President.
