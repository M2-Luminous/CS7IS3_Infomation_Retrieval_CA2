Kanzaki said he has asked Akimasa Egawa, director general of the Broadcasting Administration Bureau, to launch a private advisory group to discuss how to proceed with the HDTV project from now on. The minister's advisory group will include representatives from the electronics industry, the private broadcasting industry and Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK), the public broadcasting network. NHK already uses analog technology for high-definition television broadcasts. HDTV offers crisper images than conventional TVs. Egawa caused a stir earlier this week when he said the ministry is considering abandoning the analog system in favor of digital technology, which would make possible more advanced functions, but later reversed his position in response to protests from NHK and consumer electronics companies.
