In fact, although he does not give the code name, the French president is talking about the MS-5 strategic missile program, which is shrouded in the greatest secrecy. This missile would be intended to arm both so-called new generation submarines by the year 2005 and the silos buried in upper Provence. Since the early 1970's, the plateau of Albion has accommodated 18 ground-to-ground missiles capable of carrying a 1-megaton nuclear payload over a distance of approximately 5,000 km. These missiles have since been modernized. In view of the missiles' aptitude at thwarting -- or not thwarting -- hostile defense forces, which have supposedly gained in efficiency in the meantime, the missile base of the plateau of Albion could be obsolete by the beginning of next century. Hence the current debate aimed at determining the weapons system which might succeed the one currently deployed on the plateau of Albion. The debate is all about whether France can maintain three different systems -- ground-to-ground missiles, sea-to-ground missiles, and air-to-ground missiles, as is the case today -- or whether it should only maintain two of these -- and, if so, determining which system could be abandoned. The answers given by the experts vary tremendously. Nothing has been decided as yet, and the next military planning law, which will cover the years 1995 to 2000, will no doubt judge the merits of the different options. Recently, General Vincent Lanata, chief of staff of the Air Force whose forces serve the Albion plateau and whose aircraft carry air-to-ground missiles, has expressed his wish to have a more advanced airborne missile at his disposal. Consequently, Mr. Mitterrand, who sets great store by the political and strategic symbol represented by the plateau of Albion, has just spoken for the first time about the possibility of simultaneously deploying -- both in French submarines and in the silos in Provence -- missiles which are based on the same basic design but can be adapted to either launch mode. This is the program dubbed MS-5, involving a missile with multiple warheads and a range of 8,000 km. If this approach were definitively retained, it would presuppose that financial priority had already been given to the M-5 missile project, the version intended for submarines. However, what does one find? Launched in 1992, back when Pierre Joxe was defense minister, the program has been slowed down by the Balladur government in 1994 [as published], to the great displeasure of the missile's constructor, the Aerospatiale group, whose CEO, Louis Gallois, has unceasingly maintained that the M-5 is of primary interest. The M-5 even figures among the projects threatened with being staggered over an even longer period -- along with the future transport plane, the antimissile defense systems, certain equipment for use in space, and the NH-90 logistical helicopter -- if the military planning law allocates insufficient funds.
