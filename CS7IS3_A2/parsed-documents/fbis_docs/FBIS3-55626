The MOLDOVA PRESS correspondent contacted competent sources at the Presidency, Parliament, and Ministry of Interior of the Republic of Moldova, which categorically denied these rumors, calling them ill-favored and conniving in the current social-political context, their disseminators having other goals in mind than the ones directed by common sense and healthy reasoning. According to MOLDOVA PRESS, Ilie Ilascu continues to be imprisoned in the Chlinaia-Grigoriopol Prison. As a matter of fact, in an interview granted exclusively to our radio station, Mr. Nicolae Andronic, president of the parliamentary subcommission in charge of solving the conflict in the eastern rayons of the Republic of Moldova made the following statement: [Begin recording] [Andronic] What can happen because one month has passed?

[Unidentified reporter] Then why was the term of one month mentioned for submitting the pardon appeal in case of a sentence against which, the court stated, no appeal can be made. [Andronic] Thus, again, the term one month was used more as a political than a legal term. A certain date was announced to ruffle spirits and set an ultimatum, maybe not a direct one, but an indirect one. However, I want to tell you that, currently, the date of 12 January is expected when the State Duma will start its proceedings in [word indistinct]. After Maracuta's [Grigore, president of Dniester Republic Parliament] latest visit there, he found people to support among those who [word indistinct] as a results of the elections in the Duma. This in order to receive something from Moscow. [end recording] [Dascaliuc] This was the statement made to our correspondent in Chisinau, by Nicolae Andronic, president of the parliamentary subcommission in charge of solving the conflict in the eastern rayons of the Republic of Moldova.
