FR940705-1-00015 FR940705-1-00006 Specifically, the rule limits NO X emissions from boilers rated less than 2150 million British Thermal Units (MMBtu) to 0.20 pounds per megawatt-hour (lb/MW-hr) produced, and limits NO X emissions from units greater than or equal to 2150 MMBtu to 0.10lb/MW-hr. Final compliance with these limits is required by June 4, 1996 and June 4, 1994, respectively. Interim NO X limits are required for units burning natural gas as well as fuel oil. However, operation on any amount of fuel oil as of April 1, 1993 is prohibited except during system tests or a force majeure natural gas curtailment. Compliance with the hourly emission limits is determined using a 24-hour rolling average in which the 24 hourly measurements immediately preceding the current hour are used to calculate the average for that hour. Emissions and power production are required to be continuously monitored pursuant to Rule 103. For implementation by 1995, all the limits specified in Rule 59 are more stringent than RACT except for the pre-1996 limits established for units less than 2150MMBtu/hr. The pre-1996 limits for these units, however, meet RACT. Although all limits post-1996 are more stringent than the NO X RACT limits for utility boilers specified in the NO X Supplement, all additional reductions obtained beyond those attributable to RACT are assumed necessary for VCAPCD's attainment planning purposes. A more detailed discussion of the sources controlled, the controls required, and the analysis of how these controls meet RACT can be found in the Technical Support Document (TSD) for Rule 59 and Rule 103, dated June 1994. Rule 103, Stack Monitoring was originally adopted by VCAPCD on November 22, 1977. A revised version was approved into the SIP on October 16, 1985. The rule adopted on June 4, 1991 requires all large boilers, regardless of their use rate, to be monitored. EPA has evaluated the submitted rules and has determined that they are consistent with the CAA, EPA regulations and EPA policy. Therefore, both VCAPCD Rule 59, Electrical Power Generating Equipment_Oxides of Nitrogen Emissions and VCAPCD Rule 103, Stack Monitoring are being proposed for approval under section 110(k)(3) of the CAA as meeting the requirements of section 110(a) and part D. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Regulatory Process Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C sections 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, Part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, it does not have a significant impact on affected small entities. Moreover, due to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A., 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. section 7410 (a)(2). This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. OMB has exempted this action from E.O. 12866 review.
