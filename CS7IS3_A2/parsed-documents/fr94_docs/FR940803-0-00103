ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule amends the fuel economy regulations to include alternative-fueled automobiles. The Alternative Motor Fuels Act (AMFA) of 1988 includes 1993 model year and later alternative-fueled automobiles (passenger automobiles and light trucks) in the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program on a favorable basis to encourage the manufacture of these vehicles. The AMFA provides these CAFE ``credits'' for automobiles designed to be fueled with methanol, ethanol, other alcohols, natural gas, or dual-fueled automobiles designed to operate on one or more of these alterative fuels and gasoline or diesel fuel. Under the AMFA, these credits are only available for automobiles that meet certain requirements regarding: alternative fuel content (e.g., for alcohol fuels, a minimum of 85 percent by volume alcohol), energy efficiency, and driving range. Neither the AMFA nor today's final rule will affect automobiles that do not meet these requirements; such vehicles would not receive the favorable CAFE treatment. Alternative-fueled automobile labeling requirements are also specified in the AMFA. This final rule codifies the requirements of the AMFA in 40 CFR part 600. Recently, AMFA was amended by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, to extend the CAFE credit to automobiles designed to operate on additional types of alternative fuels. However, this final rule does not include these additional alternative fuel types, as they were not included in the CAFE program at the time the NPRM was published and the final rule was developed. DATES: This final rule is effective September 2, 1994, except as follows: the effective date for the amendments to 40 CFR 600.006&hyph;89(b)(1) (i) and (h) and footnote 4 to the table in 40 CFR 86.129&hyph;94(a) will be October 3, 1994, unless adverse comment is received by September 2, 1994, upon which the amendments to 40 CFR 600.006&hyph;89(b)(1) (i) and (h) and footnote 4 to the table in 40 CFR 86.129&hyph;94(a) will be withdrawn before the effective date by a document published in the Federal Register . The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in this final rule is approved by the Director of the Office of the Federal Register as of September 2, 1994. 40 CFR 600.113&hyph;93, 600.206&hyph;93, 600.207&hyph;93, 600.209&hyph;95, 600.307&hyph;95, 600.510&hyph;93 are not effective until the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the Information Collection Requirements contained in them. EPA will publish a document in the Federal Register following OMB approval of the information collection requirements. ADDRESSES: Comments regarding the amendments to 40 CFR 600.006&hyph;89(b)(1) (i) and (h) and footnote 4 to the table in 40 CFR 86.129&hyph;94(a) should be submitted to EPA Air Docket LE&hyph;131 (address following).
