FR940603-0-00133 FR940603-0-00029 The Board agrees that not all field of membership changes are expansions and therefore has replaced the term ``expansion'' with the term ``amendment.'' The format of the proposed IRPS has been modified substantially in the final version. Additionally, the IRPS, when put in the form of a manual, will be indexed to make it easier to use. Regulatory Procedures Regulatory Flexibility Act As was noted in the proposed IRPS, the NCUA Board has determined that changes to NCUA policy resulting from adoption of the IRPS will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small credit unions (primarily those under $1 million in assets). The changes in the final IRPS clarify existing policy rather than create new restrictions. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis has not been performed. Paperwork Reduction Act Paperwork requirement should decrease under the final IRPS. The information collection requirements contained in the IRPS have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval. OMB is in the process of reviewing these requirements. A notice of OMB approval will be published in the Federal Register upon its receipt. Any comments regarding collection requirement should be forwarded directly to the OMB Desk Officer indicated below at the following address: OMB Reports Management Branch, New Executive Office Building, room 3208, Washington, DC 20503; Attn.: Gary Waxman. Executive Order Executive Order 12612 requires NCUA to consider the effect of its actions on state interests. The final IRPS makes no significant changes with respect to state credit unions and, therefore, will not materially affect state interests.
