FR940907-2-00011 FR940907-2-00002 Proposals would be competitively solicited by the administrative intermediary from states, tribes, academia, and industry or conservation organizations for projects to be considered under this data collection jobs program. These proposals would be ranked according to criteria established in section IV of this announcement. To ensure that this program complements the habitat restoration program and does not duplicate other Federal assistance programs, representatives from NMFS and SCS will be members of this review panel. Priority will be given to projects that provide the greatest benefits to displaced fishermen; address the sustainability or rebuilding of anadromous species, especially threatened or endangered salmon stocks; address Federal, Pacific Fishery Management Council, PSMFC, or state fishery research needs; are based on sound scientific methodology; and have low administrative costs. Applicants must demonstrate ability to manage and account for Federal funds. NMFS has chosen the PSMFC as the administrative intermediary for the data jobs program in the three affected states. The PSMFC is an interstate fisheries commission established by Federal statute in 1947. It is a federally authorized forum, wherein its member states (California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Alaska) can legally enter into agreements and programs extending beyond state boundaries. The PSMFC is run by 15 Commissioners (three per member state), who include the state fishery agency director, a state legislator, and an appointee by the Governor from each state. The goal of the PSMFC is ``to promote the conservation, development and management of Pacific coast fishery resources through coordinated regional research, monitoring, and utilization.'' The Commissioners have set as one of the objectives of the PSMFC the facilitation of research and management projects relating to interstate fisheries. To achieve this objective, they have directed the PSMFC staff to provide administrative, fiscal, and field coordination and support for interstate and state/Federal research, data collection and management projects. NMFS proposes the PSMFC as the administrative intermediary because PSMFC goals, objectives, and organizational structure coincide largely with the implementation needs of this program. The PSMFC has a good track record of project administration, and experience with project coordination with the three states and the tribes. Because of its proven fiscal ability and low overhead, PSMFC regularly serves as a primary contractor on grants, projects, and contracts for states and other organizations. The PSMFC is in an ideal position to implement the Data Collection Jobs Program, because it already has knowledge of state, Federal, tribal and industry research priorities (recreational and commercial) as coastwide data collection efforts and research are at the very core of the PSMFC's objectives. Additionally, the PSMFC is well respected by fishermen because of its capabilities in reaching consensus and coordinating efforts between the states. As a coordinator of the individual state catch statistics systems, which include salmon landings by individual commercial fishing vessels, PSMFC should be able to verify much of the information that fishermen will need to provide to PSMFC showing that they meet the eligibility criteria. The short-term benefits of this program would be to provide compensation to fishermen for uninsured lost income due to the closed or restricted salmon seasons. The long-term advantages would be to improve collection of information important to sustaining salmon stocks. An additional benefit is that it could foster a better understanding between fishermen, scientists, and fishery managers. The timing of the actual employment of fishermen will depend on the planning and proposal selection process, as well as the best seasons in which to undertake research. IV. Eligibility Criteria For purposes of the proposed habitat restoration and data collection programs under NEAP, job applicants must meet all of the following eligibility criteria to receive assistance: 1. The applicant must show an uninsured loss. 2. In the base year used by the applicant in determining loss, the applicant must have earned at least 50 percent of gross income from the commercial fishery. 3. The applicant must have earned commercial fishery income in either 1992 or 1993. 4. The applicant's 1992 or 1993 commercial fishery income, whichever is greater, must have declined by at least 50 percent from the applicant's commercial fishery income from the base year selected. 5. If single, the applicant's 1993 gross income must have been less than $25,000. If married, the applicant's 1993 gross combined income of the applicant and his/her spouse must have been less than $50,000. No person may receive financial assistance under NEAP that exceeds 75 percent of any uninsured and otherwise uncompensated commercial fishery loss resulting from the fishery resource disaster, and no person may receive more than $100,000 in the aggregate for all losses resulting from the disaster. The intent of these criteria is to provide the available assistance to those commercial fishermen who have been most heavily dependent on salmon fishing and who have suffered the greatest losses. In order to comply with the requirements of the IFA, an uninsured loss must be shown. The second criterion is intended to determine those applicants that have been dependent on the commercial fishery for most of their livelihood. The third criterion is intended to limit eligibility to those who commercially fished during the disaster period. The final two criteria are intended to focus the available financial assistance on those commercial fishermen who have suffered the greatest losses due to the disaster and who do not have significant income from other sources.
