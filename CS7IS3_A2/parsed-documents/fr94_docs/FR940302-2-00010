SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On November 18, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the Federal Register (58 FR 60843) the preliminary results of the third administrative review of the antidumping duty order on mechanical transfer presses (MTPs) from Japan (55 FR 5642, February 16, 1990). The Department has now completed the review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act). Scope of the Review Imports covered by the review include MTPs currently classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item numbers 8462.99.0035 and 8466.94.5040. The HTS numbers are provided for convenience and for U.S. Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. The term ``mechanical transfer presses'' refers to automatic metal-forming machine tools with multiple die stations in which the workpiece is moved from station to station by a transfer mechanism designed as an integral part of the press and synchronized with the press action, whether imported as machines or parts suitable for use solely or principally with these machines. These presses may be imported assembled or unassembled. This review covers four manufacturer/exporters of MTPs from Japan entered into the United States during the period February 1, 1992, through January 31, 1993. This review does not cover spare and replacement parts and accessories, which were determined to be outside the scope of the order. See ``Final Scope Ruling on Spare and Replacement Parts,'' U.S. Department of Commerce, March 20, 1992. On November 23, 1993, the Department determined that Aida's FMX series cold forging press is within the scope of the order. See ``Final Scope Ruling_Antidumping Duty Order on Mechanical Transfer Presses from Japan: Aida Engineering, Ltd.,'' U.S. Department of Commerce, November 23, 1993. We have included the FMX press in our analysis for these final results. Analysis of Comments Received We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results of review, as provided by 19 CFR 353.38. We received comments from the petitioner, Verson Division of Allied Products Corp., and two respondents, Aida Engineering, Ltd. (Aida), and Komatsu Ltd. (Komatsu).
