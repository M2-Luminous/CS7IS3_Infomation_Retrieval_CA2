When I refer to the end of communism, I feel obligated to warn against often oversimplified views and interpretations, and against incorrect and misleading expectations which are -- paradoxically -- two completely different trends. Communism was an immense human tragedy but I can agree neither to its demonizing on the one hand nor to its trivializing on the other hand. The demonization of communism implicitly suggests that communism was a unique, unrepeatable event that somehow befell its innocent victims, without any fault on their part, without their silent approval, or their active cooperation. That is not true. Communism was "only" a more extreme form of etatism, human constructivism, and political and social engineering; a world where somebody knows better than the others what is best for all of us, where one and only one interpretation of freedom, right, social equality, or economic rationality is considered obligatory. Communism also is a world of extreme bureaucracy, far too many directives and bans, human oppression and human degradation, a world of powerlessness of the citizens against the omnipotent state. I dare to argue that a milder form of all these symptoms exists also in the standard Western societies. In the course of history, the development of these symptoms had its ascents and returns, and it also had its dangerous internal dynamics, thanks to which a point was unexpectedly reached when the entire society slid into an unforeseen and unintended state of affairs. Therefore, I believe it is extremely important also for the Western countries to know the maximum about our experience and study it very carefully. I dare say that the Czech Republic is undergoing the fastest and most successful systemic changes in the entire postcommunist world. We have already formed a standard system of ideologically well-defined political parties. We have been successful in reaching and maintaining the basic political and social accord with respect to goals, strategy, and running results of the transformation. We have introduced a market economy based on a massive and unprecedented privatization, deregulation, and liberalization, as well as on a high degree of macroeconomic stability. We have accepted in our country an open view of society, which is based on the trust in human action rather than human design, if we are to use the very helpful terminology of Friedrich von Hayek. Nevertheless, during the transition period, it is necessary to assign even the state a considerable constructive role. The reformers must abolish the old institutions, and the ensuing institutional vacuum must be quickly filled with an alternative coordination mechanism. Otherwise, the new system would not work. The faster, broader, and deeper this transformation runs, the lower is the economic and social cost, and the more successful is the entire systemic change. I disagree with the opinion that the world has entered the stage occasionally referred to as the end of history or the end of ideology. Neither is, and never will be, true. As long as people are people, there will be ideological conflicts. The conflict between communism and free society dominated the world in the past decades, and the current conflicts are not any less significant. We are -- after decades of life under communism -- somewhat oversensitive in this respect, and consider it our duty to warn against these invisible, or insufficiently conspicuous potential dangers. The present world also bears witness to another fundamental conflict. It is again becoming a question whether to trust unlimited teamwork and cooperation of free citizens or rather delegate power to the hands of benevolent politicians and administrators; whether we are convinced of the superiority of the "free market" system, or prefer the "just" market (which means protectionism); whether we are satisfied with monitoring the quality of production of our industry, or whether we want to control production technology and processes; whether we advocate the free market, or a state industrial policy; whether we favor the free choice based on our own preferences and interests, or whether we accept aprioristic externally formulated norms and criteria. This idea is based on the ethically peculiar and rationally unsustainable argument that different labor costs from firm to firm or country to country cause a "distortion of competition" and that such a lapse must be remedied by enlightened supranational regulation. Calls for quasi-universal social rights are a disguised attempt at protecting high-cost producers in the countries with a high degree of regulation and with unsustainable welfare standards from cheaper labor in less productive countries. The disparity that arose between the North and East (or South) is not a result of the difference in regulation or social legislation but directly reflects the difference in the productivity of labor. Postcommunist and developing countries cannot raise wages above their productivity and no international conference can increase their productivity. Their unemployment rate and general poverty can increase, however, if these external criteria and standards are imposed upon them. The conflict of ideas prevails, and we must discuss it. I hope that the fundamental liberal demand for freedom of speech will never be replaced by the non-liberal slogan about the "correctness of phrases," with this correctness defined, perhaps with good intentions, by the advocates of this or that truth.
