In an interview with the ASSOCIATED PRESS OF PAKISTAN in Islamabad today, he refuted the Indian claim that the resolution has been withdrawn. The resolution was presented, but no voting was held on it. However, it is still there as a document. Regarding the visit of Muslim ambassadors, he said Pakistan had a clear commitment from the Indian Government in which a visit by Muslim ambassadors to Kashmir was agreed upon as a part of the understanding for not proceeding with a vote on the resolution. Therefore, the Indian claim is incorrect in every respect. Shaharyar Khan said that one of the two main objectives envisaged by Pakistan by presenting the resolution at an UN agency was to stop the oppression and violence against the people of Kashmir and violation of their human rights. The other was to draw the world attention to the Kashmir issue for the first time in 30 years. The foreign secretary said that it is already clear that India is adopting a more transparent method in dealing with the Kashmir situation as a result of the international pressure. The group of International Committee for Red Cross, Amnesty International, and the ambassadors based in Delhi has been invited to visit Kashmir, and now the world community will strongly react to Indian Government's atrocities and violence against the Kashmiri people. Moreover, the world public opinion is now focused on India and the foreign office of every country considers the treatment of the Kashmiri people as an important issue of the international agenda.
