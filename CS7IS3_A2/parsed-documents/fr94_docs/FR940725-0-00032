FR940725-0-00032 FR940725-0-00007 Example 2. (i) S is an accrual basis QBU that is required to use the dollar as its functional currency for its first taxable year beginning in 1994. S's hyperinflationary currency is the ``h.'' During 1994, S's sales amounted to 240,000,000h, its currently deductible expenses were 26,000,000h, and its total inventory purchases amounted to 100,000,000h. During January and February of 1994, S purchased depreciable assets for 80,000,000h and was allowed depreciation of 4,000,000h. At the end of 1994, S's closing inventory was 23,000,000h. No election to use a translation period other than the month is made, S had no transactions described in paragraph (c)(8) or (c)(9) of this section, and S's closing inventory was computed on the first-in, first-out inventory method. S's adjusted income or loss statement for 1994 is translated into dollars as follows: ␣ 1␣ 1Hyperinflationary currency 1Exchange rate 1United States dollars Sales (Jan.&hyph;Feb.) 10,000,000h 120:1 $500,000 (Mar.&hyph;Apr.) 20,000,000␣ 21:1 952,381 (May.&hyph;June.) 50,000,000␣ 22:1 2,272,727 (July) 50,000,000␣ 23:1 2,173,913 (August) 20,000,000␣ 26:1 769,231 (Sept.) 20,000,000␣ 28:1 714,286 (Oct.) 20,000,000␣ 29:1 689,655 (Nov.) 20,000,000␣ 30:1 666,667 (Dec.) 30,000,000␣ 31:1 967,742 n,s,n,s Total 240,000,000h 9,706,602 Cost of Goods Sold Opening Inventory Purchases: 0 0 (Jan.&hyph;Feb.) 15,000,000h 20:1 ␣750,000 (Mar.&hyph;Apr.) 10,000,000␣ 21:1 476,190 (May&hyph;June) 30,000,000␣ 22:1 1,363,636 (July) 20,000,000␣ 23:1 869,565 (August) 10,000,000␣ 26:1 384,615 (Sept.) 5,000,000␣ 28:1 178,571 (Oct.) 5,000,000␣ 29:1 172,414 (Nov.) 2,500,000␣ 30:1 83,333 (Dec.) 2,500,000␣ 31:1 80,645 Less Closing Inventory (23,000,000) (2) (822,655) n,s,n,s ␣ 77,000,000h 3,536,314 1Where multiple months are indicated, the exchange rate applies for all months. 2See paragraph (ii) of this Example.

DASTM gain or loss of a QBU equals_ (i) The net worth of the QBU (as determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section) at the end of the taxable year minus the net worth of the QBU at the end of the preceding taxable year; plus (ii) The dollar amount of the items described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section and minus the dollar amount of the items described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section; minus (iii) The amount of dollar income or earnings and profits (or plus the amount of any dollar loss or deficit in earnings and profits) as determined for the taxable year pursuant to paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section. (2) Net worth. Net worth of a QBU at the end of any taxable year equals the aggregate dollar amount representing assets on the QBU's balance sheet at the end of the taxable year less the aggregate dollar amount representing liabilities on the balance sheet. Notwithstanding any other provision in this paragraph (d)(2), the district director may adjust the amount of any asset or liability if a purpose for acquiring (or disposing of) the asset or incurring (or discharging) the liability is to manipulate the composition of the balance sheet for any period during the taxable year in order to avoid tax. The taxpayer shall determine net worth by_ (i) Preparing a balance sheet as of the end of the taxable year from the QBU's books and records (within the meaning of §1.989(a)&hyph;1(d)) as recorded in the QBU's hyperinflationary currency; (ii) Making adjustments necessary to conform such balance sheet to United States generally accepted accounting principles and tax accounting principles (including reversing monetary correction adjustments required by local accounting principles); and
